In fiscal year 2017, following significant changes in our senior leadership and a comprehensive review of our operations and performance, we began to execute against a new business strategy that includes, among other things, the designation of six brands - Nickelodeon, Nick Jr., MTV, BET, Comedy Central and Paramount - as our highest priority, flagship brands. We operate through two reportable segments: Media Networks and Filmed Entertainment . Our measure of segment performance is adjusted operating income. We define adjusted operating income for our segments as operating income, before equity-based compensation and certain other items identified as affecting comparability, when applicable. Equity-based compensation is excluded from our segment measure of performance since it is set and approved by the Compensation Committee of Viacom Board of Directors in consultation with corporate executive management, and is included as a component of consolidated adjusted operating income. Media Networks Our Media Networks segment provides entertainment content, services and related branded products for consumers in targeted demographics attractive to advertisers, content distributors and retailers. We create, acquire and distribute programming and other content for our audiences worldwide, distributed through cable, satellite and broadband services, on linear, streaming and on-demand bases, via a variety of owned and third party platforms, including televisions, branded apps and sites, for viewing on a wide range of devices such as connected televisions, PCs, tablets, smartphones and other connected devices. The Media Networks segment also licenses its brands for consumer products and recreational opportunities, and produces live events. 32 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) Our Media Networks segment operates globally as Viacom Media Networks through three brand groups, our Global Entertainment Group, the Nickelodeon Group and BET Networks. Globally, our program services reach approximately 4.3 billion cumulative television subscribers in 183 countries and 43 languages, via 300 locally programmed and operated television channels, including Nickelodeon, Nick Jr., MTV, BET, Comedy Central, SPIKE (which will be rebranded as Paramount Network in the United States in January 2018), VH1, TV Land, CMT, Logo and our program services created specifically for international audiences, such as British public service broadcaster Channel 5 (in the United Kingdom), Telefe (in Argentina), Colors (in India) and Paramount Channel (in a variety of territories). Cumulative television subscribers aggregate total subscribers to each Viacom owned and operated, joint venture and licensee channel. Our Media Networks segment generates revenues in three categories: (i) the sale of advertising and marketing services, (ii) affiliate fees from distributors of our programming and program services and (iii) ancillary activities such as consumer products. Advertising Revenues Our Media Networks segment generates revenues from the sale of advertising and from marketing services. Our advertising revenues generally depend on the number of viewers and viewership demographics. Demand and pricing for our advertising depend on the attractiveness of our offerings to advertisers, viewership, and overall market conditions. We also drive additional demand through integrated sales of multi-platform advertising and marketing opportunities and through our integrated marketing services, providing unique branded entertainment and custom sponsorship opportunities to our advertisers. Our advertising revenues may be affected by the strength of advertising markets and general economic conditions, and may fluctuate depending on the success of our programming, as measured by viewership, at any given time. Measured viewership may vary due to the success of our programming (due to, among other things, the timing of availability of new episodes of popular programming and the performance of competing programs and other entertainment alternatives for viewers), the platforms on which our programming is available, as well as variations related to the methods used by third parties to measure viewership. Advertising revenues may also fluctuate due to seasonal variations, the timing of holidays and significant programming events such as awards shows and premieres. Typically, advertising revenues are highest in the first quarter of our fiscal year. We continue to invest in proprietary data platforms and advanced analytics that enable our customers to better target and measure the impact of their advertising, including our Viacom Vantage platform and the OpenAP consortium we created with Fox Networks Group and Turner. Additionally, we have a branded content agency, Viacom Velocity, that integrates clients brands into custom content across our platforms. We are also working with distributors of our programming to evolve our multi-platform advertising offerings to include targeting and customization through Vantage, Velocity and OpenAP. Affiliate Revenues Our affiliate revenues are generated through fees from distributors of our programming and program services, such as cable television operators, direct-to-home satellite television operators, mobile networks and subscription video-on-demand and other over-the-top ( OTT ) services. Our agreements with multichannel television service providers are generally multi-year carriage agreements with set rate increases. The amount of fees we receive is generally a function of the number of subscribers and the rates we receive per subscriber. Expirations of these affiliate agreements are staggered. We are also working with these distributors to create new and improved pay television revenue opportunities. Under subscription video-on-demand and other similar OTT agreements, we make certain programs available for distribution on one or more dates, and our revenue under these OTT agreements is recognized upon the availability of the programs licensed; therefore, revenue will fluctuate depending on the timing of when programming is made available throughout the license period. Ancillary Revenues Our Media Networks ancillary revenues are principally derived from (i) our consumer products activities, which include licensing our brands and intellectual property, as well as creation and publishing of interactive games across various platforms (including mobile, PC and console), (ii) recreational experiences and live events, (iii) viewing of our programming through electronic sell-through and download-to-rent services and the sale of DVDs and Blu-Ray discs and (iv) television syndication of our content. Our ancillary revenues vary based on consumer spending, the popularity of our programming, the volume of content available during a particular period and acceptance of our and our partners products. Media Networks segment expenses consist of operating expenses, selling, general and administrative ( SG&A ) expenses and depreciation and amortization. Operating expenses are comprised of costs related to original and acquired programming, including programming amortization, expenses associated with the distribution of home entertainment products and consumer products licensing, participations and residuals, royalties, integrated marketing expenses and other costs of sales. SG&A expenses consist primarily of employee compensation, marketing, research and professional service fees and facility and occupancy costs. Depreciation and 33 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) amortization expenses reflect depreciation of fixed assets, including transponders financed under capital leases, and amortization of finite-lived intangible assets. Filmed Entertainment Our Filmed Entertainment segment develops, produces, finances, acquires and distributes motion pictures, television programming and other entertainment content under the Paramount Pictures, Paramount Players, Paramount Animation and Paramount Television divisions, in various markets and media worldwide, for itself and for third parties. It partners on various projects with key Viacom franchises, including Nickelodeon Movies and MTV Films. Motion pictures produced, acquired and/or distributed by the Filmed Entertainment segment are generally first exhibited theatrically in domestic and/or international markets and then released in various markets through electronic sell-through, DVDs and Blu-ray discs, transactional video-on-demand, subscription video-on-demand, pay television, cable television and free television, free video-on-demand and by airlines and hotels. Paramount Television draws on Paramount extensive library of film properties and develops original programming for television and digital platforms. Producing, marketing and distributing motion pictures and television programming can involve significant costs. The timing of a motion picture release can also cause our financial results to vary. For example, marketing costs are generally incurred before and throughout the theatrical release of a film and, to a lesser extent, other distribution windows, and are expensed as incurred. As a result, we typically incur losses with respect to a particular film prior to and during the film theatrical exhibition, and recoupment of investment as well as profitability for the film may not be realized until well after its theatrical release. Therefore, the results of the Filmed Entertainment segment can be volatile as films work their way through the various distribution windows. Our Filmed Entertainment segment generates revenues in four categories: (i) the release and/or distribution of motion pictures theatrically, (ii) the release and/or distribution of film and television product through home entertainment, (iii) the licensing of film and television product to television and digital platforms and (iv) other ancillary activities. Theatrical Revenues Paramount generates revenues worldwide from the theatrical release and/or distribution of motion pictures, primarily from audience ticket sales. Each motion picture is a separate and distinct product with its revenues, and ultimate profitability, dependent upon many factors, among which audience response, domestically and internationally, is of fundamental importance. Theatrical revenues may also be affected by the number, timing and mix of releases and competitive offerings in any given period, consumer tastes and consumption habits, and overall economic conditions, including trends in discretionary spending. The theatrical success of a motion picture is a significant factor in determining the revenues it is likely to generate in home entertainment markets and licensing arrangements for television and other platforms. Revenues from motion picture theatrical releases tend to be cyclical with increases around the holidays that fall during the first quarter of our fiscal year, and in the summer months during our fourth quarter. Home Entertainment Revenues Home entertainment revenues are derived from the worldwide sales and distribution of DVDs and Blu-ray discs relating to the motion pictures released theatrically by Paramount and programming of other Viacom brands such as Nickelodeon, MTV, Comedy Central and BET, as well as certain acquired films and content distributed on behalf of third parties such as CBS Corporation ( CBS ). Home entertainment revenues are also derived from the viewing of our films on a transactional basis through transactional video-on-demand and electronic sell-through services around the world, for a fee and/or on a revenue sharing basis. Our home entertainment revenues may be affected by the number, timing and mix of releases and competitive offerings in any given period, consumer tastes and consumption habits, the prominence given by distributors and retailers to our releases compared to those of our competitors, and overall economic conditions, including trends in discretionary spending. Licensing Revenues Paramount generates fees by licensing, around the world on a territory by territory basis, films and television programs produced, acquired or distributed by Paramount, for a fee or on a revenue sharing basis, to subscription video-on-demand, pay and basic cable television, free television and free video-on-demand services. Revenue from the licensing of film and television exhibition rights is recognized upon availability for airing by the licensee and will fluctuate depending on the number and mix of available titles in any given territory. 34 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) Ancillary Revenues Paramount generates ancillary revenues by providing production and facilities services to third parties, primarily at Paramount studio lot. Paramount also generates ancillary revenues by licensing its brands for consumer products, themed restaurants, hotels and resorts, live stage plays, film clips and theme parks and other location-based entertainment projects. Filmed Entertainment segment expenses consist of operating expenses, SG&A expenses and depreciation and amortization. Operating expenses principally include the amortization of costs of our released feature films and television programming (including participations and residuals), print and advertising expenses and other distribution costs. SG&A expenses include employee compensation, facility and occupancy costs, professional service fees and other overhead costs. Depreciation and amortization expense principally consists of depreciation of fixed assets. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Our summary consolidated results of operations are presented below for the years ended September 30, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 . 2017 vs. 2016 2016 vs. 2015 Year Ended September 30, Better/(Worse) Better/(Worse) (in millions, except per share amounts) 2017 2016 2015 $ % $ % GAAP Revenues $ 13,263 $ 12,488 $ 13,268 $ 775 6 % $ (780 ) (6 )% Operating income 2,489 2,526 3,112 (37 ) (1 ) (586 ) (19 ) Net earnings from continuing operations attributable to Viacom 1,871 1,436 1,922 435 30 (486 ) (25 ) Diluted EPS from continuing operations 4.67 3.61 4.73 1.06 29 (1.12 ) (24 ) Non-GAAP* Adjusted operating income $ 2,743 $ 2,732 $ 3,920 $ 11 $ (1,188 ) (30 )% Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations attributable to Viacom 1,511 1,465 2,210 46 3 (745 ) (34 ) Adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations 3.77 3.68 5.44 0.09 2 (1.76 ) (32 ) * See Factors Affecting Comparability section below for a reconciliation of our reported results to our adjusted results, which are calculated on a non-GAAP basis. Factors Affecting Comparability The Consolidated Financial Statements reflect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows reported in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ). Our results have been affected by certain items identified as affecting comparability. Accordingly, when applicable, we use non-GAAP measures such as consolidated adjusted operating income, adjusted earnings from continuing operations before provision for income taxes, adjusted provision for income taxes, adjusted net earnings from continuing operations attributable to Viacom and adjusted diluted earnings per share ( EPS ) from continuing operations, among other measures, to evaluate our actual operating performance and for planning and forecasting of future periods. We believe that the adjusted results provide relevant and useful information for investors because they clarify our actual operating performance, make it easier to compare our results with those of other companies and allow investors to review performance in the same way as our management. Since these are not measures of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP, they should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, operating income, earnings from continuing operations before provision for income taxes, provision for income taxes, net earnings from continuing operations attributable to Viacom and diluted EPS from continuing operations as indicators of operating performance and they may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. The following tables reconcile our reported results (GAAP) to our adjusted results (non-GAAP) for the years ended September 30, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 . The tax impacts included in the tables below have been calculated using the rates applicable to the adjustments presented. 35 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) 2017 Year Ended September 30, 2017 (in millions, except per share amounts) Operating Income Earnings from Continuing Operations Before Provision for Income Taxes Provision for Income Taxes Net Earnings from Continuing Operations Attributable to Viacom Diluted EPS from Continuing Operations Reported results (GAAP) $ 2,489 $ 2,212 $ 293 $ 1,871 $ 4.67 Factors Affecting Comparability: Restructuring and programming charges 381 381 135 246 0.61 Gain on asset sales (127 ) (412 ) (116 ) (285 ) (0.71 ) Loss on extinguishment of debt 20 7 13 0.03 Investment impairment 10 4 6 0.01 Discrete tax benefit 340 (340 ) (0.84 ) Adjusted results (Non-GAAP) $ 2,743 $ 2,211 $ 663 $ 1,511 $ 3.77 Restructuring and programming charges : We recognized a pre-tax charge of $381 million , reflecting $237 million of restructuring charges and $144 million of programming charges resulting from the execution of our flagship brand strategy and strategic initiatives at Paramount. See Note 14 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. As we continue to evaluate our strategic initiatives, we may incur additional restructuring and other charges in fiscal 2018. Gain on asset sales : In 2017, a consolidated entity completed the sale of broadcast spectrum in connection with the FCC broadcast spectrum auction. The sale resulted in a pre-tax gain of $ 127 million recorded within Operating income , with $11 million attributable to the noncontrolling interest.

Loss on extinguishment of debt : We redeemed senior notes and debentures totaling $3.3 billion in 2017, resulting in the recognition of a net pre-tax extinguishment loss of $20 million within Other Items, net in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. Investment impairment : We recognized a $10 million impairment loss included within Other items, net in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings in connection with the write-down of a cost method investment in 2017.

See Note 14 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 36 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) Discrete tax benefit : The net discrete tax benefit was principally related to a tax accounting method change granted by the Internal Revenue Service, the release of tax reserves with respect to certain effectively settled tax positions and the recognition of capital loss carryforwards, partially offset by a reduction in qualified production activity tax benefits as a result of retroactively reenacted legislation. 2015 Year Ended September 30, 2015 (in millions, except per share amounts) Operating Income Earnings from Continuing Operations Before Provision for Income Taxes Provision for Income Taxes Net Earnings from Continuing Operations Attributable to Viacom Diluted EPS from Continuing Operations Reported results (GAAP) $ 3,112 $ 2,503 $ 501 $ 1,922 $ 4.73 Factors Affecting Comparability: Restructuring and programming charges 784 784 264 520 1.28 Loss on pension settlement 24 24 9 15 0.04 Loss on extinguishment of debt 18 7 11 0.03 Discrete tax benefit 258 (258 ) (0.64 ) Adjusted results (Non-GAAP) $ 3,920 $ 3,329 $ 1,039 $ 2,210 $ 5.44 Restructuring and programming charges : We recognized a pre-tax charge of $784 million, reflecting $578 million of programming charges and a $206 million restructuring charge associated with workforce reductions. See Note 14 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Loss on pension settlement : The pre-tax non-cash charge of $24 million was driven by the settlement of pension benefits of certain participants of our funded pension plan. Loss on extinguishment of debt : In September 2015, we redeemed $550 million of the total $918 million outstanding of our 6.250% Senior Notes due April 2016, at a redemption price equal to the sum of the principal amount and a make-whole amount, together totaling $568 million, and accrued interest of $14 million. As a result of the redemption, we recognized a pre-tax extinguishment loss of $18 million within Other Items, net in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. Discrete tax benefit : During 2015, we reorganized certain non-U.S. subsidiaries in order to facilitate a more efficient movement of non-U.S. cash and to support the expansion of key areas for growth internationally. The net discrete tax benefit was principally related to excess foreign tax credits attributable to a taxable repatriation of non-U.S. earnings from reorganized entities and the release of tax reserves with respect to certain effectively settled tax positions. YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2017 vs. 2016 Consolidated Results of Operations Revenues Worldwide revenues increased $775 million , or 6% , to $13.263 billion in the year ended September 30, 2017 .

Media Networks adjusted operating income decreased $187 million , or 5% , to $3.297 billion , as higher revenues were more than offset by increased expenses. Income Taxes Our effective income tax rate was 13.2% in the year ended September 30, 2017 . The net discrete tax benefit of $340 million , taken together with the discrete tax impact of the other factors affecting comparability, reduced the effective income tax rate by 16.8 percentage points. Excluding the impact of discrete tax items, our adjusted effective income tax rate was 30.0% in 2017 , a decline of 1.7 percentage points from the prior year, primarily driven by the change in the mix of domestic and international income.

International revenues increased $224 million , or 12% , to $2.127 billion . Excluding a 5-percentage point unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, international revenues increased 17%, primarily driven by an 11-percentage point favorable impact from the Telefe acquisition. Advertising Worldwide advertising revenues increased $53 million , or 1% , to $4.862 billion in the year ended September 30, 2017 . Foreign exchange had a 2-percentage point unfavorable impact on worldwide advertising revenues. Worldwide advertising revenues include a 4-percentage point favorable impact from the acquisition of Telefe. Domestic advertising revenues decreased $85 million , or 2% , to $3.753 billion , reflecting higher pricing, more than offset by lower impressions. International advertising revenues increased $138 million , or 14% , to $1.109 billion . Excluding an 8-percentage point unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, international advertising revenues increased 22%, primarily driven by an 18-percentage point favorable impact from the Telefe acquisition, as well as growth in Europe. Affiliate Worldwide affiliate revenues increased $82 million , or 2% , to $4.638 billion in the year ended September 30, 2017 . Domestic affiliate revenues increased $39 million , or 1% , to $3.920 billion , principally reflecting rate increases and higher revenues from subscription video-on-demand and other OTT agreements, partially offset by a decline in subscribers. We expect domestic affiliate revenues to decline at a high single-digit rate in the first and second quarters of fiscal 2018 due to the impact of subscriber declines, renewal rate resets with certain distributors and lower subscription video-on-demand revenues, with improvement in the second half of the year resulting in a mid-single-digit rate decline for fiscal 2018. International affiliate revenues increased $43 million , or 6% , to $718 million . Excluding a 3-percentage point unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, international affiliate revenues increased 9%, driven by the impact of rate increases, subscriber growth, new channel launches and subscription video-on-demand and other OTT agreements, as well as a 2-percentage point favorable impact from the Telefe acquisition.

Worldwide ancillary revenues include a 2-percentage point favorable impact from the acquisition of Telefe. Domestic ancillary revenues decreased $24 million , or 8% , to $296 million , principally driven by lower consumer product revenue. International ancillary revenues increased $43 million , or 17% , to $300 million , principally driven by higher consumer product revenue and the acquisition of Telefe, which had a 6-percentage point favorable impact on international ancillary revenues. Expenses Media Networks segment expenses increased $341 million , or 5% , to $6.799 billion in the year ended September 30, 2017 .

Excluding the impact from the timing of product available under subscription video-on-demand and other OTT arrangements, domestic affiliate revenues declined in the low-single digits, due to a modest decline in subscribers and the impact of rate equalization due to the consolidation of certain distributor agreements, partially offset by rate increases across the remaining subscriber base. International revenues increased 3% . Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, which had a 7-percentage point unfavorable impact, international affiliate revenues increased 10%, driven by new channel launches, increased subscribers, rate increases and the completion of certain subscription video-on-demand and other OTT arrangements.

Selling, General and Administrative SG&A expenses decreased $50 million , or 14% , to $319 million in the year ended September 30, 2016 , principally driven by lower employee costs, including 8-percentage points of benefit from our 2015 restructuring, and other discretionary cost decreases. Adjusted Operating Income/(Loss) Adjusted operating loss was $445 million in the year ended September 30, 2016 , compared with adjusted operating income of $111 million in 2015 . The decline in results reflects the underperformance of 2016 films, such as Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows and Zoolander 2 , as well as the impairment charge discussed above. 44 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Liquidity Sources and Uses of Cash Our primary source of liquidity is cash provided through the operations of our businesses. We have access to external financing sources such as our $2.5 billion five-year revolving credit facility and the capital markets. Our principal uses of cash from operations include the creation of new programming and film content, acquisitions of third-party content, and interest and income tax payments. We also use cash for the repayment of debt, quarterly cash dividends, capital expenditures and acquisitions of businesses, as well as discretionary share repurchases under our stock repurchase program, as deemed appropriate. The Media Networks segment consistently generates a significant percentage of our cash flow from operating activities. Advertising is generally purchased by large media buying agencies and our affiliate revenues are earned from cable and direct-to-home satellite television operators and other distributors. The Filmed Entertainment segment operational results and ability to generate cash flow from operations substantially depend on the number and timing of films and television series in development and production, the level and timing of print and advertising costs, and the public response to our theatrical film and home entertainment releases. In general, our segments require relatively low levels of capital expenditures in relation to our annual cash flow from operations. This contributes to our ability to generate cash flow for future investment in our content and business operations, which we expect to be able to maintain over time. We use commercial paper borrowings, backstopped by our credit facility, and the credit facility to fund short-term domestic liquidity needs principally driven by the timing of our domestic operating cash flows. Our cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.389 billion as of September 30, 2017 , of which $1.135 billion was held by our foreign subsidiaries and is substantially all deemed indefinitely reinvested in our foreign operations. While we currently do not intend or foresee a need for repatriating funds held in our foreign subsidiaries, should we require additional capital in the U.S., we could elect to repatriate these funds or access external financing. Repatriating funds could result in a higher effective tax rate and cash taxes paid. We believe that our cash flows from operating activities together with our credit facility provide us with adequate resources to fund our anticipated ongoing cash requirements. We anticipate that future debt maturities will be funded with cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operating activities and future access to capital markets, including our credit facility. We may continue to access external financing from time to time depending on our cash requirements, assessments of current and anticipated market conditions and after-tax cost of capital. Our access to capital markets can be impacted by factors outside our control, including economic conditions; however, we believe that our strong cash flows and balance sheet, our credit facility and our credit rating will provide us with adequate access to funding given our expected cash needs. Any new borrowing cost would be affected by market conditions and short and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to access capital markets on terms and conditions that will be favorable to us. Cash Flows The following tables include information driving the change in cash and cash equivalents and a reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities (GAAP) to free cash flow and operating free cash flow (non-GAAP) for each of the years ended September 30, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 . We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures, plus excess tax benefits from equity-based compensation awards (actual tax deductions in excess of amounts previously recognized, which is included within financing activities in the statement of cash flows), as applicable. We define operating free cash flow as free cash flow, excluding the impact of the cash premium on the extinguishment of debt, as applicable. Free cash flow and operating free cash flow are non-GAAP measures. Management believes the use of these measures provides investors with an important perspective on, in the case of free cash flow, our liquidity, including our ability to service debt and make investments in our businesses, and, in the case of operating free cash flow, our liquidity from ongoing activities. 45 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) Change in cash and cash equivalents (in millions) Year Ended September 30, Better/(Worse) $ 2017 2016 2015 2017 vs. 2016 2016 vs. 2015 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,671 $ 1,371 $ 2,313 $ 300 $ (942 ) Net cash provided by/(used in) investing activities 329 (299 ) (257 ) 628 (42 ) Net cash used in financing activities (1,010 ) (1,173 ) (2,477 ) 163 1,304 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 20 (26 ) (73 ) 46 47 Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ 1,010 $ (127 ) $ (494 ) $ 1,137 $ 367 Reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow and operating free cash flow Net cash provided by operating activities (GAAP) $ 1,671 $ 1,371 $ 2,313 $ 300 $ (942 ) Capital expenditures (195 ) (172 ) (142 ) (23 ) (30 ) Excess tax benefits 1 43 1 (43 ) Free cash flow (Non-GAAP) 1,477 1,199 2,214 278 (1,015 ) Debt retirement premium 33 18 33 (18 ) Operating free cash flow (Non-GAAP) $ 1,510 $ 1,199 $ 2,232 $ 311 $ (1,033 ) Operating Activities Cash provided by operating activities was $1.671 billion in 2017 , an increase of $300 million compared with 2016 , primarily reflecting lower film production spend, partially offset by other unfavorable working capital requirements, including higher income tax payments. See Note 17 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding income tax payments. Cash provided by operating activities was $1.371 billion in 2016 , a decrease of $942 million compared with 2015 , reflecting the impact from lower net earnings, higher film and television production spending and unfavorable working capital requirements. Investing Activities Cash provided by investing activities was $329 million in 2017 , principally reflecting net proceeds of $593 million from the sale of our investment in EPIX, $147 million from the sale of certain broadcast spectrum and $108 million from the sale of marketable securities, partially offset by the acquisition of Telefe for $336 million, net of cash acquired, and capital expenditures. Cash used in investing activities was $299 million in 2016 , principally reflecting capital expenditures and contributions made into grantor trusts in connection with the separation of certain senior executives. See Note 14 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Cash used in investing activities was $257 million in 2015 , principally reflecting capital expenditures and our investment in Prism TV Private Limited. Financing Activities Cash used in financing activities was $1.010 billion in 2017 , principally reflecting net payments of $783 million from debt transactions and dividend payments of $319 million , partially offset by stock option exercise proceeds of $172 million . Cash used in financing activities was $1.173 billion in 2016 , primarily driven by dividend payments of $635 million , debt repayments of $368 million and the settlement of share repurchases totaling $100 million . Cash used in financing activities was $2.477 billion in 2015 , driven by the settlement of share repurchases totaling $1.548 billion , dividend payments of $564 million and net payments of $410 million from debt transactions. 46 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) Capital Resources Capital Structure and Debt Our debt outstanding as of September 30, 2017 and 2016 is as follows: Debt (in millions) September 30, 2017 2016 Notes and debentures $ 11,065 $ 11,793 Capital leases and other obligations 54 120 Total debt $ 11,119 $ 11,913 Notes and Debentures In 2017, we issued $2.6 billion of junior debentures and senior notes and redeemed $3.331 billion of senior notes and debentures. Our issuances of debt were comprised of: $650 million in aggregate principal amount of fixed-to-floating rate junior subordinated debentures due 2057 at par, callable in 5 years (the 5-year Hybrid debentures ) $650 million in aggregate principal amount of fixed-to-floating rate junior subordinated debentures due 2057 at par, callable in 10 years (the 10-year Hybrid debentures and, together with the 5-year Hybrid debentures, the Hybrid Debentures ) $400 million in aggregate principal amount of 2.250% senior notes due 2022 at a price equal to 99.692% of the principal amount (the 2022 Senior Notes ) $900 million in aggregate principal amount of 3.450% senior notes due 2026 at a price equal to 99.481% of the principal amount (the 2026 Senior Notes and, together with the 2022 Senior Notes, the Senior Notes ) The 5-year Hybrid debentures accrue interest at a rate of 5.875% until February 28, 2022, on which date the rate will switch to a floating rate based on three-month LIBOR plus 3.895%, reset quarterly. The 10-year Hybrid debentures accrue interest at a rate of 6.250% until February 28, 2027, on which date the rate will switch to a floating rate based on three-month LIBOR plus 3.899%, reset quarterly. The Hybrid Debentures can be called by us at any time after the expiration of the fixed-rate period. The proceeds, net of issuance fees and expenses, from the issuance of the Hybrid Debentures and the Senior Notes were $2.569 billion. The Hybrid Debentures subordination, interest deferral option and extended term provide significant credit protection measures for senior creditors and as a result of these features, the debentures were awarded a 50% equity credit by S&P and Fitch, and a 25% equity credit by Moody s. The interest rate payable on the Senior Notes will be subject to adjustment from time to time if Moody Investors Services, Inc. or S&P Global Ratings downgrades (or downgrades and subsequently upgrades) the credit rating assigned to the Senior Notes. The interest rate on the Senior Notes would increase by 0.25% upon each credit agency downgrade up to a maximum of 2.00%, and would similarly be decreased for subsequent upgrades. In 2017, we redeemed $3.331 billion of senior notes and debentures for a redemption price of $3.333 billion. As a result of the redemptions, we recognized a net pre-tax extinguishment loss of $20 million within Other Items, net in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings, which included $18 million of unamortized debt discount and issuance fees. Our outstanding notes and debentures provide for certain covenant packages typical for an investment grade company. There is an acceleration trigger for the majority of the notes and debentures in the event of a change in control under specified circumstances coupled with ratings downgrades due to the change in control, as well as certain optional redemption provisions for our junior debentures. At September 30, 2017 and 2016 , the total unamortized discount and issuance fees and expenses related to our outstanding notes and debentures was $457 million and $459 million , respectively. Credit Facility : At September 30, 2017 and 2016 , there were no amounts outstanding under our $2.5 billion revolving credit facility due November 2019. The average credit facility amount outstanding for the twelve months ending September 30, 2017 47 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) was $33 million, which had a weighted average interest rate of 1.91%. The credit facility is used for general corporate purposes and to support commercial paper outstanding, if any. The borrowing rate under the credit facility is LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 1.25% to 2.25% based on our current public debt rating. The credit facility has one principal financial covenant that requires our interest coverage for the most recent four consecutive fiscal quarters to be at least 3.0x, which we met as of September 30, 2017 . Commercial Paper : At September 30, 2017 and 2016 , there was no commercial paper outstanding. The average commercial paper outstanding for the twelve months ending September 30, 2017 was $759 million, which had a weighted average interest rate of 1.53%. Stock Repurchase Program : During 2017 , we did not repurchase any shares of Class B common stock. During 2016 and 2015 , we repurchased 2.1 million and 21.1 million shares under the program for an aggregate price of $100 million and $1.5 billion , respectively, leaving $ 4.9 billion of remaining capacity under our $20.0 billion stock repurchase program. Commitments and Contingencies Our commitments primarily consist of programming and talent commitments, operating and capital lease arrangements, and purchase obligations for goods and services. These arrangements result from our normal course of business and represent obligations that may be payable over several years. See Note 11 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Additionally, we are subject to a redeemable put option (see Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements). Guarantees : In the course of our business, we both provide and receive the benefit of indemnities that are intended to allocate certain risks associated with business transactions. Similarly, we may remain contingently liable for various obligations of a business that has been divested in the event that a third party does not live up to its obligations under an indemnification agreement. Leases - We have certain indemnification obligations with respect to leases primarily associated with the previously discontinued operations of Famous Players Inc. ( Famous Players ). In addition, we have certain indemnities provided by the acquirer of Famous Players. Other - We have indemnification obligations with respect to letters of credit and surety bonds primarily used as security against non-performance in the normal course of business. Legal Matters : See Note 11 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding legal matters. Film Financing Arrangements : From time to time we enter into film financing arrangements that involve the sale of a partial copyright interest in a film to third-party investors. Since the investors typically have the risks and rewards of ownership proportionate to their ownership in the film, we generally record the amounts received for the sale of copyright interest as a reduction of the cost of the film and related cash flows are reflected in net cash flow from operating activities. We also enter into collaborative arrangements with other studios to jointly finance and distribute theatrical productions ( co-financing arrangements ). A co-financing arrangement typically involves joint ownership of the film asset with each partner responsible for distribution of the film in specific territories. The partners share in the profits and losses of the film in accordance with their respective ownership interest. In December 2016, we entered into a three-year strategic cooperation and slate financing agreement with Huahua Media ( Huahua ). Pursuant to the agreement, Huahua agreed to co-finance 25% of Paramount cost of its slate of films for a three-year period, with an option for an additional year. The arrangement included the sale of a partial copyright interest in certain films released during the first half of the year. Such interests were recorded as ancillary revenue as the films were substantially complete at the time of execution of the arrangement. In November 2017, following recent changes to Chinese foreign investment policies and delays in receipt of scheduled payments, Paramount and Huahua mutually agreed to terminate their agreement. In connection with the termination, a net $59 million charge was recorded in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2017. Paramount also announced it has secured a series of individual agreements with other financing partners that will provide committed or expected financing for approximately 25% of the production costs of Paramount film slate for fiscal 2018 and 2019. 48 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) Contractual Obligations Our contractual obligations include amounts reflected on our balance sheet, as well as off-balance sheet arrangements. At September 30, 2017 , our significant contractual obligations, including payments due for the next five fiscal years and thereafter, were as follows: Contractual Obligations (in millions) Total 2018 2019-2020 2021-2022 Thereafter Off-balance Sheet Arrangements Programming and talent commitments (1) $ 2,085 $ 659 $ 841 $ 416 $ 169 Operating leases (2) 1,625 223 270 271 861 Purchase obligations (3) 1,165 522 432 190 21 On-Balance Sheet Arrangements Capital lease obligations (4) $ 59 $ 21 $ 31 $ 6 $ 1 Debt 11,522 803 1,590 9,129 Interest payments (5) 10,633 561 1,085 998 7,989 Other long-term obligations (6) 2,398 1,537 697 164 (1) Programming and talent commitments include $1.731 billion relating to media networks programming and $354 million for talent contracts. (2) Operating leases include long-term non-cancelable operating lease commitments for office space, equipment, transponders, studio facilities and vehicles. (3) Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including open purchase orders. (4) Capital lease obligations include capital leases for satellite transponders. (5) Interest payments on our junior subordinated debentures subsequent to the expiration of their fixed-rate periods have been included based on their current fixed rates. (6) Other long-term obligations principally consist of participations, residuals and programming obligations for content that is available for airing. The table above does not include payments which may result from our defined benefit pension plans of $455 million , unrecognized tax benefits of $193 million , including interest and penalties, interest payments to be made under our credit facility and for commercial paper outstanding, $248 million of redeemable noncontrolling interest and lease indemnification obligations of approximately $194 million . The amount and timing of payments with respect to these items are subject to a number of uncertainties such that we are unable to make sufficiently reliable estimations of future payments. MARKET RISK We are exposed to market risk related to foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. We use or expect to use derivative financial instruments to modify exposure to risks from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. In accordance with our policy, we do not use derivative instruments unless there is an underlying exposure, and we do not hold or enter into financial instruments for speculative trading purposes. Foreign Exchange Risk We conduct business in various countries outside the U.S., resulting in exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates when translating from the foreign local currency to the U.S. Dollar. We use foreign currency forward contracts to economically hedge anticipated cash flows and foreign currency balances in such currencies as the British Pound, the Euro, the Brazilian Real, the Japanese Yen, the Australian Dollar and the Canadian Dollar. We also enter into forward contracts to hedge future production costs and programming obligations. The change in fair value of non-designated foreign exchange contracts is included in current period earnings as part of Other items, net in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. We manage the use of foreign exchange derivatives centrally. At September 30, 2017 and 2016 , the notional value of all foreign exchange contracts was $869 million and $1.149 billion , respectively. In 2017 , $287 million related to our foreign currency balances and $582 million related to future production costs. In 2016 , $874 million related to our foreign currency balances and $275 million related to future production costs. Interest Rate Risk A portion of our interest expense is exposed to movements in short-term rates. A 1% change to the weighted average interest rate on commercial paper and credit facility amounts outstanding in 2017 would increase or decrease interest expense by approximately $8 million. Also, interest expense for future long-term debt issues is exposed to movements in long-term rates. Interest rate hedges may be used to modify both of these exposures at our discretion. There were no interest rates hedges outstanding at September 30, 2017 and 2016 . 49 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) Viacom has issued notes and debentures that, at September 30, 2017 , had an outstanding balance of $11.1 billion and an estimated fair value of $11.6 billion . A 1% increase or decrease in the level of interest rates would decrease or increase the fair value of the notes and debentures by approximately $900 million and $1.1 billion , respectively. Credit Risk We continually monitor our positions with, and credit quality of, our customers and the financial institutions that are counterparties to our financial instrument agreements. We are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonpayment by our customers and nonperformance by the counterparties to our financial instrument agreements. However, we do not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties to our financial instrument agreements and we believe our allowance for doubtful accounts is sufficient to cover any anticipated nonpayment by our customers. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, which are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. The result of these evaluations forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amount of expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Our critical accounting policies are those that are considered by management to require significant judgment and use of estimates and that could have a significant impact on our financial statements. An understanding of our critical accounting policies is necessary to analyze our financial results. Our critical accounting policies include our accounting for film and television production costs, acquired programming rights, revenue recognition, income taxes and goodwill and other intangible assets. The risks and uncertainties involved in applying our critical accounting policies are provided below. Unless otherwise noted, we applied our critical accounting policies and estimation methods consistently in all material respects and for all periods presented, and have discussed such policies with our Audit Committee. For a summary of our significant accounting policies see Note 2 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Film and Television Production Costs We capitalize feature film and television production costs, on a title-specific basis, as Inventory, net in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We use an individual-film-forecast-computation method to amortize original production costs and to accrue estimated liabilities for residuals and participations over the applicable title life cycle based upon the ratio of current period to estimated remaining total gross revenues ( ultimate revenues ) for each title. The estimate of ultimate revenues impacts the timing of amortization and accrual of residuals and participations. Our estimate of ultimate revenues for feature films includes revenues from all sources that are estimated to be earned within 10 years from the date of a film initial theatrical release. For acquired film libraries, our estimate of ultimate revenues is for a period within 20 years from the date of acquisition. For feature films, prior to release we estimate ultimate revenues based on the historical performance of similar content and pre-release market research (including test market screenings), as well as incorporating factors of the content itself, including, but not limited to, the expected number of theaters and markets in which the original content will be released, the genre of the original content and the past box office performance of the lead actors and actresses. We believe the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of ultimate revenues for films intended for theatrical release is theatrical exhibition, as subsequent markets have historically exhibited a high correlation to theatrical performance. Upon a film initial release we update our estimate of ultimate revenues based on expected future and actual results. Our estimates of revenues from succeeding windows and markets are revised based on historical relationships to theatrical performance and an analysis of current market trends. We also review and revise estimates of ultimate revenue and participation costs as of each reporting date to reflect the most current available information. If estimates for a film are revised, the difference between amortization expense determined using the new estimate and any amounts previously expensed during that fiscal year are charged or credited to our Consolidated Statement of Earnings in the quarter in which the estimates are revised. The most sensitive factor affecting our estimates for films subsequent to their initial release is the extent of home entertainment sales achieved. In addition to theatrical performance, home entertainment sales vary based on a variety of factors including demand for our titles, the volume and quality of competing products, marketing and promotional strategies, as well as economic conditions. Ultimate revenues for television programming are limited to the amount of contracted revenue. Accordingly, television production costs in excess of the amount of contracted revenue are expensed as incurred. For original programming broadcast 50 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) on our networks, capitalized original programming costs are amortized utilizing an individual-film-forecast-computation method over the applicable title ultimate revenues based on genre and historical experience, beginning with the month of initial exhibition. The most sensitive factor affecting ultimate revenues is ratings, which are an indication of audience acceptance and directly impact the level of advertising revenues we will be able to generate during the airing of the programming. Poor ratings may result in abandonment of a program, which would require the immediate write-off of any unamortized production costs. If we believe that the release of our content will not be or has not been favorably received, then we would assess whether the fair value of such content is less than the unamortized portion of its capitalized costs and, if need be, recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the unamortized capitalized costs exceed the fair value. We utilize the individual-film-forecast-computation method (adjusted to incorporate revenue and related costs, including future exploitation costs, if any, expected to occur in periods beyond 10 years from the date of a film initial release) to develop the cash flows which are subsequently discounted to compute the fair value of a title that is being assessed for impairment. The discount rate utilized takes into account the time value of money as well as a risk premium. The risk premium reflects the uncertainties of realizing the expected cash flows of a title which is impacted by the title position within its product life cycle. Acquired Programming Rights Costs incurred in acquiring program rights, including advances, are capitalized and amortized to operating expenses over the license period or projected useful life of the programming, if shorter, commencing upon availability, based on estimated future airings. Program rights and the related liabilities are recorded at the commencement of the licensing period when the cost of the programming is known or reasonably determinable, the program material has been accepted and the programming is available for airing. If initial airings are expected to generate higher revenues an accelerated method of amortization is used. Determining factors used in estimating the useful life of programming include the expected number of future airings, which may differ from the contracted number of airings, the length of the license period and expected future revenues to be generated from the programming. The cost basis of acquired programming is the capitalized cost of each program and is equal to the cost of the programming pursuant to the license agreement less the cumulative amortization recorded for the program. Capitalized costs of rights to program materials are reported in our Consolidated Balance Sheets at the lower of unamortized cost or estimated net realizable value. We evaluate net realizable value of acquired rights programming on a daypart basis. A daypart is defined as an aggregation of programs broadcast during a particular time of day or an aggregation of programs of a similar type. We aggregate similar programming based on the specific demographic targeted by each respective program service. Net realizable value is determined by estimating advertising revenues to be derived from the future airing of the programming within the daypart as well as an allocation of affiliate revenues to programming. An impairment charge may be necessary if our estimates of future cash flows of similar programming are insufficient or if programming is abandoned. Revenue Recognition Multiple-Element Arrangements We enter into arrangements under which we perform multiple revenue-generating activities. We allocate consideration to separate units of account in the arrangement and recognize the associated revenue as each unit of account is delivered. Advertising revenues are principally generated from the sale of advertising time comprised of multiple commercial units. Each advertising spot comprises a deliverable for accounting purposes. Consideration for these arrangements is allocated among the individual advertising spots based on relative fair value using Viacom-specific prices. Subscription video-on-demand and other OTT arrangements include certain programs made available to distributors on one or more dates for a fixed fee. Consideration for such arrangements is allocated among the programs based on relative fair value using management best estimate considering viewing performance and other factors. Gross versus Net Revenue We earn and recognize revenues as a distributor on behalf of third parties and through outsourced agency agreements. In such cases, determining whether revenue should be reported on a gross or net basis is based on management assessment of who our customer is in the transaction. To the extent the end consumer is our customer, we act as the principal in a transaction and revenues earned from the end user are reported on a gross basis. This determination involves judgment and is based on an evaluation of the facts and circumstances of the terms of an arrangement. Revenue Allowances In accordance with the accounting guidance related to revenue recognition when a right of return exists, revenue allowances are recorded to adjust amounts originally invoiced to the estimated net realizable value of a particular product. Upon the sale of DVDs and Blu-ray discs to wholesalers and retailers, we record a reduction of revenue for the impact of estimated future 51 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) returns, rebates and other incentives ( estimated returns ). In determining estimated returns, we consider numerous sources of qualitative and quantitative evidence including forecasted sales data, customers rights of return, units shipped and units remaining at retail, historical return rates for similar product, current economic trends, competitive environment, promotions and sales strategies. Forecasted sales data is determined by comparing a particular release to product that has similar characteristics where applicable, such as franchise, genre, box office levels and release patterns, using regression analysis, decay rates and other tools. Based on the results of this analysis and the sales strategies to be used for the release, we reserve an appropriate percentage of each dollar of product revenue on a title taking into consideration the qualitative and quantitative factors described above. Forecasted sales data is reviewed and updated throughout each quarter and is consistent with the projections of ultimate revenues used in applying the individual-film-forecast-computation method to amortize our film costs. Accordingly, a change in forecasted sales affects both the revenue allowance and related expenses. Actual sell-through data is reviewed as it becomes available against the forecasted sales data to ensure that estimates continue to be consistent with actual sales performance. Our estimate of future returns affects reported revenue and operating income. If we underestimate the impact of future returns in a particular period, then we may record less revenue and related expenses in later periods when returns exceed the estimated amounts. If we overestimate the impact of future returns in a particular period, then we may record additional revenue and related expenses in later periods when returns are less than estimated. An incremental change of 1% in our estimated sales returns rate (i.e., provisions for returns divided by gross sales of related product) for DVDs and Blu-ray products would have a $9 million impact on our total revenue for the year ended September 30, 2017 . This revenue impact would be partially offset by a corresponding impact on related expenses depending on the margin associated with a specific film and other factors. Income Taxes Significant judgment is required in determining our annual provision for income taxes and evaluating our income tax positions. Our tax rates are impacted by the tax laws, regulations and policies in federal, state and local and international territories where our businesses operate. Changes to these laws and regulations and uncertainty generated by the prospect of future tax legislation may also affect our income tax positions, in addition to other factors, including our global mix of earnings, acquisitions and dispositions, as well as the tax characteristics of our income. In determining our income tax provisions on a jurisdiction basis, we are required to make judgments on the need to record deferred tax assets and liabilities, including the realizability of deferred tax assets. A valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is established if it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized. In evaluating uncertain tax positions, we make determinations of the application of complex tax rules, regulations and practices. We evaluate our uncertain tax positions quarterly based on many factors including, but not limited to, new facts, changes in tax law and interpretations as well as information received from regulators. A change in any one of these factors could change our evaluation of an existing uncertain tax position, resulting in the recognition of an additional charge or benefit to our income tax provision in the period and may result in fluctuations in our effective income tax rate. Additionally, our income tax returns are routinely audited and settlements of issues raised in these audits sometimes affect our income tax provisions. The resolution of audit issues and income tax positions taken may take extended periods of time due to the length of examinations by tax authorities and the possible extension of statutes of limitations. A 1% change in our effective income tax rate would result in additional income tax expense of approximately $22 million for the year ended September 30, 2017 . We indefinitely reinvest the earnings of substantially all of our foreign subsidiaries outside the U.S. We do not provide for U.S. taxes on earnings of our foreign subsidiaries for which the earnings are indefinitely reinvested. Goodwill Goodwill at September 30, 2017 relates to our reporting units Global Entertainment Group ($4.3 billion), Nickelodeon Group ($3.1 billion), BET Networks ($2.7 billion) and Paramount ($1.6 billion). We have elected to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test in 2017. We test goodwill for impairment on August 31 of each year. The first step of a quantitative goodwill impairment test is to identify a potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. The second step, if necessary, compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination. The estimates of fair value of a reporting unit are determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis. A discounted cash flow analysis requires us to make various judgmental assumptions, including assumptions about the timing and amount of future cash flows, growth rates and discount rates. Given the inherent uncertainty in determining these assumptions, actual results may 52 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) differ from those used in our valuations. To facilitate a better understanding of how these valuations are determined, a discussion of our significant assumptions, including a sensitivity analysis with respect to their impact on the estimated value of our reporting units, is provided below. The assumptions about future cash flows and growth rates are based on the budget and long-term business plans of each reporting unit. Such assumptions take into account numerous factors including historical experience, anticipated economic conditions, advertising sales and ratings trends, terms of affiliate license arrangements and anticipated terms of renewals, projected costs for production and programming, number and expected financial performance of films expected to be produced and distributed each year and changes in the reporting unit cost structures. Discount rate assumptions for each reporting unit take into account our assessment of the risks inherent in the future cash flows of the respective reporting unit, an assessment of market rates and the capital structure of comparable entities. In determining the fair value of our reporting units, we used the following assumptions: Expected cash flows underlying our business plans for the periods 2018 through 2022. Cash flows beyond 2022 are projected to grow at a perpetual growth rate, which we estimated at between 2.5% and 3%. In order to risk adjust the cash flow projections in determining fair value, we utilized a discount rate of approximately 7.4% to 9.4% for each of our reporting units. Based on our assessment using the assumptions described above, a hypothetical 20% reduction in the estimated fair value in each of our reporting units would not result in an impairment condition. We have performed a sensitivity analysis to illustrate the impact of changes in assumptions underlying the first step of the impairment test. Based on our assessment: a one percentage point decrease in the growth rate of cash flow over the periods 2018 through 2022 would reduce the indicated fair value of our reporting units by a range of approximately 4% to 6% and would not result in an impairment of any reporting unit; a one percentage point decrease in the perpetual growth rate would reduce the indicated fair value of each of our reporting units by a range of approximately 12% to 14% and would not result in an impairment of any reporting unit; and a one percentage point increase in the discount rate would reduce the indicated fair value of each of our reporting units by a range of approximately 14% to 17% and would not result in an impairment of any reporting unit. Finite-Lived Intangible Assets We evaluate whether there has been an impairment of finite-lived intangible assets if a triggering event indicates that an impairment may exist. The impairment test employed for finite-lived intangible assets (e.g., broadcast license, trade names and customer lists), which is performed at the lowest level of cash flows associated with the asset, first requires a comparison of undiscounted future cash flows against the carrying value of the asset. If the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted cash flows, the asset would be written down to its fair value. Significant judgments in this area involve determining whether a triggering event has occurred, the determination of the cash flows for the assets involved and the discount rate to be applied in determining fair value. 53 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) OTHER MATTERS Related Parties In the ordinary course of business we enter into transactions with related parties, including National Amusements, Inc. ( National Amusements ), CBS, their respective subsidiaries and affiliates, and companies that we account for under the equity method of accounting. See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for details regarding the related party transactions and their impact on the Financial Statements. Agreements with CBS Corporation In connection with our separation from CBS, effective as of January 1, 2006 (the separation ), we and CBS entered into a Separation Agreement, a Transition Services Agreement and a Tax Matters Agreement, as well as certain other agreements to govern the terms of the separation and certain of the ongoing relationships between CBS and us after the separation. These related party arrangements are more fully described below. Pursuant to the Separation Agreement, each company is obligated to indemnify the other company and the other company officers, directors and employees for any losses arising out of its failure to perform or discharge any of the liabilities it assumed pursuant to the Separation Agreement, including with respect to certain legal matters, its businesses as conducted as of the date of the separation and its breaches of shared contracts. Subject to limited exceptions, the Separation Agreement provides that none of Viacom, any subsidiary of Viacom or any person that is controlled by Viacom after the separation will own or acquire an interest in a radio or television broadcast station, television broadcast network or daily newspaper, if such ownership or acquisition would (i) cause CBS, any subsidiary of CBS or any entity controlled by CBS after the date of the separation to be in violation of U.S. federal laws limiting the ownership or control of radio broadcast stations, television broadcast stations and/or television broadcast networks or (ii) limit in any manner at any time under such laws CBS ability to acquire additional interests in a radio or television broadcast station and/or television broadcast network. These restrictions will terminate when none of Mr. Redstone, National Amusements, NAIRI Inc. or any of their successors, assigns or transferees are deemed to have interests in both CBS and Viacom that are attributable under applicable U.S. federal laws. The Separation Agreement also provides that neither Viacom, any subsidiary of Viacom or any person controlled by Viacom nor CBS, any subsidiary of CBS or any person controlled by CBS will acquire any asset, enter into any agreement or accept or agree to any condition that purports to bind, or subjects to a legal order, the other company, its subsidiaries or any person it controls without such other party written consent.
