ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The consolidated financial statements of Humana Inc. in this document present the Company financial position, results of operations and cash flows, and should be read in conjunction with the following discussion and analysis. References to we, us, our, Company, and Humana mean Humana Inc. and its subsidiaries. This discussion includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. When used in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in our press releases, investor presentations, and in oral statements made by or with the approval of one of our executive officers, the words or phrases like expects, anticipates, intends, likely will result, estimates, projects or variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements. These forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including, among other things, information set forth in Item 1A. Risk Factors. In making these statements, we are not undertaking to address or update these factors in future filings or communications regarding our business or results except as required by law. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the forward looking events discussed in this document might not occur. There may also be other risks that we are unable to predict at this time. Any of these risks and uncertainties may cause actual results to differ materially from the results discussed in the forward looking statements. Overview Headquartered in Louisville, Kentucky, Humana Inc. is one of the nation largest publicly traded health and supplemental benefits companies, based on our 2007 revenues of $25.3 billion. We are a full-service benefits solutions company, offering a wide array of health and supplemental benefit plans for employer groups, government benefit programs, and individuals. As of December 31, 2007, we had approximately 11.5 million members in our medical benefit plans, as well as approximately 6.8 million members in our specialty products. We manage our business with two segments: Government and Commercial. The Government segment consists of beneficiaries of government benefit programs, and includes three lines of business: Medicare, Military, and Medicaid. The Commercial segment consists of members enrolled in our medical and specialty products marketed to employer groups and individuals. We identified our segments in accordance with the aggregation provisions of SFAS 131 , which aggregates products with similar economic characteristics. These characteristics include the nature of customer groups as well as pricing, benefits, and underwriting requirements. These segment groupings are consistent with information used by our Chief Executive Officer. The results of each segment are measured by income before income taxes. We allocate all selling, general and administrative expenses, investment and other revenue, interest expense, and goodwill, but no other assets or liabilities, to our segments. Members served by our two segments often utilize the same medical provider networks, enabling us to obtain more favorable contract terms with providers. Our segments also share indirect overhead costs and assets. As a result, the profitability of each segment is interdependent. Our results are impacted by many factors, but most notably are influenced by our ability to establish and maintain a competitive and efficient cost structure and to accurately and consistently establish competitive premium, ASO fee, and plan benefit levels that are commensurate with our benefit and administrative costs. Benefit costs are subject to a high rate of inflation due to many forces, including new higher priced technologies and medical procedures, new prescription drugs and therapies, an aging population, lifestyle challenges including obesity and smoking, the tort liability system, and government regulation. Our industry relies on two key statistics to measure performance. The benefits ratio, which is computed by taking total benefit expenses as a percentage of premium revenues, represents a statistic used to measure underwriting profitability. The selling, general, and administrative expense ratio, or SG&A expense ratio, which is computed by taking total selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of premium revenues, administrative services fees and other revenues, represents a statistic used to measure administrative spending efficiency. 31 Table of Contents Government Segment Our strategy and commitment to the expanded Medicare programs, including new product choices and pharmacy benefits for seniors, has led to significant growth. Medicare Advantage membership increased to 1,143,000 members at December 31, 2007, up 14.0% from 1,002,600 at December 31, 2006 and up 104.9% from 557,800 at December 31, 2005, primarily due to sales of Private Fee-For-Service, or PFFS, products. Average Medicare Advantage membership was 26.4% higher for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the year ended December 31, 2006, and average stand-alone PDP membership was 19.5% higher. Likewise, Medicare premium revenues have increased $3.3 billion, or 28.5%, to $14.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007 from $11.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2006. We expect Medicare Advantage membership to continue to grow into 2008, adding between 200,000 and 250,000 members by December 31, 2008, with a shift in sales mix towards our PPO and HMO offerings. Our quarterly Government segment earnings are particularly impacted by the Medicare Part D benefit design and changes in the composition of our membership. The Medicare Part D benefit design results in coverage that varies as a member cumulative out-of-pocket costs pass through successive stages of a member plan period which begins January 1 for renewals. These plan designs generally result in us sharing a greater portion of the responsibility for total pharmacy costs in the early stages and less in the latter stages. As a result the Government segment benefits ratio generally improves as the year progresses. In addition, the number of low-income senior members as well as year over year changes in the mix of membership in our stand-alone PDP products, Standard, Enhanced, and Complete, affect the quarterly benefits ratio pattern. We expect the combination of these items will result in a greater proportion of earnings for 2008 to be earned in the first half versus the second half when compared to the quarterly earnings pattern in 2007. Commercial Segment We continue to increase the diversification of our Commercial segment membership base and continue to exercise pricing discipline relative to our fully-insured accounts. Commercial segment medical membership increased by 167,800 members from December 31, 2006 to 3,451,600 at December 31, 2007 primarily as a result of the acquisition of KMG America Corporation, discussed more fully below, which added approximately 95,900 members, primarily ASO. The remaining increase primarily was due to enrollment gains in strategic areas of commercial growth including Smart plans and other consumer offerings, individual, small group, and ASO products, partially offset by a decline in the fully-insured larger group product membership. Membership changes from exercising pricing discipline and sales focused on strategic growth areas resulted in a decline in the benefits ratio to 80.5% for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 81.7% for the year ended December 31, 2006. In addition, we are diversifying our Commercial segment revenues through expanded and new specialty product offerings with the acquisitions of CompBenefits Corporation and KMG America Corporation in the fourth quarter of 2007, each discussed further below. These acquisitions significantly increased our dental membership and added new product offerings including vision and other supplemental health and life benefit plans primarily sold on a voluntary basis. The supplemental health plans cover, for example, some of the costs associated with cancer and critical illness. Along with our 2005 acquisition of Corphealth, Inc., a behavioral health care management company, these specialty acquisitions are anticipated to enhance our Commercial segment margins and our ability to appeal to more customers. Other Highlights Earnings increased 69% to $4.91 per diluted common share in 2007 from $2.90 per diluted common share in 2006, primarily due to increased premium revenue from higher average Medicare membership. Year over year comparisons were impacted by changes in estimates associated with our 2006 Medicare Part D reconciliation with CMS and the settlement of some TRICARE contractual provisions related to prior years which increased our Government segment results by $68.9 million pretax, or $0.25 per 32 Table of Contents diluted common share, for the year ended December 31, 2007. In addition, a gain in the first quarter of 2006 of $51.7 million pretax, or $0.19 per diluted common share, from the sale of a venture capital investment also impacted year over year comparisons. Cash flows from operations decreased $462.4 million to $1,224.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to $1,686.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. Our operating cash flows were unfavorably impacted by the Part D provisions of our Medicare contracts, primarily the 2007 payment of the $725.5 million risk corridor payable to CMS associated with the 2006 contract year, partially offset by improvement in operating earnings. In September 2007, we received approval from CMS to resume marketing of individual Medicare PFFS plans. This announcement ended the June 15, 2007 voluntary suspension agreed to in conjunction with other industry participants. In October 2007, we were awarded the Department of Veterans Affairs first specialty network demonstration project, known as Project HERO (Healthcare Effectiveness through Resource Optimization), to support healthcare delivery to veterans. Currently, we are anticipating a formal request for proposal, or RFP, for the TRICARE contracts. We intend for the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows to assist in the understanding of our financial statements and related changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year, and the primary factors that accounted for those changes, as well as how certain critical accounting principles and estimates impact our financial statements. Recent Acquisitions On November 30, 2007, our Commercial segment acquired KMG America Corporation, or KMG, for cash consideration of $156.3 million including direct transaction costs, plus the assumption of $36.1 million of long-term debt. KMG provides long-duration insurance benefits including supplemental health and life benefit plans. On October 1, 2007, our Commercial segment acquired CompBenefits Corporation, or CompBenefits, for cash consideration of $369.1 million including direct transaction costs. CompBenefits provides dental and vision insurance benefits. These acquisitions, which were financed through a combination of cash and borrowings under our credit agreement, expand our commercial product offerings allowing for significant cross-selling opportunities with our medical insurance products. On March 1, 2007, our Government segment acquired DefenseWeb Technologies, Inc., or DefenseWeb, a company responsible for delivering customized software solutions for the Department of Defense, for cash consideration of $27.0 million. On May 1, 2006, our Commercial segment acquired CHA Service Company, or CHA Health, a health plan serving employer groups in Kentucky, for cash consideration of $67.5 million. On December 20, 2005, our Commercial segment acquired Corphealth, Inc., a behavioral health care management company, for cash consideration of approximately $54.0 million. This acquisition allowed Humana to integrate coverage of medical and behavior health benefits. On February 16, 2005, we acquired CarePlus Health Plans of Florida, or CarePlus, as well as its affiliated 10 medical centers and pharmacy company for approximately $444.9 million in cash, adding approximately 50,400 Medicare Advantage members in Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties. This acquisition enhanced our Medicare market position in South Florida. Certain of these transactions are more fully described in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. 33 Table of Contents Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In December 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued FASB Statement No. 141 (Revised 2007), Business Combination, or SFAS 141R. SFAS 141R will significantly change the accounting for business combinations. Under SFAS 141R, an acquiring entity will be required to recognize all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a transaction at the acquisition-date fair value with limited exceptions. SFAS 141R will change the accounting treatment for certain specific items including expensing transaction and restructuring costs and adjusting earnings in periods subsequent to the acquisition for changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties as well as changes in the fair value of acquired contingent liabilities. SFAS 141R also includes a substantial number of new disclosure requirements. SFAS 141R applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after January 1, 2009 with early adoption prohibited . Accordingly, we are required to record and disclose business combinations following existing GAAP until January 1, 2009. We currently are evaluating the provisions of SFAS 141R. In December 2007, the FASB issued FASB Statement No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements An Amendment of ARB No. 5, or SFAS 160 . SFAS 160 establishes new accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. Specifically, SFAS 160 requires the recognition of a noncontrolling interest (minority interest) as equity and separate from the parent equity. The amount of net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest will be included in consolidated net income on the face of the income statement. SFAS 160 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning January 1, 2009. Like SFAS 141R discussed above, earlier adoption is prohibited. We currently are evaluating the provisions of SFAS 160. In February 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities , or SFAS 159. SFAS 159 allows us an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value and establishes related presentation and disclosure requirements. We were required to make an election regarding this fair value option in the first quarter of 2008, and we did not elect to adopt this fair value option under SFAS 159. In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, Fair Value Measurements, or SFAS 157. SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 does not require new fair value measurements. We adopted SFAS 157 on January 1, 2008. The adoption of SFAS 157 did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. We are evaluating the disclosure provisions of SFAS 157 required in connection with the filing of our first quarter 2008 Form 10-Q. 34 Table of Contents Comparison of Results of Operations for 2007 and 2006 Certain financial data for our two segments was as follows for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006: Change 2007 2006 Dollars Percentage (dollars in thousands) Premium revenues: Medicare Advantage $ 11,173,417 $ 8,499,064 $ 2,674,353 31.5 % Medicare stand-alone PDP 3,668,425 3,050,304 618,121 20.3 % Total Medicare 14,841,842 11,549,368 3,292,474 28.5 % Military services 2,839,790 2,543,930 295,860 11.6 % Medicaid 555,594 520,520 35,074 6.7 % Total Government 18,237,226 14,613,818 3,623,408 24.8 % Fully-insured 5,663,000 5,704,378 (41,378 ) (0.7 )% Specialty 534,121 410,986 123,135 30.0 % Total Commercial 6,197,121 6,115,364 81,757 1.3 % Total $ 24,434,347 $ 20,729,182 $ 3,705,165 17.9 % Administrative services fees: Government $ 73,659 $ 49,442 $ 24,217 49.0 % Commercial 317,856 291,769 26,087 8.9 % Total $ 391,515 $ 341,211 $ 50,304 14.7 % Income before income taxes: Government $ 1,027,531 $ 513,845 $ 513,686 100.0 % Commercial 261,769 248,240 13,529 5.4 % Total $ 1,289,300 $ 762,085 $ 527,215 69.2 % Benefits ratios(a): Government 83.8 % 85.0 % (1.2 )% Commercial 80.5 % 81.7 % (1.2 )% Total 83.0 % 84.0 % (1.0 )% SG&A expense ratios(b): Government 11.2 % 11.8 % (0.6 )% Commercial 21.5 % 20.0 % 1.5 % Total 13.9 % 14.3 % (0.4 )% (a) Represents total benefit expense as a percentage of premium revenue.

Summary Net income was $833.7 million, or $4.91 per diluted common share, in 2007 compared to $487.4 million, or $2.90 per diluted common share, in 2006. The year-over-year increase in earnings primarily resulted from higher operating earnings in our Government segment largely due to increased premium revenue from higher average Medicare membership. Premium Revenues and Medical Membership Premium revenues increased $3.7 billion, or 17.9%, to $24.4 billion for 2007, compared to $20.7 billion for 2006 primarily due to higher premium revenues in the Government segment. Premium revenues reflect changes in membership and increases in average per member premiums. Items impacting average per member premiums include changes in premium rates as well as changes in the geographic mix of membership, the mix of product offerings, the mix of benefit plans selected by our membership, the impact of the risk corridor provisions, and changes in health status factors or risk adjustment provisions. Government segment premium revenues increased $3.6 billion, or 24.8%, to $18.2 billion for 2007 compared to $14.6 billion for 2006 primarily attributable to higher average Medicare membership from the expanded participation in various Medicare products. Average membership is calculated by summing the ending membership for each month in a period and dividing the result by the number of months in a period. Average Medicare Advantage membership increased 26.4% for 2007 compared to 2006. Sales of our PFFS products drove the majority of the 140,400 increase in ending Medicare Advantage members since December 31, 2006. Average Medicare stand-alone PDP membership increased 19.5% for 2007 compared to 2006. Commercial segment premium revenues increased $81.8 million, or 1.3%, to $6.2 billion for 2007 primarily due to our specialty product offerings, including dental, vision, and other supplemental health and life products, 36 Table of Contents as a result of the CompBenefits and KMG acquisitions. Increases in average fully-insured per member premiums were offset by a decrease in average fully-insured membership. Average fully-insured group membership decreased 6.9% for 2007 compared to 2006, primarily as a result of a large group account moving from fully-insured to ASO on July 1, 2006, partially offset by membership gains in strategic areas of commercial growth including Smart plans and other consumer offerings, individual, and small group product lines. Average per member premiums for our fully-insured group medical members increased approximately 5.2% from 2006 to 2007. Administrative Services Fees Our administrative services fees were $391.5 million for 2007, an increase of $50.3 million, or 14.7%, from $341.2 million for 2006. The increase was due to increases in both our Government and Commercial segments. For the Government segment, administrative services fees increased $24.2 million, or 49.0%, to $73.7 million for 2007 as a result of the DefenseWeb acquisition and the award of a new Puerto Rico ASO contract during the fourth quarter of 2006. For the Commercial segment, administrative services fees increased $26.1 million, or 8.9%, from $291.8 million for 2006 to $317.9 million for 2007 primarily from higher average ASO membership, increasing 5.7% for 2007 compared to 2006. Investment Income Investment income totaled $314.2 million for 2007, an increase of $22.3 million from $291.9 million for 2006 primarily due to higher average investment balances in 2007 partially offset by a decrease in realized gains related to the sale of venture capital investments in 2006. Investment income for 2006 included a $51.7 million realized gain related to the sale of a venture capital investment in the first quarter. Other Revenue Other revenue totaled $149.9 million for 2007, an increase of $95.6 million from $54.3 million for 2006. The increase primarily was attributable to increased revenue from growth related to Right Source SM , our mail order pharmacy. Benefit Expenses Consolidated benefit expense was $20.3 billion for 2007, an increase of $2.9 billion, or 16.7%, from $17.4 billion for 2006. The increase primarily was driven by the increase in the average number of Medicare members and an increase in average per member claims costs primarily from the effects of health care inflation. The consolidated benefits ratio for 2007 was 83.0%, a 100 basis point decrease from 84.0% for 2006. The decrease primarily was attributable to improvements in the benefits ratio for both the Commercial and Government segments. The Government segment benefit expenses increased $2.9 billion, or 23.0%, during 2007 compared to 2006 primarily due to an increase in the average number of Medicare members, including those enrolled in our PDPs, and to a lesser extent, an increase in average per member claims costs. The Government segment benefits ratio for 2007 was 83.8%, a 120 basis point decrease from 2006 of 85.0%. The decrease in the benefits ratio resulted from the combination of the extended enrollment period in 2006, improvement in the stand-alone PDP Complete plan, changes in estimates associated with our 2006 Medicare Part D reconciliation with CMS as well as the settlement of some TRICARE contractual provisions 37 Table of Contents related to prior years. Part D benefit designs result in us sharing a greater portion of the responsibilities for total pharmacy costs in the early stages of a member plan period and less in the later stages, resulting in a declining benefits ratio as the year progresses. The extended enrollment period in 2006, which ended June 30, 2006, skewed the standard pattern associated with the progression of members through the stages of Medicare Part D benefits. Regarding the Complete plan, benefit design changes improved the performance of that offering. Changes in estimates associated with our 2006 Medicare Part D reconciliation with CMS and the settlement of some TRICARE contractual provisions related to the prior years decreased the benefits ratio 40 basis points for 2007. These changes in estimates resulted from 1) the resolution of first year Medicare Part D implementation matters including enrollment discrepancies, of which similar adjustments in the future are not expected to be material due to the program operational improvement in 2007; and 2) the adjustment of certain TRICARE reserves as a result of the settlement of claims payment accuracy and risk share provisions for prior option periods. The Commercial segment benefit expense decreased $6.2 million, or 0.1%, from 2006 to 2007. This decrease primarily results from the decrease in fully-insured group membership partially offset by the increase in average per member claims costs due to medical expense inflation. The benefits ratio for the Commercial segment of 80.5% for 2007 decreased 120 basis points from the 2006 benefits ratio of 81.7%. The decrease in the benefits ratio primarily reflects an increase in the percentage of individual and small group members comprising our total fully-insured block, the CompBenefits and KMG acquisitions which added dental, vision, and other supplemental health and life members, and improving medical cost utilization. Individual and smaller group as well as specialty, primarily dental and vision, accounts generally carry a lower benefits ratio and a higher SG&A expense ratio compared to larger group accounts due to higher distribution costs. See related SG&A expense ratio discussion in the following section. SG&A Expense Consolidated SG&A expenses increased $455.0 million, or 15.1%, during 2007 compared to 2006. The increase primarily resulted from an increase in the number of employees due to the Medicare expansion, expenses associated with Right Source SM , our mail order pharmacy, and higher Medicare marketing expenses associated with higher sales goals for 2008 compared to 2007. The number of employees increased by 2,700 to 25,000 at December 31, 2007 from 22,300 at December 31, 2006, or 12.1%. The consolidated SG&A expense ratio for 2007 was 13.9%, decreasing 40 basis points from 14.3% for 2006. The SG&A expense ratio decrease resulted from improving administrative cost efficiency and productivity gains associated with servicing our members offset by our expanding mail order pharmacy business as well as differences in the composition of our medical membership portfolio for 2007 versus 2006. The consolidated SG&A expense ratio is expected to be in the range of 13.5% to 14.0% for 2008. Our Government and Commercial segments bear both direct and shared indirect overhead SG&A expenses. We allocate the indirect overhead expenses shared by the two segments primarily as a function of revenues. As a result, the profitability of each segment is interdependent. SG&A expenses in the Government segment increased $312.0 million, or 18.0%, during 2007 compared to 2006. The Government segment SG&A expense ratio decreased 60 basis points from 11.8% for 2006 to 11.2% for 2007. The decrease primarily resulted from efficiency and productivity gains associated with servicing higher average Medicare membership. The Commercial segment SG&A expenses increased $143.0 million, or 11.1%, during 2007 compared to 2006. The Commercial segment SG&A expense ratio increased 150 basis points from 20.0% for 2006 to 21.5% for 2007. This increase primarily resulted from the continued shift in the mix of membership towards ASO, an increase in the percentage of individual and small group members comprising our fully-insured membership, and 38 Table of Contents administrative costs associated with increased business for our mail order pharmacy. For 2007, 46.8% of our Commercial segment average medical membership was related to ASO business compared to 44.5% for 2006. Likewise, at December 31, 2007, 29.3% of our Commercial segment average medical membership was related to individual and small group accounts compared to 27.7% at December 31, 2006. Fee based ASO business carries a higher SG&A expense ratio than fully-insured business since there is no benefit expense or offsetting premium revenue. Additionally, individual and smaller group accounts carry a higher SG&A expense ratio due to higher distribution costs compared to larger group accounts. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization for 2007 totaled $184.8 million compared to $148.6 million for 2006, an increase of $36.2 million, or 24.4%. The increase primarily resulted from increased capital expenditures related to the Medicare expansion. Interest Expense Interest expense was $68.9 million for 2007, compared to $63.1 million for 2006, an increase of $5.8 million, primarily due to higher average outstanding debt partially offset by lower interest rates. Income Taxes Our effective tax rate for 2007 of 35.3% compared to the effective tax rate of 36.0% for 2006. The decrease is primarily due to a lower state tax rate. The lower state tax rate results from a shift in the geographic mix of revenues to states with lower tax rates. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for a complete reconciliation of the federal statutory rate to the effective tax rate. We expect the 2008 effective tax rate to be in the range of 35.5% to 36.0%. Comparison of Results of Operations for 2006 and 2005 Year over year comparisons have been impacted by litigation and Hurricane Katrina expenses in 2005 that did not recur in 2006, as more fully discussed in the following sections. 2005 Settlement of Class Action Litigation On October 17, 2005, we reached an agreement with representatives of more than 700,000 physicians to settle a nationwide class action suit. In connection with the settlement and other related litigation costs, we recorded pretax administrative expenses of $71.9 million ($44.8 million after taxes, or $0.27 per diluted common share) in the third quarter of 2005. Of the $71.9 million, $33.4 million was included in the Government segment results and the remaining $38.5 million was included in the Commercial segment results. These amounts were paid in 2006. 2005 Hurricane Katrina Certain of our operations, primarily the Louisiana market, were negatively affected by the impact of Hurricane Katrina in August 2005. Expenses related to Hurricane Katrina primarily stemmed from our efforts, in cooperation with Departments of Insurance in the affected states, to help our members by offering participating-provider benefits at non-participating providers rates, paying claims for members who were unable at the time to meet their premium obligations and similar measures. In connection with Hurricane Katrina, we recorded pretax medical and administrative expenses of $27.0 million ($16.9 million after taxes, or $0.10 per diluted common share) during the third and fourth quarters of 2005. Of the $27.0 million, $5.9 million was included in the Government segment results and the remaining $21.1 million was included in the Commercial segment results. 39 Table of Contents Results of Operations Certain financial data for our two segments was as follows for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005: Change 2006 2005 Dollars Percentage (dollars in thousands) Premium revenues: Medicare Advantage $ 8,499,064 $ 4,590,362 $ 3,908,702 85.2 % Medicare stand-alone PDP 3,050,304 3,050,304 100.0 % Total Medicare 11,549,368 4,590,362 6,959,006 151.6 % Military services 2,543,930 2,407,653 136,277 5.7 % Medicaid 520,520 548,714 (28,194 ) (5.1 )% Total Government 14,613,818 7,546,729 7,067,089 93.6 % Fully-insured 5,704,378 6,068,115 (363,737 ) (6.0 )% Specialty 410,986 386,747 24,239 6.3 % Total Commercial 6,115,364 6,454,862 (339,498 ) (5.3 )% Total $ 20,729,182 $ 14,001,591 $ 6,727,591 48.0 % Administrative services fees: Government $ 49,442 $ 50,059 $ (617 ) (1.2 )% Commercial 291,769 209,378 82,391 39.4 % Total $ 341,211 $ 259,437 $ 81,774 31.5 % Income before income taxes: Government $ 513,845 $ 316,676 $ 197,169 62.3 % Commercial 248,240 86,204 162,036 188.0 % Total $ 762,085 $ 402,880 $ 359,205 89.2 % Benefits ratios(a): Government 85.0 % 83.1 % 1.9 % Commercial 81.7 % 83.3 % (1.6 )% Total 84.0 % 83.2 % 0.8 % SG&A expense ratios(b): Government 11.8 % 12.7 % (0.9 )% Commercial 20.0 % 18.5 % 1.5 % Total 14.3 % 15.4 % (1.1 )% (a) Represents total benefit expense as a percentage of premium revenue.

Summary Net income was $487.4 million, or $2.90 per diluted common share, in 2006 compared to $296.7 million, or $1.79 per diluted common share, in 2005. Net income for 2005 included expenses resulting from the physician class action settlement ($44.8 million after taxes, or $0.27 per diluted common share) and costs associated with Hurricane Katrina ($16.9 million after taxes, or $0.10 per diluted common share) described previously. Net income for 2005 also included the beneficial effect of an effective tax rate of approximately 26.3% compared to 36.0% in 2006, primarily due to the resolution of a contingent gain ($22.8 million, or $0.14 per diluted common share) during the first quarter of 2005 in connection with the expiration of the statute of limitations on an uncertain tax position related to the 2000 tax year. After considering litigation and Hurricane Katrina expenses and the favorable tax gain contingency in 2005, the remaining year over year improvement in 2006 results from earnings increases in both the Government and Commercial segments. Premium Revenues and Medical Membership Premium revenues reflect changes in membership and increases in average per member premiums. Items impacting average per member premiums include changes in premium rates as well as changes in the geographic mix of membership, the mix of product offerings, and the mix of benefit plans selected by our membership. Premium revenues increased 48.0% to $20.7 billion for 2006, compared to $14.0 billion for 2005. Higher Government segment premium revenues were partially offset by a decrease in Commercial segment premium revenues. Premium revenues reflect higher enrollment in our Medicare Advantage plans and the addition of our stand-alone PDP business. Government segment premium revenues increased $7.1 billion, or 93.6% to $14.6 billion for 2006, compared to $7.5 billion for 2005. This increase primarily was attributable to the expanded participation in various Medicare products and geographic markets. Sales of our PFFS products drove the majority of the 79.7% 41 Table of Contents increase in Medicare Advantage members since December 31, 2005. At December 31, 2006, approximately 47% of the company Medicare Advantage members were in PFFS plans versus 22% at December 31, 2005. Additionally, our new Medicare stand-alone PDP products added 3,536,600 members and $3.1 billion in new premium revenues during 2006. Medicaid membership increased 111,200 members from December 31, 2005 due primarily to the award of a new Puerto Rico regional ASO contract in the fourth quarter of 2006 partially offset by eligible Puerto Rico Medicaid members choosing to move into the Medicare program. Commercial segment premium revenues decreased 5.3% to $6.1 billion for 2006 compared to $6.5 billion for 2005. Lower premium revenues primarily resulted from a reduction of fully-insured membership. Our fully- insured membership decreased 12.3%, or 245,600 members, to 1,754,200 at December 31, 2006 compared to 1,999,800 at December 31, 2005 primarily as a result of continued attrition within the fully-insured group accounts, partially offset by membership gains from the CHA acquisition, and membership increases in the individual as well as Smart plans and other consumer product lines. Attrition in the fully-insured group accounts results from a competitive pricing environment. Average per member premiums for our fully-insured group medical members increased approximately 5.7% from 2005 to 2006. The average per member premium increase reflects a shift in the mix in our fully-insured group membership from large groups to individuals and small groups as large groups continue to move to an administrative services only offering. Average per member premiums are lower for individuals and small groups than large groups. Administrative Services Fees Our administrative services fees for 2006 were $341.2 million, an increase of $81.8 million, or 31.5%, from $259.4 million for 2005. The increase was due to increases in our Commercial segment administrative services fees. For the Commercial segment, administrative services fees increased $82.4 million, or 39.4%, from $209.4 million for 2005 to $291.8 million for 2006. This increase resulted from increased membership. ASO membership of 1,171,000 members at December 31, 2005 increased 30.6% to 1,529,600 at December 31, 2006. Average per member fees increased approximately 19% in 2006. ASO fees from our Commercial segment represent 86% of total ASO fees. Investment Income Investment income totaled $291.9 million for 2006, an increase of $148.9 million from $143.0 million for 2005. The increase in investment income for 2006 primarily resulted from higher venture capital gains, and higher average invested balances and interest rates. Investment income for 2006 includes $75.7 million in net realized gains related to venture capital investments compared to $5.7 million in 2005. Other Revenue Other revenue totaled $54.3 million for 2006, an increase of $40.2 million from $14.1 million for 2005. The increase primarily was attributable to revenue from our new in-house mail order pharmacy operations in 2006. Benefit Expenses Consolidated benefit expense was $17.4 billion for 2006, an increase of $5.7 billion, or 48.7%, from $11.7 billion for 2005. The increase was primarily driven by the increase in the number of members, particularly higher cost Medicare members, and an increase in average per member claims costs primarily from the effects of health care inflation. The consolidated benefits ratio for 2006 was 84.0%, an 80 basis point increase from 83.2% for 2005. Higher benefit expenses from Hurricane Katrina increased the 2005 benefits ratio 20 basis points. An improvement in the Commercial segment benefits ratio was more than offset by a higher Government segment benefits ratio impacted by the new Medicare stand-alone PDP offerings. 42 Table of Contents The Government segment benefit expenses increased $6.2 billion, or 98.1%, during 2006 compared to 2005. The increase was primarily due to an increase in the number of Medicare members, including those enrolled in our stand-alone PDPs. The Government segment benefits ratio for 2006 was 85.0%, a 190 basis point increase from 2005 of 83.1%. The increase was primarily attributable to the introduction of the stand-alone PDPs in January 2006 with a benefits ratio of 92.5% for 2006. The stand-alone PDP benefits ratio was negatively impacted by a benefits ratio in our Complete plan of 115.9% for 2006, one of three stand-alone PDP offerings representing approximately 12% of our stand-alone PDP members. The Commercial segment benefit expenses decreased $382.3 million, or 7.1%, from 2005 to 2006. This decrease primarily results from the decrease in fully-insured group membership partially offset by the increase in average per member claims costs. The increase in average per member claims costs for fully-insured group members was approximately 6% for 2006. The benefits ratio for the Commercial segment of 81.7% in 2006 decreased 160 basis points from the 2005 benefits ratio of 83.3%. Higher benefit expenses from Hurricane Katrina increased the 2005 benefits ratio 30 basis points. The decrease in the benefits ratio primarily reflects improving medical cost utilization trends and an increase in the percentage of individual and small group members comprising our total fully-insured block. Individual and smaller group accounts generally carry a lower benefits ratio than larger group accounts. SG&A Expense Consolidated SG&A expenses increased $825.9 million, or 37.6%, during 2006 compared to 2005. The increase primarily resulted from an increase in the number of employees and increased sales and marketing costs due to the Medicare expansion offset by prior year litigation expenses which did not recur in 2006. The number of employees increased by 3,600 to 22,300 from 18,700 at December 31, 2005, primarily in the customer service and marketing functions associated with the growth in the Medicare business. The consolidated SG&A expense ratio for 2006 was 14.3%, decreasing 110 basis points from 15.4% for 2005. Expenses related to the litigation settlement increased the SG&A expense ratio 50 basis points for 2005. After considering the effects of the litigation settlement, the remaining decrease resulted from growth in revenues from higher average medical membership outpacing the related increase in administrative spending on a consolidated basis during 2006. Our Government and Commercial segments bear both direct and shared indirect overhead SG&A expenses. We allocate the indirect overhead expenses shared by the two segments primarily as a function of revenues. As a result, the profitability of each segment is interdependent. Government segment SG&A expenses of $1,730.2 million for 2006 increased $766.9 million, or 79.6%, from 2005. The increase primarily resulted from higher expenses associated with the infrastructure build out of our expanded Medicare offerings in the latter half of 2005 through the first half of 2006 as well as increased sales and marketing costs in 2006 also related to the Medicare expansion. The Government segment SG&A expense ratio decreased 90 basis points from 12.7% for 2005 to 11.8% for 2006. Expenses related to the litigation settlement increased the SG&A expense ratio 50 basis points for 2005. After considering the effect of the litigation, the decrease from 2005 to 2006 resulted from average membership and related revenue associated with the Medicare expansion reaching the levels contemplated by the now complete build-out of infrastructure and support functions which began in the latter half of 2005, providing more leverage against administrative costs in 2006. The Commercial segment SG&A expenses increased $59.0 million, or 4.8%, during 2006 compared to 2005. The Commercial segment SG&A expense ratio of 20.0% for 2006 increased 150 basis points from 18.5% 43 Table of Contents for 2005. Expenses related to the litigation settlement increased the SG&A expense ratio 60 basis points for 2005. After considering the effect of the litigation, the increase primarily resulted from an increase in the percentage of small group members comprising our total fully-insured membership as well as the continued shift in the mix of membership towards ASO. At December 31, 2005, 37% of our Commercial segment medical membership related to ASO business compared to 47% at December 31, 2006. Small group accounts bear a higher SG&A ratio than larger group accounts and ASO business bears a significantly higher SG&A ratio than fully-insured business. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization for 2006 totaled $148.6 million compared to $128.9 million in 2005, an increase of $19.7 million, or 15.3%. The increase resulted primarily from capital expenditures related to the Medicare expansion. Interest Expense Interest expense was $63.1 million for 2006, compared to $39.3 million for 2005, an increase of $23.8 million. This increase primarily resulted from higher average outstanding debt and higher interest rates. Income Taxes Our effective tax rate for 2006 of 36.0% increased 9.7% compared to the 26.3% effective tax rate for 2005. The higher effective tax rate for 2006 is primarily due to the resolution of a contingent tax gain of $22.8 million in the first quarter of 2005 in connection with the expiration of the statute of limitations on an uncertain tax position related to the 2000 tax year which did not recur in 2006. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for a complete reconciliation of the federal statutory rate to the effective tax rate. Liquidity Our primary sources of cash include receipts of premiums, ASO fees, investment income, as well as proceeds from the sale or maturity of our investment securities and from borrowings. Our primary uses of cash include disbursements for claims payments, SG&A expenses, interest expense, taxes, purchases of investment securities, acquisitions, capital expenditures, and payments on borrowings. Because premiums generally are collected in advance of claim payments by a period of up to several months in many instances, our business normally should produce positive cash flows during periods of increasing enrollment. Conversely, cash flows would be negatively impacted during periods of decreasing enrollment. We have experienced improving operating cash flows associated with growth in Medicare enrollment. The use of operating cash flows may be limited by regulatory requirements which require, among other items, that our regulated subsidiaries maintain minimum levels of capital. Cash and cash equivalents increased to $2,040.5 million at December 31, 2007 from $1,740.3 million at December 31, 2006. The change in cash and cash equivalents for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 is summarized as follows: 2007 2006 2005 (in thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,224,262 $ 1,686,712 $ 610,082 Net cash used in investing activities (1,845,391 ) (1,654,066 ) (767,276 ) Net cash provided by financing activities 921,278 975,642 309,131 Increase in cash and cash equivalents $ 300,149 $ 1,008,288 $ 151,937 44 Table of Contents Cash Flow from Operating Activities The decrease in operating cash flows for 2007 resulted from timing of cash flows associated with our Medicare Part D offerings, offset by Medicare enrollment growth and improved earnings. During 2007, we paid $725.5 million to CMS under the risk corridor terms of our 2006 contracts with CMS. Similarly, the provision for net amounts payable under the risk corridor terms of our 2007 contracts with CMS, which will be paid in 2008, was $102.6 million. The increase in operating cash flows for 2006 compared to 2005 resulted from Medicare enrollment growth, improved earnings, and the timing of cash flows associated with our Medicare Part D offerings which were new beginning January 1, 2006. Our 2006 Part D results related to both stand-alone PDP and MA-PD offerings reflected provisions for net amounts payable to CMS under the risk corridor terms of our contracts with CMS. This risk corridor amount, which was paid in 2007 as discussed above, reflects favorable experience on allowable risk corridor costs during the second half of 2006 compared to the expectations set out in our original annual bid for 2006 contracts with CMS. The favorable experience was associated with the Medicare Part D portion of our MA-PD offerings as well as our Standard and Enhanced stand-alone plans. Comparisons of our operating cash flows also are impacted by other changes in our working capital. The most significant drivers of changes in our working capital are typically the timing of receipts for premiums and ASO fees and payments of benefit expenses. We illustrate these changes with the following summaries of receivables and benefits payable. The detail of total net receivables was as follows at December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005: Change 2007 2006 2005 2007 2006 (in thousands) Military services: Base receivable $ 404,570 $ 452,509 $ 509,444 $ (47,939 ) $ (56,935 ) Change orders 5,168 4,247 32,285 921 (28,038 ) Military services subtotal 409,738 456,756 541,729 (47,018 ) (84,973 ) Medicare 137,345 143,875 66,536 (6,530 ) 77,339 Commercial and other 126,718 125,899 162,944 819 (37,045 ) Allowance for doubtful accounts (68,260 ) (45,589 ) (32,557 ) (22,671 ) (13,032 ) Total net receivables $ 605,541 $ 680,941 $ 738,652 (75,400 ) (57,711 ) Reconciliation to cash flow statement: Provision for doubtful accounts 28,922 20,901 Receivables from acquisition (14,267 ) (843 ) Change in receivables per cash flow statement resulting in cash from operations $ (60,745 ) $ (37,653 ) Military services base receivables consist of estimated claims owed from the federal government for health care services provided to beneficiaries and underwriting fees. The claim reimbursement component of military services base receivables is generally collected over a three to four month period. The timing of claim reimbursements resulted in the decrease in base receivables from 2006 to 2007 as well as from 2005 to 2006. The $28.0 million decrease in military services change order receivables from 2005 to 2006 resulted from the collection of receivables in 2006 related to an equitable adjustment to the contract price negotiated in late 2005 for services not originally specified in the contract. 45 Table of Contents Despite significant growth in Medicare, Medicare receivables declined $6.5 million from 2006 to 2007 due to the net collection of receivables associated with the CMS risk adjustment model. Likewise, the $77.3 million increase in Medicare receivables from 2005 to 2006 resulted from an increase in receivables associated with the CMS risk adjustment model. The decline in Commercial and other receivables from 2005 to 2006 resulted from the change in the mix of members from fully-insured to ASO. The $22.7 million increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts from 2006 to 2007 resulted from the growth of the Medicare business. The detail of benefits payable was as follows at December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005: Change 2007 2006 2005 2007 2006 (in thousands) IBNR(1) $ 1,712,599 $ 1,600,198 $ 1,013,949 $ 112,401 $ 586,249 Military services benefits payable(2) 341,372 430,674 514,426 (89,302 ) (83,752 ) Reported claims in process(3) 91,938 98,033 67,065 (6,095 ) 30,968 Other benefits payable(4) 550,924 281,502 253,702 269,422 27,800 Total benefits payable $ 2,696,833 $ 2,410,407 $ 1,849,142 286,426 561,265 Reconciliation to cash flow statement: Benefits payable from acquisition (41,029 ) (21,198 ) Change in benefits payable in cash flow statement resulting in cash from operations $ 245,397 $ 540,067 (1) IBNR represents an estimate of benefits payable for claims incurred but not reported (IBNR) at the balance sheet date. The level of IBNR is primarily impacted by membership levels, medical claim trends and the receipt cycle time, which represents the length of time between when a claim is initially incurred and when the claim form is received (i.e. a shorter time span results in a lower IBNR). (2) Military services benefits payable primarily results from the timing of the cost of providing health care services to beneficiaries and the related reimbursement by the federal government as more fully described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. A corresponding receivable is included in the base receivable in the previous receivables table. (3) Reported claims in process represents the estimated valuation of processed claims that are in the post claim adjudication process, which consists of administrative functions such as audit and check batching and handling. (4) Other benefits payable includes capitation and pharmacy payables. The balance due to our pharmacy benefit administrator fluctuates due to bi-weekly payments and the month-end cutoff. Benefits payable increased during 2007 and 2006 primarily due to growth in Medicare membership and to a lesser extent medical claims inflation. Cash Flow from Investing Activities We reinvested a portion of our operating cash flows over the last several years in investment securities, primarily short-duration fixed income securities, totaling $430.1 million in 2007, $862.1 million in 2006, and $233.3 million in 2005. Our ongoing capital expenditures primarily relate to our information technology initiatives and administrative facilities necessary for activities such as claims processing, billing and collections, medical utilization review, and customer service. Total capital expenditures, excluding acquisitions, were $239.2 million in 2007, $193.2 million in 2006, and $165.8 million in 2005. The increased spending in 2007 primarily resulted from the 46 Table of Contents purchase of three medical centers which were previously leased in South Florida in the first quarter of 2007 for approximately $20.4 million. The increased spending in 2006 and 2005 primarily resulted from our Medicare expansion initiatives. Excluding acquisitions, we expect total capital expenditures in 2008 of approximately $275 million. During 2007, we paid $369.1 million to acquire CompBenefits, $156.3 million to acquire KMG, and $27.0 million to acquire DefenseWeb. These amounts include $58.9 million of cash acquired. During 2006, we paid $65.8 million to acquire CHA Health, including $43.5 million of cash acquired, and we paid $5.8 million to settle the purchase price contingencies associated with prior year acquisitions. During 2005, net of cash acquired, we paid $444.9 million to acquire CarePlus, and $54.0 million to acquire Corphealth. These amounts include $96.1 million of cash acquired. Cash Flow from Financing Activities During 2007, our net borrowings of $350 million under our credit agreements related to the financing of the CompBenefits and KMG acquisitions. During 2006, our borrowings of $550 million and repayments of $300 million under our credit agreements related to the timing of our senior notes issuance and repayment, and funding of additional capital into certain subsidiaries during 2006 in conjunction with growth in Medicare revenues. During 2005, we borrowed $494 million under our credit agreement related to the financing of the CarePlus acquisition, a portion of which was repaid in 2005. During 2006, we issued $500 million of 6.45% senior notes due June 1, 2016. Our net proceeds, reduced for the discount and cost of the offering were $494.3 million. We used the proceeds from the offering for the repayment of the outstanding balance under our credit agreement, which at the time of the issuance was $200 million, and the repayment of our $300 million 7.25% senior notes which matured on August 1, 2006. Receipts from CMS associated with Medicare Part D claim subsidies were $185.1 million less than the corresponding claim payments during 2007 and $122.3 million less than the corresponding claim payments during 2006. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further description. The remainder of financing activities in 2007, 2006, and 2005 resulted primarily from the change in the securities lending payable, proceeds from stock option exercises, the tax benefit from stock compensation, and the change in the book overdraft. The increase in securities lending in 2007 and 2006 coincides with higher average balances of investments to lend and a change in lending terms during 2006. In connection with employee stock plans, we acquired common shares totaling 406,377 in 2007, 467,767 in 2006, and 68,296 in 2005 for an aggregate cost of $27.4 million in 2007, $26.2 million in 2006, and $2.4 million in 2005. On February 21, 2008, the Board of Directors authorized the use of up to $150 million for the repurchase of our common shares exclusive of shares repurchased in connection with employee stock plans. Senior Notes We previously issued in the public debt capital markets, $300 million aggregate principal amount of 6.30% senior unsecured notes that mature on August 1, 2018 and $500 million aggregate principal amount of 6.45% senior unsecured notes that mature on June 1, 2016. We have entered into interest rate swap agreements to exchange the fixed interest rate under these senior notes for a variable interest rate based on LIBOR. Our senior notes and related swap agreements are more fully discussed in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Credit Agreement Our 5-year $1.0 billion unsecured revolving credit agreement expires in July 2011. Under the credit agreement, at our option, we can borrow on either a revolving credit basis or a competitive advance basis. The revolving credit portion bears interest at either a fixed rate or floating rate based on LIBOR plus a spread. The 47 Table of Contents spread, which varies depending on our credit ratings, ranges from 27 to 80 basis points. We also pay an annual facility fee regardless of utilization. This facility fee, currently 10 basis points, may fluctuate between 8 and 20 basis points, depending upon our credit ratings. In addition, a utilization fee of 10 basis points is payable for each day in which borrowings under the facility exceed 50% of the total $1 billion commitment. The competitive advance portion of any borrowings will bear interest at market rates prevailing at the time of borrowing on either a fixed rate or a floating rate basis, at our option. The credit agreement contains customary restrictive and financial covenants as well as customary events of default, including financial covenants regarding the maintenance of a minimum level of net worth and a maximum leverage ratio. The terms of the credit agreement also include standard provisions related to conditions of borrowing, including a customary material adverse effect clause which could limit our ability to borrow additional funds. We have not experienced a material adverse effect, and we know of no circumstances or events which would be reasonably likely to result in a material adverse effect. At this time, we do not believe the material adverse effect clause poses a material funding risk to us. At December 31, 2007, we had $800 million of borrowings under the credit agreement outstanding at an interest rate, which varies with LIBOR, of 5.30%. In addition, we have outstanding letters of credit of $2.0 million secured under the credit agreement. No amounts have ever been drawn on these letters of credit. As of December 31, 2007, we had $198.0 million of remaining borrowing capacity under the credit agreement. We have other customary, arms-length relationships, including financial advisory and banking, with some parties to the credit agreement. Other Long-Term Borrowings Other long-term borrowings of $38.6 million at December 31, 2007 represent junior subordinated debt assumed in the KMG acquisition of $36.1 million and financing for the renovation of a building of $2.5 million. The junior subordinated debt, which is due in 2037, may be called by us in 2012 and bears a fixed annual interest rate of 8.02% payable quarterly until 2012, and then payable at a floating rate based on LIBOR plus 310 basis points. The debt associated with the building renovation bears interest at 2.00%, is collateralized by the building, and is payable in various installments through 2014. Shelf Registration We have a universal shelf registration statement filed with the SEC which allows us to sell our debt or equity securities, from time to time, with the amount, price and terms to be determined at the time of the sale. The net proceeds from any future sales of our securities under the universal shelf registration may be used for our operations and for other general corporate purposes, including repayment or refinancing of borrowings, working capital, capital expenditures, investments, acquisitions, or the repurchase of our outstanding securities. Liquidity Requirements We believe our cash balances, investment securities, operating cash flows, access to debt and equity markets, and borrowing capacity, taken together, provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating and regulatory requirements, to fund future expansion opportunities and capital expenditures in the foreseeable future, and to refinance debt as it matures. Adverse changes in our credit rating may increase the rate of interest we pay and may impact the amount of credit available to us in the future. Our investment-grade credit rating at December 31, 2007 was Baa3 according to Moody Investors Services, Inc., or Moody s, and BBB, according to Standard & Poor Ratings Services, or S&P. A downgrade to Ba2 or lower by Moody and BB or lower by S&P would give the counterparties of three of our interest rate swap agreements with a $300 million notional amount, the right, but not the obligation, to cancel the interest rate swap agreement. If cancelled, we would pay or receive an amount based on the fair market value of the 48 Table of Contents swap agreement. Assuming these swap agreements had been cancelled on December 31, 2007, we would have received $18.3 million, net, and future net interest payments would increase assuming LIBOR does not change. Other than the swap agreements, adverse changes in our credit ratings do not create, increase, or accelerate any liabilities. In addition, we operate as a holding company in a highly regulated industry. Our parent company is dependent upon dividends and administrative expense reimbursements from our subsidiaries, most of which are subject to regulatory restrictions. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at the parent company increased $111.3 million to $535.7 million at December 31, 2007 compared to $424.4 million at December 31, 2006 reflecting dividends received net of funding of additional capital into certain subsidiaries during 2007 in conjunction with growth in Medicare revenues. See Schedule I to this Form 10-K beginning on page 107 for our parent company only financial information. Regulatory Requirements Certain of our subsidiaries operate in states that regulate the payment of dividends, loans, or other cash transfers to Humana Inc., our parent company, and require minimum levels of equity as well as limit investments to approved securities. The amount of dividends that may be paid to Humana Inc. by these subsidiaries, without prior approval by state regulatory authorities, is limited based on the entity level of statutory income and statutory capital and surplus. In most states, prior notification is provided before paying a dividend even if approval is not required. Based on the most recent statutory financial statements as of December 31, 2007, we maintained aggregate statutory capital and surplus of $2,905.2 million in our state regulated subsidiaries. This compares to applicable statutory requirements which aggregated $1,810.5 million. Although the minimum required levels of equity are largely based on premium volume, product mix, and the quality of assets held, minimum requirements can vary significantly at the state level. Given our anticipated continued premium growth in 2008, capital requirements will increase. We expect to fund these increased requirements with capital contributions from Humana Inc., our parent company, of approximately $200 million in 2008. Most states rely on risk-based capital requirements, or RBC, to define their required levels of equity discussed above. RBC is a model developed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners to monitor an entity solvency. This calculation indicates recommended minimum levels of required capital and surplus and signals regulatory measures should actual surplus fall below these recommended levels. If RBC were adopted by the remaining states and Puerto Rico at December 31, 2007, we would have $966.3 million of aggregate capital and surplus above any of the levels that require corrective action under RBC, or individual state requirements based on the most recent statutory financial statements as of December 31, 2007. Contractual Obligations We are contractually obligated to make payments for years subsequent to December 31, 2007 as follows: Payments Due by Period Total Less than 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More than 5 Years (in thousands) Debt $ 1,638,608 $ $ 1,620 $ 800,614 $ 836,374 Interest(1) 712,307 94,200 188,369 165,313 264,425 Operating leases(2) 417,814 107,878 176,318 85,779 47,839 Purchase obligations(3) 180,088 57,821 74,210 35,101 12,956 Future policy benefits payable and other long-term liabilities(4) 757,049 93,106 77,805 586,138 Total $ 3,705,866 $ 259,899 $ 533,623 $ 1,164,612 $ 1,747,732 (1) Interest includes the estimated contractual interest payments under our debt agreements net of the effect of the associated swap agreements assuming no change in the LIBOR rate as of December 31, 2007. 49 Table of Contents (2) We lease facilities, computer hardware, and other equipment under long-term operating leases that are noncancelable and expire on various dates through 2018. We sublease facilities or partial facilities to third party tenants for space not used in our operations which partially mitigates our operating lease commitments. An operating lease, accounted for under the provisions of SFAS No. 13, Accounting for Leases , is a type of off-balance sheet arrangement. Assuming we acquired the asset, rather than leased such asset, we would have recognized a liability for the financing of these assets. See also Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. (3) Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase services, primarily information technology related services, or to make improvements to real estate, in each case that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum levels of service to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the appropriate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty. (4) Excludes future policy benefits payable ceded to third parties through a 100% coinsurance agreement as more fully described in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. The reinsurance carrier, not us, is responsible for cash flows associated with the reinsured contract. Our reinsured reserves are supported by reinsurance recoverables included in other long-term assets. Our potential liability is limited to the credit exposure which exists should the reinsurer be unable to meet its obligations assumed under these reinsurance arrangements. We evaluate the financial condition of these reinsurers on a regular basis. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As part of our ongoing business, we do not participate or knowingly seek to participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities (SPEs), which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. As of December 31, 2007, we are not involved in any SPE transactions. Guarantees and Indemnifications Through indemnity agreements approved by the state regulatory authorities, certain of our regulated subsidiaries generally are guaranteed by Humana Inc., our parent company, in the event of insolvency for (1) member coverage for which premium payment has been made prior to insolvency; (2) benefits for members then hospitalized until discharged; and (3) payment to providers for services rendered prior to insolvency. Our parent also has guaranteed the obligations of our military services subsidiaries. In the ordinary course of business, we enter into contractual arrangements under which we may agree to indemnify a third party to such arrangement from any losses incurred relating to the services they perform on behalf of us, or for losses arising from certain events as defined within the particular contract, which may include, for example, litigation or claims relating to past performance. Such indemnification obligations may not be subject to maximum loss clauses. Historically, payments made related to these indemnifications have been immaterial. Related Parties No related party transactions had a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. Certain related party transactions not having a material effect are discussed in our Proxy Statement for the meeting to be held April 24, 2008 see Certain Transactions with Management and Others. Government Contracts Our Medicare business, which accounted for approximately 60% of our total premiums and ASO fees for the year ended December 31, 2007, primarily consisted of products covered under the Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D Prescription Drug Plan contracts with the federal government. These contracts are renewed 50 Table of Contents generally for a one-year term each December 31 unless CMS notifies Humana of its decision not to renew by August 1 of the year in which the contract would end, or Humana notifies CMS of its decision not to renew by the first Monday in June of the year in which the contract would end. All material contracts between Humana and CMS relating to our Medicare business have been renewed for 2008. Our military business, which accounted for approximately 12% of our total premiums and ASO fees for the year ended December 31, 2007, primarily consisted of the TRICARE South Region contract. The 5-year South Region contract, which expires March 31, 2009, is subject to annual renewals on April 1 of each year at the government option. Effective April 1, 2007, the South Region contract was extended into the fourth option period, which runs from April 1, 2007 to March 31, 2008. We have received a notice from the government of its intent to renew the fifth option period which runs from April 1, 2008 to March 31, 2009. The Department of Defense has the option to extend the current contract for up to six months under existing terms. Congressional authority has also been granted to extend the contract in one year increments for a maximum of two additional years. In the second quarter of 2007, a draft solicitation related to the new TRICARE contracts, currently scheduled to begin April 1, 2009, was issued for industry comment. Currently, we are anticipating a formal request for proposal, or RFP, for the TRICARE contracts. As required under the contract, the target underwritten health care cost and underwriting fee amounts for the fourth option period were negotiated. Any variance from the target health care cost is shared with the federal government. Accordingly, events and circumstances not contemplated in the negotiated target health care cost amount could have a material adverse effect on our business. These changes may include, for example, an increase or reduction in the number of persons enrolled or eligible to enroll due to the federal government decision to increase or decrease U.S. military deployments. In the event government reimbursements were to decline from projected amounts, our failure to reduce the health care costs associated with these programs could have a material adverse effect on our business. In October 2007, we were awarded the Department of Veterans Affairs first specialty network demonstration project, known as Project HERO (Healthcare Effectiveness through Resource Optimization), to support healthcare delivery to veterans. The contract is comprised of one base period and four one-year option periods subject to annual renewals at the federal government option, with services beginning January 1, 2008. Our Medicaid business, which accounted for approximately 2% of our total premiums and ASO fees for the year ended December 31, 2007, consisted of contracts in Puerto Rico and Florida, with the vast majority in Puerto Rico. Our Medicaid contracts with the Puerto Rico Health Insurance Administration for the East and Southeast regions of Puerto Rico are effective from November 1, 2006 through June 30, 2008. In 2007, we also entered into an ASO contract with the Puerto Rico Health Administration for the Metro North Region which is effective from November 1, 2006 through October 31, 2009. The loss of any of the contracts above or significant changes in these programs as a result of legislative action, including reductions in premium payments to us, or increases in member benefits without corresponding increases in premium payments to us, may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements and accompanying notes requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We continuously evaluate our estimates and those critical accounting policies related primarily to benefit expenses and revenue recognition as well as accounting for impairments related to our investment securities, goodwill, and long-lived assets. These estimates are based on knowledge of current events and anticipated future events, and accordingly, actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates. We believe the following critical accounting policies involve the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. 51 Table of Contents Benefit Expense Recognition Benefit expenses are recognized in the period in which services are provided and include an estimate of the cost of services which have been incurred but not yet reported, or IBNR. IBNR represents a substantial portion of our benefits payable as follows: December 31, 2007 Percentage of Total December 31, 2006 Percentage of Total (dollars in thousands) IBNR $ 1,712,599 63.5 % $ 1,600,198 66.4 % Reported claims in process 91,938 3.4 % 98,033 4.0 % Other benefits payable 550,924 20.4 % 281,502 11.7 % Benefits payable, excluding military services 2,355,461 87.3 % 1,979,733 82.1 % Military services benefits payable 341,372 12.7 % 430,674 17.9 % Total benefits payable $ 2,696,833 100.0 % $ 2,410,407 100.0 % Military services benefits payable primarily consists of our estimate of incurred healthcare services provided to beneficiaries which are in turn reimbursed by the federal government as more fully described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. This amount is generally offset by a corresponding receivable due from the federal government, as more fully-described on page 45. Estimating IBNR is complex and involves a significant amount of judgment. Changes in this estimate can materially affect, either favorably or unfavorably, our results of operations and overall financial position. Accordingly, it represents a critical accounting estimate. Most benefit claims are paid within a few months of the member receiving service from a physician or other health care provider. As a result, these liabilities generally are described as having a short-tail . As such, we expect that substantially all of the December 31, 2007 estimate of benefits payable will be known and paid during 2008. Our reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best point estimate within a level of confidence required by actuarial standards. Actuarial standards of practice generally require a level of confidence such that the liabilities established for IBNR have a greater probability of being adequate versus being insufficient, or such that the liabilities established for IBNR are sufficient to cover obligations under an assumption of moderately adverse conditions. Adverse conditions are situations in which the actual claims are expected to be higher than the otherwise estimated value of such claims at the time of the estimate. Therefore, in many situations, the claim amounts ultimately settled will be less than the estimate that satisfies the actuarial standards of practice. We develop our estimate for IBNR using actuarial methodologies and assumptions, primarily based upon historical claim experience. Depending on the period for which incurred claims are estimated, we apply a different method in determining our estimate. For periods prior to the most recent three months, the key assumption used in estimating our IBNR is that the completion factor pattern remains consistent over a rolling 12-month period after adjusting for known changes in claim inventory levels and known changes in claim payment processes. Completion factors result from the calculation of the percentage of claims incurred during a given period that have historically been adjudicated as of the reporting period. For the most recent three months, the incurred claims are estimated primarily from a trend analysis based upon per member per month claims trends developed from our historical experience in the preceding months, adjusted for known changes in estimates of recent hospital and drug utilization data, provider contracting changes, changes in benefit levels, changes in member cost sharing, product mix, and weekday seasonality. The completion factor method is used for the months of incurred claims prior to the most recent three months because the historical percentage of claims processed for those months is at a level sufficient to produce a 52 Table of Contents consistently reliable result. Conversely, for the most recent three months of incurred claims, the volume of claims processed historically is not at a level sufficient to produce a reliable result, which therefore requires us to examine historical trend patterns as the primary method of evaluation. Changes in claim processes, including receipt cycle times, claim inventory levels, recoveries of overpayments, outsourcing, system conversions, and processing disruptions due to weather or other events affect views regarding the reasonable choice of completion factors. The receipt cycle time measures the average length of time between when a medical claim was initially incurred and when the claim form was received. Increased electronic claim submissions from providers have decreased the receipt cycle time over the last few years. For example, the average receipt cycle time has decreased from 16.5 days in 2005 to 15.6 days in 2007 which represents a 5.5% reduction in cycle time over the three year period. Medical cost trends potentially are more volatile than other segments of the economy. The drivers of medical cost trends include increases in the utilization of hospital facilities, physician services, prescription drugs, and new medical technologies, as well as the inflationary effect on the cost per unit of each of these expense components. Other external factors such as government-mandated benefits or other regulatory changes, increases in medical services capacity, direct to consumer advertising for prescription drugs and medical services, an aging population, catastrophes, and epidemics also may impact medical cost trends. Internal factors such as system conversions, claims processing cycle times, changes in medical management practices and changes in provider contracts also may impact our ability to accurately predict estimates of historical completion factors or medical cost trends. All of these factors are considered in estimating IBNR and in estimating the per member per month claims trend for purposes of determining the reserve for the most recent three months. Additionally, we continually prepare and review follow-up studies to assess the reasonableness of the estimates generated by our process and methods over time. The results of these studies are also considered in determining the reserve for the most recent three months. Each of these factors requires significant judgment by management. The completion and claims per member per month trend factors are the most significant factors impacting the IBNR estimate. The portion of IBNR estimated using completion factors for claims incurred prior to the most recent three months is less variable than the portion of IBNR estimated using trend factors. The following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors assuming moderate adverse experience and the estimated potential impact on our operating results caused by reasonably likely changes in these factors based on December 31, 2007 data: Completion Factor(a): Claims Trend Factor(b): Factor Change Increase (Decrease) in Benefits Payable Factor Change (Decrease) Increase in Benefits Payable (dollars in thousands) 1.50% $ (172,100 ) (10%) $ (399,700 ) 1.00% $ (114,700 ) (8%) $ (319,700 ) 0.50% $ (57,400 ) (6%) $ (239,800 ) 0.25% $ (28,700 ) (4%) $ (159,900 ) (0.50%) $ 57,400 (2%) $ (79,900 ) (1.00%) $ 114,700 2% $ 79,900 (a) Reflects estimated potential changes in benefits payable caused by changes in completion factors for incurred months prior to the most recent three months. (b) Reflects estimated potential changes in benefits payable caused by changes in annualized claims trend used for the estimation of per member per month incurred claims for the most recent three months. 53 Table of Contents The following table provides a historical perspective regarding the accrual and payment of our benefits payable, excluding military services. Components of the total incurred claims for each year include amounts accrued for current year estimated benefit expenses as well as adjustments to prior year estimated accruals. 2007 2006 2005 (in thousands) Balances at January 1 $ 1,979,733 $ 1,334,716 $ 1,074,310 Acquisitions 41,029 21,198 37,375 Incurred related to: Current year 18,015,247 15,374,855 9,635,435 Prior years (242,922 ) (178,998 ) (72,868 ) Total incurred 17,772,325 15,195,857 9,562,567 Paid related to: Current year (16,012,828 ) (13,532,139 ) (8,392,628 ) Prior years (1,424,798 ) (1,039,899 ) (946,908 ) Total paid (17,437,626 ) (14,572,038 ) (9,339,536 ) Balances at December 31 $ 2,355,461 $ 1,979,733 $ 1,334,716 Amounts incurred related to prior years vary from previously estimated liabilities as the claims ultimately are settled. Negative amounts reported for incurred related to prior years result from claims being ultimately settled for amounts less than originally estimated (favorable development). As summarized in the previous table, claim reserve balances at December 31, 2006 ultimately settled during 2007 for $242.9 million less than the amounts originally estimated. During 2006, claim reserve balances at December 31, 2005 ultimately settled for $179.0 million less than the amounts originally estimated. The $63.9 million change in the amounts incurred related to prior years for 2007 as compared to 2006 primarily relates to favorable development experienced in our Medicare operations. As previously described, our key assumptions consist of trend factors and completion factors using an assumption of moderately adverse conditions. In our Medicare operations, both our trend factor and completion factor assumptions at December 31, 2006 ultimately developed favorable versus our original estimate primarily due to changes in estimates associated with our 2006 Medicare Part D reconciliation and the growth in our Medicare business. First year Medicare Part D enrollment and eligibility issues in 2006 led to actual claim settlements with other health plans and states during 2007 for amounts less than originally estimated. Similar adjustments in the future are not expected to be as significant due to the program operational improvement in 2007. During 2006, claim reserve balances at December 31, 2005 ultimately settled during 2006 for $179.0 million less than the amounts originally estimated. During 2005, claim reserve balances at December 31, 2004 ultimately settled for $72.9 million less than the amounts originally estimated. This $106.1 million change in the amounts incurred related to prior years for 2006 as compared to 2005 primarily was attributable to both our Medicare and commercial lines of business. In each of these lines of business, both our trend factor and completion factor assumptions at December 31, 2005 ultimately developed favorable versus our original estimate primarily due to (1) the utilization of hospital and physician services during the latter half of 2005 ultimately being lower than estimated, (2) the impact of hurricanes in Florida and Louisiana in the second half of 2005 on both utilization of services and claims processing, (3) significant growth in our Medicare PFFS product, (4) reductions in receipt cycle times driven by an increase in electronic claims submissions, and (5) an increase in claim overpayment recovery levels versus our historical overpayment recovery rate. 54 Table of Contents Benefit expenses associated with the TRICARE contract and provisions associated with future policy benefits excluded from the previous table were as follows for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005: 2007 2006 2005 (in thousands) TRICARE $ 2,481,814 $ 2,208,033 $ 2,060,528 Future policy benefits 16,392 17,314 28,375 Total $ 2,498,206 $ 2,225,347 $ 2,088,903 Future policy benefits payable of $980.7 million and $320.6 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, represent liabilities for long-duration insurance policies including life insurance, annuities and health policies sold to individuals for which some of the premium received in the earlier years is intended to pay anticipated benefits to be incurred in future years. These reserves are recognized on a net level premium method based on interest, mortality, morbidity, withdrawal and maintenance expense assumptions from published actuarial tables, modified based upon actual experience. Changes in estimates of these reserves are recognized as an adjustment to benefit expenses in the period the changes occur. Future policy benefits payable of $239.7 million at December 31, 2007 and $242.7 million at December 31, 2006 are subject to 100% coinsurance agreements as more fully described in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, and as such are offset by a related reinsurance recoverable included in other long-term assets. Long-duration insurance policies associated with the KMG acquisition increased the balance in future policy benefits payable at December 31, 2007 compared to December 31, 2006. As previously discussed, our reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best estimate of our ultimate liability for claims. Actuarial standards require the use of assumptions based on moderately adverse experience, which generally results in favorable reserve development, or reserves that are considered redundant. An increase in the absolute dollar amount of redundancy over the last three years primarily has resulted from the growth in our Medicare business, coupled with the application of consistent reserving practices. When we recognize a release of the redundancy, we disclose the amount that is not in the ordinary course of business, if material. We believe we have consistently applied our methodology in determining our best estimate for benefits payable. Revenue Recognition We generally establish one-year commercial membership contracts with employer groups, subject to cancellation by the employer group on 30-day written notice. Our Medicare contracts with CMS renew annually. Our military services contracts with the federal government and our contracts with various state Medicaid programs generally are multi-year contracts subject to annual renewal provisions. Our commercial contracts establish rates on a per member basis for each month of coverage. Our Medicare and Medicaid contracts also establish monthly rates per member. However, our Medicare contracts also have additional provisions as outlined in the following separate section. Premium revenues and ASO fees are estimated by multiplying the membership covered under the various contracts by the contractual rates. In addition, we adjust revenues for estimated changes in an employer enrollment and individuals that ultimately may fail to pay. Enrollment changes not yet reported by an employer group, an individual, or the government, also known as retroactive membership adjustments, are estimated based on available data and historical trends. We routinely monitor the collectibility of specific accounts, the aging of receivables, historical retroactivity trends, as well as prevailing and anticipated economic conditions, and reflect any required adjustments in the current period revenue. We bill and collect premium and administrative fee remittances from employer groups and members in our Medicare and individual products monthly. We receive monthly premiums and administrative fees from the 55 Table of Contents federal government and various states according to government specified reimbursement rates and various contractual terms. Changes in revenues from CMS for our Medicare products resulting from the periodic changes in risk adjustment scores for our membership are recognized when the amounts become determinable and the collectibility is reasonably assured. Medicare Part D Provisions On January 1, 2006, we began covering prescription drug benefits in accordance with Medicare Part D under multiple contracts with CMS. The payments we receive monthly from CMS and members, which are determined from our annual bid, represent amounts for providing prescription drug insurance coverage. We recognize premium revenues for providing this insurance coverage ratably over the term of our annual contract. Our CMS payment is subject to risk sharing through the Medicare Part D risk corridor provisions. In addition, we receive and disburse amounts for portions of prescription drug costs for which we are not at risk, as described more fully below. The risk corridor provisions compare costs targeted in our bids to actual prescription drug costs, limited to actual costs that would have been incurred under the standard coverage as defined by CMS. Variances exceeding certain thresholds may result in CMS making additional payments to us or require us to refund to CMS a portion of the premiums we received. We estimate and recognize an adjustment to premium revenues related to these risk corridor provisions based upon pharmacy claims experience to date as if the annual contract were to terminate at the end of the reporting period. Accordingly, this estimate provides no consideration to future pharmacy claims experience. We record a receivable or payable at the contract level and classify the amount as current or long-term in the consolidated balance sheets based on the expected settlement. The estimate of the settlement associated with risk corridor provisions requires us to consider factors that may not be certain, including, among others, member eligibility differences with CMS. In 2007, we paid $725.5 million related to our reconciliation with CMS regarding the 2006 Medicare Part D risk corridor provisions compared to our estimate of $738.7 million at December 31, 2006. 2006 marked the first year of providing for the risk corridor estimate and required us to consider factors which were not certain, including certain first year implementation issues. The net liability associated with the 2007 risk corridor estimate, which will be settled in 2008, was $102.6 million at December 31, 2007. Reinsurance and low-income cost subsidies represent reimbursements from CMS in connection with the Medicare Part D program for which we assume no risk. Reinsurance subsidies represent reimbursements for CMS portion of prescription drug costs which exceed the member out-of-pocket threshold, or the catastrophic coverage level. Low-income cost subsidies represent reimbursements from CMS for all or a portion of the deductible, the coinsurance and co-payment amounts above the out-of-pocket threshold for low-income beneficiaries. Monthly prospective payments from CMS for reinsurance and low-income cost subsidies are based on assumptions submitted with our annual bid. A reconciliation and related settlement of CMS prospective subsidies against actual prescription drug costs we paid is made after the end of the year. We account for these subsidies as a deposit in our consolidated balance sheets and as a financing activity in our consolidated statements of cash flows. We do not recognize premium revenues or benefit expense for these subsidies. Receipt and payment activity is accumulated at the contract level and recorded in our consolidated balance sheets in other current assets or trade accounts payable and accrued expenses depending on the contract balance at the end of the reporting period. Gross financing receipts were $2,866.2 million and gross financing withdrawals were $3,051.2 million during 2007. CMS subsidy activity recorded to the consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2007 was $580.4 million to other current assets and $273.0 million to trade accounts payable and accrued expenses. In order to allow plans offering enhanced benefits the maximum flexibility in designing alternative prescription drug coverage, CMS provided a demonstration payment option in lieu of the reinsurance subsidy for plans offering enhanced coverage, or coverage beyond CMS defined standard benefits. The demonstration payment option is an arrangement in which CMS pays a capitation amount to a plan for assuming the 56 Table of Contents government portion of prescription drug costs in the catastrophic layer of coverage. The capitation amount represents a fixed monthly amount per member to provide prescription drug coverage in the catastrophic layer. We chose the demonstration payment option for all of our enhanced benefit plans. This capitation amount, derived from our annual bid submissions, is recorded as premium revenue. The variance between the capitation amount and actual drug costs in the catastrophic layer is subject to risk sharing as part of the risk corridor settlement. Settlement of the reinsurance and low-income cost subsidies as well as the risk corridor payment is based on a reconciliation made approximately 6 months after the close of each calendar year. This reconciliation process requires us to submit claims data necessary for CMS to administer the program. Medicare Risk Adjustment Provisions CMS has implemented a risk adjustment model which apportions premiums paid to all health plans according to health severity. The CMS risk adjustment model pays more for members with predictably higher costs, as more fully described in Item 1. Business on page 5. Under this risk adjustment methodology, diagnosis data from inpatient and ambulatory treatment settings are used to calculate the risk adjusted premium payment to us. We collect, capture, and submit the necessary and available diagnosis data to CMS within prescribed deadlines. We estimate risk adjustment revenues based upon the diagnosis data submitted to CMS and ultimately accepted by CMS. We do not have access to diagnosis data with respect to our stand-alone PDP members. CMS has transitioned to the risk adjustment model while the old demographic model was phased out. The demographic model based the monthly premiums paid to health plans on factors such as age, sex and disability status. The monthly premium amount for each member is separately determined under both the risk adjustment and demographic model. These separate payment amounts are then blended according to the transition schedule. CMS transitioned to the risk adjustment model for Medicare Advantage plans as follows: 30% in 2004, 50% in 2005, 75% in 2006, and 100% in 2007. The stand-alone PDP payment methodology is based 100% on the risk adjustment model. As a result of this process and the phasing in of the risk adjustment model, as well as budget neutrality as described in Item 1. Business on page 5, our CMS monthly premium payments per member may change materially, either favorably or unfavorably. Military services In 2007, military services revenues represented 12% of total premiums and administrative services fees. Military services revenue primarily is derived from our TRICARE South Region contract with the Department of Defense and in addition, beginning January 1, 2008, from our contract with the Department of Veterans Affairs. Revenues associated with our contract with the Department of Veterans Affairs are recognized in the period services are performed. The single TRICARE contract for the South Region includes multiple revenue generating activities and as such was evaluated under Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 00-21, Accounting for Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables . We allocate the consideration to the various components based on the relative fair values of the components. TRICARE revenues consist generally of (1) an insurance premium for assuming underwriting risk for the cost of civilian health care services delivered to eligible beneficiaries; (2) health care services provided to beneficiaries which are in turn reimbursed by the federal government; and (3) administrative services fees related to claim processing, customer service, enrollment, disease management and other services. We recognize the insurance premium as revenue ratably over the period coverage is provided. Health care services reimbursements are recognized as revenue in the period health services are provided. Administrative services fees are recognized as revenue in the period services are performed. The TRICARE contract contains provisions whereby the federal government bears a substantial portion of the risk associated with financing the cost of health benefits. Annually, we negotiate a target health care cost 57 Table of Contents amount, or target cost, with the federal government and determine an underwriting fee. Any variance from the target cost is shared. We earn more revenue or incur additional costs based on the variance in actual health care costs versus the negotiated target cost. We receive 20% for any cost underrun, subject to a ceiling that limits the underwriting profit to 10% of the target cost. We pay 20% for any cost overrun, subject to a floor that limits the underwriting loss to negative 4% of the target cost. A final settlement occurs 12 to 18 months after the end of each contract year to which it applies. We defer the recognition of any revenues for favorable contingent underwriting fee adjustments related to cost underruns until the amount is determinable and the collectibility is reasonably assured. We estimate and recognize unfavorable contingent underwriting fee adjustments related to cost overruns currently in operations as an increase in benefit expenses. We continually review these benefit expense estimates of future payments to the government for cost overruns and make necessary adjustments to our reserves. The military services contracts contain provisions to negotiate change orders. Change orders occur when we perform services or incur costs under the directive of the federal government that were not originally specified in our contract. Under federal regulations we may be entitled to an equitable adjustment to the contract price in these situations. Change orders may be negotiated and settled at any time throughout the year. We record revenue applicable to change orders when services are performed and these amounts are determinable and the collectibility is reasonably assured. Investment Securities Investment securities totaled $4,650.4 million, or 36% of total assets at December 31, 2007. Debt securities totaled $4,639.1 million, or nearly 100% of this investment portfolio. More than 98% of our debt securities were of investment-grade quality, with an average credit rating of AA+ by S&P at December 31, 2007. Most of the debt securities that are below investment grade are rated at the higher end (BB or better) of the non-investment grade spectrum. We have minimal exposure to sub-prime mortgages as we acceded to approximately $8 million of sub-prime and second-lien mortgages with our acquisition of KMG in the fourth quarter of 2007. However, by the end of January 2008, we had reduced that amount to approximately $4 million of sub-prime mortgages, each of which have maintained at least an AA+ rating after subsequent reviews by the rating agencies. There are no collateralized debt obligations or structured investment vehicles in our investment portfolio. Our investment policy limits investments in a single issuer and requires diversification among various asset types. Duration is indicative of the relationship between changes in market value and changes in interest rates, providing a general indication of the sensitivity of the fair values of our debt securities to changes in interest rates. However, actual market values may differ significantly from estimates based on duration. The average duration of our debt securities was approximately 3.9 years at December 31, 2007. Given that short term interest rates were higher than long term rates during most of 2007, cash was invested in cash equivalents instead of longer duration investment securities. Including cash equivalents, the average duration was approximately 2.6 years. Based on the duration including cash equivalents, a 1% increase in interest rates would generally decrease the fair value of our securities by approximately $172 million. Our investment securities, which consist primarily of debt securities, have been categorized as available for sale and, as a result, are stated at fair value. Fair value of actively traded debt and equity securities are based on quoted market prices. Fair value of inactively traded debt securities are based on quoted market prices of identical or similar securities or based on observable inputs like interest rates. Fair value of privately held debt securities, including venture capital investments are estimated using a variety of valuation methodologies where an observable quoted market does not exist. Such methodologies include reviewing the value ascribed to the most recent financing, comparing the security with securities of publicly traded companies in a similar line of business, and reviewing the underlying financial performance including estimating discounted cash flows. Investment securities available for current operations are classified as current assets. Unrealized holding gains and losses, net of applicable deferred taxes, are included as a component of stockholders equity and comprehensive income until realized from a sale or other than temporary impairment. 58 Table of Contents Gross unrealized losses and fair value aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position were as follows at December 31, 2007. Less than 12 months 12 months or more Total 2007 Fair Value Unrealized Losses Fair Value Unrealized Losses Fair Value Unrealized Losses (in thousands) U.S. Government obligations $ 46,272 $ (391 ) $ 169,599 $ (1,718 ) $ 215,871 $ (2,109 ) Tax exempt municipal securities 265,816 (4,098 ) 284,644 (2,147 ) 550,460 (6,245 ) Corporate and other securities 323,102 (8,645 ) 52,564 (1,164 ) 375,666 (9,809 ) Mortgage-backed securities 104,656 (1,282 ) 124,071 (2,299 ) 228,727 (3,581 ) Debt securities 739,846 (14,416 ) 630,878 (7,328 ) 1,370,724 (21,744 ) Non-redeemable preferred stocks 6,400 (1,575 ) 6,400 (1,575 ) Common stocks 3 (2 ) 3 (2 ) Equity securities 6,403 (1,577 ) 6,403 (1,577 ) Total investment securities $ 746,249 $ (15,993 ) $ 630,878 $ (7,328 ) $ 1,377,127 $ (23,321 ) We regularly evaluate our investment securities for impairment. We consider factors affecting the issuer, factors affecting the industry the issuer operates within, and general debt and equity market trends. We consider the length of time an investment fair value has been below carrying value, the severity of the decline, the near term prospects for recovery to cost, and our intent and ability to hold the investment until maturity or market recovery is realized. If and when a determination is made that a decline in fair value below the cost basis is other than temporary, the related investment is written down to its estimated fair value through a charge to earnings. The risks inherent in assessing the impairment of an investment include the risk that market factors may differ from our expectations; facts and circumstances factored into our assessment may change with the passage of time; or we may decide to subsequently sell the investment. The determination of whether a decline in the value of an investment is other than temporary requires us to exercise significant diligence and judgment. The discovery of new information and the passage of time can significantly change these judgments. The status of the general economic environment and significant changes in the national securities markets influence the determination of fair value and the assessment of investment impairment. Unrealized losses at December 31, 2007 resulted from 472 positions out of a total of 1,165 positions held. Approximately 14% of the carrying value of our investment securities have been in an unrealized loss position greater than one year. Of these investment securities in an unrealized loss position longer than a year, approximately 99% of the carrying value are within 5% of recovering fair value up to cost. The unrealized losses at December 31, 2007 primarily were caused by increases in interest rates. All issuers of securities trading at an unrealized loss remain current on all contractual payments and we believe it is probable that we will be able to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the debt securities. After taking into account these and other factors, including the severity of the decline and our ability and intent to hold these securities until recovery or maturity, we determined the unrealized losses on these investment securities were temporary and, as such, no impairment was required. Goodwill and Long-lived Assets At December 31, 2007, goodwill and other long-lived assets represented 20% of total assets and 63% of total stockholders equity. SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets , or SFAS 142, requires that we test at least annually for impairment at a level of reporting referred to as the reporting unit and more frequently if adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. A reporting unit is our operating segments or one level below the operating segments which comprise our reportable Commercial and Government segments. 59 Table of Contents The Government segment consists of beneficiaries of government benefit programs, and includes three lines of business: Medicare, Military, and Medicaid. The Commercial segment consists of members enrolled in our medical and specialty products marketed to employer groups and individuals. Goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit that is expected to benefit from a specific acquisition. Our strategy, long-range business plan, and annual planning process support our goodwill impairment tests. These tests are based primarily on an evaluation of future discounted cash flows under several scenarios. Outcomes from the discounted cash flow analysis were compared to other market approach valuation methodologies for reasonableness. We used a range of discount rates that correspond to a market-based weighted-average cost of capital. Key assumptions, including changes in membership, premium yields, medical cost trends and certain government contract extensions, are consistent with those utilized in our long-range business plan and annual planning process. If these assumptions differ from actual, the estimates underlying our goodwill impairment tests could be adversely affected. Goodwill impairment tests completed in each of the last three years did not result in an impairment loss. Long-lived assets consist of property and equipment and other finite-lived intangible assets. These assets are depreciated or amortized over their estimated useful life, and are subject to impairment reviews. We periodically review long-lived assets whenever adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. In assessing recoverability, we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine if an impairment loss may exist, and, if so, estimate fair value. We also must estimate and make assumptions regarding the useful life we assign to our long-lived assets. If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record impairment losses or change the useful life, including accelerating depreciation or amortization for these assets. There were no impairment losses in the last three years. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. 60 Table of Contents
