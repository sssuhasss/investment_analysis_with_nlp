ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION Unless otherwise indicated, all financial data in this document have been prepared using generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) in the United States of America. As used in this document, Group means Everest Re Group, Ltd. (formerly Everest Reinsurance Group, Ltd.); Holdings means Everest Reinsurance Holdings, Inc.; Everest Re means Everest Reinsurance Company and its subsidiaries (unless the context otherwise requires); and the Company means Everest Re Group, Ltd. and its subsidiaries, except when referring to periods prior to February 24, 2000, when it means Holdings and its subsidiaries. The following is a discussion of the results of operations and financial condition of the Company. This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes thereto presented under ITEM 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data . RESTRUCTURING On February 24, 2000, a corporate restructuring was completed and Group became the new parent holding company of Holdings, which remains the holding company for Group U.S. operations. Effective January 1, 2005 the principal executive offices of Group were relocated from Barbados to Bermuda. INDUSTRY CONDITIONS The worldwide reinsurance and insurance businesses are highly competitive yet cyclical by product and market. Competition with respect to the types of reinsurance and insurance business in which the Company is engaged is based on many factors, including the perceived overall financial strength of the reinsurer or insurer, ratings of the reinsurer or insurer by A.M. Best and/or Standard & Poor s, underwriting expertise, the jurisdictions where the reinsurer or insurer is licensed or otherwise authorized, capacity and coverages offered, premiums charged, other terms and conditions of the reinsurance and insurance business offered, services offered, speed of claims payment and reputation and experience in lines written. These factors operate at the individual market participant level to varying degrees as applicable to the specific participant circumstances. They also operate in aggregate across the reinsurance industry more generally contributing, in combination with background, economic conditions and variations in the reinsurance buying practices of insurance companies, by participant and in the aggregate, to cyclical movements in reinsurance rates, terms and conditions and ultimately reinsurance industry aggregate financial results. The Company competes in the U.S., Bermuda and international reinsurance and insurance markets with numerous international and domestic reinsurance and insurance companies. The Company competitors include independent reinsurance and insurance companies, subsidiaries or affiliates of established worldwide insurance companies, reinsurance departments of certain insurance companies and domestic and international underwriting operations, including underwriting syndicates at Lloyd s. Some of these competitors have greater financial resources than the Company and have established long-term and continuing business relationships throughout the industry, which can be a significant competitive advantage. In addition, the potential for securitization of reinsurance and insurance risks through capital markets provides an additional source of potential reinsurance and insurance capacity and competition. In 2004, the favorable market conditions, which had developed during 2000 through 2003, generally began to weaken. There were signs that pricing for most property classes declined modestly and that pricing for most casualty classes softened. Competition increased, in part due to the relative profitability achieved by many reinsurers over 2002 and 2003 and the attendant buildup of capital in these participants. However, this profitability and capital buildup varied significantly by market participant, reflecting the fact that the industry generally still remained exposed to fundamental issues that had negatively impacted its aggregate capacity in 2002 and 2003, including weak investment market conditions and adverse loss emergence. Both of these had tended to depress the industry aggregate financial performance and perceptions of financial strength of 34 industry participants over this period albeit with significant variation by individual market participant. The industry experienced a record level of catastrophe losses during 2004, particularly in the second half of the year, and it remains unclear whether the aggregate catastrophe losses experienced by the industry will reverse, stop or even moderate the trends toward market softening, particularly as respects property classes. Through 2003, reinsurance and insurance markets had generally continued to firm, reflecting the continuing, although diminishing, implications of losses arising from the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, and more broadly, the impact of aggregate company reactions to broad and growing recognition that competition in the late 1990s reached extremes in many classes and markets, which ultimately led to inadequate pricing and overly broad terms, conditions and coverages. The effect of these extremes, which became apparent through excessive loss emergence, varied widely by company depending on product offerings, markets accessed, underwriting and operating practices, competitive strategies and business volumes. Across all market participants, however, the aggregate general effect was depressed financial results and erosion of the industry capital base. Coupled with deteriorating investment market conditions and results, and renewed concerns regarding longer-term industry specific issues, including asbestos exposure and sub-par capital returns, these financial impacts introduced substantial, and in some cases extreme, pressure for the initiation and/or strengthening of corrective action by individual market participants. These pressures, aggregating across industry participants, reinforced the trend established in 2000 through 2003 toward firming prices, more restrictive terms and conditions, tightened coverage availability across most classes and markets and increasing concern with respect to the financial security of insurance and reinsurance providers, impacts which set the stage for the 2004 trends discussed above. The Company has been somewhat disappointed by industry developments in 2004, which have generally operated to modestly weaken pricing. The Company can not predict with any reasonable certainty whether and to what extent these trends or conditions will persist and in particular whether the property catastrophe losses experienced by the industry in 2004 will lessen competitive pressures, particularly for the property classes of business. Notwithstanding these catastrophe losses, the continued growth of reinsurance capacity, particularly in Bermuda, changes in the Lloyd market, and the potential reemergence of a market share orientation among some industry participants, combined with improving and in some cases strong financial results, continue to contribute to uncertainty about the prospective level of competitive pressures. 35 FINANCIAL SUMMARY The Company management monitors and evaluates overall Company performance based upon financial results. The following table displays a summary of the consolidated net income for the periods indicated: Years Ended December 31, (Dollars in thousands) 2004 2003 2002 Gross written premiums $ 4,704,135 $ 4,573,802 $ 2,846,501 Net written premiums 4,531,488 4,315,389 2,637,620 REVENUES: Premiums earned $ 4,425,082 $ 3,737,851 $ 2,273,677 Net investment income 495,908 402,610 350,668 Net realized capital gains (losses) 89,614 (38,026 ) (50,043 ) Net derivative (expense) income (2,660 ) 5,851 (14,509 ) Other income (expense) 741 (1,033 ) (2,091 ) Total revenues 5,008,685 4,107,253 2,557,702 CLAIMS AND EXPENSES: Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses 3,291,139 2,600,196 1,629,382 Commission, brokerage, taxes and fees 975,176 863,933 551,787 Other underwriting expenses 107,120 94,623 69,916 Interest expense 75,539 57,288 44,573 Total claims and expenses 4,448,974 3,616,040 2,295,658 INCOME BEFORE TAXES 559,711 491,213 262,044 Income tax expense 64,853 65,185 30,741 NET INCOME $ 494,858 $ 426,028 $ 231,303 As indicated in the preceding Industry Conditions section, the reinsurance and insurance industry generally experienced favorable market conditions from 2001 through 2003. These favorable market conditions, coupled with the Company financial strength, strategic positioning and market and underwriting expertise, enabled the Company to increase its volume of business significantly over this period. With the change in competitive trend throughout 2004 and with little clarity regarding the impact of property catastrophe losses on prospective market conditions, the Company continued to adapt its operations to slow its rate of growth and even decrease writings for some classes of business and reemphasize its focus on profitability as opposed to volume. Gross written premiums were $4.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2004, an increase of 2.8% as compared with $4.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2003, which had increased 60.7% compared with the year ended December 31, 2002. Gross written premiums were $2.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2002, an increase of 51.8% compared with the year ended December 31, 2001. Due to the nature of its businesses, the Company is unable to precisely differentiate between the effects of price changes as compared to the effects of changes in exposure. Similarly, because individual reinsurance arrangements often reflect revised coverages, structuring, pricing, terms and/or conditions from period to period, the Company is unable to differentiate between the premium volumes attributable to new business as compared to renewal business. Management believes, however, that on balance, the Company growth has been reasonably balanced between growth in exposures underwritten and increased pricing and/or improved terms and conditions. Management believes further that market conditions, although changing, remain generally more 36 favorable for casualty business classes than for property business classes; however, management notes that it continues to see business opportunities in most product classes and markets. Although premium volumes on a year to date basis have increased, the Company continues to decline business that does not meet its objectives regarding underwriting profitability, a discipline which became more apparent over the second half of 2004 with quarterly volumes for the third and fourth quarters which reflected year over year declines in gross premiums written. In June 2004, the Company received notification of termination with respect to its contract with American All-Risk Insurance Services, LLC, its single largest producer of California workers compensation insurance. In 2004, American All Risk Insurance Services, LLC accounted for approximately 7.8% of total gross written premiums. Under the terms of the contract, the agency continued to produce business exclusively for the Company through October 15, 2004. The business produced under this relationship will continue in force through the policy expiration dates or cancellation. The Company does not believe that the termination of this contract will have a material adverse effect on future Company operations and believes the termination was not entirely inconsistent with its plan to moderate its writings in this market. Net written premiums, comprised of gross written premiums less ceded premiums, were $4.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2004, an increase of 5.0% compared with $4.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2003, which had increased 63.6% compared with the year ended December 31, 2002. Net written premiums for the year ended December 31, 2002 were $2.6 billion, an increase of 69.1% compared with the year ended December 31, 2001. The increases in net written premium are in line with the increases in gross written premium, as ceded written premium over the period was relatively stable at $172.6 million, $258.4 million and $208.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Ceded premiums relate primarily to specific reinsurance purchased by the U.S. Insurance operation and, to a lesser extent, adjustment premiums in 2003 and 2002 on loss cessions made to the Company corporate level aggregate reinsurance coverages. Premiums earned were $4.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2004, an increase of 18.4% compared with $3.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2003, which had increased 64.4% compared with the year ended December 31, 2002. Premiums earned for the year ended December 31, 2002 were $2.3 billion, an increase of 54.9% compared with the year ended December 31, 2001. These increases reflect period to period changes in net written premiums and business mix together with normal variability in earning patterns. Business mix changes occur not only as the Company shifts emphasis between products, lines of business, distribution channels and markets, but also as individual contracts renew or non-renew, almost always with changes in coverage, structure, prices and/or terms, and as new contracts are accepted with coverages, structures, prices and/or terms different from those of expiring contracts. Changes in estimates related to unreported reinsurance activity also contribute. Incurred losses and LAE for the year ended December 31, 2004 were $3.3 billion, an increase of 26.6% compared with $2.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2003, which had increased 59.6% compared with the year ended December 31, 2002. Incurred losses and LAE for the year ended December 31, 2002 were $1.6 billion, an increase of 34.7% compared with the year ended December 31, 2001. The major contributing factor for the increases in 2004 was the increase in incurred losses and LAE due to property catastrophe net event losses of $403 million, arising principally from hurricanes Charley, Frances, Ivan and Jeanne, Pacific typhoons, Edmonton hailstorms and the Asian tsunami. Other factors, including the level of incurred losses and LAE related to changes in volume as measured by earned premium, changes in rates, and terms and the effect of changes in prior period loss reserve estimates, also contributed. The increase in incurred losses and LAE relating to net adverse prior period reserve strengthening of $312.0 million, $256.9 million and $140.1 million for years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, principally related to the Company asbestos exposures, treaty casualty and workers compensation, partially offset in 2004 by a $33.4 million reduction in 37 reserves related to the World Trade Center events. See ITEM 1, Business Changes in Historical Reserves for additional details and explanation. Commission, brokerage and tax expense for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 were $975.2 million, $863.9 million and $551.8 million, respectively, increasing principally as a result of premium volume changes, as these expenses generally vary in direct proportion to premiums earned. However, the percentage increase in expenses was somewhat less than the change in premiums, primarily reflecting the impact of changes in the Company business mix. Net investment income was $495.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, an increase of 23.2% compared with $402.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, which had increased 14.8% compared with the year ended December 31, 2002. Net investment income for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $350.7 million, an increase of 3.0% compared with the year ended December 31, 2001. The year ended December 31, 2004 included a $32.7 million increase arising from an atypical increase in the value of one of the Company limited partnership investments. Excluding this increase, the net investment income increase generally reflected growth in the Company cash and invested assets. Premiums are generally collected over the first 12 to 15 months of the Company reinsurance and insurance contract, while related losses are typically paid out over numerous years. This tends to increase cash flow from operations when premiums are increasing. The Company cash flow from operations was $1,487.6 million, $1,653.8 million and $742.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Cash flow from operations was impacted in particular by increased loss payments relating to catastrophe losses and asbestos claim settlements in 2004. Coupled with common stock offerings and the issuance of junior subordinated debt securities, this contributed to the growth in the Company total investments and cash to $11,530.2 million. Net realized capital gains of $89.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 were primarily the result of gains on the sale of the Company interest only strips investment portfolio. Net realized capital losses of $38.0 million and $50.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, were primarily the result of valuation adjustments on the interest only strip portfolio in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force No. 99-20, Recognition of Interest Income and Impairment on Purchases and Beneficial Interests in Securitized Financial Assets ( EITF 99-20 ) and write-downs in the value of securities deemed to be impaired on an other than temporary basis, partially offset by realized gains. The Company income tax expense is primarily a function of the statutory tax rates and corresponding net income in the jurisdictions where the Company operates, coupled with the impact from tax preferenced investment income. Variations between years generally reflect changes in the relative levels of pre-tax income between jurisdictions with different tax rates. Additionally, in conjunction with the transfer of the Company UK Branch to Bermuda Re, there were various tax issues giving rise to incremental net tax expenses in 2004. The Company incurred income tax expenses of $64.9 million, $65.2 million and $30.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The slight decrease in tax expense primarily reflected the impact of the catastrophe losses on 2004 underwriting results, which were partially offset by additional taxable net investment income, taxable realized capital gains and the expense associated with the transfer of the UK branch. Net income for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 was $494.9 million, $426.0 million and $231.3 million, respectively, generally reflecting improving underwriting and investment results and realized capital gains in 2004, partially offset by realized capital losses in 2003 and 2002 and, particularly in 2004, catastrophe and asbestos losses, all moderated by the impact of income taxes. SEGMENT INFORMATION The Company, through its subsidiaries, operates in five segments: U.S. Reinsurance, U.S. Insurance, Specialty Underwriting, International and Bermuda. The U.S. Reinsurance operation writes property and casualty 38 reinsurance, on both a treaty and facultative basis, through reinsurance brokers, as well as directly with ceding companies within the U.S. The U.S. Insurance operation writes property and casualty insurance primarily through general agent relationships and surplus lines brokers within the U.S. The Specialty Underwriting operation writes A&H, marine, aviation and surety business within the U.S. and worldwide through brokers and directly with ceding companies. The International operation writes property and casualty reinsurance through Everest Re branches in Canada and Singapore, in addition to foreign business written through Everest Re Miami and New Jersey offices. The Bermuda operation provides reinsurance and insurance to worldwide property and casualty markets and reinsurance to life insurers through brokers and directly with ceding companies from its Bermuda office and property and casualty reinsurance to the United Kingdom and European markets through its UK branch. These segments are managed in a carefully coordinated fashion with strong elements of central control, including with respect to capital, investments and support operations. As a result, management generally monitors and evaluates the financial performance of these operating segments based upon their underwriting gain (loss) or underwriting results. Underwriting results include earned premium less losses and LAE incurred, commission and brokerage expenses and other underwriting expenses and are analyzed using ratios, in particular loss, commission and brokerage and other underwriting expense ratios, which, respectively divide incurred losses, commissions and brokerage and other underwriting expenses by earned premium. The Company utilizes inter-affiliate reinsurance but such reinsurance generally does not impact segment results, as business is generally reported within the segment in which the business was first produced. For selected financial information regarding these segments, see Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Effective January 1, 2004, Everest Re sold its United Kingdom branch to Bermuda Re. Business for this branch was previously included in the International segment and is now included in the Bermuda segment. Due to the sale and in accordance with FAS 131, the Company restated the International and Bermuda segments for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 to conform to December 31, 2004 segment reporting. In 2003, Everest National, another subsidiary of the Company, opened a regional office in California to better serve its western U.S. insurance business. The business produced through this additional office is included in the U.S. Insurance operation. The following tables present the relevant underwriting results for the operating segments for the three years ended December 31: U.S. Reinsurance (Dollars in thousands) 2004 2003 2002 Gross written premiums $ 1,478,159 $ 1,752,302 $ 894,555 Net written premiums 1,468,466 1,687,333 834,234 Premiums earned $ 1,473,545 $ 1,423,841 $ 726,352 Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses 1,168,563 1,059,087 535,950 Commission and brokerage 373,581 350,641 182,558 Other underwriting expenses 23,390 21,670 18,876 Underwriting loss $ (91,989 ) $ (7,557 ) $ (11,032 ) 39 U.S. Insurance (Dollars in thousands) 2004 2003 2002 Gross written premiums $ 1,167,808 $ 1,069,527 $ 821,442 Net written premiums 1,019,716 923,147 705,313 Premiums earned $ 937,576 $ 823,601 $ 573,081 Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses 658,777 605,602 432,917 Commission and brokerage 130,380 146,782 122,806 Other underwriting expenses 44,834 38,569 25,802 Underwriting gain (loss) $ 103,585 $ 32,648 $ (8,444 ) Specialty Underwriting (Dollars in thousands) 2004 2003 2002 Gross written premiums $ 487,072 $ 502,888 $ 488,583 Net written premiums 470,571 498,013 486,979 Premiums earned $ 459,284 $ 468,932 $ 459,973 Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses 302,010 295,397 313,352 Commission and brokerage 129,209 133,531 130,552 Other underwriting expenses 7,068 6,475 6,363 Underwriting gain $ 20,997 $ 33,529 $ 9,706 International (Dollars in thousands) 2004 2003 2002 Gross written premiums $ 687,657 $ 520,800 $ 364,476 Net written premiums 684,390 518,919 351,004 Premiums earned $ 655,694 $ 461,607 $ 318,207 Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses 419,101 267,707 184,490 Commission and brokerage 161,106 113,091 80,853 Other underwriting expenses 11,298 9,734 9,256 Underwriting gain $ 64,189 $ 71,075 $ 43,608 40 Bermuda (Dollars in thousands) 2004 2003 2002 Gross written premiums $ 883,439 $ 728,285 $ 277,445 Net written premiums 888,345 687,977 260,090 Premiums earned $ 898,983 $ 559,870 $ 196,064 Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses 742,688 372,403 162,673 Commission and brokerage 180,900 119,888 35,018 Other underwriting expenses 13,998 12,222 6,433 Underwriting (loss) gain $ (38,603 ) $ 55,357 $ (8,060 ) The following table reconciles the underwriting results for the operating segments to income before tax as reported in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income for the years ended December 31: (Dollars in thousands) 2004 2003 2002 Underwriting gain $ 58,179 $ 185,052 $ 25,778 Net investment income 495,908 402,610 350,668 Realized gain (loss) 89,614 (38,026 ) (50,043 ) Net derivative (expense) income (2,660 ) 5,851 (14,509 ) Corporate expenses (6,532 ) (5,953 ) (3,186 ) Interest expense (75,539 ) (57,288 ) (44,573 ) Other income (expense) 741 (1,033 ) (2,091 ) Income before taxes $ 559,711 $ 491,213 $ 262,044 CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003 Premiums. Gross written premiums increased 2.8% to $4,704.1 million in 2004 from $4,573.8 million in 2003, as the Company took advantage of selected growth opportunities, while continuing to maintain a disciplined underwriting approach. Premium growth areas included a 32.0% ($166.9 million) increase in the International operations, primarily due to a $97.7 million increase in international business written through the Miami and New Jersey offices, representing primarily Latin American business, and a $67.2 million increase in Asian business. The Bermuda operation grew 21.3% ($155.2 million) reflecting an emphasis on traditional business classes in Bermuda and the UK. The U.S. Insurance operation grew 9.2% ($98.3 million), principally as a result of a $193.8 million increase in program business other than workers compensation, partially offset by a $95.5 million decrease in workers compensation business. The Specialty Underwriting operation decreased 3.1% ($15.8 million), resulting primarily from a $70.4 million decrease in A&H business, partially offset by an increase in surety business of $29.6 million and an increase in marine and aviation business of $25.0 million. The U.S. Reinsurance operation decreased 15.6% ($274.1 million), principally relating to an $142.5 million decrease in treaty casualty business, a $74.9 million decrease in facultative business, a $32.6 million decrease in treaty property business and a $19.8 million decrease in treaty non-property business. Ceded premiums decreased to $172.6 million in 2004 from $258.4 million in 2003, principally resulting from the inclusion in 2003 of $49.6 million in adjustment premiums relating to claims made under the 2000 accident year aggregate excess of loss element of the Company corporate retrocessional programs, compared with no such adjustment premiums in 2004. Aside from the corporate retrocessional programs, ceded premiums 41 generally relate to specific reinsurance purchased by the U.S. Insurance operation and fluctuate based upon the level of premiums written in the applicable programs. Net written premiums increased by 5.0% to $4,531.5 million in 2004 from $4,315.4 million in 2003, reflecting the increase in gross written premiums, combined with the decrease in ceded premiums. Premium Revenues. Net premiums earned increased by 18.4% to $4,425.1 million in 2004 from $3,737.9 million in 2003. Contributing to this increase was a 60.6% ($339.1 million) increase in the Bermuda operation, a 42.0% ($194.1 million) increase in the International operation, a 13.8% ($114.0 million) increase in the U.S. Insurance operation and a 3.5% ($49.7 million) increase in the U.S. Reinsurance operation, partially offset by a 2.1% ($9.6 million) decrease in the Specialty Underwriting operation. All of these changes reflect period to period changes in net written premiums and business mix, together with normal variability in earnings patterns. Business mix changes occur not only as the Company shifts emphasis between products, lines of business, distribution channels and markets, but also as individual contracts renew or non-renew, almost always with changes in coverage, structure, prices and/or terms, and as new contracts are accepted with coverages, structures, prices and/or terms different from those of expiring contracts. As premium reporting, earnings, loss and commission characteristics derive from the provisions of individual contracts, the continuous turnover of individual contracts, arising from both strategic shifts and day to day underwriting, can and does introduce appreciable background variability in various underwriting line items. Changes in estimates related to unreported reinsurance activity also contribute. Expenses. Incurred loss and LAE increased by 26.6% to $3,291.1 million in 2004 from $2,600.2 million in 2003. The increase in incurred losses and LAE was principally attributable to the provision for estimated catastrophe losses from hurricanes Charley, Frances, Ivan and Jeanne, Pacific typhoons, the Asian tsunami and reserve adjustments for prior period losses, together with the mitigating effects of the increase in net premiums earned and the impact of favorable changes in the Company underlying business mix and aggregate rates, terms and conditions. The Company loss and LAE reserves reflect estimates of ultimate claim liability. Such estimates are reevaluated on an ongoing basis, including re-estimates of prior period reserves, taking into consideration all available information and, in particular, newly reported loss and claim experience. The effect of such reevaluations impacts incurred losses for the current period. The Company notes that its analytical methods and processes operate at multiple levels, including individual contracts, groupings of like contracts, classes and lines of business, internal business units, segments, legal entities, and in the aggregate. The complexities of the Company business and operations require analyses and adjustments, both qualitative and quantitative, at these various levels. Additionally, the attribution of reserves, changes in reserves and incurred losses between accident year and underwriting year requires adjustments and allocations, both qualitative and quantitative, at these various levels. All of these processes, methods and practices appropriately balance actuarial science, business expertise and management judgment in a manner intended to assure the accuracy, precision and consistency of the Company reserving practices, which are fundamental to the Company operation. The Company notes, however, that the underlying reserves remain estimates, which are subject to variation, and that the relative degree of variability is generally least when reserves are considered in the aggregate and generally increases as the focus shifts to more granular data levels. Incurred losses and LAE in 2004 reflected ceded losses and LAE of $141.0 million compared to ceded losses and LAE in 2003 of $278.4 million. The decrease in ceded losses is primarily the result of the absence in 2004 of cessions under the corporate level aggregate reinsurance covers. The ceded losses and LAE in 2003 included $85.0 million of losses ceded under the 2000 accident year aggregate excess of loss component of the Company corporate retrocessional program and $81.1 million under the LM/Mt. McKinley reinsurance agreement. 42 Incurred losses and LAE include catastrophe losses, which include the impact of both current period events and favorable and adverse development on prior period events and are net of reinsurance. Individual catastrophe losses are reported net of specific reinsurance, but before recoveries under corporate level reinsurance and potential IBNR reserve offsets. The Company defines a catastrophe as a property event with expected reported losses of at least $5.0 million before corporate level reinsurance and taxes. Catastrophe losses, net of contract specific cessions, were $403.0 million in 2004, relating principally to aggregate estimated losses of $428.8 million from hurricanes Charley, Frances, Ivan and Jeanne, Pacific typhoons, Edmonton hailstorms and the Asian tsunami, which were partially offset by $33.4 million of reserve reductions related to the World Trade Center events. Catastrophe losses, net of contract specific cessions, were $36.8 million in 2003, relating principally to the May 2003 tornado and hailstorm events and hurricanes Fabian and Isabel. (Dollars in millions) Segment Net Catastrophe Losses Segment 2004 2003 U.S. Reinsurance $ 250 .7 $ 23 .9 U.S. Insurance 1 .0 1 .4 Specialty Underwriting 18 .4 3 .2 International 88 .0 1 .1 Bermuda 44 .9 7 .2 Total $ 403 .0 $ 36 .8 Net adverse prior period reserve adjustments for the year ended December 31, 2004 were $312.0 million compared to $256.9 million in 2003. For the year ended December 31, 2004, the adverse reserve adjustments included net adverse A&E adjustments of $159.4 million and net adverse non-A&E adjustments of approximately $186.0 million relating primarily to casualty reinsurance, partially offset by favorable development of $33.4 million relating to the reduction of reserves for the World Trade Center events. For the year ended December 31, 2003, net adverse prior period reserve adjustments for A&E exposures were $50.2 million and net adverse non-A&E adjustments were $206.7 million, which were net of a cession of $85 million under the 2000 accident year aggregate excess of loss component of the Company corporate retrocessional program. It is important to note that adverse non-A&E accident year reserve development arises from the reevaluation of accident year results and that such reevaluations also impact premiums and commissions attributed by accident year, generally mitigating, in part, the impact of loss development and that such impacts are recorded as part of the overall reserve evaluation. The U.S. Reinsurance segment accounted for $77.7 million of net adverse prior period reserve adjustments for the year ended December 31, 2004, which included $34.2 million of favorable development due to the reserve reduction related to the catastrophe losses from the World Trade Center events, as compared to net adverse prior period reserve adjustments of $150.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. Asbestos exposures accounted for $10.3 million and $16.8 million of adverse reserve adjustments for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, with the remainder principally attributable to professional liability and casualty business classes. During the late 1990s and early 2000s, there had been a proliferation of claims relating to bankruptcies and other financial management improprieties. This increased number of claims, combined with larger claims, has significantly increased incurred losses on the professional liability policies. In the general casualty area, the Company continues to experience losses greater than historical trends for accident years 1998 through 2001. These losses are being driven by adverse trends in litigation and economic variability. In both the professional liability and general casualty reinsurance areas, the Company relies upon loss reports from ceding companies. Although the Company may record reserves at higher levels than those reported by ceding companies, actual reported results have exceeded the initial loss indications. The U.S. Insurance segment reflected $43.3 million and $58.7 million of net adverse prior period reserve adjustments for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The adverse prior period reserve adjustments were principally due to accident years 2000 through 2002, where the Company strengthened its 43 reserves for California workers compensation insurance. This was a relatively new book of business and was written in a challenging political and economic environment. While management believes the cumulative results through 2004 remain quite positive, there has been some deterioration in claim frequency and severity related to accident years 2001 and 2002. The Specialty Underwriting segment had $5.1 million of net adverse prior period reserve adjustments for the year ended December 31, 2004, principally related to net adverse prior period reserve adjustments in the surety and A&H business lines partially offset by favorable development from marine and aviation. The net favorable prior period reserve adjustments for the year ended December 31, 2003 were $23.9 million, primarily related to A&H business. The International segment had $4.4 million of favorable net prior period reserve adjustments for the year ended December 31, 2004 and net adverse prior period reserve adjustments of $15.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. The favorable development in 2004 related primarily to 2003 Canadian property catastrophe, international and Asia business. The prior period reserve development for 2003 related primarily to general casualty business written in the U.S. and Canada on both a quota share and excess basis for accident years 1996 through 2002. The Bermuda segment reflected $190.3 million of net adverse prior period reserve adjustments for the year ended December 31, 2004 and $55.4 million of net adverse prior reserve adjustments for the year ended December 31, 2003. The development in the year ended December 31, 2004 was primarily the result of $149.1 million of A&E reserve development. For the year ended December 31, 2003, reserve adjustments included $33.5 million related to A&E exposures. All of the development related to asbestos exposures that were assumed through the September 19, 2000 loss portfolio transfer from Mt. McKinley in 2000. Aggregate reserve development related to A&E exposures was $159.4 million and $50.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The Company has A&E exposure related to contracts written by the Company prior to 1986 and to claim obligations acquired as part of the Mt. McKinley acquisition in September 2000. The reserve strengthening on business written by the Company, net of reinsurance, was $10.3 million and the net strengthening on the acquired business was $149.1 million in 2004. Substantially all of the Company A&E exposures relate to insurance and reinsurance contracts with coverage periods prior to 1986. Given the uncertainties surrounding the settlement of A&E losses, management is unable to establish a meaningful range for these obligations. (Dollars in millions) Segment Net Prior Period Reserve Adjustments Segment 2004 2003 U.S. Reinsurance $ 77 .7 $ 150 .9 U.S. Insurance 43 .3 58 .7 Specialty Underwriting 5 .1 (23 .9 ) International (4 .4 ) 15 .8 Bermuda 190 .3 55 .4 Total $ 312 .0 $ 256 .9 In all cases, the prior period development, sometimes referred to as reserve strengthening, reflects management judgment as to the implications of losses and claim information reported during the period on the Company reserve balances. The segment components of the increase in incurred losses and LAE in 2004 from 2003 were a 99.4% ($370.3 million) increase in the Bermuda operation, a 56.6% ($151.4 million) increase in the International operation, a 10.3% ($109.5 million) increase in the U.S Reinsurance operation, an 8.8% ($53.2 million) increase in the U.S. 44 Insurance operation and a 2.2% ($6.6 million) increase in the Specialty Underwriting operation. These changes reflect variability in premiums earned and changes in the loss expectation assumptions for business written, as well as the net prior period reserve development and catastrophe losses discussed above. Incurred losses and LAE for each operation were also impacted by generally improved pricing of the underlying business, as well as variability relating to changes in the mix of business by class and type, which in general reflected a more favorable mix. The Company loss ratio, which is calculated by dividing incurred losses and LAE by net premiums earned, increased by 4.8 percentage points to 74.4% in 2004 from 69.6% in 2003, reflecting the impact of the changes in premiums earned and incurred losses and LAE discussed above, as well as favorable changes in the underlying business mix and aggregate rates, terms and conditions. The following table shows the loss ratios for each of the Company operating segments for 2004 and 2003. The loss ratios for all operations were impacted by the factors noted above. Segment Loss Ratios Segment 2004 2003 U.S. Reinsurance 79 .3% 74 .4% U.S. Insurance 70 .3% 73 .5% Specialty Underwriting 65 .8% 63 .0% International 63 .9% 58 .0% Bermuda 82 .6% 66 .5% Segment underwriting expenses increased by 12.9% to $1,075.8 million in 2004 from $952.6 million in 2003. Commission, brokerage, taxes and fees increased by $111.2 million, principally reflecting increases in premium volume and changes in the mix of business. Segment other underwriting expenses increased by $11.9 million as the Company continues to expand operations to support its increased business volume. Contributing to the segment underwriting expense increases were a 47.5% ($62.8 million) increase in the Bermuda operation, a 40.4% ($49.6 million) increase in the International operation and a 6.6% ($24.7 million) increase in the U.S. Reinsurance operation, which were all partially offset by a 5.5% ($10.1 million) decrease in the U.S. Insurance operation and a 2.7% ($3.7 million) decrease in the Specialty Underwriting operation. The changes for each operation expenses principally resulted from changes in commission expenses related to changes in premium volume and business mix by class and type and, in some cases, changes in the use of specific reinsurance, as well as the underwriting performance of the underlying business. The Company expense ratio, which is calculated by dividing underwriting expenses by net premiums earned, was 24.4% in 2004 compared to 25.6% in 2003. Segment Expense Ratios Segment 2004 2003 U.S. Reinsurance 26 .9% 26 .1% U.S. Insurance 18 .7% 22 .5% Specialty Underwriting 29 .6% 29 .9% International 26 .3% 26 .6% Bermuda 21 .7% 23 .6% The Company combined ratio, which is the sum of the loss and expense ratios, increased by 3.6 percentage points to 98.8% in 2004 compared to 95.2% in 2003. 45 The following table shows the combined ratios for each of the Company operating segments in 2004 and 2003. The combined ratios for all operations were impacted by the loss and expense ratio variability noted above. Segment Combined Ratios Segment 2004 2003 U.S. Reinsurance 106 .2% 100 .5% U.S. Insurance 89 .0% 96 .0% Specialty Underwriting 95 .4% 92 .9% International 90 .2% 84 .6% Bermuda 104 .3% 90 .1% Investments. Net investment income increased 23.2% to $495.9 million in 2004 from $402.6 million in 2003, principally reflecting the effects of investing $1,487.6 million of cash flow from operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, as well as $320.0 of net proceeds from the issuance of junior subordinated debt securities in March 2004 and $250.0 of net proceeds from the issuance of senior notes in October 2004. The increase also reflected $32.7 million representing an atypical increase in the carrying value of a limited partnership investment. The following table shows a comparison of various investment yields for the periods indicated: 2004 2003 Imbedded pre-tax yield of cash and invested assets at December 31, 2004 and 2003 4 .7% 4 .8% Imbedded after-tax yield of cash and invested assets at December 31, 2004 and 2003 4 .1% 4 .1% Annualized pre-tax yield on average cash and invested assets for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 5 .0% 5 .1% Annualized after-tax yield on average cash and invested assets for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 4 .2% 4 .4% The Company, because of its historical income orientation, has generally considered total return, the combination of income yield and capital appreciation/depreciation, to be relatively less important as a measure of performance than its overall income yield. With changes the Company perceives in overall investment market conditions, and more specifically the acquisition of $496.5 million of equity securities into the overall investment portfolio in 2004, the Company is reweighting its view of total return. The following table provides a comparison of the Company total return by asset class to broadly accepted industry benchmarks for 2004 and 2003. 2004 2003 Fixed income portfolio total return 6 .5% 6 .2% Lehman bond aggregate 4 .3% 4 .1% Common equity portfolio total return 21 .9% 17 .0% S&P 500 10 .9% 28 .7% Net realized capital gains were $89.6 million in 2004, which reflected realized capital gains on the Company investments of $164.3 million, including $118.2 million on the sale of interest only strip investments, partially offset by $74.7 million of realized capital losses, which included $65.0 million related to the write-downs in the value of interest only strips deemed to be impaired on an other than temporary basis in accordance with EITF 99-20, prior to liquidation of the interest only strip portfolio during the second quarter of 2004. Net realized capital losses of $38.0 million in 2003 reflected realized capital losses on the Company investments of $88.7 million, which included $25.7 million relating to write-downs in the value of securities deemed to be impaired on an other than temporary basis and $46.2 million related to the impairment on interest only strips, 46 partially offset by $50.7 million of realized capital gains, which included $16.8 million of realized capital gains on sales of the interest only strips. The Company has one credit default swap, which it no longer writes, and five specialized equity put options in its product portfolio. These products meet the definition of a derivative under Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities ( FAS 133 ). Net derivative expense from these derivative transactions in 2004 was $2.7 million and net derivative income from these derivative transactions in 2003 was $5.9 million, with both periods principally reflecting changes in fair value for the specialized equity put options. See also Note 2 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Other income in 2004 was $0.7 million compared to other expense of $1.0 million in 2003. The decrease in net expense for 2004 was primarily due to variability in the impact of foreign exchange, partially offset by other miscellaneous expenses. Corporate underwriting expenses not allocated to segments increased to $6.5 million for 2004 compared with $6.0 million for 2003 as the Company expanded its infrastructure to support increased business volume. Interest expense in 2004 was $75.5 million compared to $57.3 million in 2003. Interest expense in 2004 included $42.0 million relating to the senior notes, $32.4 million relating to the junior subordinated debt securities and $1.2 million relating to borrowings under the Company revolving credit facility. Interest expense in 2003 reflected $38.9 million relating to the issuance of the senior notes, $17.0 million relating to the junior subordinated debt securities and $1.4 million relating to borrowings under the Company revolving credit facility. The increase in interest expense was due to the additional issuance of $320 million of junior subordinated debt securities in March 2004 and the issuance of $250 million of senior notes in October 2004. Income Taxes. The Company income tax expense is primarily a function of the statutory tax rates and corresponding net income in the jurisdictions where the Company operates, coupled with the impact from tax preferenced investment income. Variations between years generally reflect changes in the relative levels of pre-tax income between jurisdictions with different tax rates. Additionally, in conjunction with the transfer of the Company UK Branch to Bermuda Re, there were various tax issues giving rise to net tax expenses. The Company recognized income tax expense of $64.9 million in 2004 compared to $65.2 million in 2003 . Net Income. Net income was $494.9 million in 2004 compared to net income of $426.0 million in 2003, reflecting improved investment income and realized capital gains, partially offset by reduced underwriting profitability due to catastrophe losses. YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002 Premiums. Gross written premiums increased 60.7% to $4,573.8 million in 2003 from $2,846.5 million in 2002, as the Company took advantage of the general firming of rates, terms and conditions and selected growth opportunities, while continuing to maintain a disciplined underwriting approach. Premium growth areas included a 95.9% ($857.7 million) increase in the U.S. Reinsurance operation, principally related to a $519.4 million increase in treaty casualty business, a $253.9 million increase in treaty property business and a $62.8 million increase in facultative business. The International operation increased 42.9% ($156.3 million), primarily due to a $79.6 million increase in international business written through the Miami and New Jersey offices representing primarily Latin American business and a $67.4 million increase to Canadian business. The U.S. Insurance operation grew 30.2% ($248.1 million), principally as a result of an $89.5 million increase in workers compensation and a $73.2 million increase in excess and surplus lines insurance. The Bermuda operation increased $450.8 million, reflecting a $256.9 million increase in premiums from the UK branch, and a shift toward more traditional business resulting from the rollout of treaty, facultative and individual risk capabilities in Bermuda. The Specialty Underwriting operation increased 2.9% ($14.3 million), resulting primarily from a $38.0 million increase in A&H business and a $19.0 million decrease in marine and aviation. 47 Ceded premiums increased to $258.4 million in 2003 from $208.9 million in 2002, principally reflecting growth in specific reinsurance of the Company primary insurance business, which increased from $116.1 million to $146.4 million. In addition, ceded premiums for 2003 included $49.6 million in adjustment premiums relating to claims made under the 2000 accident year aggregate excess of loss element of the Company corporate retrocessional programs, while ceded premiums for 2002 included $5.1 million and $49.4 million in adjustment premium relating to claims made under the 2001 and 2000 accident year aggregate excess of loss elements of the Company corporate retrocessional programs, respectively. Net written premiums increased by 63.6% to $4,315.4 million in 2003 from $2,637.6 million in 2002, reflecting the increase in gross written premiums, combined with the growth in ceded premiums. Premium Revenues. Net premiums earned increased by 64.4% to $3,737.9 million in 2003 from $2,273.7 million in 2002. Contributing to this increase was a 96.0% ($697.5 million) increase in the U.S. Reinsurance operation, a 45.1% ($143.4 million) increase in the International operation, a 43.7% ($250.5 million) increase in the U.S. Insurance operation, a $363.8 million increase in the Bermuda operation and a 1.9% ($9.0 million) increase in the Specialty Underwriting operation. All of these changes reflect period to period changes in net written premiums and business mix together with normal variability in earnings patterns. Business mix changes occur not only as the Company shifts emphasis between products, lines of business, distribution channels and markets but also as individual contracts renew or non-renew, almost always with changes in coverage, structure, prices and/or terms, and as new contracts are accepted with coverages, structures, prices and/or terms different from those of expiring contracts. As premium reporting and earnings and loss and commission characteristics derive from the provisions of individual contracts, the continuous turnover of individual contracts, arising from both strategic shifts and day to day underwriting, can and does introduce appreciable background variability in various underwriting line items. Expenses. Incurred loss and LAE increased by 59.6% to $2,600.2 million in 2003 from $1,629.4 million in 2002. The increase in incurred losses and LAE was principally attributable to the increase in net premiums earned, the impact of changes in the Company mix of business and reserve adjustments for prior period losses. Incurred losses and LAE in 2003 reflected ceded losses and LAE of $278.4 million compared to ceded losses and LAE in 2002 of $287.7 million. The ceded losses and LAE in 2003 included $85.0 million of losses ceded under the 2000 accident year aggregate excess of loss component of the Company corporate retrocessional program and $81.1 million under the LM/Mt. McKinley reinsurance agreement. The ceded losses and LAE in 2002 included $11.0 million and $90.0 million of losses ceded under the 2001 and 2000 accident year aggregate excess of loss component of the Company corporate retrocessional program, respectively, and $56.7 million under the LM/Mt. McKinley reinsurance agreement. 48 Incurred losses and LAE include catastrophe losses, which include the impact of both current period events and favorable and adverse development on prior period events, and are net of reinsurance. A catastrophe is an event that causes a pre-tax loss on property exposures of at least $5.0 million before corporate level reinsurance and taxes. Catastrophe losses, net of contract specific cessions, were $36.8 million in 2003, relating principally to the May 2003 tornado and hailstorm events and hurricanes Fabian and Isabel, compared to $30.2 million in 2002. (Dollars in millions) Segment Net Catastrophe Losses Segment 2003 2002 U.S. Reinsurance $ 23 .9 $ 5 .4 U.S. Insurance 1 .4 - Specialty Underwriting 3 .2 1 .1 International 1 .1 18 .2 Bermuda 7 .2 5 .5 Total $ 36 .8 $ 30 .2 Net adverse prior period reserve adjustments for the year ended December 31, 2003 were $256.9 million, which were net of a cession of $85 million under the 2000 accident year aggregate excess of loss component of the Company corporate retrocessional program. For the year ended December 31, 2002, net adverse prior period reserve adjustments were $140.1 million, which were net of cessions of $11 million and $90 million under the 2001 and 2000 accident year aggregate excess of loss component of the Company corporate retrocessional program, respectively. The U.S. Reinsurance segment accounted for $134.2 million and $96.7 million of the non-A&E net prior period reserve adjustments for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The two principal underwriting areas responsible for these deficiencies are professional liability and general casualty. During the late 1990s and early 2000s, there had been a proliferation of claims relating to bankruptcies and other financial management improprieties. This increased number of claims combined with larger claims has significantly increased incurred losses on the professional liability policies. In the general casualty area, the Company continues to experience losses greater than historical trends for accident years 1998 through 2003. These losses are being driven by adverse trends in litigation and economic variability. In both the professional liability and general casualty reinsurance areas, the Company relies upon loss reports from ceding companies. Although the Company generally records reserves at higher levels than those reported by ceding companies, actual reported results have exceeded the initial loss indications. The reserve adjustments in these areas were partially offset by favorable reserve development relating to property reinsurance for the 2002 accident year. The U.S. Insurance segment reflected $58.7 million and $14.0 million of net prior period reserve adjustments for years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, principally due to California workers compensation insurance. This was a relatively new book of business and was written in a challenging political and economic environment. While management believes the cumulative results through 2003 remain positive, there has been some deterioration in claim frequency and severity related to accident years 2001 and 2002. The Specialty Underwriting segment had favorable net prior period reserve adjustments of $23.9 million and $0.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The favorable adjustments for 2003, related primarily to A&H business and cessions under the corporate retrocessional program and related principally to the 2000 through 2002 accident years. 49 The International segment had an unfavorable net prior period reserve adjustment of $15.8 million and a favorable net prior period reserve adjustment of $6.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. These reserve adjustments relate primarily to general casualty business written in the U.S. and Canada on both a quota share and excess basis for accident years 1996 through 2002, with the larger development on the 1998 through 2000 years. The Bermuda segment reflected $21.9 million of unfavorable non-A&E net prior period reserve adjustments for the year ended December 31, 2003 and $11.7 million of development for the year ended December 31, 2002. Reserve development related to A&E exposures were $50.2 million and $23.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The Company has A&E exposure related to contracts written by the Company prior to 1986 and to claim obligations acquired as part of the Mt. McKinley acquisition in September 2000. The reserve strengthening on business written by the Company, net of reinsurance, was $16.7 million in the U.S. Reinsurance segment and the net strengthening on the acquired business was $33.5 million in the Bermuda segment in 2004. Substantially all of the Company A&E exposures relate to insurance and reinsurance contracts with coverage periods prior to 1986. (Dollars in millions) Segment Net Prior Period Reserve Adjustments Segment 2003 2002 U.S. Reinsurance $ 150 .9 $ 102 .9 U.S. Insurance 58 .7 14 .0 Specialty Underwriting (23 .9 ) (0 .4) International 15 .8 (6 .2) Bermuda 55 .4 29 .8 Total $ 256 .9 $ 140 .1 In all cases, the prior period development reflects management judgment as to the implications of losses and claim information reported during the period on the Company reserve balances. The segment components of the increase in incurred losses and LAE in 2003 from 2002 were a 97.6% ($523.1 million) increase in the U.S. Reinsurance operation, an 45.1% ($83.2 million) increase in the International operation, a 39.9% ($172.7 million) increase in the U.S Insurance operation and a $209.7 million increase in the Bermuda operation, partially offset by a 5.7% ($18.0 million) decrease in the Specialty Underwriting operation. These changes generally reflect increases in premiums earned, changes in the current year loss expectation assumptions for business written, generally reflecting continued improvement in market conditions and pricing, an increase in catastrophe losses and the net prior period reserve development discussed above. Incurred losses and LAE for each operation were also impacted by variability relating to changes in the level of premium volume and the mix of business by class and type. The Company loss ratio, which is calculated by dividing incurred losses and LAE by net premiums earned, decreased by 2.1 percentage points to 69.6% in 2003 from 71.7% in 2002, reflecting the premiums earned and incurred losses and LAE discussed above, as well as the general firming of rates, terms and conditions and changes in business mix. 50 The following table shows the loss ratios for each of the Company operating segments for 2003 and 2002. The loss ratios for all operations were impacted by the expense factors noted above. Segment Loss Ratios Segment 2003 2002 U.S. Reinsurance 74 .4% 73 .8% U.S. Insurance 73 .5% 75 .5% Specialty Underwriting 63 .0% 68 .1% International 58 .0% 58 .0% Bermuda 66 .5% 83 .0% Segment underwriting expenses increased by 54.0% to $952.6 million in 2003 from $618.5 million in 2002. Commission, brokerage, taxes and fees increased by $312.2 million, principally reflecting increases in premium volume and changes in the mix of business, together with the Company emphasis on acquisition cost control. Segment other underwriting expenses increased by $21.9 million as the Company expanded operations to support its increased business volume. Contributing to these underwriting expense increases were an 84.8% ($170.9 million) increase in the U.S. Reinsurance operation, a 36.3% ($32.7 million) increase in the International operation, a 24.7% ($36.7 million) increase in the U.S. Insurance operation, a $90.7 million increase in the Bermuda operation and a 2.3% ($3.1 million) increase in the Specialty Underwriting operation. The changes for each operation expenses principally resulted from changes in commission expenses related to changes in premium volume and business mix by class and type and, in some cases, changes in the use of specific reinsurance as well as the underwriting performance of the underlying business. The Company expense ratio, which is calculated by dividing underwriting expenses by net premiums earned, was 25.6% in 2003 compared to 27.3% in 2002.

The following table shows the combined ratios for each of the Company operating segments in 2003 and 2002. The combined ratios for all operations were impacted by the loss and expense ratio variability noted above.

Net investment income increased 14.8% to $402.6 million in 2003 from $350.7 million in 2002, principally reflecting the effects of investing $1,653.8 million of cash flow from operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, $209.9 million of net proceeds from Holdings issuance of junior 51 subordinated debt securities in November 2002 and $316.8 million of net proceeds from the issuance of Group common shares in April 2003, all partially offset by the effects of the lower interest rate environment. The following table shows a comparison of various investment yields for the periods indicated: 2003 2002 Imbedded pre-tax yield of cash and invested assets at December 31, 2003 and 2002 4 .8% 5 .3% Imbedded after-tax yield of cash and invested assets at December 31, 2003 and 2002 4 .1% 4 .6% Annualized pre-tax yield on average cash and invested assets for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 5 .1% 5 .6% Annualized after-tax yield on average cash and invested assets for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 4 .4% 4 .6% The Company, because of its income orientation, considers total return, the combination of income yield and capital appreciation/depreciation, to be less relevant as a measure of performance than may be the case for investment portfolios managed with alternate strategies. The following table provides a comparison of the Company total return by asset class to broadly accepted industry benchmarks for 2003 and 2002. 2003 2002 Fixed income portfolio total return 6 .2% 8 .7% Lehman bond aggregate 4 .1% 10 .3% Common equity portfolio total return 17 .0% (14 .4)% S&P 500 28 .7% (22 .1)% Net realized capital losses were $38.0 million in 2003, reflecting realized capital losses on the Company investments of $88.7 million, which included $25.7 million relating to write-downs in the value of securities deemed to be impaired on an other than temporary basis, and $46.2 million related to the impairment on interest only strips in accordance with EITF 99-20, partially offset by $50.7 million of realized capital gains, which included $16.8 million of realized capital gains on sales of the interest only strips, compared to net realized capital losses of $50.0 million in 2002. The net realized capital losses in 2002 reflected realized capital losses on the Company investments of $142.8 million, which included $101.3 million relating to write-downs in the value of securities deemed to be impaired on an other than temporary basis, of which $33.0 million was for WorldCom, Inc., partially offset by $92.8 million of realized capital gains. The company owned no interest only strips during 2002. The Company has a small number of credit default swaps, which it no longer writes, and specialized equity put options in its product portfolio. These products meet the definition of a derivative under FAS 133. Net derivative income from these derivative transactions in 2003, was $5.9 million, which principally reflects changes in fair value of the specialized equity put options, compared to net derivative expenses of $14.5 million in 2002, which principally related to the specialized equity put options. See also Note 2 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Other expense in 2003 was $1.0 million compared to $2.1 million in 2002. The decrease in net expenses for 2003 was due to foreign exchange gains, partially offset by other miscellaneous expenses. Corporate underwriting expenses not allocated to segments increased to $6.0 million for 2003 compared with $3.2 million for 2002 as the Company expanded its infrastructure to support increased business volume. Interest expense in 2003 was $57.3 million compared to $44.6 million in 2002. Interest expense in 2003 reflected $38.9 million relating to the senior notes, $17.0 million relating to the junior subordinated debt securities and $1.4 million relating to borrowings under the Company revolving credit facility. Interest 52 expense in 2002 reflected $38.9 million relating to the issuance of the senior notes, $2.2 million relating to the junior subordinated debt securities and $3.5 million relating to borrowings under the Company revolving credit facility. Income Taxes. The Company recognized income tax expense of $65.2 million in 2003 compared to $30.7 million in 2002 . The increase in taxes generally reflects the improved underwriting and investment income results. Net Income. Net income was $426.0 million in 2003 compared to net income of $231.3 million in 2002, reflecting improved underwriting and investment income results partly offset by increased income taxes. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The following is a summary of the critical accounting policies related to accounting estimates that (1) require management to make assumptions about highly uncertain matters and (2) could materially impact the consolidated financial statements if management made different assumptions. LOSS AND LAE RESERVES. The Company most critical accounting policy is the determination of its loss and LAE reserves. The Company maintains reserves to cover its estimated ultimate liability for losses and LAE with respect to reported and unreported claims relating to both its insurance and reinsurance businesses. Because reserves are estimates of ultimate losses and LAE, management, using a variety of statistical and actuarial techniques, monitors reserve adequacy over time, evaluating new information as it becomes known and adjusting reserves as necessary. Management considers many factors when setting reserves, including: (1) the Company exposure base, generally its premiums earned; (2) its expected loss ratios on current year writings as determined through extensive interaction between its underwriters and actuaries by product and class categories; (3) internal actuarial methodologies which analyze the Company loss reporting and payment experience with similar cases, information from ceding companies and historical trends, such as reserving patterns, loss payments and product mix; (4) current legal interpretations of coverage and liability; (5) economic conditions; and (6) the uncertainties discussed below regarding reserve requirements for A&E claims. Based on these considerations, management believes that adequate provision has been made for the Company insurance and reinsurance loss and LAE reserves. Actual losses and LAE ultimately paid may deviate, perhaps substantially, from such reserves, impacting income in the period in which the change in reserves is made. See also Note 1 of Notes of the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company acknowledges that there is more uncertainty in establishing loss reserves on assumed business as compared to direct business. At December 31, 2004 the Company had assumed loss reserves of $5,939.1 million, of which $313.0 million were loss reserves on A&E business. Reserving for assumed reinsurance requires evaluating loss information received from ceding companies. Depending on the type of contract and the contractual reporting requirements, ceding companies report losses to the Company in many forms. Generally, proportional/quota share contracts require the submission of a monthly/quarterly account, which includes premium and loss settlement activity for the period with corresponding reserves as established by the ceding company. This information is recorded into the Company records. For certain proportional contracts, there is also an individual loss reporting clause, which requires a detailed loss report on claims that exceed a certain dollar threshold or relate to a particular type of loss. Excess of loss and facultative contracts generally require individual loss reporting with precautionary notices generally sent when losses reach a significant percentage of the attachment point of the contract. All individual loss reports and supporting claim information are managed by the Company experienced claims staff. Based on the evaluation of the claim, the Company may choose to establish additional case reserves over that reported by the ceding company. The Underwriting, Claim, Reinsurance Accounting and Internal Audit departments of the Company perform various reviews of the ceding carriers, particularly larger ceding carriers, to ensure that underwriting and claims procedures meet required standards. The claim information received from the ceding 53 companies is compiled into loss development triangles. Accepted actuarial methodologies, supplemented by judgment where appropriate, are then used to develop the appropriate IBNR for the Company. Included in the determination of IBNR, is a factor for reporting lags of the ceded carriers. Each quarter, the Company compares its actual reported losses for the quarter and cumulatively since the most recently completed reserve study to the expected reported losses for the respective period, which may result in additional reserving actions. This is done by aggregate class and/or type of business. This information is used as a tool in the judgmental process by which management assesses the overall adequacy of loss and LAE reserves. ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURES. The Company continues to receive claims under expired contracts, both insurance and reinsurance, asserting alleged injuries and/or damages relating to or resulting from environmental pollution and hazardous substances, including asbestos. The Company asbestos claims typically involve potential liability for bodily injury from exposure to asbestos or for property damage resulting from asbestos or products containing asbestos. The Company environmental claims typically involve potential liability for (a) the mitigation or remediation of environmental contamination or (b) bodily injury or property damages caused by the release of hazardous substances into the land, air or water. The Company reserves include an estimate of the Company ultimate liability for A&E claims. This estimate is made based on judgmental assessment of the underlying exposures as the result of (1) long and variable reporting delays, both from insureds to insurance companies and from ceding companies to reinsurers; (2) historical data, which is more limited and variable on A&E losses than historical information on other types of casualty claims; and (3) unique aspects of A&E exposures for which ultimate value cannot be estimated using traditional reserving techniques. There are significant uncertainties in estimating the amount of the Company potential losses from A&E claims. Among the uncertainties are: (a) potentially long waiting periods between exposure and manifestation of any bodily injury or property damage; (b) difficulty in identifying sources of asbestos or environmental contamination; (c) difficulty in properly allocating responsibility and/or liability for asbestos or environmental damage; (d) changes in underlying laws and judicial interpretation of those laws; (e) the potential for an asbestos or environmental claim to involve many insurance providers over many policy periods; (f) questions concerning interpretation and application of insurance and reinsurance coverage; and (g) uncertainty regarding the number and identity of insureds with potential asbestos or environmental exposure. With respect to asbestos claims in particular, several additional factors have emerged in recent years that further compound the difficulty in estimating the Company liability. These developments include: (a) continued growth in the number of claims filed, in part reflecting a much more aggressive plaintiff bar and including claims against defendants formerly regarded as peripheral ; (b) a disproportionate percentage of claims filed by individuals with no functional injury, which should have little to no financial value but that have increasingly been considered in jury verdicts and settlements; (c) the growth in the number and significance of bankruptcy filings by companies as a result of asbestos claims (including, more recently, bankruptcy filings in which companies attempt to resolve their asbestos liabilities in a manner that is prejudicial to insurers and forecloses insurers from the negotiation of bankruptcy plans); (d) the concentration of claims in a small number of states that favor plaintiffs; (e) the growth in the number of claims that might impact the general liability portion of insurance policies rather than the product liability portion; (f) measures adopted by specific courts to ameliorate the worst procedural abuses; (g) an increase in settlement values being paid to asbestos claimants, especially those with cancer or functional impairment; (h) legislation in some states to address asbestos litigation issues; and (i) the potential that other states or the U.S. Congress may adopt legislation on asbestos litigation. Management believes that these uncertainties and factors continue to render reserves for A&E and particularly asbestos losses significantly less subject to traditional actuarial analysis than reserves for other types of losses. Given these uncertainties, management believes that no meaningful range for such ultimate losses can be established. The Company establishes reserves to the extent that, in the judgment of management, the facts and prevailing law reflect an exposure for the Company or its ceding companies. 54 In connection with the acquisition of Mt. McKinley, which has significant exposure to A&E claims, LM provided reinsurance to Mt. McKinley covering 80% ($160.0 million) of the first $200.0 million of any adverse development of Mt. McKinley reserves as of September 19, 2000 and The Prudential guaranteed LM obligations to Mt. McKinley. Cessions under this reinsurance agreement exhausted the limit available under the contract at December 31, 2003. Due to the uncertainties discussed above, the ultimate losses may vary materially from current loss reserves and, depending on coverage under the Company various reinsurance arrangements, could have a material adverse effect on the Company future financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. See also Note 1 and 3 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. With respect to Mt. McKinley, where the Company has a direct relationship with policyholders, the Company aggressive litigation posture and the uncertainties inherent in the asbestos coverage and bankruptcy litigation have provided an opportunity to actively engage in settlement negotiations with a number of those policyholders who have potentially significant asbestos liabilities. Those discussions are oriented towards achieving reasonable negotiated settlements that limit Mt. McKinley liability to a given policyholder to a sum certain. In 2004, the Company has concluded such settlements or reached agreement in principle with 9 of its high profile policyholders. The Company currently has identified 15 policyholders based on their past claim activity and/or potential future liabilities as High Profile Policyholders and its settlement efforts are generally directed at such policyholders, in part because their exposures have developed to the point where both the policyholder and the Company have sufficient information to be motivated to settle. The Company believes that this active approach will ultimately result in a more cost-effective liquidation of Mt. McKinley liabilities than a passive approach, although it may also introduce additional variability in Mt. McKinley losses and cash flows as reserves are adjusted to reflect the development of negotiations and, ultimately, potentially accelerated settlements. There is less potential for similar settlements with respect to the Company reinsurance asbestos claims. Ceding companies, with their direct obligation to insureds and overall responsibility for claim settlements, are not consistently aggressive in developing claim settlement information and conveying this information to reinsurers, which can introduce significant and perhaps inappropriate delays in the reporting of asbestos claims/exposures to reinsurers. These delays not only extend the timing of reinsurance claim settlements, but also restrict the information available to estimate the reinsurers ultimate exposure. At December 31, 2004 the Company had asbestos loss reserves of $632.3 million, of which $313.0 million was for assumed business and $319.3 was for direct business. See the reserve discussion under the heading Financial Condition. REINSURANCE RECEIVABLES. The Company utilizes reinsurance agreements to reduce its exposure to large claims and catastrophic loss occurrences. These agreements provide for recovery from reinsurers of a portion of losses and loss expenses under certain circumstances without relieving the insurer of its obligation to the policyholder. In the event reinsurers were unable to meet their obligations under these reinsurance agreements or were able to successfully challenge losses ceded by the Company under the reinsurance contracts, the Company would not be able to realize the full value of the reinsurance recoverable balance. In some cases, the Company may hold partial collateral, including letters of credit and funds held arrangements, for these agreements. The Company establishes reserves for uncollectible balances based on management assessment of the collectibility of the outstanding balances. To minimize exposure from uncollectible reinsurance receivables, the Company has a reinsurance credit security committee that generally evaluates the financial strength of a reinsurer prior to entering into a reinsurance arrangement. Additionally, creditworthy foreign reinsurers of business written in the U.S. are generally required to secure their obligations. Management believes that adequate provision has been made for the Company uncollectible balances. Actual uncollectible amounts may vary, perhaps substantially, from such reserves, impacting income in the period in which the change in reserves is made. See also Note 1 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. See also Financial Condition. PREMIUMS WRITTEN AND EARNED. Premiums written by the Company are earned ratably over the periods of the related insurance and reinsurance contracts or policies. Unearned premium reserves are established to cover the 55 remainder of the unexpired contract period. Such reserves are established based upon reports received from ceding companies or computed using pro rata methods based on statistical data. Premiums earned, and the related costs, which have not yet been reported to the Company, are estimated and accrued. Standard accepted actuarial methodologies are used to estimate earned but not reported premium at each financial reporting date. The following table displays the estimated earned premiums before reduction for related expenses for the periods indicated at December 31: (Dollars in thousands) Earned But Not Reported Premium By Segment 2004 2003 2002 U.S. Reinsurance $ 485,880 $ 391,885 $ 140,823 U.S. Insurance 38,487 38,430 31,013 Specialty Underwriting 136,687 105,865 106,245 International 216,632 169,847 122,760 Bermuda 233,940 120,349 53,721 Total $ 1,111,626 $ 826,376 $ 454,562 These earned but not reported premiums are combined with reported premiums to comprise the exposure base for determining the Company incurred losses and loss and LAE reserves. Commission expense and incurred losses related to the change in earned but not reported premium is not differentiated from current period reported premium and the effects of both are included in current period company and segment financial results. See also Note 1 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. INVESTMENT VALUATION. The Company investment portfolio consists of investments available for sale and accordingly these securities are marked to market on a quarterly basis. Most securities are traded on national exchanges where market values are readily available. The Company holds some privately placed securities that are either valued by an investment advisor or by the Company using cash flow projections. Through the second quarter of 2004 the Company owned interest only strips that were accounted for in accordance with EITF 99-20, which set forth the rules for determining when these securities must be written down to fair value due to impairment. Unrealized gains and losses from market fluctuations are reflected as comprehensive income, while market value declines that are considered other than temporary impairments are reflected in the income statement as realized capital losses. The Company considers many factors when determining whether a market value decline is other than temporary, including: (1) the length of time the market value has been below book value, (2) the credit strength of the issuer, (3) the issuer market sector, (4) the length of time to maturity and (5) for asset backed securities, increases in prepayments. If management assessments change in the future, the Company may ultimately record a realized loss after management originally concluded that the decline in value was temporary. See also Note 1 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. FINANCIAL CONDITION CASH AND INVESTED ASSETS. Aggregate invested assets, including cash and short-term investments, were $11,530.2 million at December 31, 2004, $9,321.3 million at December 31, 2003 and $7,265.6 million at December 31, 2002. The increase in cash and invested assets in 2004 from 2003 resulted primarily from $1,487.6 million in cash flows from operations generated during 2004, $320.0 million from net proceeds of the issuance of junior subordinated debt securities, $250 million from net proceeds of the issuance of senior notes and $40.1 million in net pre-tax unrealized appreciation of the Company investments, partially offset by a $70 million repayment on the revolving credit agreement. The increase in cash and invested assets in 2003 from 2002 resulted primarily from $1,653.8 million in cash flows from operations generated during 2003, $316.8 56 million of net proceeds from the offering of common shares in April 2003 and $68.1 million in net unrealized appreciation of the Company investments. The Company current investment strategy generally seeks to maximize after-tax income through a high quality, diversified, taxable and tax-preferenced fixed maturity portfolio, while maintaining an adequate level of liquidity. Although not a primary objective, the Company actively considers total return performance, in particular as respects the exposures of its fixed income portfolio to variability in unrealized appreciation/depreciation as interest rates shift. The Company mix of taxable and tax-preferenced investments is adjusted continuously, consistent with the Company current and projected operating results, market conditions and the Company tax position. The fixed maturities in the investment portfolio are comprised of available for sale securities. Additionally, the Company is expanding its investments in equity securities, principally public equity index securities, which it believes will enhance the risk-adjusted total return of the investment portfolio. Commencing with the second quarter of 2003 and through the second quarter of 2004, the Company had investments in interest only strips. These investments were aimed at mitigating potential decreases in unrealized appreciation on the Company fixed income portfolio during a period where management judged that there was extraordinary potential for an increase in general interest rates. These fixed maturity securities give the holder the right to receive interest payments at a stated coupon rate on an underlying pool of mortgages. The interest payments on the outstanding mortgages are guaranteed by entities generally rated AAA. The ultimate cash flow from these investments is primarily dependent upon the average life of the mortgage pool. Generally, as market interest rates and, more specifically, market mortgage rates decline, mortgagees tend to refinance which will decrease the average life of a mortgage pool and decrease expected cash flows. Conversely, as market interest rates and, more specifically, market mortgage rates rise, repayments will slow and the ultimate cash flows will tend to rise. Accordingly, the market value of these investments tends to increase as general interest rates rise and decline as general interest rates fall. These movements are generally counter to the impact of interest rate movements on the Company other fixed income investments. The Company liquidated its interest only strip investment portfolio in the second quarter of 2004, at which point management concluded the extraordinary potential for increases in general interest rates had subsided to a more normal level. 57 The tables below summarize the composition of and the characteristics of the Company investment portfolio at December 31: 2004 2003 2002 Fixed maturities 86 .3% 93 .6% 93 .4% Equity securities 5 .6% 1 .7% 0 .7% Short-term investments 5 .1% 1 .6% 2 .3% Other invested assets 1 .4% 1 .1% 0 .7% Cash 1 .6% 2 .0% 2 .9% Total investments and cash 100 .0% 100 .0% 100 .0% 2004 2003 2002 Fixed income portfolio duration 5.2 years 4.2 years 5.4 years Fixed income composite credit quality Aa2 Aa2 Aa2 Imbedded end of period yield, pre-tax 4 .7% 4 .8% 5 .3% Imbedded end of period yield, after-tax 4 .1% 4 .1% 4 .6% The increase in short-term investments is due principally to maintaining liquidity to repay the maturing $250 million of senior notes due in March 2005. The increase in equity securities reflects a modest and continuing reweighting of the Company target investment mix. The Company, because of its historical income orientation, has generally considered total return, the combination of income yield and capital appreciation/depreciation, to be relatively less important as a measure of performance than its overall income yield. With changes the Company perceives in overall investment market conditions, and more specifically the acquisition of $496.5 million of equity securities into the overall investment portfolio in 2004, the Company is reexamining the weighting of total return in its overall investment strategy. The following table provides a comparison of the Company total return by asset class to broadly accepted industry benchmarks for the periods indicated: Years Ended December 31, 2004 2003 Fixed income portfolio total return 6 .5% 6 .2% Lehman bond aggregate 4 .3% 4 .1% Common equity portfolio total return 21 .9% 17 .0% S&P 500 10 .9% 28 .7% REINSURANCE RECEIVABLES. Reinsurance receivables for both paid and unpaid losses totaled $1,210.8 million at December 31, 2004, $1,284.1 million at December 31, 2003, and $1,116.4 million at December 31, 2002. At December 31, 2004, $405.0 million, or 33.4%, was receivable from subsidiaries of London Life. These receivables are effectively secured by a combination of letters of credit and funds held arrangements under which the Company has retained the premium payments due the retrocessionaire, recognized liabilities for such amounts and reduced such liabilities as payments are due from the retrocessionaire. In addition, $160.0 million, or 13.2%, was receivable from LM, whose obligations are guaranteed by The Prudential, $132.5 million, or 10.9%, was receivable from Transatlantic and $100.0 million, or 8.3%, was receivable from Continental, which is partially secured by funds held arrangements. No other retrocessionaire accounted for more than 5% of the Company receivables. 58 LOSS AND LAE RESERVES. Gross loss and LAE reserves totaled $7,836.3 million at December 31, 2004, $6,361.2 million at December 31, 2003, and $4,905.6 million at December 31, 2002. The increase in 2004, 2003 and 2002 is primarily attributable to increased premiums earned, increase in catastrophe losses, net prior period reserve adjustments in select areas and normal variability in claim settlements. Effective January 1, 2004, Everest Re sold its United Kingdom branch to Bermuda Re. Business for this branch was previously included in the International segment and is now included in the Bermuda segment. Due to the sale and in accordance with FAS 131, the Company restated the International and Bermuda segments for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 to conform to December 31, 2004 segment reporting. The following tables summarize gross outstanding loss and LAE reserves, segregated into case reserves and IBNR reserves, which are managed on a combined basis, for the periods indicated. Gross Reserves By Segment As of December 31, 2004 (Dollars in thousands) Case Reserves IBNR Reserves Total Reserves % of Total U.S. Reinsurance $ 1,354,647 $ 2,174,762 $ 3,529,409 45 .0% U.S. Insurance 599,200 793,451 1,392,651 17 .7% Specialty Underwriting 215,187 158,793 373,980 4 .8% International 421,804 359,073 780,877 10 .0% Bermuda 425,273 605,791 1,031,064 13 .2% Total excluding A&E 3,016,111 4,091,870 7,107,981 90 .7% A&E 571,939 156,386 728,325 9 .3% Total including A&E $ 3,588,050 $ 4,248,256 $ 7,836,306 100 .0% As of December 31, 2003 (Dollars in thousands) Case Reserves IBNR Reserves Total Reserves % of Total U.S. Reinsurance $ 1,271,956 $ 1,835,902 $ 3,107,858 48 .9% U.S. Insurance 445,802 620,895 1,066,697 16 .7% Specialty Underwriting 228,572 80,839 309,411 4 .9% International 353,686 149,717 503,403 7 .9% Bermuda 256,059 352,559 608,618 9 .6% Total excluding A&E 2,556,075 3,039,912 5,595,987 88 .0% A&E 483,433 281,824 765,257 12 .0% Total including A&E $ 3,039,508 $ 3,321,736 $ 6,361,244 100 .0% 59 As of December 31, 2002 (Dollars in thousands) Case Reserves IBNR Reserves Total Reserves % of Total U.S. Reinsurance $ 1,143,500 $ 1,459,749 $ 2,603,249 53 .1% U.S. Insurance 242,306 452,290 694,596 14 .2% Specialty Underwriting 234,809 50,929 285,738 5 .8% International 295,212 59,052 354,264 7 .2% Bermuda 187,585 112,228 299,813 6 .1% Total excluding A&E 2,103,412 2,134,248 4,237,660 86 .4% A&E 430,115 237,807 667,922 13 .6% Total including A&E $ 2,533,527 $ 2,372,055 $ 4,905,582 100 .0% The increases by segment generally reflect increases in earned premium, changes in business mix and the impact of reserve reestimations together with claim settlement activity. The fluctuations for A&E reflect the impact of reserve reevaluations and claim settlement activity. The Company loss and LAE reserves reflect estimates of ultimate claim liability. Such estimates are reevaluated on an ongoing basis, including re-estimates of prior period reserves, taking into consideration all available information and, in particular, newly reported loss and claim experience. The effect of such reevaluations impacts incurred losses for the current period. The Company notes that its analytical methods and processes operate at multiple levels including individual contracts, groupings of like contracts, classes and lines of business, internal business units, segments, legal entities, and in the aggregate. The complexities of the Company business and operations require analyses and adjustments, both qualitative and quantitative, at these various levels. Additionally, the attribution of reserves, change in reserves and incurred losses, between accident year and underwriting year requires adjustments and allocations, both qualitative and quantitative, at these various levels. All of these processes, methods and practices appropriately balance actuarial science, business expertise and management judgment in a manner intended to assure the accuracy, precision and consistency of the Company reserving practices, which are fundamental to the Company operation. The Company notes however, that the underlying reserves remain estimates, which are subject to variation, and that the relative degree of variability is generally least when reserves are considered in the aggregate and generally increases as the focus shifts to more granular data levels. There can be no assurance that reserves for, and losses from, claim obligations will not increase in the future. However, management believes that the Company existing reserves and reserving methodologies lessen the probability that any such increase would have a material adverse effect on the Company financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In this context, the Company notes that over the past 10 years, its past calendar year operations have been affected variably by effects from prior period reserve re-estimates, with such effects ranging from a favorable $35.4 million, representing 1.2% of the net prior period reserves for the year in which the adjustment was made, to an unfavorable $312.0 million, representing 6.0% of the net prior period reserves for the year in which the adjustment was made. The Company has noted that variability has increased over the past three years and has taken actions to attempt to reduce this year to year variability prospectively. 60 The following table represents the reserve levels and ranges as of December 31, 2004 for each of the Company business segments. Outstanding Reserves and Ranges By Segment (1) As of December 31, 2004 (Dollars in thousands) As Reported Low Range % (2) Low Range (2) High Range % (2) High Range (2) Gross Reserves By Segment U.S. Reinsurance $ 3,529,409 -7.4% $ 3,267,944 8.1% $ 3,813,682 U.S. Insurance 1,392,651 -5.0% 1,323,018 5.0% 1,462,284 Specialty Underwriting 373,980 -8.3% 342,944 8.3% 405,016 International 780,877 -5.5% 737,795 6.2% 828,909 Bermuda 1,031,064 -6.2% 967,138 6.2% 1,094,990 Total Gross Reserves (excluding A&E) 7,107,981 -6.6% 6,638,840 7.0% 7,604,880 A&E (All Segments) (3) (4) 728,325 NA 728,325 NA 728,325 Total Gross Reserves (4) $ 7,836,306 NA $ 7,367,165 NA $ 8,333,205 ______________ (1) There can be no assurance that reserves will not ultimately exceed the indicated ranges, requiring additional income statement expense. (2) Although totals are displayed for both the low range and high range amounts, it should be noted that statistically the range of the total is not equal to the sum of the ranges of the segments. (3) Given the uncertainties surrounding the settlement of A&E losses, management is unable to establish a range for these obligations. As a result, which relate principally to the U.S. Reinsurance and Bermuda segments, have been segregated from reserves for which a range has been determined (4) NA means not applicable. The Company has included ranges for loss reserve estimates determined by the Company actuaries, which are derived through a combination of objective and subjective criteria. The Company notes that its presentation of this information is not directly comparable to similar presentations of other companies as there are no consistently applied actuarial or accounting standards governing such presentations. The Company further notes that its recorded reserves reflect the Company best point estimate of its liabilities and that its actuarial methodologies focus on such point estimates around which ranges are subsequently developed. Depending on the specific segment, the range derived for the loss reserves, excluding reserves for A&E exposures, ranges from minus 5.0% to minus 8.3% for the low range and from plus 5.0% to plus 8.3% for the high range. Both the higher and lower ranges are associated with the Specialty Underwriting segment. Within each range, management best estimate of loss reserves is based on the point estimate derived by the Company actuaries in detailed reserve studies. Such ranges are necessarily subjective due to the lack of generally accepted actuarial standards with respect to their development. In particular, the Company notes that the width of the range is dependent on the level of confidence associated with the outcome. For the above presentation, management has assumed what it believes is a reasonable confidence level but notes that there can be no assurance that the Company claim obligations will not vary within and potentially outside of these ranges, requiring incurred loss adjustments in the period the variability is recognized. The Company is not able to establish a meaningful range for A&E reserves. Additional losses, including those relating to latent injuries, and other exposures, which are as yet unrecognized, the type or magnitude of which cannot be foreseen by the Company or the reinsurance and insurance industry generally, may emerge in the future. Such future emergence, to the extent not covered by existing retrocessional 61 contracts, could have material adverse effects on the Company future financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The Company generally has exposure to A&E losses through its Mt. McKinley operation with respect to insurance policies and through Everest Re with respect to reinsurance contracts. In each case, the Company management and analysis of its exposures takes into account a number of features of its business that differentiate the Company exposures from many other insurers and reinsurers that have significant A&E exposures. Mt. McKinley began writing small amounts of A&E exposed insurance in 1975 and increased the volume of its writings in 1977. These writings ceased in 1984, giving Mt. McKinley an approximate 10-year window of potential A&E exposure, which is appreciably shorter than is the case for many companies with significant A&E exposure. Additionally, due to changes in and standardization of policy forms, it is rare for policies in the 1970s and 1980s to have been issued without aggregate limits on at least the product liability coverage offered; policies issued in earlier decades are generally more at risk of not having aggregate limits. The vast majority of Mt. McKinley A&E exposed insurance policies are excess casualty policies, with aggregate coverage limits, which by definition also have protection afforded by underlying coverage. Mt. McKinley attachment points vary but usually are protected by millions, often tens of millions, of dollars of underlying coverage. The excess nature of most of Mt. McKinley policies also offers protection against non-product claims (for example, claims arising under general liability coverage). Although under some circumstances an excess policy could be exposed to non-product claims, such claims generally pose more of a risk to primary policies because non-product claims are generally less likely to aggregate. In addition, environmental claims arise under general liability coverage, and generally do not aggregate. Thus, these claims tend to create exposure for primary policies to a greater extent than excess policies. Virtually all of the Mt. McKinley policies that are still potentially exposed to claims have policy language providing that expenses were paid within limits rather than in addition to limits. This is a substantial difference from primary coverage, which would most often cover expenses in addition to limits. Everest Re was formed in 1973 but was not fully engaged in underwriting casualty business, under which A&E exposures generally arise, until 1974, and it effectively eliminated A&E exposures through contract exclusions effected in 1984. Therefore, Everest Re has an approximate 11-year window of A&E exposure, much shorter than that of many reinsurance companies that have significant A&E exposures. In the earlier years of its existence, Everest Re was not as heavily involved in casualty business as in property business, which generally is not exposed to asbestos claims. Everest Re generally took smaller lines of exposure per contract than many other reinsurers operating in the casualty reinsurance market and those lines were generally also smaller than the excess limits provided by Mt. McKinley policies. This means that the potential adverse development on Everest Re reinsurance business would not be subject to the same level of volatility as would be the case for companies having greater exposures per risk. Everest Re reinsured both primary and excess policies. However, its claim experience to date indicates that the majority of its reinsurance supported excess policies. As a result, most of Everest Re exposure derives from excess policies similar to those written by Mt. McKinley. With respect to both the Mt. McKinley and Everest Re operations, the Company was not a member of the Asbestos Claims Facility ( Wellington ) or the Center for Claims Resolution ( CCR ) claim settlement facilities. Insurers supporting those facilities made broad commitments concerning the application of insurance coverage to asbestos claims. With respect to its direct insurance exposures, the fact that the Company has not made those commitments may allow it to resolve insurance exposure to Wellington/CCR insureds more economically than if it had joined these facilities. With respect to its reinsurance exposures, although the Company was not a signatory to the Wellington or CCR facilities, it has, within the bounds of its reinsurance contracts, generally supported ceding companies that were signatories. Because the insurers supporting these 62 facilities have generally paid their exposures more quickly than non-signatory insurers, the Company believes that this has generally meant that it has paid its reinsurance exposure more quickly than it likely would have if it had not been subject to Wellington/CCR payments. The Company believes that its A&E exposures are unique and differentiated, by the points noted above, from those insurers and reinsurers with appreciable A&E exposure but there can be no assurance that such factors will protect the Company from adverse development, perhaps material, or allow it to secure advantages in the settlement of its claims obligations. 63 The following table summarizes incurred losses with respect to A&E on both a gross and net of retrocessions basis for the periods indicated: Asbestos and Environmental Reserves Years Ended December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2004 2003 2002 Gross Basis: Beginning of period reserves $ 765 .3 $ 667 .9 $ 644 .4 Incurred losses and LAE: Reported losses 297 .1 128 .6 180 .9 Change in IBNR (125 .4) 44 .0 (85 .9) Total incurred losses and LAE 171 .7 172 .6 95 .0 Paid losses (208 .7) (75 .2) (71 .5) End of period reserves $ 728 .3 $ 765 .3 $ 667 .9 Net Basis: Beginning of period reserves $ 534 .4 $ 527 .5 $ 568 .6 Incurred losses and LAE: Reported losses 271 .8 15 .9 102 .7 Change in IBNR (112 .4) 34 .3 (79 .2) Total incurred losses and LAE 159 .4 50 .2 23 .5 Paid losses (187 .1) (43 .3) (64 .6) End of period reserves $ 506 .7 $ 534 .4 $ 527 .5 At December 31, 2004, the gross reserves for A&E losses were comprised of $148.5 million representing case reserves reported by ceding companies, $151.3 million representing additional case reserves established by the Company on assumed reinsurance claims, $272.1 million representing case reserves established by the Company on direct insurance claims, including Mt. McKinley, and $156.4 million representing IBNR reserves. The gross incurred losses for A&E exposures increased by $171.7 million and $172.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. These increases are the result of reevaluations by management reflecting additional information received from insureds and ceding companies, ongoing litigation, additional claims received and settlement activity. Management closely monitors this additional information and adjusts reserves accordingly. The net incurred losses primarily reflect the impact of the reinsurance agreement between Mt. McKinley and LM. Industry analysts have developed a measurement, known as the survival ratio, to compare the A&E reserves among companies with such liabilities. The survival ratio is typically calculated by dividing a company current net reserves by the three year average of paid losses, and therefore measures the number of years that it would take to exhaust the current reserves based on historical payment patterns. Using this measurement, the Company net three year A&E survival ratio was 5.2 years at December 31, 2004. Adjusting for the effect of the reinsurance ceded under the reinsurance agreement with LM, this ratio rises to the equivalent of 6.8 years at December 31, 2004. The cession of $160.0 million to the stop loss reinsurance provided by LM in connection with the acquisition of Mt. McKinley results in unpaid proceeds that are not reflected in past net payments and effectively extend the funding available for future net payments. Because the survival ratio was developed as a comparative measure of reserve strength and not of absolute reserve adequacy, the Company considers, but does not rely on, the survival ratio when evaluating its reserves. 64 In particular, the Company notes that loss payout variability, which can be material, due in part to the Company orientation to negotiated settlements, particularly on its Mt. McKinley exposures, significantly impairs the credibility and utility of this measure as an analytical tool. During 2004, the Company made asbestos net claim payments of $134.3 million on Mt McKinley high profile claimants where the claim was either closed or a settlement was reached. Such payments, which are effectively non-repetitive, do for 2004, and will for 2005 and 2006, distort the Company three year survival ratio. Adjusting for such settlements, recognizing total settlements are generally considered fully reserved to an agreed settlement, the Company considers that its adjusted survival ratio for net unsettled claims is 16.0 years. Developments in 2004 and 2003 affecting asbestos exposures in general and the Company asbestos exposures in particular, together with enhancements in the Company claim management and analytical processes, resulted in the reserve strengthening noted earlier. These developments and actions have increased the emphasis on asbestos exposures as a separate component of the Company A&E exposures. Despite the Company approach of handling A&E exposures on a combined basis, management believes additional disclosure of the asbestos element of its A&E exposures is appropriate. The following tables summarize reserve and claim activity for asbestos claims, on both a gross and net of ceded reinsurance basis, for the periods indicated with particular emphasis on the differentiation of insured categories within the Mt. McKinley operation, which the Company believes reflects the most volatile element of its asbestos exposures for the years ended December 31: 65 Gross Asbestos Exposures (1) (Dollars in millions) 2004 2003 2002 Beginning of period reserves: Direct Operations (Mt.

SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY. The Company shareholders equity increased to $3,712.5 million as of December 31, 2004 from $3,164.9 million as of December 31, 2003, principally reflecting $494.9 million of net income in 2004, $26.5 million in net proceeds from options exercised, an increase of $25.7 million in net unrealized appreciation of investments and a $22.9 million increase in foreign currency translation, partially offset by $22.4 million in shareholder dividends. The Company shareholders equity increased to $3,164.9 million as of December 31, 2003 from $2,368.6 million as of December 31, 2002, principally reflecting $426.0 million of net income in 2003, $316.8 million in net proceeds from Group offering of 4.5 million common shares in April 2003, an increase of $36.4 million in net unrealized appreciation of investments and a $22.2 million increase in foreign currency translation, partially offset by $19.6 million in shareholder dividends. Dividends of $22.4 million, $19.6 million and $16.3 million were declared and paid by the Company in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES CAPITAL. The Company business operations are in part dependent on the Company financial strength, and the market perception thereof, as measured by shareholders equity, which was $3,712.5 million and $3,164.9 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The Company has flexibility with respect to capitalization as a result of its perceived financial strength, including its financial strength ratings as assigned by independent rating agencies, and its access to the debt and equity markets. The Company continuously monitors its capital and financial position, as well as investment and security market conditions, both in general and with respect to the Company securities, and responds accordingly. From time to time the Company has used open market share repurchases to effectively adjust its capital position. It made no such purchases in 2004. In September 2004, the Company existing authorization to purchase up to 1.7 million shares was amended to authorize the repurchase of up to 5 million shares. The Company notes that, outside of its open market repurchase program, it repurchased 4,800 shares in 2004 from employees in connection with restricted share vestings where individual employees chose to discharge withholding tax liabilities on vesting shares by surrendering of a portion of such shares. At December 31, 2004, 5 million shares remained under the existing repurchase authorization. The Company has a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ), which was declared effective by the SEC on December 22, 2003, that provides for the issuance of up to $975 million of securities. Generally, under this shelf registration statement, Group is authorized to issue common shares, preferred shares, debt securities, warrants and hybrid securities, Holdings is authorized to issue debt securities and Capital Trust II and Everest Re Capital Trust III ( Capital Trust III ) are authorized to issue trust preferred securities. The following securities have been issued pursuant to that registration statement, which at December 31, 2004 has a remaining balance of $405.0 million. o On March 29, 2004, Capital Trust II, an unconsolidated affiliate, issued trust preferred securities resulting in a takedown from the shelf registration statement of $320 million. In conjunction with the issuance of Capital Trust II trust preferred securities, Holdings issued $329.9 million of 6.20% junior subordinated debt securities due March 29, 2034 to Capital Trust II. Part of the proceeds from the junior subordinated debt securities issuance was used for capital contributions to Holdings operating subsidiaries. 68 o On October 6, 2004, Holdings completed a public offering of $250.0 million principal amount of 5.40% senior notes due October 15, 2014. The net proceeds will be utilized to retire existing debt at Holdings, which is coming due in March 2005, and for other general corporate purposes. On July 30, 2002, the Company filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC, providing for the issuance of up to $475.0 million of securities. Generally, under this shelf registration statement, Group was authorized to issue common shares, preferred shares, debt securities, warrants and hybrid securities, Holdings was authorized to issue debt securities and Capital Trust was authorized to issue trust preferred securities. This shelf registration statement became effective on September 26, 2002 and was effectively exhausted with the April 23, 2003 transaction described below. The following securities were issued pursuant to that registration statement. o On November 14, 2002, pursuant to a trust agreement between Holdings and JPMorgan Chase Bank, the property trustee, and Chase Manhattan Bank USA, the Delaware trustee, Capital Trust, an unconsolidated affiliate, completed a public offering of $210.0 million of 7.85% trust preferred securities, resulting in net proceeds of $203.4 million. The proceeds of the issuance were used to purchase $210 million of 7.85% junior subordinated debt securities of Holdings that will be held in trust by the property trustee for the benefit of the holders of the trust preferred securities. In conjunction with the issuance of Capital Trust trust preferred securities, Holdings issued $216.5 million of 7.85% junior subordinated debt securities due November 15, 2032 to Capital Trust. The proceeds from the junior subordinated debt securities issuance were primarily used for capital contributions to Holdings operating subsidiaries. o On April 23, 2003, the Company expanded the size of the remaining shelf registration to $318 million by filing a Post-Effective Amendment under Rule 462(b) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and General Instruction IV of Form S-3 promulgated there under. On the same date, the Company issued 4,480,135 of its common shares at a price of $70.75 per share, which resulted in $317.0 million in proceeds, before expenses of approximately $0.2 million. This transaction effectively exhausted the September 26, 2002 shelf registration. Capital Trust will redeem all of the outstanding trust preferred securities when the junior subordinated debt securities are paid at maturity on November 15, 2032. Holdings may elect to redeem the junior subordinated debt securities, in whole or in part, at any time after November 14, 2007. If such an early redemption occurs, the outstanding trust preferred securities would also be proportionately redeemed. On November 7, 2001, the Company filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC, providing for the issuance of up to $575.0 million of common equity. On February 27, 2002, the Company completed an offering of 5,000,000 of its common shares at a price of $69.25 per share, which resulted in $346.3 million of proceeds before expenses of approximately $0.5 million related to the offering. The Company has used the net proceeds for working capital and general corporate purposes. On October 2, 2002, the Company filed a post-effective amendment to this registration statement that removed the remaining securities from registration. On March 14, 2000, Holdings completed public offerings of $200.0 million principal amount of 8.75% senior notes due March 15, 2010 and $250.0 million principal amount of 8.5% senior notes due March 15, 2005. During 2000, the net proceeds of these offerings and additional funds were distributed by Holdings to Group. LIQUIDITY. The Company current investment strategy generally seeks to maximize after-tax income through a high quality, diversified, taxable bond and tax-preferenced fixed maturity portfolio, while maintaining an adequate level of liquidity. The Company mix of taxable and tax-preferenced investments is adjusted continuously, consistent with the Company current and projected operating results, market conditions and tax position. With changes the Company perceives in overall investment market conditions, and more specifically 69 the acquisition of $496.5 million of equity securities into the overall investment portfolio in 2004, the Company is reweighting its view of total return. The Company liquidity requirements are generally met from positive cash flow from operations. Positive cash flow results from reinsurance and insurance premiums being collected prior to disbursements for claims, which disbursements generally take place over an extended period after the collection of premiums, sometimes a period of many years. Collected premiums are generally invested, prior to their use in such disbursements, and investment income provides additional funding for loss payments. The Company net cash flows from operating activities were $1,487.6 million, $1,653.8 million and $742.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Additionally, these cash flows reflected net tax payments of $100.0 million, $52.6 million and $10.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively; catastrophe loss payments of $201.6 million, $96.0 million and $62.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively; and a $46.8 million payment on a terminated annuity reinsurance arrangement for the year ended December 31, 2004. The decrease in net cash flows from operations in 2004 compared with 2003 was primarily due to higher claim payments on catastrophes and increased A&E settlements, which totaled $187.1 million, $43.3 million and $64.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The increase in cash flow from 2002 reflects business growth and favorable underwriting results. In periods for which disbursements for claims and benefits, policy acquisition costs and other operating expenses exceed premium inflows, cash flow from insurance operations would be negative. The effect on cash flow from operations would be partially offset by cash flow from investment income. Additionally, cash flow from investment maturities, both short term investments and longer term maturities, would further mitigate the impact on total cash flow. As the exact timing of the payment of claims and benefits cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company maintains portfolios of long term invested assets with varying maturities, along with short-term investments that are intended to provide adequate cash for payment of claims. At December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003 the Company held cash and short-term investments of $770.8 million and $336.7 million, respectively. Part of the short-term cash position at December 31, 2004 will be used to pay the $250 million of senior notes that come due on March 15, 2005. In addition to these cash and short-term investments at December 31, 2004, the Company had $0.3 billion, at fair value, of available for sale fixed maturity securities maturing within one year, $1.9 billion maturing within two to five years and $7.7 billion maturing after five years. These securities, in conjunction with the short-term investments and positive cash flow from operations, provide adequate sources of liquidity for the expected payment of losses in the near future. The Company does not anticipate selling securities or using available credit facilities to pay losses and LAE but has the ability to do so. Management expects the trend of positive cash flow from operations, which in general reflects the strength of overall pricing over the 2003 and 2004 years, to persist over the near term. However, in the intermediate and long term, the trend continuation will be impacted by the extent to which competitive pressures weaken overall pricing available in the Company markets and the extent to which the Company successfully implements its strategy of emphasizing profitability over volume should persist. Effective December 8, 2004, Group, Bermuda Re, and Everest International entered into a new three year, $750 million group credit facility with a syndicate of lenders ( Group Credit Facility ). Wachovia Bank is the administrative agent for the Group Credit Facility. The Group Credit Facility consists of two tranches. Tranche one provides up to $250 million of revolving credit for liquidity and general corporate purposes, and for the issuance of standby letters of credit. The interest on the revolving loans shall, at the option of each of the borrowers, be either (1) Base Rate Loans (as defined below) or (2) an adjusted London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ) plus a margin. The Base Rate is the higher of the rate of interest established by Wachovia Bank from time to time as its prime rate or the Federal Funds rate, in each case plus 0.5% per annum. The amount of margin and the fees payable for the Group Credit Facility depend on Group senior unsecured debt rating. 70 Tranche two exclusively provides up to $500 million for the issuance of standby letters of credit on a collateralized basis. The Group Credit Facility requires Group to maintain a debt to capital ratio of not greater than 0.35 to 1 and to maintain a minimum net worth amount. Minimum net worth is an amount equal to the sum of (i) $2,373 million plus (ii) (A) 25% of consolidated net income for each of Group fiscal quarters and (B) 50% of any increase in consolidated net worth attributable to the issuance of ordinary and preferred shares. The base amount is reset at the end of each fiscal year to be the greater of 70% of Group consolidated net worth as of the last day of the fiscal year and the calculated minimum amount of net worth prior to the last day of the fiscal year. As of December 31, 2004, the Company was in compliance with these covenants. During the year ended December 31, 2004, there were no borrowings under tranche one of the Group Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2004, the Company has $66.0 million of letters of credit outstanding under tranche two of the Group Credit Facility. In addition, the Company has $284.9 million in letters of credit outstanding at December 31, 2004 under a $300 million bilateral agreement with Citibank. All of these letters of credit are collateralized by the Company cash and investments. These letters of credit are generally used to collateralize reinsurance assumed by Bermuda Re from jurisdictions where collateralization is generally required for the ceding company to receive credit for such reinsurance recoverables from its principal regulator. Bermuda Re and Everest International also used trust arrangements to provide collateralization to ceding companies, including affiliates. The Company generally avoids providing collateral except where required for ceding companies to receive credit from their regulators. Additionally, at December 31, 2004, $188.9 million of assets were deposited in trust accounts, primarily on behalf of Bermuda Re, as security for reinsurance recoverables of certain non-affiliated ceding companies. Effective October 10, 2003, Holdings entered into a new three year, $150.0 million senior revolving credit facility with a syndicate of lenders, replacing the December 21, 1999, three year senior revolving credit facility, which expired on December 19, 2003. Both the October 10, 2003 and December 21, 1999 senior revolving credit agreements, which have similar terms, are referred to as the Holdings Credit Facility . Wachovia Bank is the administrative agent for the Holdings Credit Facility. The Holdings Credit Facility is used for liquidity and general corporate purposes. The Holdings Credit Facility provides for the borrowing of up to $150.0 million with interest at a rate selected by Holdings equal to either, (1) the Base Rate (as defined below) or (2) an adjusted LIBOR plus a margin. The Base Rate is the higher of the rate of interest established by Wachovia Bank from time to time as its prime rate or the Federal Funds rate, in each case plus 0.5% per annum. The amount of margin and the fees payable for the Holdings Credit Facility depends upon Holdings senior unsecured debt rating. The Holdings Credit Facility requires Holdings to maintain a debt to capital ratio of not greater than 0.35 to 1, Holdings to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio of 2.5 to 1 and Everest Re to maintain its statutory surplus at $1.0 billion plus 25% of future aggregate net income and 25% of future aggregate capital contributions. As of December 31, 2004, the Company was in compliance with these covenants. During the year ended December 31, 2004, there were payments made of $70.0 million and there were no incremental borrowings made under Holdings Credit Facility. During the year ended December 31, 2003, there were no payments made and no incremental borrowings made under Holdings Credit Facility. During the year ended December 31, 2002, there were payments made of $80 million and new Holdings Credit Facility borrowings of $45 million. As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, there were outstanding Holdings Credit Facility borrowings of $0.0 million and $70.0 million, respectively. Interest expense incurred in connection with these borrowings was $1.2 million, $1.4 million and $3.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. 71 The Company 2004 total cash flow, as distinguished from its cash flow from operations, activity in 2004 included $320.0 million of new investable cash from Holdings issuance of junior subordinated debt securities in March and $246.7 million of new investable cash from Holdings issuance of senior notes securities in October. The total cash flow activity in 2003 included $316.8 million of new investable cash resulting from Group offering of common shares in April. The total cash flow activity in 2002 included $346.3 million of new investable cash resulting from Group offering of common shares in February and $209.9 million of new investable cash from Holdings issuance of junior subordinated debt securities in November. EXPOSURE TO CATASTROPHES. As with other reinsurers, the Company operating results and financial condition can be adversely affected by volatile and unpredictable natural and other disasters, such as hurricanes, windstorms, earthquakes, floods, fires and explosions. Any such catastrophic event could generate insured losses in one or many of the Company treaties or lines of business, including property and/or casualty exposures. Although the Company attempts to limit its exposure to acceptable levels, including through the purchase of reinsurance when considered to be cost effective, it is possible that an actual catastrophic event or multiple catastrophic events could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the Company. The Company employs various techniques, including licensed modeling software, to assess its accumulated exposure. Such techniques are inherently more difficult to apply to non-property exposures. Accumulated exposures with respect to catastrophe losses are generally summarized in terms of the PML. The Company defines PML as its anticipated maximum loss, taking into account contract limits, caused by a single catastrophe affecting a broad contiguous geographic area, such as that caused by a hurricane or earthquake of such a magnitude that it is expected to occur once in every 100 years. Management believes that the Company greatest catastrophe exposure world wide from any single event is to a U.S. earthquake affecting the west coast including workers compensation exposure where the Company estimates it has a pre-tax PML exposure of $427 million. The Company further estimates that its second largest exposure relates to a hurricane affecting the U.S. east coast with a pre-tax PML of $390 million. There can be no assurance that the Company will not experience losses from one or more catastrophic events that exceed, perhaps by a substantial amount, its estimated PML. The Company employs a retrocessional approach under which the Company may purchase reinsurance to cover specific business written or exposure accumulations or as a corporate level retrocessional program covering the potential accumulation or aggregation of exposures across some or all of the Company operations. All reinsurance purchasing decisions consider both the potential coverage and market conditions with respect to the pricing, terms, conditions and availability of such coverage, with the aim of securing cost effective protection. The level of reinsurance coverage varies over time, reflecting the underwriter and/or Company view of the changing dynamics of both the underlying exposure and the reinsurance markets. If a single catastrophe were to occur that resulted in $427 million of gross loss and LAE in 2005 (an amount equivalent to the Company PML including its property and workers compensation exposures), management estimates that the effect on the Company income before and after taxes would be approximately $427 million and $341 million, respectively. Such impact represents approximately 9.2% of the Company beginning of year capital. Such estimates involve multiple variables, including which Everest entity would experience the loss, and as a result there can be no assurance that this amount would not be exceeded. For 2003, 2004 and thus far in 2005, the Company has chosen not to purchase corporate retrocessional protection and to generally de-emphasize the purchase of specific reinsurance by its underwriters, reflecting the Company view that its exposures, in the context of its capital and financial position and current market pricing, do not warrant reinsurance purchases at current retrocessional price levels. For 1999, 2000 and 2001, the Company purchased accident year aggregate excess of loss retrocession coverage, which provided up to 72 $175.0 million of recoveries per accident year if Everest Re consolidated statutory basis accident year loss ratio exceeded a loss ratio attachment point provided in the contract for the respective accident years. Each arrangement provided for an adjustment premium, which reduces the net benefit by approximately 50%, in the event that the coverage is used. There are no remaining limits available under these coverages. See ITEM 1, Business Risk Management and Retrocession Arrangements for further details. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS. The following table shows the Company contractual obligations for the year ended December 31, 2004: (Dollars in millions) Payments due by period Contractual obligations Total Less than 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than 5 years 8.5% Senior notes $ 250 .0 $ 250 .0 $ - $ - $ - 8.75% Senior notes 200 .0 - - - 200 .0 5.4% Senior notes 250 .0 - - - 250 .0 Interest expense 1,283 .8 78 .0 134 .7 134 .7 936 .4 Employee benefit plans 4 .8 4 .8 - - - Junior subordinated debt 546 .4 - - - 546 .4 Operating lease agreements 33 .8 5 .7 11 .3 10 .1 6 .7 Gross Reserve for Losses and LAE (1) 7,836 .3 1,805 .5 2,510 .8 845 .5 2,674 .5 Total $ 10,405 .1 $ 2,144 .0 $ 2,656 .8 $ 990 .3 $ 4,614 .0 ______________ (1) Loss and LAE reserves represent our best estimate of losses from claims and related settlement costs. Both the amounts and timing of such payments are estimates, and the inherent variability of resolving claims as well as changes in market conditions make the timing of cash outflows uncertain. Therefore, the ultimate amount and timing of Loss and LAE payments could differ from our estimates. The senior notes and junior subordinated debt contractual obligations are the responsibility of Holdings. While the Company has sufficient cash flow, liquidity, investments and access to capital markets to satisfy these obligations, and in particular has the current liquidity to payoff the 8.5% senior notes maturing in March 2005, Holdings generally depends for its funding upon dividends from Everest Re, its operating insurance subsidiary, capital contributions from Group or access to the capital markets. The Company various operating insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries have sufficient cash flow, liquidity and investments to settle outstanding reserves for losses and LAE. Management believes that the Company, and each of its entities, have sufficient financial resources, or ready access thereto, to meet all obligations. DIVIDENDS During 2004, 2003 and 2002, the Company declared and paid shareholder dividends of $22.4 million, $19.6 million and $16.3 million, respectively. As an insurance holding company, the Company is partially dependent on dividends and other permitted payments from its subsidiaries to pay cash dividends to its shareholders. The payment of dividends to Group by Holdings and to Holdings by Everest Re is subject to Delaware regulatory restrictions and the payment of dividends to Group by Bermuda Re is subject to Bermuda insurance regulatory restrictions. Management expects that, absent extraordinary catastrophe losses, such restrictions should not affect Everest Re ability to declare and pay dividends sufficient to support Holdings general corporate needs and Holdings and Bermuda Re ability to declare and pay dividends sufficient to support Group general corporate needs. For the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, Everest Re paid dividends to Holdings of $70 million, $45 million and $85 million, respectively. Bermuda Re paid dividends to Group of $15 million in 2004. See ITEM 1, Business Regulatory Matters Dividends and Note 14A of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 73 APPLICATION OF NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In January 2003, FASB issued Financial Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities ( FIN 46 ). FIN 46 addresses whether certain types of entities, referred to as variable interest entities ( VIEs ), should be consolidated or deconsolidated in a company financial statements. During October 2003, the FASB deferred the effective date of FIN 46 provisions for VIEs created prior to February 1, 2003 to the first reporting period ending after December 15, 2003. During December 2003, the FASB issued FIN 46R, replacing FIN 46. FIN 46R is effective, for entities that had not adopted FIN 46 as of December 24, 2003, no later than the end of the first reporting period that ends on or after March 15, 2004. The Company adopted FIN 46R in the first quarter of 2004, resulting in the deconsolidation of Everest Re Capital Trust ( Capital Trust ) and Everest Re Capital Trust II ( Capital Trust II ). For 2003 and 2002, where applicable, the financial statements have been restated to reflect the deconsolidation. In March 2004, the Emerging Issue Task Force ( EITF ) reached a final consensus on Issue 03-1, The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments . This issue establishes guidance for determining whether to record impairment losses associated with investments in certain equity and debt securities. The application of this issue was required for reporting periods beginning after June 15, 2004. On September 30, 2004, the FASB issued a FASB Staff Position EITF Issue 03-1-1, which delayed the effective date for the measurement and recognition guidance included in paragraphs 10 through 20 of EITF Issue 03-1. The Company is unable to predict the impact on other-than-temporary impairments until the guidance is finalized. Currently, the Company continues to apply Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities ( FAS 115 ), and the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 5:M, Other Than Temporary Impairment Of Certain Investments In Debt And Equity Securities and believes that unrealized losses in its investment portfolio are temporary in nature. In December 2004, the Financial accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued FASB Statement 123(R) Share-Based Payment ( FAS 123(R) ). FAS 123(R) requires all share-based compensation awards granted, modified or settled after December 15, 1994 to be accounted for using the fair value method of accounting. Under the modified prospective application, compensation cost is recognized for the outstanding, non-vested awards based on the grant date fair value of those awards as calculated under FAS 123. The Company does not expect the adoption of the statement to have a material impact on the Company financial condition or results of operation. The application of this issue will become effective for interim or annual periods beginning after June 15, 2005. MARKET SENSITIVE INSTRUMENTS The SEC Financial Reporting Release #48 requires registrants to clarify and expand upon the existing financial statement disclosure requirements for derivative financial instruments, derivative commodity instruments and other financial instruments (collectively, market sensitive instruments ). The Company does not generally enter into market sensitive instruments for trading purposes. The Company current investment strategy seeks to maximize after-tax income through a high quality, diversified, taxable and tax-preferenced fixed maturity portfolio, while maintaining an adequate level of liquidity. The Company mix of taxable and tax-preferenced investments is adjusted continuously, consistent with its current and projected operating results, market conditions and the Company tax position. The fixed maturities in the investment portfolio are comprised of non-trading available for sale securities. Additionally, the Company invests in equity securities, which it believes will enhance the risk-adjusted total return of the investment portfolio. The Company has also engaged in a small number of credit default swaps and specialized equity options. The overall investment strategy considers the scope of present and anticipated Company operations. In particular, estimates of the financial impact resulting from non-investment asset and liability transactions, together with the Company capital structure and other factors, are used to develop a net liability analysis. This 74 analysis includes estimated payout characteristics for which the investments of the Company provide liquidity. This analysis is considered in the development of specific investment strategies for asset allocation, duration and credit quality. The change in overall market sensitive risk exposure principally reflects the asset changes that took place during the period, including the acquisition of interest only strips in 2003 and early 2004, which market value increases as interest rates rise and decreases as interest rates fall. The addition of these securities to the portfolio reduced the impact of interest rate shift on the entire portfolio. As interest rates rose during the second quarter of 2004, the Company fully liquidated its interest only strip investment portfolio. The Company $11.5 billion investment portfolio at December 31, 2004 is principally comprised of fixed maturity securities, which are subject to interest rate risk and foreign currency rate risk, and equity securities, which are subject to equity price risk. The impact of these risks on the investment portfolio is generally mitigated by changes in the value of operating assets and liabilities and their associated income statement impact. Interest rate risk is the potential change in value of the fixed maturity portfolio, including short-term investments, due to change in market interest rates. In a declining interest rate environment, it includes prepayment risk on the $1,474.0 million of mortgage-backed securities in the $9,947.2 million fixed maturity portfolio. Prepayment risk results from potential accelerated principal payments that shorten the average life and thus the expected yield of the security. 75 The tables below display the potential impact of market value fluctuations and after-tax unrealized appreciation on the Company fixed maturity portfolio as of December 31, 2004 and 2003 based on parallel 200 basis point shifts in interest rates up and down in 100 basis point increments. For legal entities with a U.S. dollar functional currency, this modeling was performed on each security individually. To generate appropriate price estimates on mortgage-backed securities, changes in prepayment expectations under different interest rate environments were taken into account. For legal entities with a non-U.S. dollar functional currency, the effective duration of the involved portfolio of securities was used as a proxy for the market value change under the various interest rate change scenarios. All amounts are in U.S. dollars and are presented in millions. In general, for 2003, the lower volatility was attributable to the Company investments in interest only strips, the effect of which was to reduce overall portfolio duration and therefore sensitivity to interest rate moves. 2004 Interest Rate Shift in Basis Points -200 -100 0 100 200 Total Market Value $ 11,798.6 $ 11,172.8 $ 10,533.0 $ 9,882.1 $ 9,262.2 Market Value Change from Base (%) 12.0 % 6.1 % 0.0 % (6.2 )% (12.1 )% Change in Unrealized Appreciation After-tax from Base ($) $ 936.7 $ 472.1 $ - $ (478.9 )% $ (936.3 ) 2003 Interest Rate Shift in Basis Points -200 -100 0 100 200 Total Market Value $ 9,858.7 $ 9,353.9 $ 8,878.7 $ 8,483.5 $ 8,004.1 Market Value Change from Base (%) 11.0 % 5.4 % 0.0 % (4.5 )% (9.9 )% Change in Unrealized Appreciation After-tax from Base ($) $ 713.2 $ 341.9 $ - $ (290.2 )% $ (643.8 ) The Company had $7,836.3 million and $6,361.2 million of reserves for losses and LAE as of December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003. These amounts are recorded at their nominal or estimated ultimate payment amount, as opposed to fair value, which would reflect a discount adjustment to reflect the time value of money. Since losses are paid out over a period of time, the fair value of the reserves is less than the nominal value. As interest rates rise, the fair value of the reserves decreases and conversely, if interest rates decline, the fair value will increase. These movements are the opposite of the interest rate impacts on the fair value of investments since reserves are future obligations. While the difference between fair value and nominal value is not reflected in the Company financial statements, the Company financial results will include investment income over time from the investment portfolio until the claims are paid. The Company loss and loss reserve obligations have an expected duration of approximately 4.5 years, which is reasonably consistent with the Company fixed income portfolio. If the company were to discount its loss and LAE reserves, net of reinsurance receivable on unpaid losses, the discount would be approximately $1.5 billion resulting in a discounted reserve balance of approximately $5.2 billion, representing approximately 50% of the fixed maturity market value. The existence of such obligations, and the variable differential between ultimate and fair value, which in theory applies equally to invested assets and insurance liability, provides substantial mitigation of the economic effects of interest rate variability even though such mitigation is not reflected in the Company financial statements. Foreign currency rate risk is the potential change in value, income and cash flow arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Each of the Company non-U.S./Bermuda ( foreign ) operations maintains capital in the currency of the country of its geographic location consistent with local regulatory guidelines. Generally, the Company prefers to maintain the capital of its operations in U.S. dollar assets, although this 76 varies by regulatory jurisdiction in accordance with market needs. Each foreign operation may conduct business in its local currency, as well as the currency of other countries in which it operates. The primary foreign currency exposures for these foreign operations are the Canadian Dollar, the British Pound Sterling and the Euro. The Company mitigates foreign exchange exposure by a general matching of the currency and duration of its assets to its corresponding operating liabilities. In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 52, the Company translates the assets, liabilities and income of non-U.S. dollar functional currency legal entities to the U.S. dollar. This translation amount is reported as a component of other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2004, there has been no material change in exposure to foreign exchange rates as compared to December 31, 2003. The tables below display the potential impact of a parallel 20% increase and decrease in foreign exchange rates on the valuation of invested assets subject to foreign currency exposure in 10% increments as of December 31, 2004 and 2003. This analysis includes the after-tax impact of translation from transactional currency to functional currency as well as the after-tax impact of translation from functional currency to the U.S. dollar reporting currency. The growth in exposure between 2004 and 2003 principally arises from increases in the level of foreign currency investments, which are generally commensurate with changes in the Company mix of business. All amounts are in U.S. dollars and are presented in millions. 2004 Change in Foreign Exchange Rates in Percent -20% -10% 0% 10% 20% Total After-tax Foreign Exchange Exposure $ (180.8) $ (95.1) $ - $ 102.0 $ 209.2 2003 Change in Foreign Exchange Rates in Percent -20% -10% 0% 10% 20% Total After-tax Foreign Exchange Exposure $ (78.5) $ (42.1) $ - $ 46.2 $ 95.4 Equity risk is the potential change in market value of the common stock and preferred stock portfolios arising from changing equity prices. The Company invests in exchange traded and mutual funds, which invest principally in high quality common and preferred stocks that are traded on the major exchanges in the U.S.. The primary objective in managing the equity portfolio is to provide long-term capital growth through market appreciation and income. 77 The tables below display the impact on market value and after-tax unrealized appreciation of a 20% change in equity prices up and down in 10% increments as of December 31, 2004 and 2003. The growth in exposure is primarily due to the growth in the equity portfolio. All amounts are in U.S. dollars and are presented in millions. 2004 Change in Equity Values in Percent -20% -10% 0% 10% 20% Market Value of the Equity Portfolio $ 520.7 $ 585.8 $ 650.9 $ 716.0 $ 781.0 After-tax Change in Unrealized Appreciation $ (84.6 ) $ (42.3 ) $ - $ 42.3 $ 84.6 2003 Change in Equity Values in Percent -20% -10% 0% 10% 20% Market Value of the Equity Portfolio $ 118.3 $ 133.1 $ 147.9 $ 162.7 $ 177.5 After-tax Change in Unrealized Appreciation $ (16.5 ) $ (8.3 ) $ - $ 8.3 $ 16.5 Although not considered material in the context of the Company aggregate exposure to market sensitive instruments, the Company has issued five specialized equity put options based on the Standard & Poor 500 ( S&P 500 ) index that are market sensitive and sufficiently unique to warrant supplemental disclosure. During 2001, the Company sold five specialized equity put options based on the S&P 500 index for total consideration, net of commissions, of $16.9 million. These contracts each have a single exercise date, with maturities ranging from 18 to 30 years and strike prices ranging from $1,141.21 to $1,540.63. No amounts will be payable under these contracts if the S&P 500 index is at or above the strike price on the exercise dates. If the S&P 500 index is lower than the strike price on the applicable exercise date, the amount due will vary proportionately with the percentage by which the index is below the strike price. Based on historical index volatilities and trends and the December 31, 2004 index value, the Company estimates the probability for each contract of the S&P 500 index being below the strike price on the exercise date to be less than 6.4%. The theoretical maximum payouts under the contracts would occur if on each of the exercise dates the S&P 500 index value were zero. As these specialized equity put options are derivatives within the framework of FAS 133, the Company reports the fair value of these instruments in its balance sheet and records any changes to fair value in its statement of operations. The Company has recorded fair values for its obligations on these specialized equity put options at December 31, 2004 and 2003 of $21.5 million and $16.5 million, respectively; however, the Company does not believe that the ultimate settlement of these transactions is likely to require a payment that would exceed the initial consideration received or any payment at all. As there is no active market for these instruments, the determination of their fair value is based on an industry accepted option pricing model, which requires estimates and assumptions, including those regarding volatility and expected rates of return. 78 The tables below estimate the impact of potential movements in interest rates and the S&P 500 index, which are the principal factors affecting fair value of these instruments, looking forward from the fair value at December 31, 2004 and 2003. These are estimates and there can be no assurance regarding future market performance. The asymmetrical results of the interest rate and S&P 500 index shifts reflect that the liability cannot fall below zero whereas it can increase to its theoretical maximum.

Like all insurance and reinsurance companies, the Company is exposed to unpredictable catastrophic events, including weather-related and other natural catastrophes, as well as acts of terrorism. Any material reduction in the Company operating results caused by the occurrence of one or more catastrophes could inhibit its ability to pay dividends or to meet its interest and principal payment obligations. The Company defines a catastrophe as an event that causes a pre-tax loss on property exposures before reinsurance of at least $5.0 million, before corporate level reinsurance and taxes. By way of illustration, during the past five calendar years, pre-tax catastrophe losses, net of contract specific reinsurance but before cessions under corporate reinsurance programs, were as follows: Calendar year Pre-tax catastrophe losses 2004 $ 403.0 million 2003 $ 36.8 million 2002 $ 30.2 million 2001 $ 222.6 million 2000 $ 13.9 million 80 If the Company loss reserves are inadequate to meet its actual losses, net income would be reduced or it could incur a loss. The Company is required to maintain reserves to cover its estimated ultimate liability of losses and loss adjustment expenses for both reported and unreported claims incurred. These reserves are only estimates of what the Company believes the settlement and administration of claims will cost based on facts and circumstances known to it. In setting reserves for its reinsurance liabilities, the Company relies on claim data supplied by its ceding companies and brokers. This information is not always timely or accurate and can result in inaccurate loss projections. Because of the uncertainties that surround estimating loss reserves and LAE, the Company cannot be certain that ultimate losses will not exceed these estimates of losses and loss adjustment reserves. If the Company reserves are insufficient to cover its actual losses and loss adjustment expenses, the Company would have to augment its reserves and incur a charge to its earnings. These charges could be material. By way of illustration, during the past five calendar years, the reserve re-estimation process affected the Company net income in the following manner: Calendar year Effect on pre-tax net income 2004 $ 312.0 million decrease 2003 $ 256.9 million decrease 2002 $ 140.1 million decrease 2001 $ no change 2000 $ 7.8 million decrease See ITEM 1, Business Changes in Historical Reserves, which provides a more detailed chart showing the effect of reserve re-estimates on calendar year operating results for the past ten years. The difficulty in estimating the Company reserves is increased because loss reserves include reserves for potential A&E liabilities. A&E liabilities are especially hard to estimate for many reasons, including the long waiting periods between exposure and manifestation of any bodily injury or property damage, difficulty in identifying the source of the asbestos or environmental contamination, long reporting delays and difficulty in properly allocating liability for the asbestos or environmental damage. Legal tactics and judicial and legislative developments affecting the scope of insurers liability, which can be difficult to predict, also contribute to uncertainties in estimating reserves for A&E liabilities. The failure to accurately assess underwriting risk could reduce the Company net income or generate a net loss. The Company success depends on its ability to accurately assess the risks associated with the businesses on which the risk is retained. If the Company fails to accurately assess the risks it retains, it may fail to establish adequate premium rates to cover its losses and LAE. This could reduce the Company net income and even result in a net loss. Losses may arise from events or exposures that are not anticipated when the coverage is priced. An example of an unanticipated event is the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. Neither the magnitude of loss on a single line of business nor the combined impact on several lines of business from an act of terrorism on such a large scale was contemplated when the Company priced its coverages. In addition to unanticipated events, the Company also faces the unanticipated expansion of its exposures, particularly in long-tail liability lines. An example of this is the ongoing expansion of the scope of insurers legal liability for A&E exposures discussed above. 81 Decreases in pricing for property and casualty reinsurance and insurance could reduce the Company net income. The Company writes primarily property and casualty reinsurance and insurance. The worldwide reinsurance and insurance businesses are highly competitive, yet cyclical by product and market. These cycles, as well as other business, economic and societal trends that influence aggregate supply and demand for property and casualty insurance and reinsurance products, are outside of the Company control. In 2004, the favorable market conditions, which had developed during 2000 through 2003, generally began to weaken. There were signs that pricing for most property classes declined modestly and that pricing for most casualty classes softened. Competition increased in part due to the relative profitability achieved by many reinsurers over 2002 and 2003 and the attendant buildup of capital in these market participants. However, this profitability and capital buildup varied significantly by participant reflecting the fact that the industry generally still remained exposed to fundamental issues that had negatively impacted its aggregate capacity in 2002 and 2003, including weak investment market conditions and adverse loss emergence. Both of these had tended to depress the industry aggregate financial performance and perceptions of financial strength of industry participants over this period albeit with significant variation by individual market participant. The industry experienced a record level of catastrophe losses during 2004, particularly in the second half of the year, and it remains unclear whether the aggregate catastrophe losses experienced by the industry will reverse, stop or even moderate the trends toward market softening, particularly as respects property classes. Further discussion of competitive issues can be found in ITEM 1, Business Competition . If rating agencies downgrade their ratings of the Company insurance subsidiaries, future prospects for growth and profitability could be significantly and adversely affected. The Company insurance company subsidiaries, other than Mt. McKinley, which is in runoff, currently hold an A+ ( Superior ) financial strength rating from A.M. Best. Everest Re, Bermuda Re and Everest National hold an AA ( Very Strong ) financial strength rating from Standard & Poor s. Everest Re and Bermuda Re hold an Aa3 ( Excellent )" financial strength rating from Moody s. Financial strength ratings are used by insurers and reinsurance and insurance intermediaries as an important means of assessing the financial strength and quality of reinsurers. In addition, an unfavorable rating or the lack of a rating of its reinsurers may adversely affect the rating of a company purchasing reinsurance. A downgrade or withdrawal of any of these ratings might adversely affect the Company ability to market its insurance products and could have a material and adverse effect on future prospects for growth and profitability. During the last five years, no active subsidiary of the Company had experienced financial strength rating downgrade. However, the Company cannot assure that a downgrade will not occur in the future. Consistent with market practice, many of the Company treaty reinsurance business allows the ceding company to terminate the contract or seek collateralization of the Company obligations in the event of a rating downgrade below a certain threshold. The termination provision would generally be triggered only if a rating fell below A.M. Best A- rating level, which is three levels below Everest Re current rating of A+. Everest Re also has more modest exposure to reinsurance contracts that contain provisions for obligatory funding of outstanding liabilities in the event of a rating agency downgrade. That provision would also generally be triggered only if Everest Re rating fell below A.M. Best A- rating level. The Company reinsurers may not satisfy their obligations. The Company is subject to credit risk with respect to its reinsurers because the transfer of risk to a reinsurer does not relieve it of its liability to the insured. In addition, reinsurers may be unwilling to pay the Company even though they are able to do so. The failure of one or more of the Company reinsurers to honor their obligations to it in a timely fashion would impact its cash flow and reduce its net income and could cause it to incur a significant loss. 82 If the Company is unable or chooses not to purchase reinsurance and transfer risk to reinsurers, its net income could be reduced or it could incur a net loss in the event of unusual loss experience. The Company is generally less reliant on the purchase of reinsurance than many of its competitors, in part because of its strategic emphasis on underwriting discipline and management of the cycles inherent in its business. The Company tries to separate its risk taking process from its risk mitigation process in order to avoid developing too great a reliance on reinsurance. Thus, the Company generally evaluates, underwrites, selects and prices its products prior to consideration of reinsurance. However, the Company underwriters generally consider purchasing reinsurance with respect to specific insurance contracts or programs, and its senior management generally considers purchasing reinsurance with respect to its overall operations, where reinsurance is deemed prudent from a risk mitigation perspective or is expected to have a positive cost/benefit relationship. Since the Company generally purchases reinsurance only when it expects a net benefit, the percentage of business that it reinsures, as indicated in the chart below, varies considerably from year to year, depending on its view of the relationship between cost and expected benefit for the contract period. 2004 2003 2002 2001 2000 Percentage of ceded written premiums to gross written premiums 3 .7% 5 .6% 7 .3% 16 .8% 12 .0% Changes in the availability and cost of reinsurance, which are subject to market conditions that are outside of the Company control, have thus reduced to some extent its ability to use reinsurance to tailor the risks it assumes on a contract or program basis or to mitigate or balance exposures across its reinsurance operations. Because the Company has reduced its level of reinsurance purchases, its net income could be reduced in the event of a large unreinsured event or adverse overall experience. The Company industry is highly competitive and it may not be able to compete successfully in the future. The Company industry is highly competitive and subject to pricing cycles that can be particularly pronounced. The ease of entry for well-capitalized competitors further exacerbates this market cycle. The Company competes on a global basis in the U.S., Bermuda and other international markets. According to Standard & Poor s, the Company ranks among the top ten global reinsurance groups where 80% of the market share is concentrated. The top twenty groups in the Company industry represent 95% of the market revenues. The leaders in this market are Munich Re, Swiss Re, Berkshire Hathaway, Hannover Re and Employers Re. Relative to the Company, some of these competitors may have greater financial resources, longer operating histories, and extensive business relationships that transcend the industry, any of which can be a significant competitive advantage. Forces outside the industry can also impact the Company market, including such factors as economic, regulatory, legal, and geophysical. The Company may not be able to compete successfully in the future should there be a significant change to the competitive landscape of its market. The Company is dependent on its key personnel. The Company success has been, and will continue to be, dependent on the ability to retain the services of existing key executive officers and to attract and retain additional qualified personnel in the future. The loss of the services of any key executive officer or the inability to hire and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future could adversely affect the ability of the Company to conduct business. Generally, the Company considers key executive officers to be those individuals who have the greatest influence in setting overall policy and controlling operations: Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Joseph V. Taranto (age 56), President and Chief Operating Officer, Thomas J. Gallagher (age 56), and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Stephen L. Limauro (age 53). Of those three officers, the Company only has an employment contract with Mr. Taranto. That contract has been previously filed with the SEC and was most recently amended on April 18, 2003 to extend Mr. Taranto term of employment from March 31, 2004 until March 31, 2006. The Company is 83 not aware that any of the above three officers are planning to leave the Company or retire in the near future. The Company does not maintain any key employee insurance on any of its employees. Special considerations apply to the Company Bermuda operations. Under Bermuda law, non-Bermudians, other than spouses of Bermudians and individuals holding permanent resident certificates, are not permitted to engage in any gainful occupation in Bermuda without a work permit issued by the Bermuda government. A work permit is only granted or extended if the employer can show that, after a proper public advertisement, no Bermudian, spouse of a Bermudian or individual holding a permanent resident certificate is available who meets the minimum standards for the position. The Bermuda government has announced a policy that places a six-year term limit on individuals with work permits, subject to specified exemptions for persons deemed to be key employees. Currently, all six of the Company Bermuda-based professional employees who require work permits have been granted permits by the Bermuda government that expire at various times between March 2006 and February 2008. This includes Mark de Saram, the chief executive officer of the Company Bermuda reinsurance operation. In the event his work permit were not renewed, the Company could lose his services, thereby adversely affecting its ability to conduct its business in Bermuda until it was able to replace him with an individual in Bermuda who did not require a work permit or who was granted the permit. 84 The value of the Company investment portfolio and the investment income it receives from that portfolio could decline as a result of market fluctuations and economic conditions. A significant portion of the Company investment portfolio consists of fixed income securities and smaller portions consist of equity securities and other investments. Both the fair market value of these assets and the investment income from these assets fluctuate depending on general economic and market conditions. For example, the fair market value of the Company fixed income securities generally increases or decreases in an inverse relationship with fluctuations in interest rates. The fair market value of its fixed income securities can also decrease as a result of any downturn in the business cycle that causes the credit quality of those securities to deteriorate. The net investment income that the Company realizes from future investments in fixed income securities will generally increase or decrease with interest rates. Interest rate fluctuations also can cause net investment income from investments that carry prepayment risk, such as mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities, to differ from the income anticipated from those securities at the time of purchase. In addition, if issuers of individual investments are unable to meet their obligations, investment income will be reduced and realized capital losses may arise. Because all of the Company securities are classified as available for sale, changes in the market value of its securities are reflected in its financial statements. Similar treatment is not available for liabilities. As a result, a decline in the value of the securities in the Company portfolio could reduce its net income or cause it to incur a loss. The following table quantifies the portion of the Company investment portfolio that consists of fixed income securities, equity securities and investments that carry prepayment risk. (Dollars in thousands) Type of Security As of December 31, 2004 Fixed income: Mortgage-backed securities $ 1,474,006 Other asset-backed 248,736 Total asset-backed 1,722,742 Other fixed income 8,224,430 Total fixed income 9,947,172 Equity securities 650,871 Other invested assets 161,324 Cash and short-term investments 770,805 Total Investments and Cash $ 11,530,172 Further discussion of market-sensitive instruments can be found in ITEM 7, Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Market Sensitive Instruments . The Company may experience foreign currency exchange losses. The Company functional currency is the U.S. dollar. However, the Company writes a portion of its business in currencies other than U.S. dollars. During the year ended December 31, 2004, the Company wrote approximately 23.5% of its reinsurance coverages in currencies other than U.S. dollars. The Company also maintains a portion of its investment portfolio in investments denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars. As of December 31, 2004, the Company maintained approximately 10.7% of its investment portfolio in investments denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars. Consequently, quarterly exchange rate fluctuations may have a material impact on the Company quarterly net income. During 2004, 2003, 2002, the impact on the Company quarterly pre-tax net income from exchange rate fluctuations ranged from a loss of $3.6 million to a gain of $7.8 million. Further discussion of foreign currency rate risk can be found in ITEM 7, 85 Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Market Sensitive Instruments . RISKS RELATING TO REGULATION Insurance laws and regulations restrict the Company ability to operate and any failure to comply with those laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on its business. The Company is subject to extensive and increasing regulation under U.S., state and foreign insurance laws. These laws limit the amount of dividends that can be paid to the Company by its operating subsidiaries, impose restrictions on the amount and type of investments that the Company can hold, prescribe solvency, accounting and internal control standards that must be met and maintained and require the Company to maintain reserves. These laws also require disclosure of material intercompany transactions and require prior approval of extraordinary transactions. These extraordinary transactions include declaring dividends from operating subsidiaries that exceed statutory thresholds. These laws also generally require approval of changes of control of insurance companies. The application of these laws could affect the Company liquidity and ability to pay dividends, interest and other payments on securities, as applicable, and could restrict the ability to expand business operations through acquisitions of new insurance subsidiaries. In addition, the Company cannot assure that it will have or can maintain all required licenses and approvals or that its business fully complies with the wide variety of applicable laws and regulations or the relevant authority interpretation of the laws and regulations. If the Company does not have the requisite licenses and approvals or does not comply with applicable regulatory requirements, the insurance regulatory authorities could preclude or temporarily suspend the Company from carrying on some or all activities or monetarily penalize the Company. These types of actions could have a material adverse effect on the Company business. To date, no material fine, penalty or restriction has been imposed on the Company for failure to comply with any insurance law or regulation. Regulatory challenges in the U.S. could adversely affect the ability of Bermuda Re to conduct business. Bermuda Re does not intend to be licensed or admitted as an insurer or reinsurer in any U.S. jurisdiction. Under current law, Bermuda Re generally will be permitted to reinsure U.S. risks from its office in Bermuda without obtaining those licenses. However, the insurance and reinsurance regulatory framework has become subject to increased scrutiny. In the past, there have been congressional and other initiatives in the U.S. regarding increased supervision and regulation of the insurance industry, including proposals to supervise and regulate reinsurers domiciled outside the U.S. If Bermuda Re were to become subject to any insurance laws of the U.S. or any U.S. state at any time in the future, it might be required to post deposits or maintain minimum surplus levels and might be prohibited from engaging in lines of business or from writing some types of policies. Complying with those laws could have a material adverse effect on the Company ability to conduct business in Bermuda and international markets. Bermuda Re may need to be licensed or admitted in additional jurisdictions to develop its business. As Bermuda Re business develops, it will monitor the need to obtain licenses in jurisdictions other than Bermuda and the UK where it has an authorized branch in order to comply with applicable law or to be able to engage in additional insurance-related activities. In addition, Bermuda Re may be at a competitive disadvantage in jurisdictions where it is not licensed or does not enjoy an exemption from licensing relative to competitors that are so licensed or exempt from licensing. Bermuda Re may not be able to obtain any additional licenses that it determines are necessary or desirable. Furthermore, the process of obtaining those licenses is often costly and may take a long time. 86 Bermuda Re ability to write reinsurance may be severely limited if it is unable to arrange for security to back its reinsurance. Many jurisdictions do not permit insurance companies to take credit for reinsurance obtained from unlicensed or non-admitted insurers on their statutory financial statements without appropriate security. Bermuda Re reinsurance clients typically require it to post a letter of credit or enter into other security arrangements. If Bermuda Re is unable to obtain or maintain a letter of credit facility on commercially acceptable terms or is unable to arrange for other types of security, its ability to operate its business may be severely limited. If Bermuda Re defaults on any letter of credit that it obtains, it may be required to prematurely liquidate a substantial portion of its investment portfolio and other assets pledged as collateral. RISKS RELATING TO THE COMPANY S SECURITIES Because of the Company holding company structure, its ability to pay dividends, interest and principal is dependent on its receipt of dividends, loan payments and other funds from its subsidiaries. The Company and Holdings are holding companies, each of whose most significant assets consists of the stock of their operating subsidiaries. As a result, each of the Company and Holdings ability to pay dividends, interest or other payments on its securities in the future will depend on the earnings and cash flows of the operating subsidiaries and the ability of the subsidiaries to pay dividends or to advance or repay funds to it. This ability is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, regulatory and other factors beyond the Company control. Payment of dividends and advances and repayments from some of the operating subsidiaries are regulated by U.S., state and foreign insurance laws and regulatory restrictions, including minimum solvency and liquidity thresholds. Accordingly, the operating subsidiaries may not be able to pay dividends or advance or repay funds to the Company and Holdings in the future, which could prevent it from paying dividends, interest or other payments on its securities. Provisions in the Company bye-laws could have an anti-takeover effect, which could diminish the value of its common shares. The Company bye-laws contain provisions that may entrench directors and make it more difficult for shareholders to replace directors even if the shareholders consider it beneficial to do so. In addition, these provisions could delay or prevent a change of control that a shareholder might consider favorable. The effect of these provisions could be to prevent a shareholder from receiving the benefit from any premium over the market price of our common shares offered by a bidder in a potential takeover. Even in the absence of an attempt to effect a change in management or a takeover attempt, these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common shares if they are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future. For example, the Company bye-laws contain the following provisions that could have an anti-takeover effect: o election of directors is staggered, meaning that the members of only one of three classes of directors are selected each year; o shareholders have limited ability to remove directors; o the total voting power of any shareholder owning more than 9.9% of the common shares will be reduced to 9.9% of the total voting power of the common shares; o the board of directors may decline to register any transfer of common shares if it has reason to believe that the transfer would result in: 87 o any person that is not an investment company beneficially owning more than 5.0% of any class of the issued and outstanding share capital of the Company, o any person holding controlled shares in excess of 9.9% of any class of the issued and outstanding share capital of the Company, or o any adverse tax, regulatory or legal consequences to the Company, any of its subsidiaries or any of its shareholders; o the Company also has the option to redeem or purchase all or part of a shareholder common shares to the extent the board of directors determines it is necessary or advisable to avoid or cure any adverse or potential adverse consequences if: o any person that is not an investment company beneficially owns more than 5.0% of any class of the issued and outstanding share capital of the Company, o any person holds controlled shares in excess of 9.9% of any class of the issued and outstanding share capital of the Company, or o share ownership by any person may result in adverse tax, regulatory or legal consequences to the Company, any of its subsidiaries or any other shareholder. The Board of Directors has indicated that it will apply these bye-law provisions in such manner that passive institutional investors will be treated similarly to investment companies. For this purpose, passive institutional investors include all persons who are eligible, pursuant to Rule 13d-1(b)(1) under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, to file a short-form statement on Schedule 13G, but excluding any insurance company or any parent holding company or control person of an insurance company. Applicable insurance laws may also have an anti-takeover effect. Before a person can acquire control of a U.S. insurance company, prior written approval must be obtained from the insurance commissioner of the state where that insurance company is domiciled. Prior to granting approval of an application to acquire control of a domestic insurance company, a state insurance commissioner will consider such factors as the financial strength of the applicant, the integrity and competence of the applicant board of directors and executive officers, the acquiror plans for changes to the insurance company board of directors and executive officers, the acquiror plans for the future operations of the insurance company and any anti-competitive results that may arise from the consummation of the acquisition of control. Because any person who acquired control of the Company would thereby acquire indirect control of its insurance company subsidiaries in the U.S., the insurance change of control laws of Delaware, Arizona, California and Georgia would apply to such a transaction. This could have the effect of delaying or even preventing such a change of control. Investors in the Company may have more difficulty in protecting their interests than investors in a U.S. corporation. The Companies Act 1981 of Bermuda (the Companies Act ), differs in material respects from the laws applicable to U.S. corporations and their shareholders. The following is a summary of material differences between the Companies Act, as modified in some instances by provisions of the Company bye-laws, and Delaware corporate law that could make it more difficult for investors in the Company to protect their interests than investors in a U.S. corporation. Because the following statements are summaries, they do not address all aspects of Bermuda law that may be relevant to the Company and its shareholders. 88 Alternate Directors. The Company bye-laws provide, as permitted by Bermuda law, that each director may appoint an alternate director, who shall have the power to attend and vote at any meeting of the board of directors or committee at which that director is not personally present and to sign written consents in place of that director. Delaware law does not provide for alternate directors. Committees of the Board of Directors. The Company bye-laws provide, as permitted by Bermuda law, that the board of directors may delegate any of its powers to committees that the board appoints, and those committees may consist partly or entirely of non-directors. Delaware law allows the board of directors of a corporation to delegate many of its powers to committees, but those committees may consist only of directors. Interested Directors. Bermuda law and the Company bye-laws provide that if a director has a personal interest in a transaction to which the Company is also a party and if the director discloses the nature of this personal interest at the first opportunity, either at a meeting of directors or in writing to the directors, then the Company will not be able to declare the transaction void solely due to the existence of that personal interest and the director will not be liable to the Company for any profit realized from the transaction. In addition, after a director has made the declaration of interest referred to above, he or she is allowed to be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present and to vote on a transaction in which he or she has an interest, unless disqualified from doing so by the chairman of the relevant board meeting. Under Delaware law, an interested director could be held liable for a transaction in which that director derived an improper personal benefit. Additionally, under Delaware law, a corporation may be able to declare a transaction with an interested director to be void unless one of the following conditions is fulfilled: o the material facts as to the interested director relationship or interests are disclosed or are known to the board of directors and the board in good faith authorizes the transaction by the affirmative vote of a majority of the disinterested directors, o the material facts are disclosed or are known to the shareholders entitled to vote on the transaction and the transaction is specifically approved in good faith by the holders of a majority of the voting shares or o the transaction is fair to the corporation as of the time it is authorized, approved or ratified. Transactions with Significant Shareholders. As a Bermuda company, the Company may enter into business transactions with its significant shareholders, including asset sales, in which a significant shareholder receives, or could receive, a financial benefit that is greater than that received, or to be received, by other shareholders with prior approval from the Company board of directors but without obtaining prior approval from the shareholders. In the case of an amalgamation, in which two or more companies join together and continue as a single company, a resolution of shareholders approved by a majority of at least 75% of the votes cast is required in addition to the approval of the board of directors, except in the case of an amalgamation with and between wholly-owned subsidiaries. If the Company were a Delaware corporation, any business combination with an interested shareholder (which, for this purpose, would include mergers and asset sales of greater than 10% of the Company assets that would otherwise be considered transactions in the ordinary course of business) within a period of three years from the time the person became an interested shareholder would require prior approval from shareholders holding at least 66 2/3% of the Company outstanding common shares not owned by the interested shareholder, unless the transaction qualified for one of the exemptions in the relevant Delaware statute or the Company opted out of the statute. For purposes of the Delaware statute, an interested shareholder is generally defined as a person who together with that person affiliates and associates owns, or within the previous three years did own, 15% or more of a corporation outstanding voting shares. Takeovers. Under Bermuda law, if an acquiror makes an offer for shares of a company and, within four months of the offer, the holders of not less than 90% of the shares that are the subject of the offer tender their shares, the acquiror may give the nontendering shareholders notice requiring them to transfer their shares on the terms of 89 the offer. Within one month of receiving the notice, dissenting shareholders may apply to the court objecting to the transfer. The burden is on the dissenting shareholders to show that the court should exercise its discretion to enjoin the transfer. The court will be unlikely to do this unless there is evidence of fraud or bad faith or collusion between the acquiror and the tendering shareholders aimed at unfairly forcing out minority shareholders. Under another provision of Bermuda law, the holders of 95% of the shares of a company (the acquiring shareholders ) may give notice to the remaining shareholders requiring them to sell their shares on the terms described in the notice. Within one month of receiving the notice, dissenting shareholders may apply to the court for an appraisal of their shares. Within one month of the court appraisal, the acquiring shareholders are entitled either to acquire all shares involved at the price fixed by the court or cancel the notice given to the remaining shareholders. If shares were acquired under the notice at a price below the court appraisal price, the acquiring shareholders must either pay the difference in price or cancel the notice and return the shares thus acquired to the shareholder, who must then refund the purchase price. There are no comparable provisions under Delaware law. Inspection of Corporate Records. Members of the general public have the right to inspect the public documents of the Company available at the office of the Registrar of Companies and the Company registered office, both in Bermuda. These documents include the memorandum of association, which describes the Company permitted purposes and powers, any amendments to the memorandum of association and documents relating to any increase or reduction in the Company authorized share capital. Shareholders of the Company have the additional right to inspect the Company bye-laws, minutes of general meetings of shareholders and audited financial statements that must be presented to the annual general meeting of shareholders. The register of shareholders of the Company also is open to inspection by shareholders without charge, and to members of the public for a fee. The Company is required to maintain its share register at its registered office in Bermuda. The Company also maintains a branch register in the offices of its transfer agent in the U.S., which is open for public inspection as required under the Companies Act. The Company is required to keep at its registered office a register of its directors and officers that is open for inspection by members of the public without charge. However, Bermuda law does not provide a general right for shareholders to inspect or obtain copies of any other corporate records. Under Delaware law, any shareholder may inspect or obtain copies of a corporation shareholder list and its other books and records for any purpose reasonably related to that person interest as a shareholder. Shareholder Suits. The rights of shareholders under Bermuda law are not as extensive as the rights of shareholders under legislation or judicial precedent in many U.S. jurisdictions. Class actions and derivative actions are generally not available to shareholders under the laws of Bermuda. However, the Bermuda courts ordinarily would be expected to follow English case law precedent, which would permit a shareholder to bring an action in the name of the Company to remedy a wrong done to the Company where the act complained of is alleged to be beyond the corporate power of the Company or illegal or would result in the violation of the Company memorandum of association or bye-laws. Furthermore, the court would give consideration to acts that are alleged to constitute a fraud against the minority shareholders or where an act requires the approval of a greater percentage of the Company shareholders than actually approved it. The winning party in an action of this type generally would be able to recover a portion of attorneys fees incurred in connection with the action. Under Delaware law, class actions and derivative actions generally are available to stockholders for breach of fiduciary duty, corporate waste and actions not taken in accordance with applicable law. In these types of actions, the court has discretion to permit the winning party to recover its attorneys fees. Limitation of Liability of Directors and Officers . The Company bye-laws provide that the Company and its shareholders waive all claims or rights of action that they might have, individually or in the right of the Company, against any director or officer for any act or failure to act in the performance of that director or officer duties. However, this waiver does not apply to claims or rights of action that arise out of fraud or dishonesty. This waiver may have the effect of barring claims arising under U.S. federal securities laws. Under Delaware law, a corporation may include in its certificate of incorporation provisions limiting the personal 90 liability of its directors to the corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for many types of breach of fiduciary duty. However, these provisions may not limit liability for any breach of the duty of loyalty, acts or omissions not in good faith or that involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, the authorization of unlawful dividends, stock repurchases or stock redemptions, or any transaction from which a director derived an improper personal benefit. Moreover, these provisions would not be likely to bar claims arising under U.S. federal securities laws. Indemnification of Directors and Officers. The Company bye-laws provide that the Company shall indemnify its directors or officers to the full extent permitted by law against all actions, costs, charges, liabilities, loss, damage or expense incurred or suffered by them by reason of any act done, concurred in or omitted in the conduct of the Company business or in the discharge of their duties. Under Bermuda law, this indemnification may not extend to any matter involving fraud or dishonesty of which a director or officer may be guilty in relation to the Company, as determined in a final judgment or decree not subject to appeal. Under Delaware law, a corporation may indemnify a director or officer who becomes a party to an action, suit or proceeding because of his position as a director or officer if (1) the director or officer acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation and (2) if the action or proceeding involves a criminal offense, the director or officer had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful. Enforcement of Civil Liabilities. The Company is organized under the laws of Bermuda. Some of its directors and officers may reside outside the U.S. A substantial portion of the Company assets are or may be located in jurisdictions outside the U.S. A person may not be able to effect service of process within the U.S. on directors and officers of the Company and those experts who reside outside the U.S. A person also may not be able to recover against them or the Company on judgments of U.S. courts or to obtain original judgments against them or the Company in Bermuda courts, including judgments predicated upon civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws. Dividends. Bermuda law does not allow a company to declare or pay a dividend, or make a distribution out of contributed surplus, if there are reasonable grounds for believing that the Company, after the payment is made, would be unable to pay its liabilities as they become due, or that the realizable value of the Company assets would be less, as a result of the payment, than the aggregate of its liabilities and its issued share capital and share premium accounts. The share capital account represents the aggregate par value of the Company issued shares, and the share premium account represents the aggregate amount paid for issued shares over and above their par value. Under Delaware law, subject to any restrictions contained in the Company certificate of incorporation, a company may pay dividends out of the surplus or, if there is no surplus, out of net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared and/or the preceding fiscal year. Surplus is the amount by which the net assets of a corporation exceed its stated capital. Delaware law also provides that dividends may not be paid out of net profits at any time when stated capital is less than the capital represented by the outstanding stock of all classes having a preference upon the distribution of assets. RISKS RELATING TO TAXATION If U.S. tax law changes, the Company net income may be reduced. In the last few years, some members of Congress have expressed concern about U.S. corporations that move their place of incorporation to low-tax jurisdictions. Also, some members of Congress have expressed concern over a competitive advantage that foreign-controlled insurers and reinsurers may have over U.S. controlled insurers and reinsurers due to the purchase of reinsurance by U.S. insurers from affiliates operating in some foreign jurisdictions, including Bermuda. Although the recently enacted legislation, which increases the U.S. tax burden on so-called inverting companies, does not apply to the Company, the Company does not know whether any similar legislation disadvantageous to the Company Bermuda insurance subsidiaries will ever be 91 enacted into law. If it were enacted, the U.S. tax burden on the Company Bermuda operations, or on some business ceded from its licensed U.S. insurance subsidiaries to some offshore reinsurers, could be increased. This could reduce the Company net income. The Company and/or Bermuda Re may be subject to U.S. corporate income tax, which would reduce the Company net income. The income of Bermuda Re is a significant portion of the Company worldwide income from operations. The Company has established guidelines for the conduct of its Bermuda operations that are designed to ensure that Bermuda Re is not engaged in the conduct of a trade or business in the U.S. Based on its compliance with those guidelines, the Company believes that Bermuda Re should not be required to pay U.S. corporate income tax, other than withholding tax on U.S. source dividend income. However, if the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) successfully contended that Bermuda Re was engaged in a trade or business in the U.S., Bermuda Re would be required to pay U.S. corporate income tax on any income that is subject to the taxing jurisdiction of the U.S., and possibly the U.S. branch profits tax. Even if the IRS successfully contended that Bermuda Re was engaged in a U.S. trade or business, the U.S.-Bermuda tax treaty would preclude the IRS from taxing Bermuda Re income except to the extent that its income were attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by that subsidiary. The Company does not believe that Bermuda Re has a permanent establishment in the U.S. If the IRS successfully contended that Bermuda Re did have income attributable to a permanent establishment in the U.S., Bermuda Re would be subject to U.S. tax on that income. Based on its compliance with guidelines designed to ensure that it generates only immaterial amounts, if any, of income that is subject to the taxing jurisdiction of the U.S., the Company believes that it should be required to pay only immaterial amounts, if any, of U.S. corporate income tax, other than withholding tax on U.S. source dividend income. However, if the IRS successfully contended that the Company had material amounts of income that is subject to the taxing jurisdiction of the U.S., it would be required to pay U.S. corporate income tax on that income, and possibly the U.S. branch profits tax. Prior to the current year, even if the IRS had successfully contended that the Company had material amounts of income that was subject to the taxing jurisdiction of the U.S., the U.S.-Barbados tax treaty would have precluded the IRS from taxing its income, except to the extent that its income was attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by it in the U.S. Since the Company moved its principal executive offices out of Barbados as of December 31, 2004 and since the United States and Barbados recently made effective a protocol to the U.S.-Barbados tax treaty, which strengthens the limitation of benefits provisions of that treaty, the U.S.-Barbados tax treaty will no longer provide any protection to the Company. Nevertheless, the Company does not believe that it has material amounts of income subject to the taxing jurisdiction of the U.S. If the IRS successfully contended, however, that the Company did have income subject to tax in the U.S. the imposition of tax on that income would reduce the Company net income. If Bermuda Re became subject to U.S. income tax on its income or if it became subject to U.S. income tax on more than immaterial amounts of income, its income could also be subject to the U.S. branch profits tax. In that event, the Company and Bermuda Re would be subject to taxation at a higher combined effective rate than if they were organized as U.S. corporations. The combined effect of the 35% U.S. corporate income tax rate and the 30% branch profits tax rate is a net tax rate of 54.5%. The imposition of these taxes would reduce the Company net income. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and the European Union are considering measures that might increase the Company taxes and reduce our net income. A number of multinational organizations, including the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (the OECD ), have recently identified some countries as not participating in adequate information exchange, engaging in harmful tax practices or not maintaining adequate controls to prevent 92 corruption, such as money laundering activities. The OECD has threatened non-member jurisdictions that do not agree to cooperate with the OECD with punitive sanctions by OECD member countries, though specific sanctions have yet to be adopted by OECD member countries. It is as yet unclear as to what these sanctions will be, who will adopt them and when or if they will be imposed. The OECD published a list of uncooperative tax havens, which are those jurisdictions from whom the OECD has not received commitments to the OECD principles of regulatory and tax transparency and effective exchange of information. The government of Bermuda has made these commitments. As a result, Bermuda is not currently listed as an uncooperative tax haven. However, it is possible that the OECD could change its view in the future and decide to list Bermuda as an uncooperative tax haven, or that one of the other multinational organizations could take a different view from the OECD and decide to recommend sanctions against Bermuda. Any sanctions imposed on Bermuda could increase the Company taxes and reduce its net income. In addition, the Company is not able to predict what changes will arise from the commitments given to the OECD by the government of Bermuda or whether those changes will subject it to additional taxes. The Company and/or Bermuda Re may become subject to Bermuda tax, which would reduce the Company net income. The Company and Bermuda Re currently are not subject to income or capital gains taxes in Bermuda. Both companies have received an assurance from the Bermuda Minister of Finance under The Exempted Undertakings Tax Protection Act 1966 of Bermuda to the effect that if any legislation is enacted in Bermuda that imposes any tax computed on profits or income, or computed on any capital asset, gain or appreciation, or any tax in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax, then that tax will not apply to them or to any of the Company operations or its shares, debentures or other obligations until March 28, 2016. This assurance does not prevent the application of any of those taxes to persons ordinarily resident in Bermuda and does not prevent the imposition of any tax payable in accordance with the provisions of The Land Tax Act 1967 of Bermuda or otherwise payable in relation to any land leased to the Company or Bermuda Re. There are currently no procedures for extending these assurances. As a result, the Company and Bermuda Re could be subject to taxes in Bermuda after March 28, 2016, which could reduce the Company net income. The Company net income will be reduced if U.S. excise and withholding taxes are increased. Bermuda Re is subject to an excise tax on reinsurance and insurance premiums it collects with respect to risks located in the U.S. In addition, Bermuda Re may be subject to withholding tax on dividend income from U.S. sources. These taxes could increase and other taxes could be imposed in the future on Bermuda Re business, which could reduce the Company net income.
