ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Background We are a major air carrier that provides scheduled air transportation for passengers and cargo throughout the United States ( U.S. ) and around the world. We offered service, including Delta Connection carrier service, to 321 destinations in 58 countries in January 2008. We are a founding member of SkyTeam, a global airline alliance that provides customers with extensive worldwide destinations, flights and services. Including our SkyTeam and worldwide codeshare partners, we offered flights to 485 worldwide destinations in 106 countries in January 2008. On September 14, 2005 (the Petition Date ), we and substantially all of our subsidiaries (collectively, the Debtors ) filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code (the Bankruptcy Code ) in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (the Bankruptcy Court ). Our reorganization in Chapter 11 involved a fundamental transformation of our business. On April 30, 2007 (the Effective Date ), we emerged from bankruptcy as a competitive airline with a global network. In connection with our emergence from bankruptcy, we began issuing shares of new common stock pursuant to the Debtors Joint Plan of Reorganization (the Plan of Reorganization ). References in this Form 10-K to Successor refer to Delta on or after May 1, 2007, after giving effect to (1) the cancellation of Delta common stock issued prior to the Effective Date, (2) the issuance of new Delta common stock and certain debt securities in accordance with the Plan of Reorganization and (3) the application of fresh start reporting. References to Predecessor refer to Delta prior to May 1, 2007. Combined Financial Results of the Predecessor and Successor Upon emergence from Chapter 11, we adopted fresh start reporting in accordance with American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position 90-7, Financial Reporting by Entities in Reorganization under the Bankruptcy Code ( SOP 90-7 ). The adoption of fresh start reporting resulted in our becoming a new entity for financial reporting purposes. Accordingly, the Consolidated Financial Statements on or after May 1, 2007 are not comparable to the Consolidated Financial Statements prior to that date. Due to our adoption of fresh start reporting on April 30, 2007, the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations include the results of operations for (1) the eight months ended December 31, 2007 of the Successor, (2) the four months ended April 30, 2007 of the Predecessor and (3) the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 of the Predecessor. For purposes of management discussion and analysis of the results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2007 in this Form 10-K, we combined the results of operations for the four months ended April 30, 2007 of the Predecessor with the eight months ended December 31, 2007 of the Successor. We then compared the combined results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2007 with the corresponding period in the prior year of the Predecessor and discussed significant fresh start reporting adjustments ( Fresh Start Adjustments ) which impacted comparability. We believe the combined results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2007 provide management and investors with a more meaningful perspective on Delta ongoing financial and operational performance and trends than if we did not combine the results of operations of the Predecessor and the Successor in this manner. Similarly, we combine the financial results of the Predecessor and the Successor when discussing our sources and uses of cash for the year ended December 31, 2007. Overview of Combined 2007 Results In 2007, we recorded combined consolidated net income of $1.6 billion, which includes a $1.2 billion gain from reorganization items, net, primarily reflecting a $2.1 billion gain in connection with our emergence from bankruptcy. From an operational perspective, we reported operating income of $1.1 billion for 2007. 26 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Due to the record high fuel costs experienced over the last several years, aircraft fuel expense and related taxes have become our largest cost. In an effort to manage these costs, we hedged 38% of our fuel consumption in 2007, resulting in an average fuel price per gallon of $2.21. We realized $111 million in cash gains on fuel hedge contracts settled during the year. Consistent with our positive operating financial results for 2007, cash flows from operations generated $1.4 billion, which are net of $875 million in cash used under the Plan of Reorganization to satisfy our bankruptcy-related obligations to the Air Line Pilots Association ( ALPA ) and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (the PBGC ). During 2007, we strengthened our balance sheet through the payment of $1.0 billion in net debt, including two then outstanding debtor-in-possession financing facilities (the DIP Facility ), our bankruptcy-related obligations to ALPA and the PBGC and certain other higher interest-bearing debt maturities. We also invested more than $1.0 billion in capital expenditures, focused primarily on customer service initiatives, such as new flight equipment and improvements at our Atlanta and New York-JFK hubs. Business Initiatives Recent initiatives that we expect will generate positive momentum in our business include: A joint venture agreement with Air France announced on October 17, 2007, to share revenue and cost on certain transatlantic routes. The initial implementation of the joint venture in April 2008 will include flights operated by both carriers between Air France Paris-Charles de Gaulle, Orly and Lyon hubs and our Atlanta, Cincinnati, New York-JFK and Salt Lake City hubs, as well as all flights between London Heathrow Airport and the U.S. By 2010, the joint venture is scheduled to be extended to all transatlantic flights operated by Air France and Delta between North America and Europe and the Mediterranean, as well as all flights between Los Angeles and Tahiti. The right to offer nonstop flights between our hub in Atlanta and Shanghai, China, effective March 30, 2008. The completion of the conversion of 11 B-767-400 aircraft from domestic to international service, with three remaining B-767-400 aircraft to be converted by spring 2008. These aircraft support our international expansion strategy. In addition, we launched 16 new international routes including service from Atlanta to Dubai, Lagos, Prague, Seoul, and Vienna and from New York-JFK to Bucharest and Pisa. The announcement of our New York strategy to improve our customers travel experience at New York-JFK by adding a premium customer check-in facility in our international terminal and redesigning our schedule to permit significant growth in international routes while helping to reduce congestion and delays at peak times. In late 2007, our Board of Directors established a special committee of the Board to work with management to review and analyze strategic options, including potential consolidation transactions, to assist us in maintaining our leadership position in the airline industry. Any decision of the Board of Directors regarding strategic options will be based on the best, long-term interests of all Delta stakeholders, including stockholders, employees, customers and the communities we serve. 27 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Fresh Start Adjustments During the eight months ended December 31, 2007, Fresh Start Adjustments impacted our Consolidated Financial Statements. These adjustments resulted in a $157 million increase to pre-tax income for the year ended December 31, 2007. The Fresh Start Adjustments consist of the following: (in millions) Increase/(Decrease) to Pre-tax Income for 2007 Operating revenue $ 188 Operating expense Aircraft fuel expense and related taxes (46 ) Depreciation 127 Amortization (146 ) Aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs (52 ) Other 19 Total operating expense (98 ) Operating income 90 Other income (primarily interest expense) 67 Income before income taxes $ 157 SkyMiles Frequent Flyer Program . We revalued our frequent flyer award liability to estimated fair value and changed our accounting policy from an incremental cost method to a deferred revenue method. Fair value represents the estimated price that third parties would require us to pay for them to assume the obligation of redeeming miles under the SkyMiles program. Fresh Start Adjustments for the SkyMiles program (including the change in accounting policy for that program) increased operating revenue by $188 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. Fuel Hedging . Prior to the adoption of fresh start reporting on April 30, 2007, we recorded as a component of shareowners deficit in other comprehensive loss $46 million of deferred gains related to our fuel hedging program. This gain would have been recognized as an offset to fuel expense as the underlying fuel hedge contracts were settled. However, as required by fresh start reporting, accumulated other comprehensive loss prior to emergence from Chapter 11 was reset to zero. Accordingly, Fresh Start Adjustments resulted in a non-cash increase to fuel expense of $46 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. Depreciation . We revalued property and equipment to fair value, which reduced the net book value of these assets by $1.0 billion. In addition, we adjusted the depreciable lives of flight equipment to reflect revised estimated useful lives. As a result, depreciation expense decreased by $127 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. Amortization of Intangible Assets . We valued our intangible assets at fair value, which increased the net book value of intangible assets (excluding goodwill) by $2.9 billion, of which $956 million relates to amortizable intangible assets. As a result, amortization expense increased by $146 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. Aircraft Maintenance Materials and Outside Repairs . We changed the way we account for certain maintenance parts that were previously capitalized and depreciated. After emergence, we expense these parts as they are placed on the aircraft. This change resulted in an increase in aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs expense of $52 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. Interest Expense . The revaluation of our debt and capital lease obligations resulted in a decrease in interest expense due to the amortization of premiums from adjusting these obligations to fair value. During 2007, $33 million in future premium credits were accelerated in connection with accounting for (1) the amendment to our 28 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements spare parts credit facility (the Spare Parts Loan ) with General Electric Capital Corporation ( GECC ) and (2) the prepayment of certain secured debt with the proceeds from the sale of $1.4 billion of Pass Through Certificates, Series 2007-1 (the 2007-1 Certificates ). As a result, interest expense decreased by $70 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. Other Fresh Start Adjustments . We recorded other Fresh Start Adjustments relating primarily to the revaluation of our aircraft leases. These adjustments increased operating expense by $19 million and non-operating expense by $3 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. Share-Based Compensation Expense Upon emergence from bankruptcy and in connection with our Plan of Reorganization, we adopted a new compensation program which was approved by the Bankruptcy Court for our approximately 1,200 officers, director level employees and other management personnel (the Management Program ). Under the Management Program, officers received restricted stock, stock options and performance shares; director-level employees received restricted stock and stock options; and other management personnel received restricted stock. During the eight months ended December 31, 2007, the total compensation expense related to the Management Program was $109 million. Accounting Adjustments During 2006, we recorded certain out-of-period adjustments ( Accounting Adjustments ) in our Consolidated Financial Statements that affect the comparability of our results for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005. These adjustments resulted in a net non-cash charge approximating $310 million to our Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2006, consisting of: A $112 million charge in landing fees and other rents. This adjustment is associated primarily with our airport facility leases at New York-JFK. It resulted from historical differences associated with recording escalating rent expense based on actual rent payments instead of on a straight-line basis over the lease term as required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ( SFAS ) No. 13, Accounting for Leases. A $108 million net charge related to the sale of mileage credits under our SkyMiles frequent flyer program. This includes an $83 million decrease in passenger revenue, a $106 million decrease in other, net revenue, and an $81 million decrease in other operating expense. This net charge primarily resulted from the reconsideration of our position with respect to the timing of recognizing revenue associated with the sale of mileage credits that we expect will never be redeemed for travel. A $90 million charge in salaries and related costs to adjust our accrual for postemployment healthcare benefits. This adjustment is due to healthcare payments applied to this accrual over several years, which should have been expensed as incurred. We believe the Accounting Adjustments, considered individually and in the aggregate, are not material to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005. In making this assessment, we considered qualitative and quantitative factors, including our substantial net loss in these years, the non-cash nature of the Accounting Adjustments, our substantial shareowners deficit at the end of these years and our status as a debtor-in-possession under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code during these years. Reclassifications Upon emergence and as a result of fresh start reporting, we changed the classification of certain items on our Consolidated Statements of Operations. We also reclassified prior period amounts to conform to current period presentations. These changes have no impact on operating or net income in any period prior or subsequent to our emergence from bankruptcy. For more information about these reclassifications, see Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 29 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Sale of ASA On September 7, 2005, we sold Atlantic Southeast Airlines, Inc. ( ASA ), our wholly owned subsidiary, to SkyWest, Inc. ( SkyWest ). After the sale, the revenue and expense related to our contract carrier agreement with ASA are reported as regional affiliates passenger revenue and contract carrier arrangements, respectively, in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Prior to the sale, expenses related to ASA were reported in the applicable expense line item in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. For additional information on the sale of ASA, see Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Combined Results of Operations 2007 Compared to 2006 Net Income (Loss) We had consolidated net income of $1.6 billion for 2007, and a consolidated net loss of $6.2 billion for 2006. The results for 2007 include a $1.2 billion gain from reorganization items, net, primarily reflecting a $2.1 billion gain in connection with our emergence from bankruptcy. The results for 2006 include (1) a $6.2 billion charge to reorganization items, net, (2) a $310 million charge associated with the Accounting Adjustments discussed above and (3) a $765 million income tax benefit discussed below. Operating Revenue Combined Predecessor (in millions) Year Ended December 31, 2007 Year Ended December 31, 2006 Increase (Decrease) % Increase (Decrease) Operating Revenue: Passenger: Mainline $ 12,758 $ 11,640 $ 1,118 10 % Regional affiliates 4,170 3,853 317 8 % Total passenger revenue 16,928 15,493 1,435 9 % Cargo 482 498 (16) (3)% Other, net 1,744 1,541 203 13 % Total operating revenue $ 19,154 $ 17,532 $ 1,622 9 % Operating revenue totaled $19.2 billion for 2007, a $1.6 billion, or 9%, increase compared to 2006. Passenger revenue increased 9% on a 3% increase in available seat miles ( ASMs ), or capacity, and a 1.9 point increase in load factor. The increase in passenger revenue reflects a rise of 4% and 7% in passenger mile yield and passenger revenue per available seat mile ( PRASM ), respectively. Mainline passenger revenue increased primarily due to (1) strong passenger demand, (2) our increased service to more profitable international destinations, (3) increased SkyMiles revenue associated with Fresh Start Adjustments discussed above and (4) the negative impact of Accounting Adjustments recorded in 2006 as discussed above. Passenger revenue of regional affiliates increased primarily due to increased flying by our contract carriers, which resulted in an 8% increase in revenue passenger miles ( RPMs ), or traffic, on 7% greater capacity. Other, net revenue increased primarily due to (1) increased SkyMiles revenue due to a change in accounting methodology and Fresh Start Adjustments discussed above, (2) increased administrative service charges and baggage handling fees, (3) growth in aircraft maintenance and staffing services to third parties and (4) the negative impact of Accounting Adjustments recorded in 2006 as discussed above. Increase (Decrease) Year Ended December 31, 2007 vs. 2006 Combined (in millions) Year Ended December 31, 2007 Passenger Revenue RPMs ASMs Passenger Mile Yield PRASM Load Factor Passenger Revenue: North America $ 12,062 3 % % (3 )% 3 % 7 % 2.5 pts International 4,745 28 % 17 % 16 % 9 % 11 % 1.0 pts Charter 121 1 % 21 % 12 % (17 )% (9 )% 3.2 pts Total passenger revenue $ 16,928 9 % 5 % 3 % 4 % 7 % 1.9 pts 30 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements North American Passenger Revenue . North American passenger revenue increased 3%, driven by a 2.5 point increase in load factor and a 7% increase in PRASM on a 3% decline in capacity. The passenger mile yield increased 3%. The increases in passenger revenue and PRASM reflect (1) strong passenger demand and (2) revenue and network productivity improvements, including right-sizing capacity to better meet customer demand and the continued restructuring of our route network to reduce less productive short haul domestic flights and reallocate widebody aircraft to international routes. As a result of our efforts to right-size capacity in domestic markets, we increased flying by our contract carriers. International Passenger Revenue . International passenger revenue increased 28%, generated by a 17% increase in RPMs on a 16% increase in capacity and an 11% increase in PRASM. The passenger mile yield increased 9%. These results reflect increases in service to more profitable international destinations, primarily in the Atlantic and Latin America markets, from the restructuring of our route network. Our mix of domestic versus international capacity was 67% and 33%, respectively, for 2007, compared to 71% and 29%, respectively, for 2006. Operating Expense Combined Predecessor (in millions) Year Ended December 31, 2007 Year Ended December 31, 2006 Increase (Decrease) % Increase (Decrease) Operating Expense: Aircraft fuel and related taxes $ 4,686 $ 4,433 $ 253 6 % Salaries and related costs 4,189 4,365 (176) (4)% Contract carrier arrangements 3,152 2,656 496 19% Depreciation and amortization 1,164 1,276 (112) (9)% Contracted services 996 918 78 8 % Aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs 983 921 62 7 % Passenger commissions and other selling expenses 933 888 45 5 % Landing fees and other rents 725 881 (156) (18)% Passenger service 338 332 6 2 % Aircraft rent 246 316 (70) (22)% Profit sharing 158 158 NM Restructuring, asset writedowns, pension settlements and related items, net 13 (13) (100)% Other 488 475 13 3 % Total operating expense $ 18,058 $ 17,474 $ 584 3 % Operating expense was $18.1 billion for 2007, a $584 million, or 3%, increase compared to 2006. Operating capacity increased 3% to 151.8 billion ASMs due mainly to increases in service to international destinations, primarily in the Atlantic and Latin America markets, from the restructuring of our route network and higher contract carrier flying from our initiatives to right-size capacity. Cost per available seat mile ( CASM ) increased 1% to 11.90 . Aircraft fuel and related taxes . Aircraft fuel and related taxes increased primarily due to higher average fuel prices and increased Mainline consumption. These increases were partially offset by gains on our fuel hedging derivatives. Fuel prices averaged $2.21 per gallon, including fuel hedge gains of $51 million, for 2007, compared to $2.10 per gallon, including fuel hedge losses of $108 million, for 2006. Salaries and related costs . The decrease in salaries and related costs reflects a decline of (1) $382 million due to benefit cost reductions for our pilot and non-pilot employees and (2) $90 million due to a charge during 2006 associated with Accounting Adjustments discussed above. These decreases were partially offset by 31 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements (1) expense associated with share-based compensation and (2) an 8% increase in Mainline headcount due to our expansion at New York-JFK and our assumption of ASA ramp operations in Atlanta. Contract carrier arrangements . Contract carrier arrangements expense increased due to a 16% growth in contract carrier flying from our business plan initiatives to right-size capacity in domestic markets and due to higher average fuel prices. Fuel prices for our contract carriers averaged $2.37 per gallon for 2007, compared to $2.22 per gallon for 2006. Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation expense decreased primarily due to (1) a lower depreciable asset base resulting from $127 million in Fresh Start Adjustments discussed above and (2) 2006 adjustments to accelerate depreciation on certain limited life parts and aircraft. These decreases were partially offset by amortization expense of $146 million related to intangibles created in connection with the Fresh Start Adjustments discussed above. Contracted services . The increase in contracted services is primarily due to (1) higher outsourcing related to information technology, cargo handling services and our aircraft cleaning services, (2) international expansion and (3) New York-JFK facility improvements. Landing fees and other rents. Landing fees and other rents decreased primarily due to a charge recorded in 2006 associated with Accounting Adjustments discussed above and due to benefits of restructuring certain contracts and lease obligations in bankruptcy. Aircraft Rent. The decline in aircraft rent expense is primarily due to the renegotiation and rejection of certain leases in connection with our restructuring under Chapter 11 and Fresh Start Adjustments discussed above. Profit sharing . Our broad-based employee profit sharing plan provides that, for each year in which we have an annual pre-tax profit (as defined), we will pay at least 15% of that profit to eligible employees. Based on our pre-tax earnings, we accrued $158 million under the profit sharing plan for 2007. Operating Income and Operating Margin We reported operating income of $1.1 billion and $58 million for 2007 and 2006, respectively. Operating margin, which is the ratio of operating income to operating revenues, was 6% and less than 1% for 2007 and 2006, respectively. Other (Expense) Income Other expense, net for 2007 was $492 million, compared to $820 million for 2006. This change is substantially attributable to (1) a 25%, or $218 million, net decrease in interest expense primarily due to the repayment of the DIP Facility in connection with our emergence from Chapter 11 and Fresh Start Adjustments discussed above, partially offset by interest expense on borrowings under a senior secured exit financing facility, which we entered into in conjunction with our emergence from bankruptcy (the Exit Facilities ), (2) a $59 million increase in interest income primarily from interest earned due to bankruptcy initiatives that was classified within reorganization items, net, in 2006 and (3) a $51 million increase to miscellaneous, net, primarily related to fuel hedge losses in 2006 and foreign currency gains in 2007 due to an increased number of transactions denominated in foreign currencies. 32 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Reorganization Items, Net Reorganization items, net totaled a $1.2 billion gain for 2007, primarily consisting of the following: Emergence gain. A net $2.1 billion gain due to our emergence from bankruptcy, comprised of (1) a $4.4 billion gain related to the discharge of liabilities subject to compromise in connection with the settlement of claims, (2) a $2.6 billion charge associated with the revaluation of our SkyMiles frequent flyer obligation and (3) a $238 million gain from the revaluation of our remaining assets and liabilities to fair value. For additional information regarding this emergence gain, see Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Aircraft financing renegotiations and rejections . A $440 million charge for estimated claims primarily associated with the restructuring of the financing arrangements for 143 aircraft and adjustments to prior claims estimates. Contract carrier agreements . A net charge of $163 million in connection with amendments to certain contract carrier agreements. For additional information regarding this charge and our contract carrier agreements, see Notes 1 and 8, respectively, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Emergence compensation . In accordance with the Plan of Reorganization, we made $130 million in lump-sum cash payments to approximately 39,000 eligible non-contract, non-management employees. We also recorded an additional charge of $32 million related to our portion of payroll related taxes associated with the issuance, as contemplated by the Plan of Reorganization, of approximately 14 million shares of common stock to those employees. For additional information regarding the common stock issuance, see Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Pilot collective bargaining agreement . An $83 million allowed general, unsecured claim in connection with the agreement between Comair, Inc., our wholly owned subsidiary ( Comair ), and ALPA to reduce Comair pilot labor costs. Facility leases . A net $43 million gain, which primarily reflects (1) a $126 million net gain related to our settlement agreement with the Massachusetts Port Authority partially offset by (2) a net $80 million charge from an allowed general, unsecured claim in connection with the settlement relating to the restructuring of certain of our lease and other obligations at the Cincinnati Airport. For additional information regarding these matters, see Notes 1, 6 and 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Reorganization items, net totaled a $6.2 billion charge for 2006, primarily consisting of the following: Pilot pension termination . $2.2 billion and $801 million allowed general, unsecured claims in connection with our settlement agreements with the PBGC and a group representing retired pilots, respectively. Charges for these claims were offset by $1.3 billion in settlement gains associated with the derecognition of the previously recorded obligations for the qualified defined benefit pension plan for pilots (the Pilot Plan ) and the related pilot non-qualified plans upon the termination of these plans. For additional information regarding these settlement agreements and the termination of these plans, see Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Pilot collective bargaining agreement . A $2.1 billion allowed general, unsecured claim in connection with our comprehensive agreement with ALPA reducing our pilot labor costs. Aircraft financing renegotiations and rejections . A $1.7 billion charge for estimated claims associated with restructuring the financing arrangements for 188 aircraft and the rejection of 16 aircraft leases. Retiree healthcare benefit claims . A $539 million charge for allowed general, unsecured claims in connection with agreements that we reached with committees representing both pilot and non-pilot retired employees reducing their postretirement healthcare benefits. For additional information regarding this matter, see Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 33 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Income Tax (Provision) Benefit For 2007, we recorded an income tax provision totaling $207 million. We have recorded a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets, excluding the effect of the deferred tax liabilities that are unable to be used as a source of income against these deferred tax assets, based on our belief that it is more likely than not that the asset will not be realized in the future. We will continue to assess the need for a full valuation allowance in future periods. In accordance with SOP 90-7, the reduction of the valuation allowance associated with the realization of pre-emergence deferred tax assets will sequentially reduce the value of our recorded goodwill followed by other indefinite-lived intangible assets until the net carrying cost of these assets is zero. Accordingly, during 2007, we reduced goodwill by $211 million with respect to the realization of pre-emergence deferred tax assets. For 2006, we recorded an income tax benefit totaling $765 million. The amount primarily reflects a decrease to our deferred tax asset valuation allowances from the reversal of accrued pension liabilities associated with the Pilot Plan and pilot non-qualified plan obligations upon each plan termination. For additional information about the income tax valuation allowance, see Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Results of Operations 2006 Compared to 2005 Net Loss Our consolidated net loss was $6.2 billion and $3.8 billion in 2006 and 2005, respectively. The results for 2006 include (1) a $6.2 billion charge to reorganization items, net, (2) a $310 million charge associated with the Accounting Adjustments discussed above and (3) a $765 million income tax benefit. The results for 2005 include an $888 million charge to restructuring, asset writedowns, pension settlements and related items, net, and an $884 million charge to reorganization items, net. Operating Revenue Predecessor Year Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease) % Increase (Decrease) (in millions) 2006 2005 Operating Revenue: Passenger: Mainline $ 11,640 $ 11,367 $ 273 2 % Regional affiliates 3,853 3,225 628 19 % Total passenger revenue 15,493 14,592 901 6 % Cargo 498 524 (26) (5)% Other, net 1,541 1,364 177 13 % Total operating revenue $ 17,532 $ 16,480 $ 1,052 6 % Operating revenue totaled $17.5 billion for 2006, a $1.1 billion, or 6%, increase compared to 2005. Passenger revenue increased 6%, while capacity decreased 6%. The increase in passenger revenue is due to a rise of 10% and 12% in passenger mile yield and PRASM, respectively, from fare increases that reflect strong passenger demand as well as actions we took during our Chapter 11 proceedings to achieve revenue and network productivity improvements. Passenger revenue and other, net revenue were negatively impacted by Accounting Adjustments discussed above. Passenger revenue of regional affiliates increased due to (1) a change in how we classify ASA revenue as a result of its sale to SkyWest and (2) new contract carrier agreements with Shuttle America Corporation ( Shuttle America ) and Freedom Airlines, Inc. ( Freedom ), effective September 1, 2005 34 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements and October 1, 2005, respectively. Other, net revenue increased primarily due to increased Skymiles revenue due to a change in accounting methodology and growth in our aircraft maintenance in-sourcing business. Increase (Decrease) Year Ended December 31, 2006 vs. 2005 Predecessor (in millions) Year Ended December 31, 2006 Passenger Revenue RPMs ASMs Passenger Mile Yield PRASM Load Factor Passenger Revenue: North America $ 11,678 2 % (10) % (13) % 14 % 18 % 2.8 pts International 3,695 23 % 20 % 21 % 2 % 2 % (0.6)pts Charter revenue 120 2 % (21) % (9) % 28 % 12 % (5.3)pts Total passenger revenue $ 15,493 6 % (3) % (6) % 10 % 12 % 2.0 pts North American Passenger Revenue . North American passenger revenue increased 2%, driven by a 14% increase in passenger mile yield and a 2.8 point increase in load factor, which were partially offset by a 13% decline in capacity. PRASM increased 18%. The decline in capacity, partially offset by the increase in load factor, resulted in a 10% decline in RPMs. The increases in passenger revenue, passenger mile yield and PRASM reflect (1) fare increases implemented as part of the improved industry revenue environment and (2) the positive impact of our strategic initiatives, including right-sizing capacity to better meet customer demand and increasing point-to-point flying and simplifying our domestic hubs to achieve a greater local traffic mix. International Passenger Revenue . International passenger revenue increased 23%, generated by a 20% increase in RPMs from a 21% increase in capacity. The passenger mile yield and PRASM both increased by 2%. These results reflect increases in service to international destinations, primarily in the Atlantic and Latin America markets, from the restructuring of our route network. Our mix of domestic versus international capacity was 71% and 29%, respectively, for 2006, compared to 77% and 23%, respectively, for 2005. Operating Expense Predecessor Increase (Decrease) % Increase (Decrease) Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2006 2005 Operating Expense: Aircraft fuel and related taxes $ 4,433 $ 4,466 $ (33) (1)% Salaries and related costs 4,365 5,290 (925) (17)% Contract carrier arrangements 2,656 1,318 1,338 102 % Depreciation and amortization 1,276 1,273 3 % Contracted services 918 936 (18) (2) % Aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs 921 893 28 3 % Passenger commissions and other selling expenses 888 948 (60) (6)% Landing fees and other rents 881 878 3 % Passenger service 332 348 (16) (5)% Aircraft rent 316 543 (227) (42)% Restructuring, asset writedowns, pension settlements and related items, net 13 888 (875) (99)% Other 475 700 (225) (32)% Total operating expense $ 17,474 $ 18,481 $ (1,007) (5)% 35 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Operating expense was $17.5 billion for 2006, a $1.0 billion, or 5%, decrease compared to 2005. Operating capacity decreased 6% to 148.0 billion ASMs primarily due to the reduction of our aircraft fleet as part of our business plan initiatives. CASM remained relatively constant at 11.80 . Aircraft fuel and related taxes. Aircraft fuel and related taxes remained relatively constant due to reduced consumption despite higher fuel prices. Our average fuel price per gallon increased 17% to $2.10. Fuel gallons consumed decreased 15% primarily due to a reduction in Mainline capacity and our sale of ASA. As a result of this sale, ASA fuel gallons are no longer part of our fuel gallons consumed. Aircraft fuel expense includes fuel hedge losses of $108 million in 2006. We had no fuel hedge gains or losses in 2005. Salaries and related costs . The decrease in salaries and related costs primarily reflects an 11% decline due to lower Mainline headcount and our sale of ASA, and an 8% decrease from salary rate and benefit cost reductions for our pilot and non-pilot employees, partially offset by Accounting Adjustments discussed above. Contract carrier arrangements . Contract carrier arrangements expense increased primarily due to a 73% increase from the change in how we classify ASA expense as a result of its sale to SkyWest and an 18% increase from new contract carrier agreements with Shuttle America and Freedom. Landing fees and other rents . Landing fees and other rents remained relatively constant due to (1) a 4% decrease from the change in how we classify ASA expense as a result of its sale to SkyWest and (2) a net 4% decrease due to our shifting of capacity from domestic to international offset by Accounting Adjustments discussed above. Aircraft rent . The decline in aircraft rent expense is primarily due to a 29% decrease from the renegotiation and rejection of certain leases in connection with our restructuring efforts and an 8% decrease from the change in how we classify ASA expense as a result of its sale to SkyWest. Restructuring, asset writedowns, pension settlements and related items, net . For 2006, restructuring, asset writedowns, pension settlements and related items, net totaled a $13 million charge, primarily due to the following: Workforce Reduction . A $29 million charge related to our decision in 2005 to reduce staffing by approximately 7,000 to 9,000 jobs by December 2007. This charge was partially offset by a $21 million reduction in accruals associated with prior year workforce reduction programs. For 2005, restructuring, asset writedowns, pension settlements and related items, net totaled an $888 million charge consisting of the following: Pension curtailment charge . A $447 million curtailment charge related to the Pilot Plan and the qualified defined benefit pension plan for eligible non-pilot employees and retirees (the Non-Pilot Plans ). This charge relates to the freeze of service accruals under the Pilot Plan effective December 31, 2004, and the impact of the planned reduction of 6,000 to 7,000 jobs announced in November 2004 on the Non-Pilot Plan (see Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Pension settlements . $388 million in settlement charges primarily related to the Pilot Plan due to a significant increase in pilot retirements and lump sum distributions from plan assets (see Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Workforce reduction . A $46 million charge related to our decision in 2005 to reduce staffing by approximately 7,000 to 9,000 jobs by December 2007. This charge was partially offset by a net $3 million reduction in accruals associated with prior year workforce reduction programs. Asset charges . A $10 million charge related to the removal from service of six B-737-200 aircraft prior to their lease expiration dates. 36 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Other. The decrease in other operating expense primarily reflects (1) a 13% decrease due to an adjustment related to certain non-income tax reserves, (2) a 12% decrease from the Accounting Adjustments discussed above and (3) a 10% decrease related to the change in how we classify ASA expense as a result of its sale to SkyWest. Operating Income (Loss) and Operating Margin We reported operating income of $58 million for 2006, compared to an operating loss of $2.0 billion for 2005. Operating margin, which is the ratio of operating income (loss) to operating revenue, was less than 1% and (12%) for 2006 and 2005, respectively. Other (Expense) Income Other expense, net was $820 million for 2006, compared to $974 million for 2005. This change is substantially attributable to (1) a 16%, or $162 million, decrease in interest expense primarily due to a $206 million decrease associated with the accounting treatment of certain interest charges under our Chapter 11 proceedings in accordance with SOP 90-7 (see Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements), partially offset by a $97 million increase from a higher level of debt outstanding and higher interest rates and (2) a $19 million increase to miscellaneous, net, primarily related to the ineffective portion of our fuel hedge positions. Reorganization Items, Net Reorganization items, net totaled a $6.2 billion charge for 2006. For additional information about these items, see Combined Results of Operations 2007 Compared to 2006. Reorganization items, net totaled an $884 million charge for 2005, primarily consisting of the following: Aircraft financing renegotiations, rejections and repossessions . A $611 million charge for estimated claims associated with restructuring the financing arrangements for seven aircraft, the rejection of 50 aircraft leases and the repossession of 15 aircraft. Debt issuance and discount costs . A $163 million charge associated with the write-off of certain debt issuance costs and discounts in conjunction with the valuation of our unsecured and undersecured debt. Facility leases . An $88 million charge for estimated claims in connection with the rejection of certain unexpired facility leases and the related bond obligations. Income Tax Benefit For 2006, we recorded an income tax benefit totaling $765 million. The amount primarily reflects a decrease to our deferred tax asset valuation allowances from the reversal of accrued pension liabilities associated with the Pilot Plan and pilot non-qualified plan obligations upon each plan termination. For 2005, we recorded an income tax benefit totaling $41 million. The amount is primarily the result of a $1.6 billion adjustment to our deferred tax asset valuation allowance due to increases in the deferred tax asset related to our additional minimum pension liability and net operating loss carryforwards. For additional information about the income tax valuation allowance, see Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Financial Condition and Liquidity We expect to meet our cash needs for 2008 from cash flows from operations, cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments and financing arrangements. We also have an undrawn $1.0 billion revolving credit facility that is a part of our Exit Facilities. Our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments were $2.8 billion at December 31, 2007, compared to $2.6 billion at December 31, 2006. 37 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Significant Liquidity Events Significant liquidity events during 2007 were as follows: We entered into the Exit Facilities to borrow up to $2.5 billion from a syndicate of lenders. We used a portion of the proceeds from the Exit Facilities and existing cash to repay the DIP Facility. Our Exit Facilities include certain affirmative, negative and financial covenants. We were in compliance with these covenants at December 31, 2007. We completed the sale of $1.4 billion of the 2007-1 Certificates. The proceeds from this transaction were primarily used to prepay $961 million of existing aircraft-secured financing, effectively lowering the interest rate and deferring more than $560 million in maturities originally due in 2010 and 2011. The additional proceeds of $449 million are available for general corporate purposes. We funded $875 million associated with two bankruptcy-related obligations in accordance with our comprehensive agreement with ALPA and our settlement agreement with the PBGC. We entered into an amendment to our Visa/MasterCard credit card processing agreement (the Amended Processing Agreement ) that, among other things, resulted in the release by the credit card processor of the then existing $804 million cash reserve under the agreement and extended the term of the agreement to October 31, 2008. We entered into an amendment to the Spare Parts Loan with GECC. As a result of this amendment, among other things, the outstanding principal amount under the Spare Parts Loan was increased to $415 million, providing an incremental $181 million in proceeds, and the interest rate we pay under this facility was reduced. We entered into an agreement to borrow up to $233 million to finance certain pre-delivery payments payable by us to Boeing with respect to future deliveries of 10 B-737-700 aircraft and eight B-777-200LR aircraft. Our wholly owned subsidiary, Comair, entered into a long-term debt agreement to borrow up to $290 million to finance the acquisition of 14 CRJ-900 aircraft. We have provided a guarantee to the lender covering payment on behalf of Comair in the event of default. Our obligations under this debt agreement are secured by the underlying aircraft. As of December 31, 2007, $160 million of borrowings were outstanding with respect to delivery of eight aircraft. For additional information about these events, see Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Combined Sources and Uses of Cash Cash flows from operating activities Cash provided by operating activities was $1.4 billion and $993 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively. Cash flows from operating activities in 2007 reflect $875 million in cash used under the Plan of Reorganization to satisfy bankruptcy-related obligations under our comprehensive agreement with ALPA and settlement agreement with the PBGC. Cash flows from operating activities during 2007 also reflect (1) the release of $804 million from restricted cash under the Amended Processing Agreement, (2) revenue and network productivity improvements, including right-sizing capacity to better meet customer demand and the continued restructuring of our route network to reduce less productive short haul domestic flights and reallocate widebody aircraft to international routes and (3) a $476 million decrease in short-term investments primarily from sales of auction rate securities. Cash flows provided by operating activities in 2006 reflect an increase of $401 million in working capital compared to 2005. This increase was primarily a result of revenue and network productivity improvements, restructuring initiatives and labor cost reductions implemented during our Chapter 11 proceedings and an 38 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements improved revenue environment. Our 2006 cash flows from operating activities also include a $116 million decrease in our restricted cash balance primarily due to a release of cash from restricted to operating under agreements we reached with certain vendors. In 2005, our restricted cash balance increased significantly primarily due to cash holdbacks under our Visa/MasterCard credit card processing agreement. Cash flows from investing activities Cash used in investing activities totaled $625 million and $361 million for 2007 and 2006, respectively. Cash used in investing activities in 2007 reflects an increase in investment of $545 million for flight equipment and advanced payments for aircraft commitments and $78 million for ground property and equipment. During 2007, restricted cash decreased by $185 million. In addition, we received $34 million and $83 million from the sale of our investments in priceline.com Incorporated and ARINC Incorporated, respectively. Cash used in investing activities totaled $361 million for 2006, compared to cash provided by investing activities of $22 million for 2005. This change reflects a $401 million decrease in cash used for the purchase of flight and ground equipment in 2006. Our 2005 cash flows from investing activities include $842 million in proceeds from our sale of ASA and certain flight equipment. Cash flows from financing activities Cash used in financing activities totaled $120 million and $606 million for 2007 and 2006, respectively. Cash used in financing activities in 2007 primarily reflects (1) the repayment of the DIP Facility with a portion of the proceeds available under the Exit Facilities and existing cash, (2) the prepayment of $863 million of secured debt with a portion of the proceeds from the sale of the 2007-1 Certificates and (3) scheduled principal payments on long-term debt and capital lease obligations. During 2007, we also received proceeds from an amendment to the Spare Parts Loan, as discussed above. Cash used in financing activities totaled $606 million for 2006, compared to cash provided by financing activities of $830 million for 2005. This change is primarily due to the net proceeds we received under the DIP Facility shortly after our Chapter 11 filing in 2005. While in Chapter 11, we ceased making payments on our unsecured debt. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2007 that relate to debt, operating leases, aircraft order commitments, capital leases, contract carrier obligations, other material, noncancelable purchase obligations and other commitments. The table does not include commitments that are contingent on events or other factors that are uncertain or unknown at this time, some of which are discussed in footnotes to this table and in the text immediately following the footnotes. Contractual Obligations by Year (in millions) 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 After 2012 Total Long-term debt (1) $ 1,478 $ 1,035 $ 1,857 $ 1,588 $ 1,567 $ 3,964 $ 11,489 Operating lease payments (2) 1,231 1,062 969 824 758 3,854 8,698 Aircraft order commitments (3) 1,295 1,248 712 3,255 Capital lease obligations (4) 128 125 125 118 84 112 692 Contract carrier obligations (5) 2,411 2,520 2,575 2,574 2,458 13,978 26,516 Other purchase obligations (6) 161 69 60 50 36 14 390 Other commitments (7) 41 40 40 40 40 20 221 Total (8) $ 6,745 $ 6,099 $ 6,338 $ 5,194 $ 4,943 $ 21,942 $ 51,261 (1) Interest payments related to long-term debt are included in the table. The principal portion of these obligations is included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Estimated amounts for future interest and 39 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements related payments in connection with our long-term debt obligations are based on the fixed and variable interest rates specified in the associated debt agreements. Estimates on variable rate interest were calculated using implied short-term LIBOR based on LIBOR at December 31, 2007. Also included in the table are other debt-related payments which represent credit enhancements required in conjunction with certain financing agreements. (2) This amount includes our noncancelable operating leases and our lease payments related to aircraft under our contract carrier agreements with ASA, Chautauqua, ExpressJet Airlines, Inc. ( ExpressJet ), Freedom, Pinnacle Airlines, Inc. ( Pinnacle ), Shuttle America and SkyWest Airlines. (3) For additional information regarding our aircraft order commitments, see Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. (4) Interest payments related to capital lease obligations are included in the table. The present value of these obligations, excluding interest, is included on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. (5) This amount represents our minimum fixed obligation under our contract carrier agreements with ASA, Chautauqua, ExpressJet, Freedom, Pinnacle, Shuttle America and SkyWest Airlines (excluding contract carrier lease payments accounted for as operating leases). (6) Includes purchase obligations pursuant to which we are required to make minimum payments for goods and services, including but not limited to insurance, outsourced human resource services, marketing, maintenance, obligations related to Comair, technology, sponsorships and other third party services and products. (7) Represents commitments to certain vendors for which we are obligated to generate specified amounts of revenue related to ticket booking fees. (8) In addition to the contractual obligations included in the table, we have significant cash obligations that are not included in the table. For example, we will pay wages required under collective bargaining agreements, fund pension plans (as discussed below), purchase capacity under contract carrier arrangements (as discussed below), settle tax contingency reserves (as discussed below) and pay credit card processing fees and fees for other goods and services, including those related to fuel, maintenance and commissions. While we are parties to legally binding contracts regarding these goods and services, the actual commitment is contingent on certain factors such as volume and/or variable rates that are uncertain or unknown at this time. Therefore, these items are not included in the table. In addition, purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business are excluded from the table and any amounts which we are liable for under the purchase orders are included in current liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Payments under our profit-sharing plan or pursuant to our 2007 Performance Compensation Plan are contingent on factors unknown at this time and, therefore, are not included in this table. The following items are not included in the table above: Pension Plans. We sponsor qualified defined contribution and defined benefit pension plans for eligible employees and retirees. Our funding obligations for these plans are governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act ( ERISA ). Estimates of pension plan funding requirements can vary materially from actual funding requirements because the estimates are based on various assumptions, including those described below. Defined Contribution Pension Plans ( DC Plans ). During 2007, we contributed approximately $112 million to our DC Plans, which include the Delta Family-Care Savings Plan and the Delta Pilots Defined Contribution Plan. In addition to the $112 million contribution, we paid approximately $61 million directly to employees that otherwise would have been contributed to the DC Plans on their behalf, but for limits imposed by the Internal Revenue Code on contributions to such plans. In 2008, we expect to contribute approximately $195 million to our DC Plans or directly to employees once they reach the applicable Internal Revenue Code limits. 40 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Defined Benefit Pension Plans ( DB Plans ). During 2007, we contributed approximately $116 million to our DB Plans. Under our settlement agreement with the PBGC, the Pilot Plan was terminated effective September 2, 2006. In addition, our non-qualified defined benefit pension plans for pilots were terminated effective September 2, 2006. Effective December 31, 2005, future pay and service accruals under the Non-Pilot Plan were frozen. Effective April 1, 2007, we elected the alternative funding schedule under Section 402(a)(1) of the Pension Protection Act of 2006 with respect to the Non-Pilot Plan. We also rejected in bankruptcy our non-qualified defined benefit plans for non-pilot employees. As a result, no further benefits will be paid from these non-qualified plans. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 allows us to reduce the funding obligations for the Non-Pilot Plan over the next several years. While this legislation makes our funding obligations for the Non-Pilot Plan more predictable, factors outside our control will continue to have an impact on the funding requirements for that plan. Estimates of future funding requirements for the Non-Pilot Plan are based on various assumptions, including, among other things, the actual and projected market performance of assets of the Non-Pilot Plan; statutory requirements; the terms of the Non-Pilot Plan; and demographic data for participants in the Non-Pilot Plan, including the number of participants and the rate of participant attrition. Assuming current funding rules, we estimate that the funding requirements under the Non-Pilot Plan for 2008 to 2012 will aggregate approximately $500 million. Contract Carrier Agreements . We have long-term capacity purchase agreements with several regional air carriers. Under these agreements, the carriers operate some or all of their aircraft using our flight code, and we schedule those aircraft, sell the seats on those flights and retain the related revenue. We pay those airlines an amount, as defined in the applicable agreement, which is based on a determination of their cost of operating those flights and other factors intended to approximate market rates for those services. Under these long-term capacity purchase agreements, we are obligated to pay certain minimum fixed obligations, which are included in the table above. The remaining estimated expense is not included in the table because this expense is contingent based on the costs associated with the operation of contract carrier flights by those air carriers as well as rates that are unknown at this time. We cannot reasonably estimate at this time our expense under the contract carrier agreements in 2008 and thereafter. For information regarding payments we may be required to make in connection with certain terminations of our capacity purchase agreements with Chautauqua and Shuttle America, see Contingencies Related to Termination of Contract Carrier Agreements in Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. FIN 48. We adopted FIN 48 on January 1, 2007. The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2007 is $143 million. We have accrued $54 million for the payment of interest and $8 million for the payment of penalties related to these unrecognized tax benefits. We are currently under audit by the Internal Revenue Service for the 2005 and 2006 tax years. 41 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements It is reasonably possible that during 2008 the settlement of bankruptcy claims will result in significant changes to the amount of unrecognized tax benefits on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. We cannot presently estimate the range of the reasonably possible outcomes. Legal Contingencies . We are involved in various legal proceedings relating to employment practices, environmental issues and other matters concerning our business. We cannot reasonably estimate the potential loss for certain legal proceedings because, for example, the litigation is in its early stages or the plaintiff does not specify the damages being sought. Other Contingent Obligations under Contracts . In addition to the contractual obligations discussed above, we have certain contracts for goods and services that require us to pay a penalty, acquire inventory specific to us or purchase contract specific equipment, as defined by each respective contract, if we terminate the contract without cause prior to its expiration date. Because these obligations are contingent on our termination of the contract without cause prior to its expiration date, no obligation would exist unless such a termination occurs. For additional information about other contingencies not discussed above, as well as information related to general indemnifications, see Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Application of Critical Accounting Policies Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions. We periodically evaluate these estimates and assumptions, which are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates. Fresh-Start Reporting. As previously noted, upon emergence from Chapter 11, we adopted fresh start reporting, which required us to revalue our assets and liabilities to fair value. In estimating fair value, we based our estimates and assumptions on the guidance prescribed by SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements ( SFAS 157 ), which we were required to adopt in connection with our adoption of fresh start reporting. SFAS 157, among other things, defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure about fair value measurements. To facilitate the calculation of the enterprise value of the Successor, management developed a set of financial projections for the Successor using a number of estimates and assumptions. The enterprise and corresponding reorganization value of the Successor was based on financial projections using various valuation methods, including (1) a comparison of our projected performance to the market values of comparable companies; (2) a review and analysis of several recent transactions in the airline industry; and (3) a calculation of the present value of future cash flows based on our projections. Utilizing these methodologies, the reorganization value of the Successor was estimated to be in the range of $9.4 billion to $12.0 billion. The enterprise value, and corresponding reorganization value, is dependent upon achieving the future financial results set forth in our projections, as well as the realization of certain other assumptions. There can be no assurance that the projections will be achieved or that the assumptions will be realized. The excess reorganization value (using the low end of the range) over the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible assets, net of liabilities, has been reflected as goodwill in the Fresh Start Consolidated Balance Sheet. The financial projections and estimates of enterprise and reorganization value are not incorporated into this Form 10-K. All estimates, assumptions and financial projections, including the fair value adjustments, the financial projections, and the enterprise value and reorganization value projections, are inherently subject to significant uncertainties and the resolution of contingencies beyond our control. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the estimates, assumptions and financial projections will be realized, and actual results could vary materially. 42 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements For the impact that the adoption of fresh start reporting had on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, see Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Frequent Flyer Program (the SkyMiles Program ). We have a frequent flyer program offering incentives to increase travel on Delta. This program allows participants to earn mileage credits by flying on Delta, Delta Connection Carriers and participating airlines, as well as through participating companies such as credit card companies, hotels and car rental agencies. We also sell mileage credits to other airlines and to non-airline businesses. Mileage credits can be redeemed for free or upgraded air travel on Delta and participating airlines, for membership in our Crown Room Club and for other program awards. As a result of the adoption of fresh start reporting upon emergence from bankruptcy, we revalued our SkyMiles frequent flyer award liability to estimated fair value. The fair value of our SkyMiles frequent flyer award liability was determined based on the estimated price that third parties would require us to pay for them to assume the obligation for miles expected to be redeemed under the SkyMiles Program. This estimated price was determined based on the weighted average equivalent ticket value of a SkyMiles award, redeemed for travel on Delta or a participating airline. The weighted average equivalent ticket value contemplates differing classes of service, domestic and international itineraries and the carrier providing the award travel. At April 30, 2007, we recorded deferred revenue equal to $0.0083 for each mile we estimate will ultimately be redeemed under the SkyMiles Program. Upon emergence from bankruptcy, we changed our accounting policy to a deferred revenue model for all frequent flyer miles. We now account for all miles earned and sold as separate deliverables in a multiple element revenue arrangement as prescribed by EITF 00-21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables. We use the residual method for revenue recognition of mileage credits. The fair value of the mileage credit component is determined based on the low end of the range of the prices at which we sell mileage credits to other airlines, which price is currently $0.0054 per mile and will be re-evaluated annually. Under the residual method, the portion of the revenue from the sale of mileage credits that approximates fair value is deferred and recognized as passenger revenue when miles are redeemed and services are provided based on the weighted average price of all miles that have been deferred. The portion of the revenue received in excess of the fair value, the marketing premium, is recognized in income when the related services are provided and classified as other, net revenue. For mileage credits which we estimate are not likely to be redeemed ( Breakage ), we recognize the associated value proportionally during the period in which the remaining mileage credits are expected to be redeemed. The estimate of Breakage, which is currently 22%, is based on historical redemption patterns. A change in assumptions as to the period over which mileage credits are expected to be redeemed, the actual redemption activity for mileage credits or our estimate of the fair value of mileage credits expected to be redeemed could have a material impact on our revenue in the year in which the change occurs and in future years. At December 31, 2007, the aggregate deferred revenue balance associated with the SkyMiles program was $3.3 billion. A hypothetical 1% change in our outstanding number of miles estimated to be redeemed would result in a $27 million impact on our deferred revenue liability. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Goodwill reflects the excess of the reorganization value of the Successor over the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible assets, net of liabilities, from the adoption of fresh start reporting. We recorded $12.3 billion of goodwill upon emergence from bankruptcy. Identifiable intangible assets consist primarily of trade name, takeoff and arrival slots, SkyTeam alliance agreements, marketing agreements, customer relationships and certain contracts. These intangible assets, excluding marketing agreements, customer relationships and certain contracts, are indefinite-lived assets and are not amortized. Marketing agreements, customer relationships and certain contracts are definite-lived intangible assets and are amortized over the estimated economic life of the respective agreements and contracts. 43 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, we apply a fair value-based impairment test to the net book value of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets on an annual basis and, if certain events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred, on an interim basis. The annual impairment test date for our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets is October 1. In evaluating our goodwill for impairment, we first compare our one reporting unit fair value to its carrying value. We estimate the fair value of our reporting unit by considering (1) our market capitalization, (2) any premium to our market capitalization an investor would pay for a controlling interest ( Control Premium ), (3) the potential value of synergies and other benefits that could result from such interest, (4) market multiple and recent transactions values of peer companies and (5) projected discounted future cash flows, if reasonably estimable. If the reporting unit fair value exceeds its carrying value, no further testing is required. If, however, the reporting unit carrying value exceeds its fair value, we then determine the amount of the impairment charge, if any. We recognize an impairment charge if the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. We perform the impairment test for our indefinite-lived intangible assets by comparing the asset fair value to its carrying value. Fair value is estimated based on recent market transactions where available or projected discounted future cash flows. We recognize an impairment charge if the asset carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value. At October 1, 2007, we performed the annual required impairment test of our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, which resulted in no impairment charge. For both goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, changes in assumptions or circumstances, including, but not limited to, (1) long-term negative trends in our market capitalization, (2) continued escalation of fuel prices, (3) interruption to our operations due to employee strike, terrorist attack, etc. and/or (4) consolidation of competitors within the industry, which are not offset by other factors such as improved yield or an increase in Control Premiums, could result in an impairment in the year in which the change occurs and in future years. For additional information about our accounting policy for goodwill and other intangible assets, see Notes 2 and 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Long-Lived Assets . Our flight equipment and other long-lived assets have a recorded value of $11.7 billion on our Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2007. This value is based on various factors, including the assets estimated useful lives and their estimated salvage values. In accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets ( SFAS 144 ), we record impairment losses on long-lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate the assets might be impaired and the estimated future cash flows generated by those assets are less than their carrying amounts. The impairment loss recognized is the amount by which the asset carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair value. In order to evaluate potential impairment as required by SFAS 144, we group assets at the fleet type level (the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows) and then estimate future cash flows based on projections of passenger yield, fuel costs, labor costs and other relevant factors. We estimate aircraft fair values using published sources, appraisals and bids received from third parties, as available. For additional information about our accounting policy for the impairment of long-lived assets, see Notes 2 and 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Income Tax Valuation Allowance and Contingencies . In accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, deferred tax assets should be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The future realization of our net deferred tax assets depends on the availability of sufficient future taxable income. In making this determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence and make certain assumptions. We consider, among other things, our deferred tax liabilities, the overall business environment, our historical earnings and losses, our industry historically cyclical periods of earnings and losses, and potential, current and future tax planning strategies. 44 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Our income tax provisions are based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. Although we believe that the positions taken on previously filed tax returns are reasonable, we have established tax and interest reserves in recognition that various taxing authorities may challenge the positions we have taken, which could result in additional liabilities for taxes and interest. We review the reserves as circumstances warrant and adjust the reserves as events occur that affect our potential liability, such as lapsing of applicable statutes of limitations, conclusion of tax audits, a change in exposure based on current calculations, identification of new issues, release of administrative guidance, or the rendering of a court decision affecting a particular issue. We adjust the income tax provision in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known. In the event that the adjustment pertains to a pre-emergence tax position, we would adjust goodwill followed by other indefinite-lived intangible assets until the net carrying value of these assets is zero. Beginning January 1, 2009, any adjustments to pre-emergence tax positions will be made through the income tax provision pursuant to SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations ( SFAS 141R ). For additional information about income taxes, see Notes 2 and 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Pension Plans . We sponsor DB Plans for our eligible employees and retirees. The impact of these DB Plans on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2007 and 2006 and our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the eight months ended December 31, 2007, the four months ended April 30, 2007 and the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 is presented in Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We currently estimate that our defined benefit pension plan expense related to our Non-Pilot Plan in 2008 will be approximately $35 million. The effect of our DB Plans on our Consolidated Financial Statements is subject to many assumptions. We believe the most critical assumptions are (1) the weighted average discount rate and (2) the expected long-term rate of return on the assets of our DB Plans. The Pilot Plan and pilot non-qualified defined benefit pension plans were terminated during 2006. For additional information regarding these terminations, see Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We determine our weighted average discount rate on our measurement date primarily by reference to annualized rates earned on high quality fixed income investments and yield-to-maturity analysis specific to our estimated future benefit payments. We used a weighted average discount rate of 6.08% and 5.88% at December 31, 2007 and September 30, 2006, respectively. Additionally, our weighted average discount rate for net periodic benefit cost in each of the past three years has varied from the rate selected on our measurement date, ranging from 5.67% to 6.01% between 2005 and 2007, due to remeasurements throughout the year. The impact of a 0.50% change in our weighted average discount rate is shown in the table below. The expected long-term rate of return on the assets of our DB Plans is based primarily on plan specific investment studies using historical returns on our DB Plans assets. The investment strategy for pension plan assets is to utilize a diversified mix of global public and private equity portfolios, public and private fixed income portfolios, and private real estate and natural resource investments to earn a long-term investment return that meets or exceeds a 9% annualized return target. Our historical annualized three, five, 10 and 15 year rate of return on plan assets is approximately 13%, 14%, 8% and 11%, respectively, as of December 31, 2007. The impact of a 0.50% change in our expected long-term rate of return is shown in the table below. Change in Assumption Effect on 2008 Pension Expense Effect on Accrued Pension Liability at December 31, 2007 0.50% decrease in discount rate - 9 million + 452 million 0.50% increase in discount rate + 6 million - 426 million 0.50% decrease in expected return on assets + 23 million 0.50% increase in expected return on assets - 23 million For additional information about our pension plans, see Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 45 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In December 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS 141R. SFAS 141R provides guidance for recognizing and measuring goodwill acquired in a business combination and requires disclosure of information to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination. SFAS 141R is effective for fiscal years beginning on January 1, 2009. For additional information regarding SFAS 141R, see Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Market Risks Associated with Financial Instruments We have significant market risk exposure related to aircraft fuel prices and interest rates. Market risk is the potential negative impact of adverse changes in these prices or rates on our Consolidated Financial Statements. To manage the volatility relating to these exposures, we periodically enter into derivative transactions pursuant to stated policies (see Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements). We expect adjustments to the fair value of financial instruments accounted for under SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities to result in ongoing volatility in earnings and shareowners equity. The following sensitivity analyses do not consider the effects of a change in demand for air travel, the economy as a whole or actions we may take to seek to mitigate our exposure to a particular risk. For these and other reasons, the actual results of changes in these prices or rates may differ materially from the following hypothetical results. Aircraft Fuel Price Risk Our results of operations may be materially impacted by changes in the price of aircraft fuel. We periodically use derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, which are comprised of crude oil, heating oil and jet fuel swap, collar and call option contracts, in an effort to manage our exposure to changes in aircraft fuel prices. For 2007, aircraft fuel and related taxes accounted for 26% of our total operating expenses. Aircraft fuel and related taxes for 2007 increased 6% compared to 2006 primarily due to higher average fuel prices. Fuel prices averaged $2.21 per gallon, including fuel hedge gains of $51 million, for 2007 compared to $2.10 per gallon, including fuel hedge losses of $108 million, for 2006. As of January 31, 2008, we have hedged a portion of our projected fuel requirements, including those of our contract carriers under capacity purchase agreements, for the three years ending December 31, 2010, using crude oil and heating oil call option and swap contracts as follows: (in millions, unless otherwise stated) Weighted Average Contract Strike Price per Gallon Percentage of Projected Fuel Requirements Hedged Contract Fair Value at January 31, 2008 (1) Contract Fair Value Based Upon 10% Rise in Futures Prices (1)(2) Increase in Aircraft Fuel Expense Due to 10% Rise in Jet Fuel Price (3) 2008 Heating oil Call options $ 2.43 22 % $ 91 $ 157 $ 529 Swaps $ 2.44 2 2 15 47 Total 24 % $ 93 $ 172 $ 576 2009 Crude oil Call options $ 2.05 9 % $ 61 $ 70 $ 723 Total 9 % $ 61 $ 70 $ 723 46 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements (in millions, unless otherwise stated) Weighted Average Contract Strike Price per Gallon Percentage of Projected Fuel Requirements Hedged Contract Fair Value at January 31, 2008 (1) Contract Fair Value Based Upon 10% Rise in Futures Prices (1) (2) Increase in Aircraft Fuel Expense Due to 10% Rise in Jet Fuel Price (3) 2010 Crude oil Call options $ 2.04 2 % $ 16 $ 17 $ 787 Total 2 % $ 16 $ 17 $ 787 (1) Contract fair value includes the cost of premiums paid. (2) Projection based upon average futures prices per gallon by contract settlement month. (3) Projection based upon estimated average jet fuel price per gallon of $2.70, $2.81 and $2.93 and estimated aircraft fuel consumption of 2.5 billion gallons, 2.6 billion gallons and 2.7 billion gallons for 2008, 2009 and 2010, respectively, inclusive of the impact of fuel hedge instruments. For additional information regarding our exposure to market risks, see Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to market risk from volatility in interest rates is primarily associated with our long-term debt obligations. Market risk associated with our fixed and variable rate long-term debt relates to the potential reduction in fair value and negative impact to future earnings, respectively, from an increase in interest rates. We had $4.5 billion of fixed-rate debt and $3.8 billion of variable-rate debt at December 31, 2007. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, a 10% increase in average annual interest rates would have decreased the estimated fair value of our fixed-rate long-term debt by $332 million and $114 million, respectively, and increased interest expense on our variable-rate long-term debt by $19 million and $24 million, respectively. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, we did not have any interest rate swaps or contractual arrangements that would reduce our interest expense. For additional information on our long-term debt, see Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Glossary of Defined Terms ASM Available Seat Mile. A measure of capacity.
