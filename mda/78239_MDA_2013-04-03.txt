Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations OVERVIEW The following discussion and analysis is intended to provide you with information about us, our operations and our financial performance. It should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes, which are included elsewhere in this report. We are one of the largest branded apparel companies in the world, with a heritage dating back over 130 years. Our brand portfolio consists of nationally and internationally recognized brand names, including our own brands Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger, Van Heusen, IZOD, ARROW and Bass, and our licensed brands Geoffrey Beene , Kenneth Cole New York , Kenneth Cole Reaction , MICHAEL Michael Kors , Sean John , Chaps , Donald J. Trump Signature Collection , JOE Joseph Abboud , DKNY , Ike Behar and John Varvatos, as well as certain other owned, licensed and private label brands. We acquired Warnaco on February 13, 2013 for $3.1 billion, of which $2.2 billion was paid in cash and the balance through the issuance of approximately 7.7 million shares of our common stock. We funded the cash portion and related costs of the acquisition and repaid a portion of our and Warnaco previously outstanding debt with the net proceeds of: (i) an offering 31 of $700.0 million of 4 1/2% senior notes due 2022; and (ii) $3.075 billion of term loans borrowed under new senior secured credit facilities. These items are more fully described in the section entitled Liquidity and Capital Resources below. Warnaco designs, sources, markets, licenses and distributes a broad line of intimate apparel, sportswear and swim products worldwide. Warnaco products are sold under the highly-recognized Calvin Klein , Speedo , Warner and Olga brand names and are distributed domestically and internationally, through all major channels of distribution. The Warnaco transaction, which follows our transformational acquisitions of Calvin Klein in 2003 and Tommy Hilfiger in 2010, reinforces our strategy to drive the Calvin Klein brand reach globally. Prior to the acquisition, Warnaco was our largest licensee for Calvin Klein products and the royalties it paid us, together with fees paid on its sales of Calvin Klein underwear, sleepwear and loungewear (product categories for which it beneficially owns the Calvin Klein trademarks), accounted for approximately 37% of our Calvin Klein royalty, advertising and other revenue in 2012. By reuniting the Calvin Klein brand under one owner, we will have complete direct global control of the brand image and commercial decisions for the two largest Calvin Klein apparel categories jeanswear and underwear. Under a single brand vision, we will be able to better coordinate product design, merchandising, supply chain, retail distribution and marketing, which will strengthen the brand image, positioning and execution across all markets. The Warnaco acquisition also takes advantage of our and Warnaco complementary geographic operations. Warnaco operations in Asia and Latin America will enhance our opportunities in these high-growth regions, and we will have the ability to leverage our expertise and infrastructure in North America and Europe to enhance the growth and profitability of Warnaco Calvin Klein jeanswear and underwear businesses in these regions. The acquisition also brings the Speedo , Warner and Olga brands into our Heritage Brands portfolio. With a diversified brand portfolio and strong operations in every major consumer market around the world, we believe our business will be better balanced across geographies, channels of distribution, product categories and price points, and we will have the opportunity to realize revenue growth and enhanced profitability. We also believe the Warnaco acquisition creates significant opportunities to achieve synergies, principally with respect to certain corporate functions and duplicative brand management functions in North America and Europe. We expect to realize the synergies in full by the end of 2016. Our acquisition of Tommy Hilfiger in 2010 provided us with an established international platform in Europe that is a strategic complement to our strong North American presence and gives us resources and expertise needed to grow our brands and businesses internationally. As discussed above, the acquisition of Warnaco presents us with the opportunity to continue to grow our brands around the world. We are also pursuing growth opportunities for the Tommy Hilfiger brands through, among other things, joint ventures in the rapidly emerging markets of China, India and Brazil, and intensifying efforts in underdeveloped markets. Our revenue reached a record $6.0 billion in 2012, approximately 39% of which was generated internationally. Our global designer lifestyle brands, Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein , together generated approximately 72% of this revenue. We currently estimate that with the addition of Warnaco, approximately 45% of our annual revenue will be generated internationally and revenue for our Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein businesses will approximate 75% of our total revenue. Our business strategy is to manage and market a portfolio of nationally and internationally recognized brands at multiple price points and across multiple channels of distribution. We believe this strategy reduces our reliance on any one demographic group, merchandise preference, distribution channel or geographic region. Our internationally renowned designer lifestyle brands, Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger , offer additional geographic distribution channel and price point opportunities as compared to our heritage brands. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Operations Overview During 2012, we generated net sales from (i) the wholesale distribution to retailers, franchisees, licensees and distributors of men dress shirts, neckwear and underwear, men and women sportswear, footwear, accessories and related products under owned and licensed trademarks; and (ii) over 1,000 company-operated retail locations worldwide of apparel, footwear, accessories and other products under our Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger, Van Heusen, IZOD and Bass trademarks. We generate royalty, advertising and other revenue from fees for licensing the use of our trademarks. Calvin Klein royalty, advertising and other revenue, which comprised 78% of total royalty, advertising and other revenue in 2012, is derived across various regions under licenses and other arrangements for a broad array of products offered under our Calvin Klein brands. Our future operating performance and financial results will be significantly impacted by the Warnaco acquisition, including in regard to revenue, gross margin, operating expenses and cash flows. A substantial portion of our Calvin Klein licensing revenue was generated from Warnaco and, therefore, our royalty, advertising and other revenue will decrease significantly (such amount generated from Warnaco was approximately $145 million in 2012). The loss of licensing revenue 32 will also affect our gross profit on total revenue, as licensing revenue carries no cost of goods sold. In addition, the financing of the transaction has greatly impacted our capital structure, will cause our interest expense to increase, and will require us to use significant amounts of our cash to pay interest and principal. Our effective tax rate will also be impacted as Warnaco has significant operations in jurisdictions that are generally taxed at rates higher than our current effective tax rate. Additionally, we incurred in 2012, and expect to incur over the next four years, significant costs and charges related to the acquisition, integration and related restructuring. In 2012, we incurred pre-tax charges of $42.6 million and expect to incur approximately $175 million to $200 million of additional pre-tax charges over the next four years, approximately $125 million of which is expected to be incurred in 2013. Our segment reporting will also change as a result of the acquisition. We acquired Tommy Hilfiger in the second quarter of 2010. We recorded pre-tax charges in 2010 in connection with the acquisition and integration of Tommy Hilfiger that totaled $338.3 million, including: (i) a loss of $140.5 million associated with hedges against Euro to United States dollar exchange rates relating to the purchase price; (ii) short-lived non-cash valuation amortization charges of $76.8 million, which became fully amortized during 2010; and (iii) transaction, integration, restructuring and debt extinguishment costs of $121.0 million. We incurred pre-tax charges of $20.5 million and $69.5 million during 2012 and 2011, respectively, in connection with the integration and the related restructuring, including product exit charges. We reacquired during the third quarter of 2011 the rights in India to the Tommy Hilfiger trademarks that had been subject to a perpetual license. We paid $25.0 million as consideration for this transaction and are required to make annual contingent purchase price payments under certain circumstances. In connection with the transaction, we were required to record an expense of $20.7 million in 2011 due to the settlement of an unfavorable contract as a result of a pre-existing relationship with the licensee, as the license provided favorable terms to the licensee. Please see the section entitled Liquidity and Capital Resources below for a further discussion. In the fourth quarter of 2010, we exited our United Kingdom and Ireland Van Heusen dresswear and accessories business. We recorded pre-tax charges in connection with this exit of $6.6 million in 2010, which consists principally of non-cash charges. In 2011, we announced we would be exiting in 2012 our licensed Timberland men wholesale sportswear and our Izod women wholesale sportswear businesses. We incurred pre-tax charges of $8.1 million during 2011 in connection with these two initiatives. We amended and restated our senior secured credit facility in the first quarter of 2011. We recorded debt modification costs of $16.2 million in connection with this transaction. Please see the section entitled Liquidity and Capital Resources below for a further discussion. Our calculations of the comparable store sales percentages throughout this discussion are based on comparable weeks and, therefore, exclude an extra week in 2012, as our 2012 fiscal year included 53 weeks of operations. During the fourth quarter of 2012, we changed our method of accounting for our pension and other postretirement plans. As part of this change, we elected to begin immediately recognizing actuarial gains and losses in our operating results in the year in which they occur. We have applied this change retrospectively, adjusting all prior periods. This change resulted in recording actuarial losses of $28.1 million, $76.1 million and $4.5 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. 33 The following table summarizes our income statements in 2012, 2011 and 2010: 2012 2011 2010 (dollars in millions) Net sales $ 5,540.8 $ 5,410.0 $ 4,219.7 Royalty revenue 370.0 356.0 306.7 Advertising and other revenue 132.2 124.6 110.4 Total revenue 6,043.0 5,890.6 4,636.8 Gross profit 3,249.2 3,055.9 2,422.0 % of total revenue 53.8 % 51.9 % 52.2 % Selling, general and administrative expenses 2,594.3 2,549.9 2,071.8 % of total revenue 42.9 % 43.3 % 44.7 % Debt modification and extinguishment costs 16.2 6.7 Other loss 140.5 Equity in income of unconsolidated affiliates 5.4 1.4 Income before interest and taxes 660.4 491.2 203.0 Interest expense 118.7 129.4 128.6 Interest income 1.5 1.3 1.7 Income before taxes 543.1 363.1 76.2 Income tax expense 109.3 87.4 21.8 Net income $ 433.8 $ 275.7 $ 54.4 Total Revenue Net Sales Our net sales were $5.541 billion in 2012, $5.410 billion in 2011 and $4.220 billion in 2010. The 2012 net sales increase of $130.8 million as compared to 2011 included a negative impact of approximately $210 million, or 4%, of which approximately $110 million was due to foreign currency translation and approximately $100 million was attributable to the exit from the Izod women and Timberland wholesale sportswear businesses. The overall increase in 2012 as compared to 2011 was due principally to the effect of the following items: The aggregate addition of $154.1 million of net sales attributable to growth in our Tommy Hilfiger North America and Tommy Hilfiger International segments. Within the Tommy Hilfiger North America segment, net sales increased 10%, principally driven by retail comparable store sales growth of 10%. Net sales in the Tommy Hilfiger International segment increased 2%, including a negative impact of approximately $110 million, or 6%, related to foreign currency translation. European retail comparable store sales grew 11% and the European wholesale business exhibited strong growth, but these increases were partially offset by continued weakness in Japan, where we are currently in the process of strategically repositioning and investing in the brand. The addition of $87.1 million of net sales attributable to growth in our Other (Calvin Klein Apparel) segment, driven by (i) a 12% increase in the North American Calvin Klein retail business, which was due to new store openings, store expansions and a 5% increase in comparable store sales; and (ii) a 16% increase in the North American wholesale business. The aggregate reduction of $99.6 million in net sales attributable to our Heritage Brand Wholesale Dress Furnishings, Heritage Brand Wholesale Sportswear and Heritage Brand Retail segments. Comparable store sales in the Heritage Brand Retail segment were relatively flat as compared to the prior year period, while sales in the Heritage Brand Wholesale Sportswear segment decreased 13%, due principally to the negative impact of approximately $100 million related to the exited sportswear businesses, partially offset by strong growth in our ongoing sportswear businesses in the second half of the year. The Heritage Brand Wholesale Dress Furnishings segment experienced a 7% decrease due primarily to a reduction in dress furnishings sales to J.C. Penney. 34 The 2011 net sales increase of $1.190 billion as compared to 2010 net sales was due principally to the effect of the following items: The addition of $433.7 million and $267.6 million of first quarter net sales in our Tommy Hilfiger International and Tommy Hilfiger North America segments, respectively, as the acquisition of Tommy Hilfiger was not completed until the second quarter of 2010. The addition of $262.2 million and $116.6 million, attributable to second through fourth quarter growth in the Tommy Hilfiger International and Tommy Hilfiger North America segments, respectively. This increase was driven by low double-digit growth in the European wholesale division, combined with retail comparable store sales growth of 10% and 14% for our Tommy Hilfiger International and Tommy Hilfiger North America retail businesses, respectively. Also contributing to the revenue increase was a net benefit of approximately $55 million in our Tommy Hilfiger International segment related to foreign currency translation. The addition of $85.1 million of net sales attributable to growth in our Other (Calvin Klein Apparel) segment, as our Calvin Klein retail business posted a 16% increase in comparable store sales in 2011 and the wholesale business experienced low double-digit growth. The addition of $41.0 million of sales attributable to growth in our Heritage Brand Wholesale Dress Furnishings segment. The addition of $7.9 million of sales attributable to growth in our Heritage Brand Retail segment, due principally to a 2% increase in retail comparable stores sales in 2011. The addition of $7.5 million of net sales attributable to growth in our Calvin Klein Licensing segment. The reduction of $31.2 million of sales attributable to our Heritage Brand Wholesale Sportswear segment, which was driven particularly by decreases in the Timberland division, which we exited in 2012, and the Izod division. Royalty, Advertising and Other Revenue Royalty, advertising and other revenue was $502.2 million in 2012 as compared to $480.6 million in 2011. Of the $21.6 million increase, $12.0 million was attributable to our Tommy Hilfiger business, due principally to strong performance in watches, footwear and eyewear and growth in Asia and Latin America. Within the Calvin Klein Licensing segment, global licensee royalty revenue increased 2%, including a negative impact of 1% related to foreign currency translation. Continued global growth in women sportswear, dresses, footwear and handbags was partially offset by a decline in royalty revenue related to a reduction in the European Calvin Klein bridge and accessories business attributable, in part, to our decision to terminate Warnaco licenses and operate the business directly, and weakness in jeans and women underwear in Europe and the United States. Royalty, advertising and other revenue was $480.6 million in 2011 as compared to $417.1 million in 2010. Of this $63.5 million increase, $25.6 million was attributable to our Tommy Hilfiger business, due principally to the addition of first quarter royalty, advertising and other revenue, combined with second through fourth quarter increases due to growth in Central and South America and Asia, and strong performance in tailored apparel, fragrance and eyewear. Within the Calvin Klein Licensing segment, global licensee royalty revenue increased $28.1 million, or 11%, as compared to 2010 driven by growth across virtually all product categories and regions, with jeanswear, underwear, fragrance, footwear, accessories and women sportswear and dresses performing particularly well. Calvin Klein advertising and other revenue increased $11.1 million to $108.6 million in 2011 as compared to 2010, driven principally by the launch in the first quarter of 2011 of the global marketing campaign supporting the introduction of the new ck one lifestyle brand for jeanswear, underwear and fragrance. Advertising and other revenue is generally collected and spent and, therefore, is presented as both a revenue and an expense within our income statement, with minimal net impact on earnings. Impact of Warnaco Acquisition on Future Revenue Revenue in 2013 will be significantly impacted by the acquisition of Warnaco. We currently expect revenue in 2013 will be approximately $8.2 billion. This amount reflects the elimination of approximately $200 million of revenue generated, in the aggregate, by us and Warnaco in 2012 through transactions between each other, approximately $100 million of additional lost revenue from the absence of the 53rd week in 2013 and the revenue generated by Warnaco for the first ten days of our 2013 fiscal year as the acquisition did not close until February 13, 2013. Our expectation for revenue from the acquired Warnaco business is approximately $2.15 billion, which is relatively flat as compared to Warnaco 2012 revenue (excluding approximately $230 million of revenue related to the Chaps men sportswear business, as Ralph Lauren Corporation reacquired the Chaps license effective contemporaneously with the Warnaco acquisition). Approximately $145 million of the 35 $200 million of revenue generated between us and Warnaco referred to above relates to Calvin Klein licensing revenue generated from Warnaco, and, as such, the royalty, advertising and other revenue generated by our Calvin Klein licensing business will decrease in 2013 due to the acquisition. This will also have a significant impact on our gross profit percentage on total revenue, as more fully discussed below. Gross Profit on Total Revenue Gross profit on total revenue is calculated as total revenue less cost of goods sold. Included as cost of goods sold are costs associated with the production and procurement of product, including inbound freight costs, purchasing and receiving costs, inspection costs and other product procurement related charges. All of our royalty, advertising and other revenue is included in gross profit because there is no cost of goods sold associated with such revenue. As a result, our gross profit may not be comparable to that of other entities. The following table shows our revenue mix between net sales and royalty, advertising and other revenue, as well as our gross profit as a percentage of total revenue for 2012, 2011 and 2010: 2012 2011 2010 Components of revenue: Net sales 91.7 % 91.8 % 91.0 % Royalty, advertising and other revenue 8.3 % 8.2 % 9.0 % Total 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Gross profit as a % of total revenue 53.8 % 51.9 % 52.2 % Gross profit on total revenue in 2012 was $3.249 billion, or 53.8% of total revenue, compared to $3.056 billion, or 51.9% of total revenue, in 2011. Gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased 190 basis points in 2012 as compared with 2011, due primarily to our mix of business, as we experienced faster growth in our higher-margin Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein businesses while exiting the lower-margin Izod women and Timberland wholesale sportswear businesses. In addition, our Tommy Hilfiger business experienced an increase in gross profit as a percentage of revenue resulting from higher average unit retail selling prices globally. Gross profit as a percentage of total revenue decreased 30 basis points in 2011 as compared with 2010, due principally to (i) the negative impact of higher overall product costs in 2011, particularly in the second half of the year, and increased promotional selling during 2011 in our Izod and Timberland wholesale sportswear businesses; (ii) the negative impact of a change in revenue mix, as royalty, advertising and other revenue, which does not carry a cost of sales and has a gross profit percentage of 100%, decreased in 2011 as a percentage of total revenue; (iii) the positive impact of the absence in 2011 of $44.5 million of short-lived non-cash valuation amortization charges that were recorded during 2010 as a result of the Tommy Hilfiger acquisition; and (iv) the positive impact of owning Tommy Hilfiger for a full year in 2011, as Tommy Hilfiger gross profit rates are higher than our other non-licensing businesses. We currently expect that the gross profit percentage on total revenue in 2013 will decrease as compared with 2012 due to the Warnaco acquisition, as our royalty, advertising and other revenue, which does not carry a cost of sales and has a gross profit percentage of 100%, will decrease as a percentage of total revenue and will be replaced by a directly-operated business, which does carry a cost of sales. In addition, we expect the gross profit percentage in 2013 to decrease as a result of one-time acquisition adjustments expected to be recorded in connection with the Warnaco acquisition. Selling, General and Administrative ( SG&A ) Expenses Our SG&A expenses were as follows: 2012 2011 2010 (dollars in millions) SG&A expenses $ 2,594.3 $ 2,549.9 $ 2,071.8 % of total revenue 42.9 % 43.3 % 44.7 % 36 SG&A expenses in 2012 were $2.594 billion, or 42.9% of total revenue, as compared to $2.550 billion, or 43.3% of total revenue in 2011. The 40 basis point decrease in SG&A expenses as a percentage of total revenue was due primarily to the effect of (i) an 80 basis point decrease due to lower pension expense resulting from smaller actuarial losses; and (ii) a net 50 basis point decrease due to a reduction in acquisition, integration and restructuring costs; partially offset by (iii) a 90 basis point increase due principally to faster growth in the higher-expense Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein businesses. SG&A expenses in 2011 were $2.550 billion, or 43.3% of total revenue, as compared to $2.072 million, or 44.7% of total revenue in 2010. The 140 basis point decrease in SG&A expenses as a percentage of total revenue was due primarily to the effect of (i) a net 170 basis point decrease due to a reduction in acquisition, integration and related restructuring costs; and (ii) a 90 basis point decrease due principally to leveraging of expenses; offset, in part, by (iii) a 120 basis point increase due to higher pension expense resulting from larger actuarial losses. We currently expect that our SG&A expenses as a percentage of total revenue in 2013 will decrease as compared to 2012 due principally to the addition of Warnaco businesses, most of which are lower-expense wholesale businesses. This decrease is expected to be offset, in part, by acquisition, integration and restructuring costs associated with the acquisition. Our SG&A expenses are expected to be significantly impacted by the amount of expense recorded for our pension plans due to the change in accounting method discussed above. Pension expense recorded throughout the year is calculated using actuarial valuations that incorporate assumptions and estimates about financial market, economic and demographic conditions. Differences between estimated and actual results give rise to gains and losses that are recorded immediately in pension expense, generally in the fourth quarter of the year, which can create volatility in our operating results. Debt Modification and Extinguishment Costs We incurred costs totaling $16.2 million during 2011 in connection with the amendment and restatement of our senior secured credit facility. Please refer to the section entitled Liquidity and Capital Resources below for a discussion of this transaction. We incurred a loss of $6.7 million in 2010 on the extinguishment of our 7 1/4% senior notes due 2011 and our 8 1/8% senior notes due 2013. Please refer to the section entitled Liquidity and Capital Resources below for a discussion of the tender for, and redemption of, these notes. We currently expect to incur costs in 2013 related to the termination of our previously outstanding term loans and the replacement of such term loans with new senior secured credit facilities entered into in connection with the Warnaco acquisition. Please refer to the section entitled Liquidity and Capital Resources below for a discussion of this transaction. Other Loss We settled on May 6, 2010 1.550 billion of foreign currency forward exchange contracts, which we entered into in connection with the Tommy Hilfiger acquisition to hedge against our exposure to changes in the exchange rate for the Euro, as a portion of the acquisition purchase price was payable in cash and denominated in Euros. We recorded a pre-tax loss of $140.5 million during 2010 related to these contracts. Equity in Income of Unconsolidated Affiliates The equity in income of unconsolidated affiliates during 2012 was $5.4 million as compared to $1.4 million during 2011. These amounts relate to our share of income from our joint ventures for the Tommy Hilfiger brand in China and India, both of which began operations under our partnership in the third quarter of 2011, and in Brazil, which began operations in the fourth quarter of 2012. Our investments in these joint ventures are being accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Please refer to the section entitled Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates (China, India and Brazil Joint Ventures) within Liquidity and Capital Resources below for a further discussion of our investments in these joint ventures. Interest Expense and Interest Income Interest expense decreased to $118.7 million in 2012 from $129.4 million in 2011, principally as a result of payments we made on our term loans during the last two years, partially offset by interest expense incurred on our new $700.0 million of 4 1/2% senior notes due 2022, which were issued during the fourth quarter of 2012 to fund a portion of the consideration for the Warnaco acquisition. Please refer to the section entitled Financing Arrangements within Liquidity and Capital Resources below for a further discussion. Interest income of $1.5 million in 2012 was relatively flat to $1.3 million in 2011. 37 Interest expense increased slightly to $129.4 million in 2011 from $128.6 million in 2010, principally as a result of the full year impact of our increased debt incurred related to the Tommy Hilfiger acquisition, mostly offset by the additional voluntary repayments of the debt. Interest income decreased to $1.3 million in 2011 from $1.7 million in 2010 due principally to a decrease in our average cash position during the year. Net interest expense for 2013 is currently expected to increase to approximately $200 million from $117.2 million in 2012, principally as a result of the term loans borrowed under new senior secured credit facilities and the issuance of the $700.0 million of 4 1/2% senior notes due 2022 mentioned above, which were used to fund the Warnaco acquisition and to repay a portion of our and Warnaco previously outstanding debt. Income Taxes Income tax expense was as follows: 2012 2011 2010 (dollars in millions) Income tax expense $ 109.3 $ 87.4 $ 21.8 Income tax expense as a % of pre-tax income 20.1 % 24.1 % 28.6 % The effective tax rate for 2012 was 20.1% compared with 24.1% in 2011. Our effective tax rate in 2012 was lower than the United States statutory tax rate primarily due to the benefit of the overall lower tax rates in international jurisdictions, combined with a benefit from the recognition of previously unrecognized net operating losses and tax credits, partially offset by non-deductible acquisition expenses incurred in 2012 in connection with the Warnaco acquisition. The 2012 effective tax rate was lower than 2011 due to certain foreign earnings in 2011 being taxed in the United States, as well as additional tax synergies resulting from the Tommy Hilfiger acquisition, partially offset by non-deductible acquisition expenses incurred in 2012 in connection with the Warnaco acquisition. The effective tax rate for 2011 was 24.1% compared with 28.6% in 2010. Our effective tax rate in 2011 was lower than the United States statutory tax rate primarily due to the benefit of the overall lower tax rates in international jurisdictions partially offset by foreign earnings taxed in the United States, combined with a tax benefit resulting from revaluing certain deferred tax liabilities in connection with a decrease in the statutory tax rate in Japan. The 2011 effective tax rate was lower than 2010 due in large part to significant non-deductible acquisition expenses and short-lived intangible asset amortization in 2010 in connection with the Tommy Hilfiger acquisition. We currently anticipate that our 2013 effective tax rate will be between 25.5% to 26.5%. The 2013 effective tax rate is expected to increase as compared to the 2012 effective tax rate as a result of the impact of our acquisition of Warnaco, as Warnaco has significant operations in jurisdictions that are generally taxed at rates higher than our effective tax rate. It is possible that our estimated rate could change from the mix of international and domestic pre-tax earnings, or from discrete events arising from specific transactions, audits by tax authorities or the receipt of new information. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Historical Results Cash Flow Summary Cash increased $659.0 million during 2012, including net proceeds from the $700 million senior notes offering undertaken in connection with the Warnaco acquisition, partially offset by $300 million of term loan repayments. Cash flow in 2013 will be impacted by various factors in addition to those noted below in this Liquidity and Capital Resources section, including the Warnaco acquisition and the amount of debt repayments we make in 2013. As of February 3, 2013, approximately $237 million of cash and cash equivalents was held by international subsidiaries whose undistributed earnings are considered permanently reinvested. Our intent is to reinvest these funds in international operations. If management decides at a later date to repatriate these funds to the United States, we would be required to provide taxes on these amounts based on applicable United States tax rates, net of foreign taxes already paid. 38 Operations Cash provided by operating activities was $569.5 million in 2012, as compared to $490.7 million in 2011, due primarily to the net effect of (i) an increase in net income; (ii) an increase in cash related to changes in working capital attributable to inventory and trade receivables; and (iii) a decrease in cash due to increased contributions to our defined benefit qualified pension plans. Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates (China, India and Brazil Joint Ventures) We formed a joint venture in Brazil in 2012 in which we own a 40% economic interest. The joint venture holds an exclusive license for the Tommy Hilfiger brand in Brazil that became effective on January 4, 2013. We made funding payments with respect to our 40% interest totaling $6.5 million during 2012. We formed a joint venture in China in 2011 in which we own a 45% economic interest. The joint venture assumed direct control of the Tommy Hilfiger wholesale and retail distribution business in China from the prior licensee in 2011. We made funding payments with respect to our 45% interest totaling $17.1 million during 2011. We completed a $30 million acquisition in 2011 from Ganesha Limited and Ganesha Brands Limited, both of which are affiliates of GVM International Limited ( GVM ), of a 50% economic interest in a company that was renamed Tommy Hilfiger Arvind Fashion Private Limited ( TH India ). TH India was GVM sublicensee of the Tommy Hilfiger trademarks for apparel, footwear and handbags in India. As a result of the transaction, TH India is now the direct licensee of the trademarks for all categories (other than fragrance), operates a wholesale apparel, footwear and handbags business in connection with its license, and sublicenses the trademarks for certain other product categories in the region. We made additional payments to TH India totaling $1.9 million and $1.6 million during 2012 and 2011, respectively, to contribute our 50% share of funding. Acquisition of Netherlands Franchisee We acquired during the third quarter of 2012 from a former Tommy Hilfiger franchisee in the Netherlands 100% of the share capital of ten affiliated companies, which operate 13 Tommy Hilfiger stores in the Netherlands. We paid $13.1 million as consideration for this transaction. Reacquisition of Tommy Hilfiger Tailored Apparel License We entered into agreements during 2011 to reacquire from a licensee, prior to the expiration of the license, the rights to distribute Tommy Hilfiger brand tailored apparel in Europe and acquire an outlet store from the licensee. The transfer of the rights and store ownership became effective December 31, 2012. Under these agreements, we made a payment of $9.6 million (based on the applicable exchange rate in effect on the payment date) to the licensee during the fourth quarter of 2011 and made an additional payment of $24.8 million (based on the applicable exchange rate in effect on the payment date) to the licensee during the fourth quarter of 2012. Tommy Hilfiger India Perpetually Licensed Rights Reacquisition We reacquired in 2011 the rights in India to the Tommy Hilfiger trademarks that had been subject to a perpetual license previously granted to GVM. We paid $25.0 million during the third quarter of 2011 as consideration for the transaction. In addition, we are required to make annual contingent purchase price payments based on a percentage of annual sales in excess of an agreed upon threshold of Tommy Hilfiger products in India for a period of five years (or, under certain circumstances, a period of six years) following the acquisition date. Such payments are subject to a $25.0 million aggregate maximum and are due within 60 days following each one-year period. The first one-year period commenced on July 1, 2011. During the third quarter of 2012, we made a contingent purchase price payment of $0.2 million for the first one-year period. In connection with the transaction, we recorded an expense of $20.7 million in 2011 due to the settlement of an unfavorable contract as a result of a pre-existing relationship with the licensee, as the license provided favorable terms to the licensee. Reacquisition of Tommy Hilfiger Handbag License We entered into an agreement in 2010 to reacquire from a licensee, prior to the expiration of the license, the rights to distribute Tommy Hilfiger handbags outside of the United States. The effective date of the transfer of the rights was December 39 31, 2010. In connection with this transaction, we made a payment of $7.3 million, based on the applicable exchange rate in effect on the payment date, to the former licensee during the second quarter of 2010. Tommy Hilfiger Acquisition We completed our acquisition of Tommy Hilfiger on May 6, 2010. We paid $2.486 billion in cash and issued 7.9 million shares of our common stock, valued at $475.6 million, as consideration for the acquisition, for total consideration of approximately $3.0 billion. In addition, we entered into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to purchase 1.550 billion to hedge against our exposure to changes in the exchange rate for the Euro, as a portion of the cash component of the purchase price was denominated in Euros. We settled the foreign currency forward exchange contracts at a loss of $140.5 million on May 6, 2010 in connection with completing the acquisition. We funded the cash portion and related costs of the Tommy Hilfiger acquisition with cash on hand and the net proceeds of the following activities: (i) the sale of 5.8 million shares of our common stock; (ii) the issuances of an aggregate of 8,000 shares of Series A convertible preferred stock for an aggregate gross purchase price of $200.0 million; (iii) the issuance of $600.0 million of 7 3/8% senior notes due 2020; and (iv) the borrowing of $1.9 billion of term loans under new senior secured credit facilities. Capital Expenditures Our capital expenditures in 2012 were $210.6 million compared to $169.8 million in 2011. This increase was due principally to new stores and retail store expansions in the United States and Canada. We currently expect capital expenditures in 2013 to increase as compared to the prior year primarily due to capital expenditures for Warnaco operations, as well as our investment in combining the infrastructure of the two companies. Calvin Klein Contingent Purchase Price Payments In connection with our acquisition of Calvin Klein, we are obligated to pay Mr. Calvin Klein contingent purchase price payments based on 1.15% of total worldwide net sales (as defined in the agreement governing this acquisition, as amended) of products bearing any of the Calvin Klein brands with respect to sales made through February 12, 2018. A significant portion of the sales on which the payments to Mr. Klein are made are wholesale sales by us and our licensees and other partners to retailers. Such contingent purchase price payments totaled $51.0 million in 2012. We currently expect that such payments will be between $53 million and $55 million in 2013. Common Stock Offering We sold 5.8 million shares of our common stock on April 28, 2010 for net proceeds, after commissions, discounts and related fees and expenses of $364.5 million, which were used to fund a portion of the purchase price for the Tommy Hilfiger acquisition. Series A Convertible Preferred Stock Issuance On May 6, 2010, we sold an aggregate of 8,000 shares of Series A convertible preferred stock, par value $100.00 per share, for an aggregate gross purchase price of $200.0 million. We received net proceeds of $188.6 million in connection with this issuance, which were used to fund a portion of the purchase price for the Tommy Hilfiger acquisition. The Series A convertible preferred stock had a liquidation preference of $25,000 per share and was convertible at a price of $47.74. During 2012, the holders of the Series A convertible preferred stock converted all of the convertible preferred stock into 4.2 million shares of our common stock. Holders of the Series A convertible preferred stock were entitled to vote and participate in dividends with the holders of our common stock on an as-converted basis. Due to the conversion of such stock, there were no holders of our Series A convertible preferred stock as of February 3, 2013. Dividends Our common stock currently pays annual dividends totaling $0.15 per share. Our Series A convertible preferred stock participated in common stock dividends on an as-converted basis prior to its conversion during 2012. Dividends on common and preferred stock totaled $11.0 million during 2012. 40 We currently project that cash dividends on our common stock in 2013 will be approximately $12 million based on our current dividend rate, the number of shares of our common stock outstanding as of February 3, 2013, the number of shares of stock issued in connection with the acquisition of Warnaco, and our estimates of stock to be issued during 2013 under our stock incentive plans. Financing Arrangements Our capital structure was as follows: (dollars in millions) February 3, 2013 January 29, 2012 Short-term borrowings $ 10.8 $ 13.0 Current portion of long-term debt 88.0 70.0 Capital lease obligations 31.1 26.8 Long-term debt 2,211.6 1,832.9 Stockholders equity 3,252.6 2,715.4 In addition, we had $892.2 million and $233.2 million of cash and cash equivalents as of February 3, 2013 and January 29, 2012, respectively. $700.0 million of cash and cash equivalents as of February 3, 2013 arose from senior notes that were issued to fund a portion of the consideration for the acquisition of Warnaco. Short-Term Borrowings One of our subsidiaries has a Yen-denominated overdraft facility with a Japanese bank, which provides for borrowings of 1.000 billion ($10.8 million based on the exchange rates in effect on February 3, 2013) and is utilized to fund working capital. Borrowings under the facility are unsecured and bear interest at the one-month Japanese inter-bank borrowing rate ( TIBOR ) plus 0.15%. Such facility renews automatically unless we give notice of termination. The full amount of this facility was borrowed as of February 3, 2013. The weighted average interest rate on the funds borrowed at February 3, 2013 was 0.33%. The maximum amount of borrowings outstanding under this facility during 2012 was approximately $12.5 million. Capital Lease Obligations Our cash payments for capital lease obligations totaled $10.8 million and $10.4 million in 2012 and 2011, respectively. 4 1/2% Senior Notes Due 2022 On December 20, 2012, we issued $700.0 million principal amount of 4 1/2% senior notes due December 15, 2022. Interest on the 4 1/2% notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning on June 15, 2013. We may redeem some or all of these notes at any time prior to December 15, 2017 by paying a make whole premium plus any accrued and unpaid interest. Subject to certain conditions, we may also redeem up to 35% of these notes prior to December 15, 2015 with the net cash proceeds of certain equity offerings without having to pay a penalty or make whole premium. In addition, we may redeem some or all of these notes on or after December 15, 2017 at specified redemption prices plus any accrued and unpaid interest. 7 3/8% Senior Notes Due 2020 On May 6, 2010, we issued $600.0 million principal amount of 7 3/8% senior notes due May 15, 2020. Interest on the 7 3/8% notes is payable semi-annually in arrears. We may redeem some or all of these notes on or after May 15, 2015 at specified redemption prices plus any accrued and unpaid interest. We may redeem some or all of these notes at any time prior to May 15, 2015 by paying a make whole premium plus any accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, subject to certain conditions, we may also redeem up to 35% of these notes prior to May 15, 2013, by paying a set premium, with the net proceeds of certain equity offerings. 41 During the fourth quarter of 2012, we received the requisite consents from holders of these notes to amend the indenture governing the notes. The amendment increases the amount of secured indebtedness that we are permitted to incur without equally and ratably securing the notes. Under the terms of the consent solicitation, we paid $5.7 million during the fourth quarter to the holders of the notes. 7 3/4% Debentures Due 2023 We have outstanding $100.0 million of debentures due on November 15, 2023 with a yield to maturity of 7.80% . The debentures accrue interest at the rate of 7 3/4%, which is payable semi-annually. Pursuant to the indenture governing the debentures, we must maintain a certain level of stockholders equity in order to pay cash dividends and make other restricted payments, as defined in the indenture governing the debentures. Tender for and Redemption of 2011 Notes and 2013 Notes We commenced tender offers on April 7, 2010 for (i) all of the $150.0 million outstanding principal amount of our notes due 2011; and (ii) all of the $150.0 million outstanding principal amount of our notes due 2013. The tender offers expired on May 4, 2010. On May 6, 2010, we accepted for purchase all of the notes tendered, made payment to tendering holders and called for redemption all of the balance of our outstanding 7 1/4% senior notes due 2011 and all of the balance of our outstanding 8 1/8% senior notes due 2013. The redemption prices of the notes due 2011 and 2013 were 100.000% and 101.354%, respectively, of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the applicable note, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the redemption date. On May 6, 2010, we made an irrevocable payment, including accrued and unpaid interest, to the trustee for the notes due 2011 and 2013. As a result, such indentures were satisfied and effectively discharged as of May 6, 2010. Senior Secured Credit Facilities On May 6, 2010, we entered into a senior secured credit facility, which we amended and restated on March 2, 2011 ( the amended facility ). The amended facility consisted of a Euro-denominated term loan A facility, a United States dollar-denominated term loan A facility, a Euro-denominated term loan B facility, a United States dollar-denominated term loan B facility, a United States dollar-denominated revolving credit facility and two multi-currency (one United States dollar and Canadian dollar, and the other Euro, Japanese Yen and British Pound) revolving credit facilities. We made payments on our term loans of approximately $300 million during 2012. As of February 3, 2013, (a) we had an aggregate of approximately $900 million of term loan borrowings outstanding under our United States dollar-denominated term loan A and B facilities; (b) we had repaid all of our Euro-denominated term loan A and B facilities; and (c) the amended facility provided for approximately $450 million of revolving credit (based on the applicable exchange rates on February 3, 2013), under which we had no revolving credit borrowings and $42.4 million of letters of credit outstanding. The amended facility was terminated on February 13, 2013 and replaced with the senior secured credit facilities entered into in connection with the Warnaco acquisition, as discussed below. We made payments on our term loans of approximately $450 million during 2011, including a voluntary prepayment of approximately $150 million in connection with the closing of the amended facility in the first quarter of 2011. We paid $10.6 million of fees in cash in connection with the modification of our amended facility in the first quarter of 2011. We made additional payments on our term loans of approximately $300 million during 2012. As of February 3, 2013, we were in compliance with all financial and non-financial covenants applicable at that time. Please see the section below entitled Warnaco Acquisition for a discussion of the material debt covenants to which we are subject under the terms of the new senior secured credit facility entered into in connection with the acquisition of Warnaco. As of February 3, 2013 , our corporate credit was rated Ba2 by Moody with a stable outlook and our issuer credit was rated BB+ by Standard & Poor with a stable outlook. Both ratings were reaffirmed upon the acquisition of Warnaco. In assessing our credit strength, we believe that both Moody and Standard & Poor considered, among other things, the impact of the Warnaco acquisition and related financing, our capital structure and financial policies as well as our consolidated balance sheet, our historical acquisition activity and other financial information, as well as industry and other qualitative factors. Warnaco Acquisition We completed our acquisition of Warnaco on February 13, 2013. We paid $2.181 billion in cash and issued approximately 7.7 million shares of our common stock, valued at $927.0 million, as consideration for the acquistion. In 42 addition, we issued replacement stock awards related to employee stock-based compensation grants valued at approximately $40 million, which for accounting purposes are included in the total consideration of approximately $3.148 billion. The value of the replacement stock awards was determined based on the proportionate amount of the vesting period that had lapsed as of the acquisition date. We funded the cash portion and related costs of the acquisition and repaid a portion of our and Warnaco previously outstanding debt with the net proceeds of: (i) an offering of $700.0 million of 4 1/2% senior notes due 2022, as discussed above; and (ii) $3.075 billion of term loans borrowed under new senior secured credit facilities, as discussed below. The new senior secured credit facilities ( the new facilities ), were entered into simultaneously with the closing of the Warnaco acquisition. The new facilities consist of a $1.700 billion United States dollar-denominated Term Loan A, a $1.375 billion United States dollar-denominated Term Loan B and senior secured revolving credit facilities in an aggregate principal amount of $750.0 million (based on the applicable exchange rates on February 13, 2013), consisting of (a) a $475.0 million United States dollar-denominated revolving credit facility, (b) a $25.0 million United States dollar-denominated revolving credit facility available in United States dollars or Canadian dollars and (c) a 185.9 million Euro-denominated revolving credit facility available in Euro, Pounds Sterling, Japanese Yen and Swiss Francs. As discussed above, the full amounts of the term loans were drawn upon the acquisition closing. The revolving credit facilities include amounts available for letters of credit. As of February 13, 2013, we had drawn no revolving credit borrowings and approximately $86.9 million of letters of credit. A portion of each of the United States revolving credit facility and Canadian revolving credit facility is also available for the making of swingline loans. The issuance of such letters of credit and the making of any swingline loan reduces the amount available under the applicable revolving credit facility. So long as certain conditions are satisfied, we may add one or more term loan facilities or increase the commitments under the revolving credit facilities by an aggregate amount not to exceed the greater of (a) $750.0 million and (b) $1.250 billion as long as the ratio of our senior secured net debt to consolidated adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (in each case calculated as set forth in the documentation relating to the new facilities) would not exceed 3.00:1.00 after giving pro forma effect to the incurrence of such increase, plus, in either case, an amount equal to the aggregate revolving commitments of any defaulting lender (to the extent the commitments with respect thereto have been terminated). The lenders under the new facilities are not required to provide commitments with respect to such additional facilities or increased commitments. The terms of each of Term Loan A and Term Loan B contain a mandatory repayment schedule on a quarterly basis, such that the total annual repayments are as follows: Term Loan A B Borrowings on February 13, 2013 $1,700,000,000 $1,375,000,000 Percentage required to be repaid for the annual period ending March 31: 2014 5 % 1 % 2015 5 % 1 % 2016 7.5 % 1 % 2017 10 % 1 % 2018 72.5 % 1 % 2019 1 % 2020 94 % The outstanding borrowings under the new facilities are prepayable at any time without penalty (other than customary breakage costs). The terms of the new facilities require us to repay certain amounts outstanding thereunder with (a) net cash proceeds of the incurrence of certain indebtedness, (b) net cash proceeds of certain asset sales or other dispositions (including as a result of casualty or condemnation) that exceed certain thresholds, to the extent such proceeds are not reinvested or committed to be reinvested in the business in accordance with customary reinvestment provisions and (c) a percentage of excess cash flow, which percentage is based upon our net leverage ratio during the relevant fiscal period. The United States dollar-denominated borrowings under the new facilities bear interest at a rate equal to an applicable margin plus, as determined at our option, either (a) a base rate determined by reference to the greater of (i) the prime rate, (ii) the United States federal funds rate plus 1/2 of 1.00% and (iii) a one-month adjusted Eurocurrency rate plus 1.00% (provided 43 that, in the case of Term Loan B, in no event will the base rate be deemed to be less than 1.75%) or (b) an adjusted Eurocurrency rate, calculated in a manner set forth in the new facilities (provided that, in the case of Term Loan B, in no event will the adjusted Eurocurrency rate be deemed to be less than 0.75%). Canadian dollar-denominated borrowings under the new revolving credit facility bear interest at a rate equal to an applicable margin plus, as determined at our option, either (a) a Canadian prime rate determined by reference to the greater of (i) the rate of interest per annum that Royal Bank of Canada establishes at its main office in Toronto, Ontario as the reference rate of interest in order to determine interest rates for loans in Canadian Dollars to its Canadian borrowers and (ii) the sum of (x) the average of the rates per annum for Canadian Dollar bankers acceptances having a term of one month that appears on the display referred to as CDOR Page of Reuters Monitor Money Rate Services as of 10:00 a.m. (Toronto time) on the date of determination, as reported by the administrative agent (and if such screen is not available, any successor or similar service as may be selected by the administrative agent), and (y) 0.75%, or (b) an adjusted Eurocurrency rate, calculated in a manner set forth in the new facility. The borrowings under the new revolving credit facility in currencies other than United States dollars or Canadian dollars bear interest at a rate equal to an applicable margin plus an adjusted Eurocurrency rate, calculated in a manner set forth in the new facility. The initial applicable margins will be in the case of Term Loan A and the revolving credit facilities, 2.00% for adjusted Eurocurrency rate loans and 1.00% for base rate loans, as applicable. The applicable margins in the case of Term Loan B are fixed at 2.50% for adjusted Eurocurrency rate loans and 1.50% for base rate loans, respectively. After the date of delivery of the compliance certificate and financial statements with respect to our fiscal quarter ending May 5, 2013, the applicable margin for borrowings under Term Loan A and the revolving credit facilities will be adjusted based on our quarter end net leverage ratio. The new facilities contain covenants that restrict our ability to finance future operations or capital needs, to take advantage of other business opportunities that may be in our interest or to satisfy our obligations under our other outstanding debt. These covenants restrict our ability to, among other things: incur or guarantee additional debt or extend credit; make restricted payments, including paying dividends or making distributions on, or redeeming or repurchasing, our capital stock or certain debt; make acquisitions and investments; dispose of assets; engage in transactions with affiliates; enter into agreements restricting our subsidiaries ability to pay dividends; create liens on our assets or engage in sale/leaseback transactions; and effect a consolidation or merger, or sell, transfer, or lease all or substantially all of our assets. The new facilities require us to comply with certain financial covenants, including minimum interest coverage and maximum net leverage, beginning with our fiscal quarter ending August 4, 2013. A breach of any of these operating or financial covenants would result in a default under the applicable facility. If an event of default occurs and is continuing, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts then outstanding, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable which would result in acceleration of our other debt. If we were unable to repay any such borrowings when due, the lenders could proceed against their collateral, which also secures some of our other indebtedness. We are also subject to similar covenants and restrictions in connection with our other long-term debt agreements. 44 Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes, as of February 3, 2013 , our contractual cash obligations by future period: Payments Due by Period (1) Description Total Obligations 2013 2014-2015 2016-2017 Thereafter (dollars in millions) Long-term debt (2) $ 2,300.0 $ 88.0 $ 472.0 $ 340.0 $ 1,400.0 Interest payments on long-term debt 810.6 114.0 210.1 171.9 314.6 Short-term borrowings 10.8 10.8 Operating and capital leases (3) 1,836.3 318.0 518.9 400.5 598.9 Inventory purchase commitments (4) 799.5 799.5 Minimum contractual royalty payments (5) 78.2 17.4 25.4 18.2 17.2 Non-qualified supplemental defined benefit plans (6) 18.9 2.0 3.9 3.2 9.8 Sponsorship payments (7) 20.4 10.7 6.8 2.9 Other contractual obligations (8) 14.4 14.4 Total contractual cash obligations $ 5,889.1 $ 1,374.8 $ 1,237.1 $ 936.7 $ 2,340.5 ______________________ (1) Our contractual obligations have materially changed subsequent to the end of 2012 as a result of the Warnaco acquisition. Please refer to the discussion above in this Liquidity and Capital Resources section for a description of new debt obligations that were incurred in connection with the financing of the acquisition. (2) At February 3, 2013 , we had outstanding $560.0 million under a senior secured term loan A facility and $340.0 million under a senior secured term loan B facility, which require mandatory payments through May 6, 2016 (according to the mandatory repayment schedules and prior to the termination and replacement of these facilities, as discussed above), $600.0 million of 7 3/8% senior unsecured notes due May 15, 2020, $700.0 million of 4 1/2% senior unsecured notes due December 15, 2022 and $100.0 million of 7 3/4% debentures due November 15, 2023. Interest on the senior secured term loans was payable quarterly and interest on the senior unsecured notes and debentures is payable semi-annually. (3) Includes retail store, warehouse, showroom, office and equipment operating leases, as well as capital leases. Retail store operating leases generally provide for payment of direct operating costs in addition to rent. The obligation amounts listed include future minimum lease payments and exclude such direct operating costs. Please refer to Note 14, Leases, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for further information. (4) Represents contractual commitments for goods on order and not received or paid for as of February 3, 2013 . Substantially all of these goods are expected to be received and the related payments are expected to be made within six months of our year end. This amount does not include foreign currency exchange forward contracts that we have entered into to manage our exposure to exchange rate changes with respect to certain of these purchases. Please refer to Note 8, Derivative Financial Instruments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for further information. (5) Our minimum contractual royalty payments arise under numerous license agreements we have with third parties, each of which has different royalty rates and terms. Agreements typically require us to make minimum payments to the licensors of the licensed trademarks based on expected or required minimum levels of sales of licensed products, as well as additional royalty payments when our sales exceed such minimum sales. Certain of our license agreements require that we pay a specified percentage of net sales to the licensor for advertising and promotion of the licensed products, with no minimum amount required to be paid. These amounts, as well as any advertising spending requirements, are excluded from the minimum contractual royalty payments shown in the table. There is no guarantee that we will exceed the minimum payments under any of these license agreements. However, given our projected sales levels for products covered under these agreements, we currently anticipate that future payments required under our license agreements on an aggregate basis will exceed the contractual minimums shown in the table. (6) We have an unfunded non-qualified supplemental defined benefit plan covering two current and 16 retired executives under which the participants will receive a predetermined amount during the 10 years following the attainment of age 45 65, provided that prior to the termination of employment with us, the participant has been in such plan for at least 10 years and has attained age 55. (7) Represents payment obligations for sponsorships. We have agreements relating to our sponsorship of the Barclay Center, the 2014 Super Bowl Host Committee and certain professional sports teams and athletes and other similar sponsorships. (8) Represents amounts payable in connection with Tommy Hilfiger acquisition of a licensee business in Japan prior to our acquisition of Tommy Hilfiger, which obligations we assumed as of the effective date of our acquisition of Tommy Hilfiger. Not included in the above table are contingent purchase price payments we are obligated to pay Mr. Calvin Klein based on 1.15% of total worldwide net sales, as defined in the agreement governing the Calvin Klein acquisition, of products bearing any of the Calvin Klein brands and are required to be made with respect to sales made through February 12, 2018. A significant portion of the sales on which the payments to Mr. Klein are made are wholesale sales by us and our licensees and other partners to retailers. Such contingent purchase price payments totaled $51.0 million in 2012. Not included in the above table are contingent purchase price payments we are obligated to pay GVM based on a percentage of annual sales in excess of an agreed upon threshold of Tommy Hilfiger products in India for a period of five years (or, under certain circumstances, a period of six years) following the acquisition date of September 7, 2011. Such payments are subject to a $25.0 million aggregate maximum and are due within 60 days following each one-year period commencing on July 1, 2011. During the third quarter of 2012, we made a contingent purchase price payment of $0.2 million for the first one-year period. Not included in the above table are contributions to our defined benefit qualified pension plans, or payments to employees and retirees in connection with our supplemental executive retirement, supplemental pension and postretirement health plans. Contractual cash obligations for these plans cannot be determined due to the number of assumptions required to estimate our future benefit obligations, including return on assets, discount rate and future compensation increases. The liabilities associated with these plans are presented in Note 10, Retirement and Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report. We currently estimate that we will make contributions of approximately $30 million to our pension plans in 2013. Our estimated pension contributions do not include anticipated contributions for the Warnaco plans that we acquired on February 13, 2013. We will update this figure in future filings to reflect these anticipated contributions. Our actual contributions may differ from our planned contributions due to many factors, including changes in tax and other benefit laws, or significant differences between expected and actual pension asset performance or interest rates. Not included in the above table are $189.1 million of net potential cash obligations associated with unrecognized tax benefits due to the uncertainty regarding the future cash outflows associated with such obligations. Please refer to Note 7, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for further information related to unrecognized tax benefits. Not included in the above table are $12.5 million of asset retirement obligations related to leased office and retail store locations due to the uncertainty of timing of future cash outflows associated with such obligations. Please refer to Note 20, Other Comments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for further information related to asset retirement obligations. Not included in the above table are obligations related to our non-exclusive buying agency agreement with Li & Fung due to uncertainty of the timing and amounts of future cash flows associated with such obligations. Under the terms of the agreement, we are required to use Li & Fung for at least 54% of our global sourcing needs for Tommy Hilfiger products. The buying agency agreement with Li & Fung is terminable by us upon 12 months prior notice for any reason, and is terminable by either party (i) upon six months prior notice in the event of a material breach by the other party and (ii) immediately upon the occurrence of certain bankruptcy or insolvency events relating to the other party. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have a material current effect, or that are reasonably likely to have a material future effect, on our financial position, changes in financial position, revenue, expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. 46 MARKET RISK INTEREST AND EXCHANGE RATE SENSITIVITY Financial instruments held by us as of February 3, 2013 include cash equivalents, short and long-term debt, foreign currency forward exchange contracts and an interest rate swap agreement. Note 9, Fair Value Measurements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report outlines the fair value of our financial instruments as of February 3, 2013 . Cash and cash equivalents held by us are affected by short-term interest rates. Due to the currently low rates of return we are receiving on our cash equivalents, the potential for a significant decrease in short-term interest rates is low and, therefore, a further decrease would not have a material impact on our interest income. However, there is potential for a more significant increase in short-term interest rates, which could have a more material impact on our interest income. Given our balance of cash and cash equivalents at February 3, 2013 , the effect of a 10 basis point increase in short-term interest rates on our interest income would be approximately $0.9 million annually. We entered into new senior secured credit facilities on February 13, 2013, and simultaneously terminated our previously outstanding amended facility. Please refer to Note 21, Subsequent Events (Unaudited), in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for a further discussion of our new credit facility. Borrowings under our new senior secured credit facilities bear interest at a rate equal to an applicable margin plus a variable rate. As such, our credit facilities expose us to market risk for changes in interest rates. As of February 13, 2013, approximately 45% of our total debt was at a fixed rate, with the remainder at variable rates. Given our debt position at February 13, 2013, the effect of a 10 basis point increase in interest rates on our interest expense would be approximately $1.2 million annually. Our Tommy Hilfiger business and the businesses acquired from Warnaco each have a substantial international component, which exposes us to significant foreign exchange risk. Accordingly, the impact of a strengthening United States dollar, particularly against the Euro, the Brazilian Real, the Japanese Yen, the Korean Won, the British Pound, the Canadian dollar, the Mexican Peso, the Indian Rupee and the Chinese Yuan, will have a negative impact on our results of operations. Our Tommy Hilfiger business and the businesses acquired from Warnaco purchase the majority of the products that they sell in United States dollars, which exposes these international businesses to foreign exchange risk as the United States dollar fluctuates. As such, we currently use and plan to continue to use foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative instruments to mitigate the cash flow or market value risks associated with such United States dollar-denominated purchases. We are also exposed to market risk for changes in exchange rates for the United States dollar in connection with our licensing businesses, particularly our Calvin Klein business. As a substantial portion of our Calvin Klein licensing revenue was generated from Warnaco, this exposure has been substantially reduced. Most of our license agreements require the licensee to report sales to us in the licensee local currency but to pay us in United States dollars based on the exchange rate as of the last day of the contractual selling period. Thus, while we are not exposed to exchange rate gains and losses between the end of the selling period and the date we collect payment, we are exposed to exchange rate changes during and up to the last day of the selling period. In addition, certain of our other foreign license agreements expose us to exchange rate changes up to the date we collect payment or convert local currency payments into United States dollars. As a result, during times of a strengthening United States dollar, our foreign royalty revenue will be adversely impacted, and during times of a weakening United States dollar, our foreign royalty revenue will be favorably impacted. In addition, we have exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates on certain intercompany loans. We currently use and plan to continue to use foreign currency forward exchange contracts to mitigate this exposure. SEASONALITY Our business generally follows a seasonal pattern. Our wholesale businesses tend to generate higher levels of sales in the first and third quarters, while our retail businesses tend to generate higher levels of sales in the fourth quarter. Royalty, advertising and other revenue tends to be earned somewhat evenly throughout the year, although the third quarter has the highest level of royalty revenue due to higher sales by licensees in advance of the holiday selling season. We expect this seasonal pattern will generally continue. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS The Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued in May 2011 guidance to clarify and revise the requirements for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements. We adopted this guidance prospectively beginning in 2012 and such adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. 47 The FASB issued in September 2011 guidance that is intended to reduce the cost and complexity of the goodwill impairment test by providing an entity with the option to first assess qualitatively whether it is necessary to perform the two-step impairment test that is currently in place. An entity would not be required to quantitatively calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount. The guidance became effective for us in the first quarter of 2012. We adopted this guidance and performed such tests during the third quarter of 2012. The adoption did not have any impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The FASB issued in July 2012 guidance that is intended to reduce the cost and complexity of the impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets by providing an entity with the option to first assess qualitatively whether it is necessary to perform the impairment test that is currently in place. An entity would not be required to quantitatively calculate the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset unless the entity determines that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount. We early adopted this guidance and performed such tests during the third quarter of 2012. The adoption did not have any impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. The FASB issued in February 2013 guidance that requires an entity to provide information about significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income. For amounts that are required to be reclassified in their entirety to net income in the same reporting period, an entity must report the amounts by component and their corresponding effect on the respective line items of net income. Such information is required to be presented either on the face of the financial statements or as a separate disclosure in the footnotes to the financial statements. For other amounts that are not required to be reclassified to net income in their entirety, an entity is required to cross-reference to other disclosures. This guidance becomes effective for us in the first quarter of 2013. The adoption will not have any impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Our consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of significant accounting policies, which require management to make significant estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are outlined in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report. We believe that the following are the more critical judgmental areas in the application of our accounting policies that currently affect our financial position and results of operations: Sales allowances and returns We have arrangements with many of our department and specialty store customers to support their sales of our products. We establish accruals which, based on a review of the individual customer arrangements and the expected performance of our products in their stores, we believe will be required to satisfy our sales allowance obligations. We also establish accruals, which are based on historical data and authorized amounts, that we believe are necessary to provide for inventory returns. It is possible that the accrual estimates could vary from actual results, which would require adjustment to the allowance and returns accruals. Inventories Inventories are comprised principally of finished goods and are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost for certain wholesale apparel inventories in North America is determined using the first-in, first-out method. Cost for all other inventories is determined using the weighted average cost method. We review current business trends, inventory agings and discontinued merchandise categories to determine adjustments which are estimated to be necessary to liquidate existing clearance inventories and reduce inventories to the lower of cost or market. We believe that all inventory writedowns required at February 3, 2013 have been recorded. If market conditions were to change, it is possible that the required level of inventory reserves would need to be adjusted. Asset impairments During 2012, 2011 and 2010, we determined that the long-lived assets in certain of our retail stores and other locations were not recoverable, which resulted in us recording impairment charges. In order to calculate the impairment charges, we estimated the undiscounted future cash flows and the related fair value of each asset. The undiscounted future cash flows for each asset were estimated using current sales trends and other factors. If different assumptions had been used for future sales trends, the recorded impairment charges could have been significantly higher or lower. Note 9, Fair Value Measurements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report includes a further discussion of the circumstances surrounding the impairments and the assumptions related to the impairment charges. Allowance for doubtful accounts Accounts receivable, as presented on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, is net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. An allowance for doubtful accounts is determined through an analysis of the aging of accounts receivable and assessments of collectibility based on historic trends, the financial condition of our customers and an evaluation of economic conditions. Because we cannot predict future changes in economic conditions and in the financial stability of our 48 customers, actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates and could impact our allowance for doubtful accounts. Income taxes Deferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases and are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered. FASB guidance on accounting for income taxes requires that deferred tax assets be evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe a portion will not be realized. We consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets, including our recent earnings experience and expectations of future taxable income by taxing jurisdiction, the carryforward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes and other relevant factors. The actual realization of deferred tax assets may differ significantly from the amounts we have recorded. During the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Accounting for income taxes requires a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the tax position will be fully sustained upon review by taxing authorities, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. For tax positions that are 50 percent or less likely of being sustained upon audit, we do not recognize any portion of that benefit in the financial statements. We consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes. Our actual results could differ materially from our current estimates. Goodwill and other intangible assets Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually, at the beginning of the third quarter of each fiscal year, and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired. Impairment testing for goodwill is done at a reporting unit level. A reporting unit is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment, called a component. However, two or more components of an operating segment will be aggregated and deemed a single reporting unit if the components have similar economic characteristics. In 2012, we adopted new authoritative accounting guidance that allows us to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a more detailed quantitative impairment test for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. We would perform the quantitative test if our qualitative assessment determined it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. We may elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to the quantitative test for any reporting unit or asset. Qualitative factors that we consider as part of our assessment include a comparison of the most recent valuation to reporting unit carrying amounts, an increase in our market capitalization and its implied impact on reporting unit fair value, industry and market conditions, macroeconomic conditions, trends in product costs and financial performance of our businesses. If we perform the quantitative test for any reporting units, we use a discounted cash flow method to calculate fair value. The discounted cash flow method is based on the present value of projected cash flows. Assumptions used in these cash flow projections are generally consistent with our internal forecasts. The estimated cash flows are discounted using a rate that represents the weighted average cost of capital. The weighted average cost of capital is based on a number of variables, including the equity-risk premium and risk-free interest rate. Management believes the assumptions used for the impairment tests are consistent with those that would be utilized by a market participant performing similar analyses and valuations. Any projected cash flows and estimates of weighted average cost of capital may be impacted by adverse changes in market and economic conditions and are subject to change based on the facts and circumstances that exist at the time of the valuation. No impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets resulted from our impairment tests in 2012. If different assumptions for our goodwill and other intangible asset impairment tests had been applied, significantly different outcomes could have resulted. Based upon the results of our annual goodwill impairment testing during 2012 and our future cash flow projections, we currently do not believe that any of our reporting units are at significant risk for a future material goodwill impairment. Pension benefits Included in the calculations of expense and liabilities for our pension plans are various assumptions, including return on assets, discount rate and future compensation increases. Note 10, Retirement and Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report sets forth the significant rate assumptions used in performing certain calculations related to our pension plans. Actual results could differ from these assumptions, which would require adjustments to our balance sheet and could result in volatility in our future pension expense. Holding all other assumptions constant, a 1% increase or decrease in the assumed rate of return on assets would decrease or increase, respectively, 2013 net benefit cost by approximately $4 million. Likewise, a 0.25% increase or decrease in the 49 assumed discount rate would decrease or increase, respectively, 2013 net periodic pension expense by approximately $19 million. During the fourth quarter of 2012, we changed our method of accounting for actuarial gains and losses for our pension and other postretirement plans. Historically, we recognized actuarial gains and losses related to our pension and other postretirement obligations and pension plan assets as a component of other comprehensive income in the periods in which they arose. As set forth in FASB guidance for pension and other postretirement plans, we amortized actuarial gains and losses (to the extent they exceeded a 10% corridor) in future periods over the average remaining service period of active employees or, if substantially all plan participants were inactive, over the average remaining life expectancy of inactive participants, as a component of our net periodic benefit cost. We elected in the fourth quarter of 2012 to begin to immediately recognize actuarial gains and losses in our operating results in the year in which they occur. These gains and losses are measured at least annually as of the end of our fiscal year and, as such, will generally be recognized during the fourth quarter of each year. Additionally, we will no longer calculate expected return on plan assets using a permitted averaging technique for market-related value of plan assets but instead will use the fair value of plan assets. We believe the accounting policy changes improve the transparency of our operational performance by recognizing in current period earnings the financial statement effects of changes in assumptions on our pension and other postretirement obligations and changes in fair value of pension plan assets. The financial data for all prior periods presented has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the effect of these accounting changes. Please refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for a presentation of our operating results before and after the application of this accounting change. Stock-based compensation Accounting for stock-based compensation requires measurement of compensation cost for all stock-based awards at fair value on the date of grant and recognition of compensation over the service period for awards expected to vest. We use the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model to determine the fair value of our stock options. This model uses assumptions that include the risk-free interest rate, expected volatility, expected dividend yield and expected life of the options. The fair value of restricted stock units and restricted stock are determined based on the quoted price of our common stock on the date of grant. The fair value of contingently issuable performance shares is based on the quoted price of our common stock on the date of grant, reduced for the present value of any dividends expected to be paid on our common stock during the performance cycle, as the contingently issuable performance shares do not accrue dividends prior to being earned. We record expense for contingently issuable performance shares based on our current expectations of the probable number of shares that will ultimately be issued. The value of our stock-based awards is recognized as expense over the service period, net of estimated forfeitures. The estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment, and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates, such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised. We consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures, including types of awards, employee class and historical experience. Actual results and future estimates may differ substantially from our current estimates.
