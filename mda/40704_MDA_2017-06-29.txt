ITEM 7 Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW We are a global consumer foods company. We develop distinctive value-added food products and market them under unique brand names. We work continuously to improve our core products and to create new products that meet consumers evolving needs and preferences. In addition, we build the equity of our brands over time with strong consumer-directed marketing, innovative new products, and effective merchandising. We believe our brand-building strategy is the key to winning and sustaining leading share positions in markets around the globe. Our fundamental financial goal is to generate superior returns for our shareholders over the long term. We believe that increases in net sales, segment operating profit, earnings per share (EPS), free cash flow, cash return to shareholders, and return on average total capital are key drivers of financial performance for our business. Our long-term growth objectives are to consistently deliver: low single-digit annual growth in organic net sales; mid single-digit annual growth in total segment operating profit on a constant-currency basis; high single-digit annual growth in diluted EPS excluding certain items affecting comparability on a constant-currency basis; improvement in adjusted return on average total capital; free cash flow conversion averaging above 95 percent of adjusted net earnings after tax; and cash return to shareholders averaging above 90 percent of free cash flow, including an attractive dividend yield. We believe that this financial performance should result in long-term value creation for shareholders. Fiscal 2017 was a year of significant change for General Mills. We implemented a new global organizational structure to enhance our agility in a rapidly changing consumer environment. We expanded our global supply chain restructuring initiative to further increase our efficiency. We also implemented a business plan that aggressively shifted resources to our best growth opportunities and eliminated low-return investments and volume. While these actions were the right thing to do for our company, we did not execute up to our standards in certain areas and our results did not meet our expectations. Consolidated net sales and total segment operating profit growth fell short of our plans, largely because of competitive price gaps in our North American Retail segment. We underestimated the impact that our aggressive reductions in promotional spending, implemented early in the fiscal year, would have on our net pricing relative to competitors. The gaps were most pronounced in the U.S. Meals & Baking operating unit, and competitive activity also significantly impacted U.S. Yogurt. We took corrective actions to improve our performance in the second half of fiscal 2017, but it was not sufficient to stem the early declines. Yogurt in the Europe & Australia segment also did not meet expectations as competitive pressure from smaller branded players increased significantly. Excluding yogurt, the segment net sales and share increased driven by ice cream and snack bars innovation and improved merchandising performance. In the Convenience Stores & Foodservice segment, segment operating profit grew driven by lower input costs and benefits from cost savings initiatives. Net sales for the Focus 6 platforms grew modestly, but were more than offset by market index pricing on flour. In the Asia & Latin America segment, macroeconomic weakness in Latin America and the Middle East created a challenging environment while greater China returned to net sales growth, including contributions from the new Yoplait business. We continued to realize planned benefits from our numerous restructuring initiatives and cost reduction efforts in our supply chain and administrative areas which helped us to increase our adjusted operating profit margin and adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS) in fiscal 2017. Our consolidated net sales for fiscal 2017 declined 6 percent to $15.6 billion, primarily driven by declining contributions from volume, including the impact of the divestiture of the North American Green Giant product lines (Green Giant). On an organic basis, net sales decreased 4 percent. Operating profit of $2.6 billion decreased 5 percent. Total segment operating profit of $3.0 billion declined 2 percent and declined 1 percent on a constant-currency basis. Diluted EPS of $2.77 was flat compared to fiscal 2016. Adjusted diluted EPS, which excludes certain items affecting comparability of results, rose 5 percent to $3.08 per share and increased 6 percent on a constant-currency basis. Our return on average total capital was 12.7 percent, and adjusted return on average total capital increased 30 basis points to 11.6 percent and increased 40 basis points on a constant-currency basis (See the Non-GAAP Measures section below for discussion of total segment operating profit, adjusted diluted EPS, organic net sales growth rate, constant-currency total segment operating profit growth rate, constant-currency adjusted diluted EPS growth rate, and adjusted return on average total capital, which are not defined by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)). Net cash provided by operations totaled $2.3 billion in fiscal 2017 at a conversion rate of 136 percent of net earnings, including earnings attributable to redeemable and noncontrolling interests. This cash generation supported capital investments totaling $684 million, and our resulting free cash flow was $1.6 billion at a conversion rate of 86 percent of adjusted net earnings, including earnings attributable to redeemable and noncontrolling interests. We also returned significant cash to shareholders through a 6 percent dividend increase and share repurchases totaling $1,652 million. Total cash returned to shareholders represented 164 percent of our free cash flow (see the Non-GAAP Measures section below for a description of our use of measures not defined by GAAP). 15 Table of Contents A detailed review of our fiscal 2017 performance appears below in the section titled Fiscal 2017 Consolidated Results of Operations. We remain committed to our Consumer First strategy and our focus on driving growth and returns for our shareholders. Our top priority in fiscal 2018 is to make significant strides toward returning our business to sustainable topline growth. Our fiscal 2018 plans call for investment in product news and innovation to accelerate growth for businesses where we have positive momentum, and to improve those that are underperforming. We will also increase investment in capabilities like e-commerce and Strategic Revenue Management, which are critical to future growth. We will continue to prioritize resources against our Growth platforms, where we see the strongest profitable growth potential. And we will make selective investments in our Foundation brands while focusing on profitability and cash generation. We plan to continue to drive efficiency in fiscal 2018, including delivering approximately $390 million in supply chain productivity savings through our ongoing Holistic Margin Management (HMM) efforts. We also expect to deliver approximately $160 million in incremental savings from our other restructuring and cost-reduction initiatives, which equates to approximately $700 million in savings versus fiscal 2015 levels. These savings should more than offset our estimate of 3 percent input cost inflation. This cost management discipline has helped us significantly expand our adjusted operating profit margin over the past two years. We continue to see opportunities for further margin expansion, including an increase in adjusted operating profit margin in fiscal 2018, but we will moderate the pace of expansion as we invest to restore topline growth. Looking forward, we are focused on delivering a balance of sales growth and margin expansion, along with strong cash conversion and cash returns, to create top-tier returns for our shareholders. With these assumptions in mind: We expect fiscal 2018 organic net sales to decline between 1 and 2 percent from fiscal 2017 levels. We expect fiscal 2018 total segment operating profit will be in a range between flat and up 1 percent on a constant-currency basis. We expect fiscal 2018 adjusted diluted EPS to increase 1 to 2 percent in constant currency from the base of $3.08 earned in fiscal 2017. Our plans call for continued strong cash returns to shareholders. The current annualized dividend rate of $1.96 per share is up 2 percent from the annual dividend paid in fiscal 2017. Share repurchases in fiscal 2018 are expected to result in a net reduction in average diluted shares outstanding of approximately 1 to 2 percent. See the Non-GAAP Measures section below for a description of our use of measures not defined by GAAP. Certain terms used throughout this report are defined in a glossary in Item 8 of this report. FISCAL 2017 CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Fiscal 2017 includes an additional month of results from General Mills Brasil Alimentos Ltda (Yoki) (please refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report). In fiscal 2017, operating results reflected challenging net sales performance. However, we continued to make progress against our cost savings and margin expansion initiatives. The net sales decline of 6 percent was driven by declining contributions from volume in the North America Retail and Europe & Australia segments including the impact of the divestiture of Green Giant in fiscal 2016, which were partially offset by favorable net price realization and mix. Operating profit margin of 16.4 percent was up 10 basis points from year-ago levels primarily driven by benefits from cost savings and spending optimization initiatives, and favorable net price realization, partially offset by the gain from the Green Giant divestiture. Adjusted operating profit margin increased 130 basis points to 18.1 percent, driven by benefits from cost savings and spending optimization initiatives and favorable net price realization. Diluted earnings per share of $2.77 was flat to fiscal 2016 and adjusted diluted EPS, which excludes certain items affecting comparability, on a constant-currency basis increased 6 percent compared to fiscal 2016 (see the Non-GAAP Measures section below for a description of our use of measures not defined by GAAP). 16 Table of Contents A summary of our consolidated financial results for fiscal 2017 follows: Fiscal 2017 In millions, except per share Fiscal 2017 vs. Fiscal 2016 Percent of Net Sales Constant- Currency Growth (a) Net sales $ 15,619.8 (6 )% Operating profit 2,566.4 (5 )% 16.4 % Net earnings attributable to General Mills 1,657.5 (2 )% Diluted EPS $ 2.77 Flat Organic net sales growth rate (a) (4 )% Total segment operating profit (a) 2,952.6 (2 )% (1 )% Adjusted operating profit margin (a) 18.1 % Diluted EPS, excluding certain items affecting comparability (a) $ 3.08 5 % 6 % (a) See the Non-GAAP Measures section below for our use of measures not defined by GAAP. Consolidated net sales were as follows: Fiscal 2017 Fiscal 2017 vs. Fiscal 2016 Fiscal 2016 Net sales (in millions) $ 15,619.8 (6) % $ 16,563.1 Contributions from volume growth (a) (8) pts Net price realization and mix 3 pts Foreign currency exchange (1) pt (a) Measured in tons based on the stated weight of our product shipments. The 6 percent decline in net sales primarily reflected lower organic net sales, unfavorable foreign currency exchange, and the Green Giant divestiture in fiscal 2016 (please refer to Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report). Organic net sales declined 4 percent driven by volume declines in the North America Retail and Europe & Australia segments which were partially offset by positive net price realization and mix. To improve comparability of results from period to period, organic net sales exclude the impacts of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, as well as acquisitions, divestitures, and a 53rd week of results, when applicable. Components of organic net sales growth are shown in the following table: Fiscal 2017 vs. Fiscal 2016 Contributions from organic volume growth (a) (7) pts Organic net price realization and mix 3 pts Organic net sales growth (4) pts Foreign currency exchange (1) pt Acquisitions and divestitures (b) (1) pt Net sales growth (6) pts (a) Measured in tons based on the stated weight of our product shipments. (b) Primarily the Green Giant divestiture in fiscal 2016 (please refer to Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report). Cost of sales decreased $678 million in fiscal 2017 to $10,056 million. The decrease included an $814 million decrease attributable to lower volume and a $137 million increase attributable to product rate and mix. We recorded a $14 million net decrease in cost of sales related to mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions and grain inventories as described in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report, compared to a net decrease of $63 million in fiscal 2016. In fiscal 2017, we recorded $42 million of restructuring charges in cost of sales compared to $78 million in fiscal 2016. We also recorded $44 million of restructuring initiative project-related costs in cost of sales in fiscal 2017 compared to $58 million in fiscal 2016 (please refer to Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report). Gross margin declined 5 percent in fiscal 2017 versus fiscal 2016. Gross margin as a percent of net sales of 36 percent increased 40 basis points compared to fiscal 2016. 17 Table of Contents Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses decreased $318 million to $2,801 million in fiscal 2017 versus fiscal 2016 primarily due to a 17 percentage point decrease in media and advertising expense and cost savings initiatives. SG&A expenses as a percent of net sales decreased 90 basis points compared to fiscal 2016. During fiscal 2017, we recorded a $14 million divestiture loss from the sale of our Martel, Ohio manufacturing facility. Divestiture net gain totaled $148 million in fiscal 2016 primarily from the sale of Green Giant (please refer to Note 3 of the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report). Restructuring, impairment, and other exit costs totaled $183 million in fiscal 2017, compared to $151 million in fiscal 2016, and $284 million in fiscal 2015. Total charges associated with our restructuring initiatives recognized in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 consisted of the following: As Reported Estimated In Millions Fiscal 2017 Fiscal 2016 Fiscal 2015 Future Total Savings (b) Charge Cash Charge Cash Charge Cash Charge Cash Charge Cash Global reorganization $ 72.1 $ 20.0 $ $ $ $ $ 3 $ 55 $ 75 $ 75 Closure of Melbourne, Australia plant 21.9 1.6 12 1 34 3 Restructuring of certain international product lines 45.1 10.3 (3 ) (10 ) 42 Closure of Vineland, New Jersey plant 41.4 7.3 17 12 58 19 Project Compass (0.4 ) 12.8 54.7 36.1 5 54 54 Project Century 44.0 49.4 182.6 34.1 181.8 12.0 6 48 414 143 Project Catalyst 1.3 (7.5 ) 47.8 148.4 45.0 141 94 Combination of certain operational facilities 5.1 4.5 13.9 6.5 1 (2 ) 15 14 Other 0.1 (0.6 ) 0.1 Total restructuring charges (a) 224.1 107.8 229.8 122.6 343.5 63.6 36 109 833 402 Project-related costs classified in cost of sales 43.9 46.9 57.5 54.5 13.2 9.7 15 19 130 130 Restructuring charges and project-related costs $ 268.0 $ 154.7 $ 287.3 $ 177.1 $ 356.7 $ 73.3 $ 51 $ 128 $ 963 $ 532 Future cumulative annual savings $ 700 (a) Includes restructuring charges recorded in cost of sales of $41.5 million in fiscal 2017, $78.4 million in fiscal 2016 and $59.6 million in fiscal 2015. (b) Cumulative annual savings estimated by fiscal 2018. Includes savings from SG&A cost reduction projects. Please refer to Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for more information regarding our restructuring activities. Interest, net for fiscal 2017 totaled $295 million, $9 million lower than fiscal 2016, primarily driven by lower rates and changes in the mix of debt, partially offset by higher average debt balances. Our consolidated effective tax rate for fiscal 2017 was 28.8 percent compared to 31.4 percent in fiscal 2016. The 2.6 percentage point decrease was primarily due to non-deductible expenses related to the Green Giant divestiture in fiscal 2016. Our effective tax rate excluding certain items affecting comparability was 29.2 percent in fiscal 2017 compared to 29.8 percent in fiscal 2016 (see the Non-GAAP Measures section below for a description of our use of measures not defined by GAAP). 18 Table of Contents After-tax earnings from joint ventures for fiscal 2017 decreased to $85 million compared to $88 million in fiscal 2016 primarily driven by unfavorable foreign currency exchange and an asset write-off for Cereal Partners Worldwide (CPW), partially offset by contributions from volume growth and favorable foreign currency exchange for H agen-Dazs Japan, Inc. (HDJ). On a constant-currency basis, after-tax earnings from joint ventures decreased 6 percent (see the Non-GAAP Measures section below for a description of our use of this measure not defined by GAAP).

FISCAL 2016 CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Fiscal 2016 had 52 weeks compared to 53 weeks in fiscal 2015. Fiscal 2016 includes an additional month of results from Annie and Yoplait SAS (please refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report). Fiscal 2016 net sales declined 6 percent to $16,563 million and were flat to fiscal 2015 on an organic basis. Operating profit of $2,707 million was 30 percent higher than fiscal 2015. Total segment operating profit was $3,000 million, 1 percent lower than fiscal 2015 and 1 percent higher on a constant-currency basis. In fiscal 2016, net earnings attributable to General Mills were $1,697 million, up 39 percent from $1,221 million in fiscal 2015, and we reported diluted EPS of $2.77 in fiscal 2016, up 41 percent from $1.97 in fiscal 2015. Adjusted diluted EPS which excludes certain items affecting comparability totaled $2.92 in fiscal 2016, up 2 percent from $2.86 in fiscal 2015. Diluted EPS excluding certain items affecting comparability on a constant-currency basis increased 5 percent compared to fiscal 2015 (see the Non-GAAP Measures section below for a description of our use of measures not defined by GAAP). 19 Table of Contents A summary of our consolidated financial results for fiscal 2016 follows: Fiscal 2016 In millions, except per share Fiscal 2016 vs. Fiscal 2015 Percent of Net Sales Constant- Currency Growth (a) Net sales $ 16,563.1 (6 )% Operating profit 2,707.4 30 % 16.3 % Net earnings attributable to General Mills 1,697.4 39 % Diluted earnings per share $ 2.77 41 % Organic net sales growth rate (a) Flat Total segment operating profit (a) 2,999.5 (1 )% 1 % Adjusted operating profit margin (a) 16.8 % Diluted earnings per share, excluding certain items affecting comparability (a) $ 2.92 2 % 5 % (a) See the Non-GAAP Measures section below for our use of measures not defined by GAAP.

The 6 percent decline in fiscal 2016 net sales included a 1 percent decrease from acquisitions and divestitures, primarily the Green Giant divestiture in fiscal 2016 and Annie acquisition in fiscal 2015, reflecting 2 percentage points of decline from volume (please refer to Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report). The 53rd week in fiscal 2015 contributed approximately 1 percentage point of net sales decline in fiscal 2016, reflecting approximately 1 percentage point of decline from volume. Organic net sales were flat to fiscal 2015. To improve comparability of results from period to period, organic net sales exclude the impacts of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, as well as acquisitions, divestitures, and a 53rd week of results, when applicable. Components of organic net sales growth are shown in the following table: Fiscal 2016 vs. Fiscal 2015 Contributions from organic volume growth (a) Flat Organic net price realization and mix Flat Organic net sales growth Flat Foreign currency exchange (4) pts Acquisitions and divestitures (b) (1) pt 53rd week impact (c) (1) pt Net sales growth (6) pts (a) Measured in tons based on the stated weight of our product shipments.

Cost of sales decreased $948 million in fiscal 2016 to $10,734 million. In fiscal 2016, product mix drove a $486 million decrease in cost of sales and lower volume drove a $369 million decrease. We recorded a $63 million net decrease in cost of sales related to mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions and grain inventories as described in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial 20 Table of Contents Statements in Item 8 of this report, compared to a net increase of $90 million in fiscal 2015. In fiscal 2016, we recorded $78 million of restructuring charges in cost of sales compared to $60 million in fiscal 2015. We recorded $58 million of restructuring initiative project-related costs in cost of sales in fiscal 2016 compared to $13 million in fiscal 2015 (please refer to Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report). We also recorded a $3 million foreign exchange loss in cost of sales in fiscal 2015 related to Venezuela currency devaluation. Gross margin declined 2 percent in fiscal 2016 versus fiscal 2015. Gross margin as a percent of net sales of 35 percent increased 150 basis points compared to fiscal 2015. SG&A expenses decreased $209 million in fiscal 2016 versus fiscal 2015 primarily due to an 8 percent decrease in advertising and media expense, and savings from Project Catalyst, Project Compass, and our other cost-management initiatives. In fiscal 2015, we recorded a $5 million charge in SG&A expenses related to Venezuela currency devaluation and $16 million of integration costs related to our acquisition of Annie s. SG&A expenses as a percent of net sales decreased 10 basis points compared to fiscal 2015. During fiscal 2016, we recorded a $148 million divestitures gain (net) from the sale of Green Giant, our subsidiary in Venezuela, and our foodservice business in Argentina (please refer to Note 3 of the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report). Restructuring, impairment, and other exit costs totaled $151 million in fiscal 2016 compared to $544 million in fiscal 2015. In fiscal 2015, we made a strategic decision to redirect certain resources supporting our Green Giant business in our North America Retail segment to other businesses within the segment. As a result, we recorded a $260 million impairment charge in fiscal 2015 related to the Green Giant brand intangible asset. Restructuring charges recorded in restructuring, impairment, and other exit costs were $151 million in fiscal 2016 compared to $284 million in fiscal 2015.

Please refer to Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for more information regarding our restructuring activities. Interest, net for fiscal 2016 totaled $304 million, $12 million lower than fiscal 2015, primarily driven by lower average debt balances, partially offset by changes in the mix of debt. Our consolidated effective tax rate for fiscal 2016 was 31.4 percent compared to 33.3 percent in fiscal 2015. The 1.9 percentage point decrease was primarily due to the unfavorable impact of our repatriation of historical foreign earnings in fiscal 2015, partially offset by non-deductible expenses related to the Green Giant divestiture in fiscal 2016. Our effective tax rate excluding certain items affecting comparability was 29.8 percent in fiscal 2016 compared to 30.5 percent in fiscal 2015 (see the Non-GAAP Measures section below for a description of our use of measures not defined by GAAP). 21 Table of Contents After-tax earnings from joint ventures for fiscal 2016 increased to $88 million compared to $84 million in fiscal 2015 primarily driven by favorable input costs in fiscal 2016, favorable product mix for HDJ, and lapping an impairment charge of $3 million at CPW in South Africa in fiscal 2015, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency exchange. On a constant-currency basis, after-tax earnings from joint ventures increased 12 percent (see the Non-GAAP Measures section below for a description of our use of these measures not defined by GAAP).

RESULTS OF SEGMENT OPERATIONS In the third quarter of fiscal 2017, we announced a new global organization structure to streamline our leadership, enhance global scale, and drive improved operational agility to maximize our growth capabilities. As a result of this global reorganization, beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2017, we reported results for our four operating segments as follows: North America Retail; Convenience Stores & Foodservice; Europe & Australia; and Asia & Latin America. We have restated our net sales by segment and segment operating profit amounts to reflect our new operating segments. These segment changes had no effect on previously reported consolidated net sales, operating profit, net earnings attributable to General Mills, or earnings per share. Our North America Retail operating segment consists of our former U.S. Retail operating units and our Canada region. Within our North America Retail operating segment, our former U.S. Meals operating unit and U.S. Baking operating unit have been combined into one operating unit: U.S. Meals & Baking. Our Convenience Stores & Foodservice operating segment was unchanged. Our Europe & Australia operating segment consists of our former Europe region. Our Asia & Latin America operating segment consists of our former Asia/Pacific and Latin America regions. 22 Table of Contents The following tables provide the dollar amount and percentage of net sales and operating profit from each segment for fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015: Fiscal Year 2017 2016 2015 In Millions Dollars Percent of Total Dollars Percent of Total Dollars Percent of Total Net Sales North America Retail $ 10,196.9 65 % $ 10,936.6 66 % $ 11,612.1 66 % Convenience Stores & Foodservice 1,870.0 12 1,923.8 12 1,995.1 11 Europe & Australia 1,824.5 12 1,998.0 12 2,126.5 12 Asia & Latin America 1,728.4 11 1,704.7 10 1,896.6 11 Total $ 15,619.8 100 % $ 16,563.1 100 % $ 17,630.3 100 % Segment Operating Profit North America Retail $ 2,303.6 78 % $ 2,351.2 78 % $ 2,382.7 78 % Convenience Stores & Foodservice 401.2 14 378.9 13 353.1 12 Europe & Australia 164.2 5 200.3 7 179.4 6 Asia & Latin America 83.6 3 69.1 2 119.8 4 Total $ 2,952.6 100 % $ 2,999.5 100 % $ 3,035.0 100 % Segment operating profit excludes unallocated corporate items, net gain/loss on divestitures, and restructuring, impairment, and other exit costs because these items affecting operating profit are centrally managed at the corporate level and are excluded from the measure of segment profitability reviewed by our executive management. NORTH AMERICA RETAIL SEGMENT Our North America Retail operating segment reflects business with a wide variety of grocery stores, mass merchandisers, membership stores, natural food chains, drug, dollar and discount chains, and e-commerce grocery providers. Our product categories in this business segment are ready-to-eat cereals, refrigerated yogurt, soup, meal kits, refrigerated and frozen dough products, dessert and baking mixes, frozen pizza and pizza snacks, grain, fruit and savory snacks, and a wide variety of organic products including refrigerated yogurt, nutrition bars, meal kits, salty snacks, ready-to-eat cereal, and grain snacks.

The decline in net sales also includes the impact of the Green Giant divestiture from the U.S. Meals & Baking and Canada operating units in fiscal 2016. The 6 percent decrease in North America Retail net sales for fiscal 2016 was driven by declines in all operating units. These results include 3 percentage points of net sales decline from the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, primarily Green Giant and Annie s, reflecting approximately 3 percentage points of decline from volume. The 53 rd week in fiscal 2015 contributed 1 percentage point of net sales decline in fiscal 2016, reflecting approximately 2 percentage points of decline from volume. 23 Table of Contents The components of North America Retail organic net sales growth are shown in the following table: Fiscal 2017 vs. 2016 Percentage Change Fiscal 2016 vs. 2015 Percentage Change Contributions from organic volume growth (a) (9) pts (2) pts Organic net price realization and mix 4 pts 1 pt Organic net sales growth (5) pts (1) pt Foreign currency exchange Flat (1) pt Acquisitions and divestitures (b) (2) pts (3) pts 53rd week impact (c) (1) pt Net sales growth (7) pts (6) pts (a) Measured in tons based on the stated weight of our product shipments.

(b) On a constant currency basis, Canada net sales decreased 2 percent in fiscal 2017 and decreased 4 percent in fiscal 2016. See the Non-GAAP Measures section below for our use of this measure not defined by GAAP. Segment operating profit of $2,304 million in fiscal 2017 decreased $48 million, or 2 percent, from fiscal 2016. The decrease was primarily driven by declining contributions from volume growth, currency-driven inflation on products imported into Canada, and the impact of the Green Giant divestiture, partially offset by benefits from cost savings initiatives, favorable net price realization, and a decrease in SG&A expenses, including a 16 percentage point decline in media and advertising expense. Segment operating profit decreased 2 percent on a constant-currency basis in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 (see the Non-GAAP Measures section below for our use of this measure). Segment operating profit of $2,351 million in fiscal 2016 decreased $32 million, or 1 percent, from fiscal 2015. The decrease was primarily driven by currency-driven inflation on products imported into Canada and the impact of the Green Giant divestiture, 24 Table of Contents partially offset by a decrease in SG&A expenses, including a decline in media and advertising expense and benefits from cost savings initiatives. Segment operating profit was flat on a constant-currency basis in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 (see the Non-GAAP Measures section below for our use of this measure). CONVENIENCE STORES & FOODSERVICE SEGMENT In our Convenience Stores & Foodservice segment our major product categories are ready-to-eat cereals, snacks, refrigerated yogurt, frozen meals, unbaked and fully baked frozen dough products, and baking mixes.

In fiscal 2016, segment operating profit was up 7 percent from $353 million in fiscal 2015 primarily driven by favorable product mix and cost savings from Project Catalyst and other cost management initiatives. EUROPE & AUSTRALIA SEGMENT Our Europe & Australia operating segment consists of our former Europe region. The segment includes retail and foodservice businesses in the greater Europe and Australia regions. Our product categories include refrigerated yogurt, meal kits, super-premium ice cream, refrigerated and frozen dough products, shelf stable vegetables, grain snacks, and dessert and baking mixes.

The 4 percent decrease in Europe & Australia organic net sales growth in fiscal 2017 was primarily driven by a 7 percentage point decline from contributions from organic volume growth, which primarily reflects increased competition in key categories and the impact of an additional month of results from Yoplait SAS in fiscal 2016. The 4 percent increase in Europe & Australia organic net sales growth in fiscal 2016 was primarily driven by a 6 percentage point increase from contributions from organic volume growth, which primarily reflects the impact of an additional month of results from Yoplait SAS, and contributions from volume growth in our H agen-Dazs and Old El Paso businesses. Segment operating profit for fiscal 2017 decreased 18 percent to $164 million from $200 million in fiscal 2016, primarily driven by unfavorable foreign currency exchange, including currency-driven inflation on imported products in certain markets, and the impact of the additional month of results from Yoplait SAS in fiscal 2016, partially offset by a decrease in SG&A expenses, including a 24 percentage point decline in media and advertising expense. Europe & Australia segment operating profit decreased 9 percent on a constant-currency basis in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 (see the Non-GAAP Measures section below for our use of this measure). Segment operating profit for fiscal 2016 increased 12 percent to $200 million from $179 million in fiscal 2015, primarily driven by lower input costs, favorable mix, and an additional month of results from Yoplait SAS, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency exchange. Europe & Australia segment operating profit increased 28 percent on a constant-currency basis in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 (see the Non-GAAP Measures section below for our use of this measure). 26 Table of Contents ASIA & LATIN AMERICA SEGMENT Our Asia & Latin America operating segment consists of our former Asia/Pacific and Latin America regions. The segment includes retail and foodservice businesses in the greater Asia and South America regions. Our product categories include super-premium ice cream and frozen desserts, refrigerated and frozen dough products, dessert and baking mixes, meal kits, salty and grain snacks, wellness beverages, and refrigerated yogurt.

The 3 percent increase in Asia & Latin America organic net sales in fiscal 2017 was primarily driven by a 5 percentage point increase from organic net price realization and mix resulting from pricing actions in the Latin America and China markets, partially offset by a 2 percentage point decline in contributions from organic volume which reflects the impact of macroeconomic challenges in Latin America and the restructuring of our snacks business in China. The 2 percentage point decline in contributions from organic volume included the impact of an additional month of results from Yoki in fiscal 2017. The 7 percent increase in Asia & Latin America organic net sales growth in fiscal 2016 was primarily driven by a 4 percentage point increase from organic net price realization and mix primarily driven by pricing actions in the Latin America region and a 3 percentage point increase in contributions from organic volume which reflects increased contributions from the Asia region. 27 Table of Contents Segment operating profit for fiscal 2017 increased 21 percent to $84 million from $69 million in fiscal 2016, primarily driven by growth in the H agen-Dazs business in China and the impact of an additional month of results from Yoki in fiscal 2017. Asia & Latin America segment operating profit increased 20 percent on a constant-currency basis in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 (see the Non-GAAP Measures section below for our use of this measure). Segment operating profit for fiscal 2016 declined 42 percent to $69 million from $120 million in fiscal 2015, primarily driven by increased SG&A expenses, unfavorable foreign currency exchange, and input cost inflation, including currency-driven inflation on imported products in certain markets. Asia & Latin America segment operating profit declined 33 percent on a constant-currency basis in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 (see the Non-GAAP Measures section below for our use of this measure). UNALLOCATED CORPORATE ITEMS Unallocated corporate items include corporate overhead expenses, variances to planned domestic employee benefits and incentives, contributions to the General Mills Foundation, asset and liability remeasurement impact of hyperinflationary economies, restructuring initiative project-related costs, and other items that are not part of our measurement of segment operating performance. This includes gains and losses from the mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions until passed back to our operating segments in accordance with our policy as discussed in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. For fiscal 2017, unallocated corporate expense totaled $190 million compared to $289 million last year. In fiscal 2017, we recorded a $14 million net decrease in expense related to mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions and grain inventories compared to a $63 million net decrease in expense in the prior year. In addition, we recorded $42 million of restructuring charges, and $44 million of restructuring initiative project-related costs in cost of sales in fiscal 2017, compared to $78 million of restructuring charges and $58 million of restructuring initiative project-related costs in cost of sales in fiscal 2016. The decrease in unallocated corporate expense also reflects lower incentive expense in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016. For fiscal 2016, unallocated corporate expense totaled $289 million compared to $414 million in fiscal 2015. In fiscal 2016, we recorded a $63 million net decrease in expense related to mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions and grain inventories compared to a $90 million net increase in expense in the prior year. In addition, we recorded $78 million of restructuring charges, and $58 million of restructuring initiative project-related costs in cost of sales in fiscal 2016, compared to $60 million of restructuring charges and $13 million of restructuring initiative project-related costs in cost of sales in fiscal 2015. We recorded an $8 million foreign exchange loss related to the remeasurement of assets and liabilities of our Venezuelan subsidiary in fiscal 2015. We also recorded $16 million of integration costs resulting from the acquisition of Annie in fiscal 2015. The decrease in unallocated corporate expense also reflects cost savings from Project Catalyst and other cost management initiatives. IMPACT OF INFLATION Our gross margin performance reflects the impact of 1 percent input cost inflation in fiscal 2017, 2 percent in fiscal 2016, and 2 percent in fiscal 2015, primarily on commodity inputs. We expect input cost inflation of 3 percent in fiscal 2018. We attempt to minimize the effects of inflation through HMM, planning, and operating practices. Our risk management practices are discussed in Item 7A of this report. LIQUIDITY The primary source of our liquidity is cash flow from operations. Over the most recent three-year period, our operations have generated $7.5 billion in cash. A substantial portion of this operating cash flow has been returned to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. We also use cash from operations to fund our capital expenditures and acquisitions. We typically use a combination of cash, notes payable, and long-term debt to finance significant acquisitions and major capital expansions. As of May 28, 2017, we had $703 million of cash and cash equivalents held in foreign jurisdictions, which will be used to fund foreign operations and acquisitions. There is currently no need to repatriate these funds in order to meet domestic funding obligations or scheduled cash distributions. If we choose to repatriate historical earnings held in foreign jurisdictions, we intend to do so only in a tax-neutral manner. 28 Table of Contents Cash Flows from Operations Fiscal Year In Millions 2017 2016 2015 Net earnings, including earnings attributable to redeemable and noncontrolling interests $ 1,701.1 $ 1,736.8 $ 1,259.4 Depreciation and amortization 603.6 608.1 588.3 After-tax earnings from joint ventures (85.0 ) (88.4 ) (84.3 ) Distributions of earnings from joint ventures 75.6 75.1 72.6 Stock-based compensation 95.7 89.8 106.4 Deferred income taxes 183.9 120.6 25.3 Tax benefit on exercised options (64.1 ) (94.1 ) (74.6 ) Pension and other postretirement benefit plan contributions (45.4 ) (47.8 ) (49.5 ) Pension and other postretirement benefit plan costs 35.7 118.1 91.3 Divestitures loss (gain) 13.5 (148.2 ) Restructuring, impairment, and other exit costs 117.0 107.2 531.1 Changes in current assets and liabilities, excluding the effects of acquisitions and divestitures (232.0 ) 258.2 214.7 Other, net (86.3 ) (105.6 ) (137.9 ) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 2,313.3 $ 2,629.8 $ 2,542.8 In fiscal 2017, cash provided by operations was $2.3 billion compared to $2.6 billion in fiscal 2016. The $316 million decrease is primarily driven by a $490 million change in current assets and liabilities. The $490 million change in current assets and liabilities is primarily due to changes in other current liabilities driven by changes in income taxes payable, a decrease in incentive accruals and changes in trade and advertising accruals due to reduced spending. The change in current assets and liabilities was also impacted by the timing of accounts payable. Additionally, we recorded a $14 million loss on a divestiture during fiscal 2017, compared to a $148 million net gain on divestitures during fiscal 2016 and classified the related cash flows as investing activities. We strive to grow core working capital at or below the rate of growth in our net sales. For fiscal 2017, core working capital increased 9 percent, primarily due to timing of accounts receivable and inventory build late in fiscal 2017, compared to a net sales decline of 6 percent. In fiscal 2016, core working capital decreased 41 percent, compared to a net sales decline of 6 percent, and in fiscal 2015, core working capital decreased 13 percent, compared to net sales decline of 2 percent. In fiscal 2016, our operations generated $2.6 billion of cash, compared to $2.5 billion in fiscal 2015. The $477 million increase in net earnings included a $96 million change in deferred income taxes and a $148 million net gain on divestitures and was also offset by a $424 million decrease in non-cash restructuring charges. The $43 million change in current assets and liabilities was primarily driven by the timing of accounts payable including the impact of longer terms offset by the timing of inventory build.

We invested $684 million in land, buildings, and equipment in fiscal 2017, $45 million less than last year. In fiscal 2016, we generated $93 million of cash through investing activities compared to a use of $1.6 billion in fiscal 2015. We invested $729 million in land, buildings, and equipment in fiscal 2016, $17 million more than fiscal 2015. In fiscal 2016, we received proceeds of $828 million from the divestitures of certain businesses, primarily Green Giant. In fiscal 2015, we acquired Annie for an aggregate purchase price of $809 million, net of $12 million of cash acquired. We expect capital expenditures to be approximately $650 million in fiscal 2018. These expenditures will fund initiatives that are expected to fuel international growth, support innovative products, and continue HMM initiatives throughout the supply chain. 29 Table of Contents Cash Flows from Financing Activities Fiscal Year In Millions 2017 2016 2015 Change in notes payable $ 962.4 $ (323.8 ) $ (509.8 ) Issuance of long-term debt 1,072.1 542.5 2,253.2 Payment of long-term debt (1,000.0 ) (1,000.4 ) (1,145.8 ) Proceeds from common stock issued on exercised options 112.6 171.9 163.7 Tax benefit on exercised options 64.1 94.1 74.6 Purchases of common stock for treasury (1,651.5 ) (606.7 ) (1,161.9 ) Dividends paid (1,135.1 ) (1,071.7 ) (1,017.7 ) Distributions to noncontrolling and redeemable interest holders (61.0 ) (84.3 ) (25.0 ) Other, net (9.1 ) (7.2 ) (16.1 ) Net cash used by financing activities $ (1,645.5 ) $ (2,285.6 ) $ (1,384.8 ) Net cash used by financing activities decreased by $640 million in fiscal 2017.

For more information on our debt issuances and payments, please refer to Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. During fiscal 2017, we received $113 million in proceeds from common stock issued on exercised options compared to $172 million in fiscal 2016, a decrease of $59 million. During fiscal 2015, we received $164 million in proceeds from common stock issued on exercised options. During fiscal 2017, we repurchased 25 million shares of our common stock for $1,652 million. During fiscal 2016, we repurchased 11 million shares of our common stock for $607 million. During fiscal 2015, we repurchased 22 million shares of our common stock for $1,162 million. Dividends paid in fiscal 2017 totaled $1,135 million, or $1.92 per share, an 8 percent per share increase from fiscal 2016. Dividends paid in fiscal 2016 totaled $1,072 million, or $1.78 per share, a 7 percent per share increase from fiscal 2015 dividends of $1.67 per share.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 we amended the credit facility expiration date by one year to May 2022. To ensure availability of funds, we maintain bank credit lines sufficient to cover our outstanding notes payable. Commercial paper is a continuing source of short-term financing. We have commercial paper programs available to us in the United States and Europe. We also have uncommitted and asset-backed credit lines that support our foreign operations. The credit facilities contain several covenants, including a requirement to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 2.5 times. Certain of our long-term debt agreements, our credit facilities, and our noncontrolling interests contain restrictive covenants. As of May 28, 2017, we were in compliance with all of these covenants. We have $605 million of long-term debt maturing in the next 12 months that is classified as current, including $500 million of 1.4 percent notes due October 2017 and $100 million of 6.39 percent fixed rate medium term notes due for remarketing in February 2018. We believe that cash flows from operations, together with available short- and long-term debt financing, will be adequate to meet our liquidity and capital needs for at least the next 12 months. As of May 28, 2017, our total debt, including the impact of derivative instruments designated as hedges, was 67 percent in fixed-rate and 33 percent in floating-rate instruments, compared to 78 percent in fixed-rate and 22 percent in floating-rate instruments on May 29, 2016. Return on average total capital was 12.7 percent in fiscal 2017 compared to 12.9 percent in fiscal 2016. Improvement in adjusted return on average total capital is one of our key performance measures (see the Non-GAAP Measures section below for our discussion of this measure, which is not defined by GAAP). Adjusted return on average total capital increased 30 basis points from 11.3 percent in fiscal 2016 to 11.6 percent in fiscal 2017 as fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings increased. On a constant-currency basis, adjusted return on average total capital increased 40 basis points. We also believe that our fixed charge coverage ratio and the ratio of operating cash flow to debt are important measures of our financial strength. Our fixed charge coverage ratio in fiscal 2017 was 7.26 compared to 7.40 in fiscal 2016. The measure decreased from fiscal 2016 as earnings before income taxes and after-tax earnings from joint ventures decreased by $132 million in fiscal 2017. Our operating cash flow to debt ratio decreased 6.8 percentage points to 24.4 percent in fiscal 2017, driven by a decrease in cash provided by operations and an increase in notes payable. We have a 51 percent controlling interest in Yoplait SAS and a 50 percent interest in Yoplait Marques SNC and Libert Marques S rl. Sodiaal holds the remaining interests in each of these entities. We consolidate these entities into our consolidated financial statements. We record Sodiaal 50 percent interest in Yoplait Marques SNC and Libert Marques S rl as noncontrolling interests, and its 49 percent interest in Yoplait SAS as a redeemable interest on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. These euro- and Canadian dollar-denominated interests are reported in U.S. dollars on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Sodiaal has the ability to put all or a portion of its redeemable interest to us at fair value once per year, up to three times before December 2024. As of May 28, 2017, the redemption value of the redeemable interest was $911 million which approximates its fair value. The third-party holder of the General Mills Cereals, LLC (GMC) Class A Interests receives quarterly preferred distributions from available net income based on the application of a floating preferred return rate to the holder capital account balance established in the most recent mark-to-market valuation (currently $252 million). On June 1, 2015, the floating preferred return rate on GMC Class A Interests was reset to the sum of three-month LIBOR plus 125 basis points. The preferred return rate is adjusted every three years through a negotiated agreement with the Class A Interest holder or through a remarketing auction. We have an option to purchase the Class A Interests for consideration equal to the then current capital account value, plus any unpaid preferred return and the prescribed make-whole amount. If we purchase these interests, any change in the third-party holder capital account from its original value will be charged directly to retained earnings and will increase or decrease the net earnings used to calculate EPS in that period. 31 Table of Contents OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS As of May 28, 2017, we have issued guarantees and comfort letters of $505 million for the debt and other obligations of consolidated subsidiaries, and guarantees and comfort letters of $165 million for the debt and other obligations of non-consolidated affiliates, mainly CPW. In addition, off-balance sheet arrangements are generally limited to the future payments under non-cancelable operating leases, which totaled $501 million as of May 28, 2017. As of May 28, 2017, we had invested in five variable interest entities (VIEs). None of our VIEs are material to our results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity as of and for the fiscal year ended May 28, 2017. Our defined benefit plans in the United States are subject to the requirements of the Pension Protection Act (PPA). In the future, the PPA may require us to make additional contributions to our domestic plans. We do not expect to be required to make any contributions in fiscal 2017. The following table summarizes our future estimated cash payments under existing contractual obligations, including payments due by period: Payments Due by Fiscal Year In Millions Total 2018 2019 -20 2021 -22 2023 and Thereafter Long-term debt (a) $ 8,290.6 604.2 2,647.7 1,559.3 3,479.4 Accrued interest 83.8 83.8 Operating leases (b) 500.7 118.8 182.4 110.4 89.1 Capital leases 1.2 0.4 0.6 0.1 0.1 Purchase obligations (c) 3,191.0 2,304.8 606.8 264.3 15.1 Total contractual obligations 12,067.3 3,112.0 3,437.5 1,934.1 3,583.7 Other long-term obligations (d) 1,372.7 Total long-term obligations $ 13,440.0 $ 3,112.0 $ 3,437.5 $ 1,934.1 $ 3,583.7 (a) Amounts represent the expected cash payments of our long-term debt and do not include $1.2 million for capital leases or $44.4 million for net unamortized debt issuance costs, premiums and discounts, and fair value adjustments. (b) Operating leases represents the minimum rental commitments under non-cancelable operating leases. (c) The majority of the purchase obligations represent commitments for raw material and packaging to be utilized in the normal course of business and for consumer marketing spending commitments that support our brands. For purposes of this table, arrangements are considered purchase obligations if a contract specifies all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, a pricing structure, and approximate timing of the transaction. Most arrangements are cancelable without a significant penalty and with short notice (usually 30 days). Any amounts reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as accounts payable and accrued liabilities are excluded from the table above. (d) The fair value of our foreign exchange, equity, commodity, and grain derivative contracts with a payable position to the counterparty was $24 million as of May 28, 2017, based on fair market values as of that date. Future changes in market values will impact the amount of cash ultimately paid or received to settle those instruments in the future. Other long-term obligations mainly consist of liabilities for accrued compensation and benefits, including the underfunded status of certain of our defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plans, and miscellaneous liabilities. We expect to pay $21 million of benefits from our unfunded postemployment benefit plans and $14.6 million of deferred compensation in fiscal 2018. We are unable to reliably estimate the amount of these payments beyond fiscal 2018. As of May 28, 2017, our total liability for uncertain tax positions and accrued interest and penalties was $158.6 million. 32 Table of Contents SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES For a complete description of our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. Our significant accounting estimates are those that have a meaningful impact on the reporting of our financial condition and results of operations. These estimates include our accounting for promotional expenditures, valuation of long-lived assets, intangible assets, redeemable interest, stock-based compensation, income taxes, and defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plans. Promotional Expenditures Our promotional activities are conducted through our customers and directly or indirectly with end consumers. These activities include: payments to customers to perform merchandising activities on our behalf, such as advertising or in-store displays; discounts to our list prices to lower retail shelf prices; payments to gain distribution of new products; coupons, contests, and other incentives; and media and advertising expenditures. The recognition of these costs requires estimation of customer participation and performance levels. These estimates are based on the forecasted customer sales, the timing and forecasted costs of promotional activities, and other factors. Differences between estimated expenses and actual costs are recognized as a change in management estimate in a subsequent period. Our accrued trade, coupon, and consumer marketing liabilities were $483 million as of May 28, 2017, and $564 million as of May 29, 2016. Because our total promotional expenditures (including amounts classified as a reduction of revenues) are significant, if our estimates are inaccurate we would have to make adjustments in subsequent periods that could have a significant effect on our results of operations. Valuation of Long-Lived Assets We estimate the useful lives of long-lived assets and make estimates concerning undiscounted cash flows to review for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (or asset group) may not be recoverable. Fair value is measured using discounted cash flows or independent appraisals, as appropriate. Intangible Assets Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are not subject to amortization and are tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. Our estimates of fair value for goodwill impairment testing are determined based on a discounted cash flow model. We use inputs from our long-range planning process to determine growth rates for sales and profits. We also make estimates of discount rates, perpetuity growth assumptions, market comparables, and other factors. We evaluate the useful lives of our other intangible assets, mainly brands, to determine if they are finite or indefinite-lived. Reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, other economic factors (such as the stability of the industry, known technological advances, legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment, and expected changes in distribution channels), the level of required maintenance expenditures, and the expected lives of other related groups of assets. Intangible assets that are deemed to have definite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis, over their useful lives, generally ranging from 4 to 30 years. Our estimate of the fair value of our brand assets is based on a discounted cash flow model using inputs which include projected revenues from our long-range plan, assumed royalty rates that could be payable if we did not own the brands, and a discount rate. As of May 28, 2017, we had $12.9 billion of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. While we currently believe that the fair value of each intangible exceeds its carrying value and that those intangibles so classified will contribute indefinitely to our cash flows, materially different assumptions regarding future performance of our businesses or a different weighted-average cost of capital could result in material impairment losses and amortization expense. We performed our fiscal 2017 assessment of our intangible assets as of August 29, 2016. As of our annual assessment date, there was no impairment of any of our intangible assets as their related fair values were substantially in excess of the carrying values except for the Latin America reporting unit and the Immaculate Baking brand intangible asset. The excess fair value above the carrying value of the Latin America reporting unit and the Immaculate Baking brand intangible asset is as follows: In Millions Carrying Value Excess Fair Value Above Carrying Value Latin America $ 523.0 15 % Immaculate Baking $ 12.0 17 % Our Latin America reporting unit and Immaculate Baking brand have experienced declining business performance. In addition, while not impaired as of May 28, 2017, the Progresso , Green Giant , and Food Should Taste Good brand intangible assets and U.S. Yogurt reporting unit had risk of decreasing coverage. We will continue to monitor these businesses for potential impairment. 33 Table of Contents Redeemable Interest In fiscal 2017, we adjusted the redemption value of Sodiaal redeemable interest in Yoplait SAS based on a discounted cash flow model. The significant assumptions used to estimate the redemption value include projected revenue growth and profitability from our long-range plan, capital spending, depreciation and taxes, foreign currency exchange rates, and a discount rate. As of May 28, 2017, the redemption value of the redeemable interest was $911 million. Stock-based Compensation The valuation of stock options is a significant accounting estimate that requires us to use judgments and assumptions that are likely to have a material impact on our financial statements. Annually, we make predictive assumptions regarding future stock price volatility, employee exercise behavior, dividend yield, and the forfeiture rate. For more information on these assumptions, please refer to Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. The estimated fair values of stock options granted and the assumptions used for the Black-Scholes option-pricing model were as follows: Fiscal Year 2017 2016 2015 Estimated fair values of stock options granted $8.80 $7.24 $7.22 Assumptions: Risk-free interest rate 1.7% 2.4% 2.6% Expected term 8.5 years 8.5 years 8.5 years Expected volatility 17.8% 17.6% 17.5% Dividend yield 2.9% 3.2% 3.1% The risk-free interest rate for periods during the expected term of the options is based on the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon yield curve in effect at the time of grant. An increase in the expected term by 1 year, leaving all other assumptions constant, would increase the grant date fair value by 1 percent. If all other assumptions are held constant, a one percentage point increase in our fiscal 2017 volatility assumption would increase the grant date fair value of our fiscal 2017 option awards by 7 percent. To the extent that actual outcomes differ from our assumptions, we are not required to true up grant-date fair value-based expense to final intrinsic values. However, these differences can impact the classification of cash tax benefits realized upon exercise of stock options, as explained in the following two paragraphs. Furthermore, historical data has a significant bearing on our forward-looking assumptions. Significant variances between actual and predicted experience could lead to prospective revisions in our assumptions, which could then significantly impact the year-over-year comparability of stock-based compensation expense. Any corporate income tax benefit realized upon exercise or vesting of an award in excess of that previously recognized in earnings (referred to as a windfall tax benefit) is presented in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as a financing cash flow. The actual impact on future years cash flows will depend, in part, on the volume of employee stock option exercises during a particular year and the relationship between the exercise-date market value of the underlying stock and the original grant-date fair value previously determined for financial reporting purposes. Realized windfall tax benefits are credited to additional paid-in capital within the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Realized shortfall tax benefits (amounts which are less than that previously recognized in earnings) are first offset against the cumulative balance of windfall tax benefits, if any, and then charged directly to income tax expense, potentially resulting in volatility in our consolidated effective income tax rate. Because employee stock option exercise behavior is not within our control, it is possible that significantly different reported results could occur if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail. See the new accounting requirements for the accounting and presentation of stock-based payments in the Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements section below for forthcoming changes to stock-based compensation. Income Taxes We apply a more-likely-than-not threshold to the recognition and derecognition of uncertain tax positions. Accordingly, we recognize the amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being ultimately realized upon settlement. Future changes in judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions will affect earnings in the quarter of such change. For more information on income taxes, please refer to Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. 34 Table of Contents Defined Benefit Pension, Other Postretirement Benefit, and Postemployment Benefit Plans We have defined benefit pension plans covering many employees in the United States, Canada, France, and the United Kingdom. We also sponsor plans that provide health care benefits to many of our retirees in the United States, Canada, and Brazil. Under certain circumstances, we also provide accruable benefits, primarily severance, to former and inactive employees in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. Please refer to Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for a description of our defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plans. We recognize benefits provided during retirement or following employment over the plan participants active working lives. Accordingly, we make various assumptions to predict and measure costs and obligations many years prior to the settlement of our obligations. Assumptions that require significant management judgment and have a material impact on the measurement of our net periodic benefit expense or income and accumulated benefit obligations include the long-term rates of return on plan assets, the interest rates used to discount the obligations for our benefit plans, and health care cost trend rates. Expected Rate of Return on Plan Assets Our expected rate of return on plan assets is determined by our asset allocation, our historical long-term investment performance, our estimate of future long-term returns by asset class (using input from our actuaries, investment services, and investment managers), and long-term inflation assumptions. We review this assumption annually for each plan; however, our annual investment performance for one particular year does not, by itself, significantly influence our evaluation. Our historical investment returns (compound annual growth rates) for our United States defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets were 11.8 percent, 10.0 percent, 6.0 percent, 8.4 percent, and 8.4 percent for the 1, 5, 10, 15, and 20 year periods ended May 31, 2017. On a weighted-average basis, the expected rate of return for all defined benefit plans was 8.17 percent for fiscal 2017, 8.53 percent for fiscal 2016, and 8.53 percent for fiscal 2015. For fiscal 2018, we lowered our weighted-average expected rate of return on plan assets for our principal defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans in the United States to 7.95 percent due to asset changes that decreased investment risk in the portfolio. Lowering the expected long-term rate of return on assets by 100 basis points would increase our net pension and postretirement expense by $66 million for fiscal 2018. A market-related valuation basis is used to reduce year-to-year expense volatility. The market-related valuation recognizes certain investment gains or losses over a five-year period from the year in which they occur. Investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the market-related value of assets and the actual return based on the market-related value of assets. Our outside actuaries perform these calculations as part of our determination of annual expense or income. Discount Rates Beginning in fiscal 2017, we changed the method used to estimate the service and interest cost components of the net periodic benefit expense for our United States and most of our international defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plans. We adopted a full yield curve approach to estimate service cost and interest cost by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used to determine the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. This method provides a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by correlating the timing of the plans liability cash flows to the corresponding rate on the yield curve. Previously, we estimated service cost and interest cost using a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period. This change does not affect the measurement of our benefit obligations related to these plans. We have accounted for this change prospectively as a change in accounting estimate beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. The change in methodology resulted in a decrease in service and interest cost of approximately $68 million in fiscal 2017 compared to what our costs would have been under the previous method. The fiscal 2017 reduction in our net periodic benefit expense as a result of this change in methodology was partially offset by a reduction in our weighted-average expected rate of return on plan assets for our principal defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans in the United States to 8.25 percent as a result of changes that decreased investment risk in the portfolio. Our discount rate assumptions are determined annually as of May 31 for our defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plan obligations. We work with our outside actuaries to determine the timing and amount of expected future cash outflows to plan participants and, using the Aa Above Median corporate bond yield, to develop a forward interest rate curve, including a margin to that index based on our credit risk. This forward interest rate curve is applied to our expected future cash outflows to determine our discount rate assumptions. 35 Table of Contents Our weighted-average discount rates were as follows: Defined Benefit Pension Plans Other Postretirement Benefit Plans Postemployment Benefit Plans Effective rate for fiscal 2018 service costs 4.37 % 4.27 % 3.54 % Effective rate for fiscal 2018 interest costs 3.45 % 3.24 % 2.67 % Obligations as of May 31, 2017 4.08 % 3.92 % 2.87 % Effective rate for fiscal 2017 service costs 4.57 % 4.42 % 3.55 % Effective rate for fiscal 2017 interest costs 3.44 % 3.17 % 2.67 % Obligations as of May 29, 2016 4.19 % 3.97 % 2.94 % Obligations as of May 31, 2015 and fiscal 2016 expense 4.38 % 4.20 % 3.55 % Lowering the discount rates by 100 basis points would increase our net defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plan expense for fiscal 2018 by approximately $85 million. All obligation-related experience gains and losses are amortized using a straight-line method over the average remaining service period of active plan participants. Health Care Cost Trend Rates We review our health care cost trend rates annually. Our review is based on data we collect about our health care claims experience and information provided by our actuaries. This information includes recent plan experience, plan design, overall industry experience and projections, and assumptions used by other similar organizations. Our initial health care cost trend rate is adjusted as necessary to remain consistent with this review, recent experiences, and short-term expectations. Our initial health care cost trend rate assumption is 7.3 percent for retirees age 65 and over and 7.0 percent for retirees under age 65 at the end of fiscal 2017. Rates are graded down annually until the ultimate trend rate of 5.0 percent is reached in 2024 for all retirees. The trend rates are applicable for calculations only if the retirees benefits increase as a result of health care inflation. The ultimate trend rate is adjusted annually, as necessary, to approximate the current economic view on the rate of long-term inflation plus an appropriate health care cost premium. Assumed trend rates for health care costs have an important effect on the amounts reported for the other postretirement benefit plans. A one percentage point change in the health care cost trend rate would have the following effects: In Millions One Percentage Point Increase One Percentage Point Decrease Effect on the aggregate of the service and interest cost components in fiscal 2018 $ 2.2 $ (1.9) Effect on the other post retirement accumulated benefit obligation as of May 28, 2017 59.5 (53.8) Any arising health care claims cost-related experience gain or loss is recognized in the calculation of expected future claims. Once recognized, experience gains and losses are amortized using a straight-line method over 10 years, resulting in at least the minimum amortization required being recorded. Financial Statement Impact In fiscal 2017, we recorded net defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plan expense of $56 million compared to $163 million of expense in fiscal 2016 and $153 million of expense in fiscal 2015. As of May 28, 2017, we had cumulative unrecognized actuarial net losses of $1.6 billion on our defined benefit pension plans and $24 million on our postretirement and postemployment benefit plans, mainly as the result of liability increases from lower interest rates, partially offset by recent increases in the values of plan assets. These unrecognized actuarial net losses will result in increases in our future pension and postretirement benefit expenses because they currently exceed the corridors defined by GAAP. Actual future net defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plan income or expense will depend on investment performance, changes in future discount rates, changes in health care cost trend rates, and other factors related to the populations participating in these plans. 36 Table of Contents RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In March 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued new accounting requirements related to the presentation of net periodic defined benefit pension expense, net periodic postretirement benefit expense, and net periodic postemployment benefit expense. The new standard requires the service cost component of net periodic benefit expense to be recorded in the same line items as other employee compensation costs within our Consolidated Statements of Earnings. Other components of net periodic benefit expense must be presented separately outside of operating profit in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings. In addition, the new standard requires that only the service cost component of net periodic benefit expense is eligible for capitalization. We recognized net periodic benefit expense of $56 million in fiscal 2017, $163 million in fiscal 2016, and $153 million in fiscal 2015 of which $141 million, $161 million, and $167 million, respectively, related to service cost. These amounts may not necessarily be indicative of future amounts that may be recognized subsequent to the adoption of this new standard. The requirements of the new standard are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those annual periods, which for us is the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Early adoption is permitted. In January 2017, the FASB issued new accounting requirements related to goodwill impairment testing. The new standard eliminates the requirement to measure a goodwill impairment loss by determining the implied fair value of goodwill. Instead, goodwill impairment losses will be measured by the amount by which a reporting unit carrying value exceeds the reporting unit fair value, limited to the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. The requirements of the new standard are effective for annual or any interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, which for us is fiscal 2021. Early adoption is permitted. We intend to adopt this standard in fiscal 2018 and do not expect this guidance to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position. In October 2016, the FASB issued new accounting requirements related to the recognition of income taxes resulting from intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory. This will result in the recognition of the income tax consequences resulting from the intra-entity transfer of assets in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings in the period of the transfer. The requirements of the new standard are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those annual periods, which for us is the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Early adoption is permitted. We are in the process of analyzing the impact of this standard on our results of operations and financial position. In March 2016, the FASB issued new accounting requirements for the accounting and presentation of stock-based payments. This will result in realized windfall and shortfall tax benefits upon exercise or vesting of stock-based awards being recorded in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings instead of additional paid-in capital within our Consolidated Balance Sheets. In addition, realized windfall and shortfall tax benefits will be reclassified from financing activities to operating activities in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. We recognized windfall tax benefits of $64 million in fiscal 2017, $94 million in fiscal 2016, and $75 million in fiscal 2015. These amounts may not necessarily be indicative of future amounts that may be recognized subsequent to the adoption of this new standard as windfall and shortfall tax benefits are dependent upon future stock prices, employee exercise behavior, and applicable tax rates. The requirements of the new standard are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods, which for us is the first quarter of fiscal 2018. In February 2016, the FASB issued new accounting requirements for accounting, presentation and classification of leases. This will result in most leases being capitalized as a right of use asset with a related liability on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The requirements of the new standard are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those annual periods, which for us is the first quarter of fiscal 2020. We are in the process of evaluating lease accounting software and analyzing the impact of this standard on our results of operations and financial position. Based on our assessment to date, we expect this guidance will have a material impact on our Consolidated Balance Sheets due to the amount of our lease commitments but we are unable to quantify the impact at this time. In May 2014, the FASB issued new accounting requirements for the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers. The requirements of the new standard and its subsequent amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those annual periods, which for us is the first quarter of fiscal 2019. We are in the process of documenting the impact of the guidance on our current accounting policies and practices in order to identify material differences, if any, that would result from applying the new requirements to our revenue contracts. We continue to make progress on our revenue recognition review and are also in the process of evaluating the impact, if any, on changes to our business processes, systems, and controls to support recognition and disclosure requirements under the new guidance. In addition, we continue to assess our adoption approach. Based on our assessment to date, we do not expect this guidance to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position. 37 Table of Contents NON-GAAP MEASURES We have included in this report measures of financial performance that are not defined by GAAP. We believe that these measures provide useful information to investors, and include these measures in other communications to investors. For each of these non-GAAP financial measures, we are providing below a reconciliation of the differences between the non-GAAP measure and the most directly comparable GAAP measure, an explanation of why we believe the non-GAAP measure provides useful information to investors and any additional purposes for which our management or Board of Directors uses the non-GAAP measure. These non-GAAP measures should be viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of, the comparable GAAP measure. Organic Net Sales Growth Rates This measure is used in reporting to our executive management and as a component of the Board of Directors measurement of our performance for incentive compensation purposes. We provide organic net sales growth rates for our consolidated net sales and segment net sales. We believe that organic net sales growth rates provide useful information to investors because they provide transparency to underlying performance in our net sales by excluding the effect that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, as well as acquisitions, divestitures, and a 53 rd week, when applicable, have on year-to-year comparability. A reconciliation of these measures to reported net sales growth rates, the relevant GAAP measures, are included in our Consolidated Results of Operations and Results of Segment Operations discussions above. Total Segment Operating Profit and Total Segment Operating Profit as a Percent of Net Sales Total segment operating profit is used in reporting to our executive management and as a component of the Board of Director measurement of our performance for incentive compensation purposes. We believe that this measure provides useful information to investors because it is the profitability measure we use to evaluate segment performance. Fiscal Year Percent of Net Sales 2017 2016 2015 2014 2013 Operating profit as reported $ 2,566.4 16.4 % $ 2,707.4 16.3 % $ 2,077.3 11.8 % $ 2,957.4 16.5 % $ 2,851.8 16.0 % Unallocated Corporate Items 190.1 1.2 % 288.9 1.8 % 413.8 2.3 % 258.4 1.5 % 351.3 2.0 % Divestitures loss (gain) 13.5 0.1 % (148.2 ) (0.9 )% % (65.5 ) (0.4 )% % Restructuring, impairment, and other exit costs 182.6 1.2 % 151.4 0.9 % 543.9 3.1 % 3.6 % 19.8 0.1 % Total Segment operating profit $ 2,952.6 18.9 % $ 2,999.5 18.1 % $ 3,035.0 17.2 % $ 3,153.9 17.6 % $ 3,222.9 18.1 % 38 Table of Contents Diluted EPS Excluding Certain Items Affecting Comparability and Related Constant-currency Growth Rate (Adjusted Diluted EPS) This measure is used in reporting to our executive management and as a component of the Board of Directors measurement of our performance for incentive compensation purposes. We believe that this measure provides useful information to investors because it is the profitability measure we use to evaluate earnings performance on a comparable year-over-year basis.

Forward-Looking Financial Measures Our fiscal 2018 outlook for organic net sales growth, constant-currency total segment operating profit and adjusted diluted EPS, and adjusted operating profit margin are non-GAAP financial measures that exclude, or have otherwise been adjusted for, items impacting comparability, including the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, restructuring charges and project-related costs, and commodity mark-to-market effects. Our fiscal 2018 outlook for organic net sales growth also excludes the effect of acquisitions and divestitures. We are not able to reconcile these forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP financial measures without unreasonable efforts because we are unable to predict with a reasonable degree of certainty the actual impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices or the timing of acquisitions, divestitures and restructuring actions throughout fiscal 2018. The unavailable information could have a significant impact on our fiscal 2018 GAAP financial results. For fiscal 2018, we currently expect: foreign currency exchange rates (based on blend of forward and forecasted rates and hedge positions), acquisitions, and divestitures to have an immaterial impact on net sales growth; foreign currency exchange rates to have an immaterial impact on total segment operating profit and adjusted diluted EPS growth; and total restructuring charges and project-related costs related to actions previously announced to total approximately $45 million. 45 Table of Contents CAUTIONARY STATEMENT RELEVANT TO FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION FOR THE PURPOSE OF SAFE HARBOR PROVISIONS OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995 This report contains or incorporates by reference forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 that are based on our current expectations and assumptions.
