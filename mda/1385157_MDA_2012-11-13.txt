ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. The following discussion may contain forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those factors discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report, particularly in "Risk Factors" and "Forward-Looking Information." Our Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in United States Dollars, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"). Organic net sales growth and free cash flow are non-GAAP financial measures which are discussed in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures, together with GAAP financial measures, provide useful information to investors because they reflect the financial measures that management uses in evaluating the underlying results of our operations. See "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" for more information about these non-GAAP financial measures, including our reasons for including the measures and material limitations with respect to the usefulness of the measures. Overview We are a global company that designs and manufactures approximately 500,000 products that connect and protect the flow of power and data inside millions of products used by consumers and industries. We partner with customers in a broad array of industries from consumer electronics, energy, and healthcare to automotive, aerospace, and communication networks. We operate through three reporting segments: Transportation Solutions, Communications and Industrial Solutions, and Network Solutions. See Notes 1 and 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our segments. We service our customers primarily through our direct sales force that serves customers in over 150 countries. The sales force is supported by approximately 7,400 engineers as well as globally deployed manufacturing sites. Through our sales force and engineering resources, we are able to collaborate with our customers throughout the world to provide highly engineered products and solutions to meet their needs. 32 Table of Contents Our strategic objective is to increase our net sales and profitability across our segments in the markets we serve. This strategy is dependent upon the following strategic priorities: Deliver extraordinary customer service; Strengthen our innovation leadership; Extend our leadership in emerging markets; Lead in smart connectivity; and Supplement organic growth with strategic partnerships and acquisitions. Our business and operating results have been and will continue to be affected by worldwide economic conditions. Our sales are dependent on certain industry end markets that are impacted by consumer as well as industrial and infrastructure spending, and our operating results can be affected by changes in demand in those markets. Overall, our net sales decreased 3.6% in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011. On an organic basis, net sales decreased 2.7% in fiscal 2012 from fiscal 2011 levels. On an organic basis, we experienced declines in our sales into industrial and infrastructure based markets, primarily as a result of weakness in the industrial and data communications end markets in our Communications and Industrial Solutions segment, and telecom networks and subsea communications end markets in our Network Solutions segment. On an organic basis, we experienced modest growth in our sales into consumer based markets, as growth in the automotive end market in our Transportation Solutions segment was partially offset by declines within the consumer devices and appliance end markets in our Communications and Industrial Solutions segment. The acquisition of Deutsch in April 2012 benefited the automotive and aerospace, defense, and marine end markets in the Transportation Solutions segment and contributed net sales of $327 million in fiscal 2012. Fiscal 2011 included an additional week which contributed $267 million in net sales and $0.08 per share to diluted earnings per share. ADC, which was acquired in December 2010, contributed net sales of $843 million, of which $24 million related to the additional week, during fiscal 2011. Also, the acquisition of ADC resulted in incremental net sales of $154 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2012 over the same period of fiscal 2011. The March 2011 earthquake, subsequent tsunami, and aftershocks in Japan caused disruptions in our customers' operations and the supply chains that support their operations. We estimate that our fiscal 2011 net sales and diluted earnings per share were negatively impacted by $99 million and $0.07 per share, respectively, as a result of these disruptions. Our facilities in Japan were not materially damaged, and we did not experience further negative impacts in fiscal 2012. Outlook Net sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 are expected to be between $3.15 billion and $3.25 billion. We expect global automotive production in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 to be comparable to first quarter fiscal 2012 levels. Our sales into the automotive and aerospace, defense, and marine end markets will benefit from incremental Deutsch sales which are expected to be approximately $150 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2013. During the first quarter of fiscal 2013, we expect continued weakness in the industrial, energy, and appliance end markets. Also, we expect results in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 to be negatively impacted by lower spending for broadband networks equipment and lower levels of project activity in the subsea communications end market. In the first fiscal quarter of 2013, we expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.43 to $0.47 per share. For fiscal 2013, we expect net sales to be between $13.4 billion and $14.0 billion, reflecting expected sales increases in the automotive and aerospace, defense, and marine end markets, offset by continued weakness in the industrial, appliance, and energy end markets. Our sales into the automotive 33 Table of Contents and aerospace, defense, and marine end markets will benefit from incremental Deutsch sales during the first half of fiscal 2013. We expect global automotive production and broadband network spending in fiscal 2013 to remain flat at fiscal 2012 levels. We expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $2.61 to $2.91 per share. The above outlook is based on foreign exchange rates and commodity prices that are consistent with current levels. We are monitoring the current macroeconomic environment and its potential effects on our customers and the end markets we serve. Additionally, we continue to closely manage our costs in line with economic conditions. We are also managing our capital resources and monitoring capital availability to ensure that we have sufficient resources to fund future capital needs. (See further discussion in "Liquidity and Capital Resources.") Acquisitions On April 3, 2012, we acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of Deutsch. The total value paid for the transaction amounted to 1.55 billion (approximately $2.05 billion using an exchange rate of $1.33 per 1.00), net of cash acquired. The total value paid included $659 million related to the repayment of Deutsch's financial debt and accrued interest. Deutsch is a global leader in high-performance connectors for harsh environments, and significantly expands our product portfolio and enables us to better serve customers in the industrial and commercial transportation, aerospace, defense, and marine, and rail markets. The combined organization offers a broad product range, global presence, and shared commitment to innovation, and creates an even greater opportunity to serve the growing market for harsh environment connectivity applications. We expect to realize cost savings and other synergies related to operational efficiencies including the consolidation of manufacturing, marketing, and general and administrative functions. The acquired Deutsch businesses have been reported primarily in our Transportation Solutions segment from the date of acquisition. During fiscal 2012, Deutsch contributed net sales of $327 million and an operating loss of $54 million to our Consolidated Statement of Operations. The operating loss included charges of $75 million associated with the amortization of acquisition-related fair value adjustments primarily related to acquired inventories and customer order backlog, acquisition costs of $21 million, restructuring charges of $14 million, and integration costs of $6 million. In July 2010, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement") to acquire 100% of the outstanding stock of ADC, a provider of broadband communications network connectivity products and related solutions. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, we commenced a tender offer through a subsidiary to purchase all of the issued and outstanding shares of ADC common stock at a purchase price of $12.75 per share in cash followed by a merger of the subsidiary with and into ADC, with ADC surviving as an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary. On December 8, 2010, we acquired 86.8% of the outstanding common shares of ADC. On December 9, 2010, we exercised our option under the Merger Agreement to purchase additional shares from ADC that, when combined with the shares purchased in the tender offer, were sufficient to give us ownership of more than 90% of the outstanding ADC common shares. On December 9, 2010, upon effecting a short-form merger under Minnesota law, we owned 100% of the outstanding shares of ADC for a total purchase price of approximately $1,263 million in cash (excluding cash acquired of $546 million) and $22 million representing the fair value of ADC share-based awards exchanged for TE Connectivity share options and stock appreciation rights. The acquisition was made to accelerate our growth potential in the global broadband connectivity market. The combined organization offers a complete product portfolio across every major geographic 34 Table of Contents market. It also added ADC's Distributed Antenna System products, which expanded our wireless connectivity portfolio to provide greater mobile coverage and capacity solutions to carrier and enterprise customers as demand for mobile data continues to expand. We realized cost savings and other synergies through operational efficiencies including the consolidation of manufacturing, marketing, and general and administrative functions. The acquired ADC businesses have been included in the Network Solutions segment from the date of acquisition. During fiscal 2011, ADC contributed net sales of $843 million and an operating loss of $53 million to our Consolidated Statement of Operations. The operating loss included restructuring charges of $80 million, charges of $39 million associated with the amortization of acquisition-related fair value adjustments primarily related to acquired inventories and customer order backlog, integration costs of $10 million, and acquisition costs of $9 million. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding acquisitions. Restructuring We continue to streamline our operations and simplify our global manufacturing footprint by migrating facilities from higher-cost to lower-cost countries, consolidating within countries, and transferring product lines to lower-cost countries. These initiatives are designed to help us maintain our competitiveness in the industry, improve our operating leverage, and position us for profitability growth in the years ahead. In connection with these initiatives, we incurred restructuring charges of approximately $127 million during fiscal 2012, including $14 million associated with the acquisition of Deutsch. In fiscal 2012, cash spending related to restructuring was $137 million, including $7 million associated with the acquisition of Deutsch. In response to a weaker than expected economic environment, we are expanding our restructuring efforts and expect to incur restructuring charges of approximately $200 million during fiscal 2013. Annualized cost savings related to these actions are expected to be approximately $75 million and are expected to be realized by the end of fiscal 2015. Cost savings will be reflected primarily in cost of sales and selling, general, and administrative expenses. In fiscal 2013, we expect total spending, which will be funded with cash from operations, to be approximately $150 million related to restructuring actions. Discontinued Operations During fiscal 2012, we sold our Touch Solutions business for net cash proceeds of $380 million, subject to working capital adjustments, of which we received $370 million during fiscal 2012. We recognized a pre-tax gain of $5 million on the transaction. The agreement includes contingent earn-out provisions through 2015 based on business performance. Also, during fiscal 2012, we sold our TE Professional Services business for net cash proceeds of $28 million, of which we received $24 million during fiscal 2012, and recognized a pre-tax gain of $2 million on the transaction. See Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding discontinued operations. Divestitures During fiscal 2010, we sold our mechatronics business for net cash proceeds of $3 million. This business designed and manufactured customer-specific components, primarily for the automotive industry, and generated sales of approximately $100 million in fiscal 2010. In connection with the sale, we recorded a pre-tax loss on sale of $41 million in the Transportation Solutions segment in fiscal 2010. 35 Table of Contents During fiscal 2010, we completed the divestiture of the Dulmison connectors and fittings product line, which was part of our energy business in the Network Solutions segment, for net cash proceeds of $12 million. In connection with the divestiture, we recorded a pre-tax impairment charge related to long-lived assets and a pre-tax loss on sale, both totaling $13 million in fiscal 2010. The loss on divestitures and impairment charges are presented in restructuring and other charges, net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. We have presented the loss on divestitures, related long-lived asset impairments, and operations of the mechatronics business and Dulmison connectors and fittings product line in continuing operations due to immateriality. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the divestitures. Company Name Change In March 2011, our shareholders approved an amendment to our articles of association to change our name from "Tyco Electronics Ltd." to "TE Connectivity Ltd." The name change was effective March 10, 2011. Our ticker symbol "TEL" on the New York Stock Exchange remained unchanged. The Separation Tyco Electronics Ltd. was incorporated in fiscal 2000 as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tyco International. Effective June 29, 2007, we became the parent company of the former electronics businesses of Tyco International. On June 29, 2007, Tyco International distributed all of our shares, as well as its shares of its former healthcare businesses, to its common shareholders. Results of Operations Consolidated Operations Key business factors that influenced our results of operations for the periods discussed in this report include: Raw material prices. We purchased approximately 173 million pounds of copper, 141,000 troy ounces of gold, and 2.9 million troy ounces of silver in fiscal 2012. Prices have increased in recent years and continue to fluctuate. Although copper prices have declined from prior year levels, they remain high relative to historic levels. The following table sets forth the average prices incurred related to copper, gold, and silver during fiscal 2012, 2011, and 2010: Fiscal Measure 2012 2011 2010 Copper Lb. $ 3.90 $ 3.99 $ 3.15 Gold Troy oz. $ 1,599 $ 1,382 $ 1,114 Silver Troy oz. $ 34.30 $ 30.27 $ 17.91 In fiscal 2013, we expect to purchase copper, gold, and silver in quantities similar to fiscal 2012 levels. Foreign exchange. Approximately 54% of our net sales are invoiced in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Our results of operations are influenced by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. Dollar, compared to other currencies, will directly affect our reported results as we translate those currencies into U.S. Dollars at the end 36 Table of Contents of each fiscal period. The percentage of net sales in fiscal 2012 by major currencies invoiced was as follows: Currencies Percentage U.S. Dollar 46 % Euro 28 Japanese Yen 8 Chinese Renminbi 6 Korean Won 3 Brazilian Real 2 British Pound Sterling 2 All others 5 Total 100 % The following table sets forth certain items from our Consolidated Statements of Operations and the percentage of net sales that such items represent for the periods shown.

Net sales decreased $496 million, or 3.6%, to $13,282 million in fiscal 2012 from $13,778 million in fiscal 2011. On an organic basis, net sales decreased $372 million, or 2.7%, in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 primarily as a result of decreased net sales in the Communications and Industrial Solutions segment and, to a lesser degree, the Network Solutions segment. Foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted net sales by $338 million, or 2.4%, in fiscal 2012. Fiscal 2011 37 Table of Contents included an additional week which contributed $267 million in net sales. Deutsch, which was acquired on April 3, 2012, contributed net sales of $327 million during fiscal 2012. Also, the acquisition of ADC on December 8, 2010 resulted in incremental net sales of $154 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2012 over the same period of fiscal 2011. Net sales increased $2,097 million, or 18.0%, to $13,778 million in fiscal 2011 from $11,681 million in fiscal 2010. On an organic basis, net sales increased $736 million, or 6.3%, in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 due primarily to growth in the Transportation Solutions segment. Price erosion adversely affected organic sales by $192 million in fiscal 2011. Foreign currency exchange rates positively impacted net sales by $391 million, or 3.3%, in fiscal 2011. Fiscal 2011 included an additional week which contributed $267 million in net sales. ADC contributed net sales of $843 million, of which $24 million related to the additional week, during fiscal 2011. The divestitures of the mechatronics business and the Dulmison connectors and fittings product line in fiscal 2010 negatively impacted sales by $116 million in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010. See further discussion of organic net sales below under Results of Operations by Segment.

Included in Network Solutions is $24 million related to ADC. Gross Margin. In fiscal 2012, gross margin was $4,046 million, reflecting a $225 million decrease from gross margin of $4,271 million in fiscal 2011. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales decreased to 30.5% in fiscal 2012 from 31.0% in fiscal 2011. In fiscal 2012, gross margin included charges of $75 million associated with the amortization of acquisition-related fair value adjustments primarily related to acquired inventories and customer order backlog associated with Deutsch, whereas, in fiscal 2011, gross margin included similar charges of $39 million associated with ADC. Excluding these items, gross margin decreased in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011. The decrease resulted from lower sales levels and, to a lesser degree, increased material costs and unfavorable product mix, partially offset by improved manufacturing productivity. In fiscal 2011, gross margin was $4,271 million, reflecting a $628 million increase from gross margin of $3,643 million in fiscal 2010. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales decreased to 31.0% in fiscal 2011 as compared to 31.2% in fiscal 2010. In fiscal 2011, gross margin included charges of $39 million related to the acquisition of ADC. Excluding this item, gross margin increased in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010. The increase was due to higher sales levels and, to a lesser degree, improved manufacturing productivity and cost reduction benefits from restructuring actions, partially offset by increased material costs, price erosion, and unfavorable product mix. Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general, and administrative expenses decreased $43 million to $1,685 million in fiscal 2012 from $1,728 million in fiscal 2011. The decrease resulted primarily from cost control measures and benefits attributable to restructuring actions, partially offset by the additional selling, general, and administrative expenses of Deutsch. Selling, general, and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 12.7% in fiscal 2012 from 12.5% in fiscal 2011 primarily as a result of the decrease in sales. Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased $238 million in fiscal 2011 to $1,728 million from $1,490 million in fiscal 2010. The increase was related primarily to the additional selling, general, and administrative expenses of ADC and increased selling expenses to support higher sales levels. Selling, general, and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were 12.5% and 12.8% in fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively. Acquisition and Integration Costs. In connection with the acquisition of Deutsch, we incurred acquisition and integration costs of $27 million during fiscal 2012. In connection with the acquisition of ADC, we incurred acquisition and integration costs of $19 million and $8 million during fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively. 39 Table of Contents Restructuring and Other Charges, Net. Net restructuring and other charges were $128 million, $136 million, and $137 million in fiscal 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively. During fiscal 2012, we initiated several restructuring programs resulting in headcount reductions across all segments. Also, we initiated restructuring programs associated with the acquisition of Deutsch. Fiscal 2011 actions were primarily associated with the acquisition of ADC and related headcount reductions in the Network Solutions segment. Additionally, we increased reductions-in-force as a result of economic conditions, primarily in the Communications and Industrial Solutions segment. Fiscal 2010 actions primarily related to headcount reductions in the Transportation Solutions segment. Fiscal 2010 charges included a pre-tax loss on sale of $41 million in the Transportation Solutions segment related to the sale of our mechatronics business, as well as a long-lived asset impairment charge and a loss on sale totaling $13 million related to the divestiture of the Dulmison connectors and fittings product line, which was part of the energy business in the Network Solutions segment. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding net restructuring and other charges. Pre-separation Litigation Income. During fiscal 2010, Tyco International settled a class action lawsuit captioned Stumpf v. Tyco International Ltd., et al . Pursuant to the sharing formula in the Separation and Distribution Agreement, we recorded income of $7 million during fiscal 2010 relating to the release of excess reserves. There are no remaining securities lawsuits outstanding. Operating Income. Operating income was $1,518 million and $1,687 million in fiscal 2012 and 2011, respectively. Results for fiscal 2012 included $116 million of charges related to the acquisition of Deutsch, including $75 million of charges associated with the amortization of acquisition-related fair value adjustments primarily related to acquired inventories and customer order backlog, $27 million of acquisition and integration costs, and $14 million of net restructuring and other charges. The results for fiscal 2012 also included $114 million of additional restructuring and other charges. Results for fiscal 2011 included $138 million of charges related to the acquisition of ADC, including $80 million of restructuring and other charges, $39 million of charges associated with the amortization of acquisition-related fair value adjustments primarily related to acquired inventories and customer order backlog, and $19 million of acquisition and integration costs. The results for fiscal 2011 also included $56 million of additional restructuring and other charges and an additional week which contributed $52 million of operating income. Excluding these items, operating income decreased in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011. The decrease resulted from the unfavorable impacts of lower sales levels and, to a lesser degree, increased material costs and unfavorable product mix, partially offset by improved manufacturing productivity. Operating income was $1,687 million in fiscal 2011 compared to $1,452 million in fiscal 2010. Fiscal 2011 included an additional week which contributed $52 million of operating income. As discussed above, results for fiscal 2011 included $138 million of charges related to the acquisition of ADC. The results for fiscal 2011 also included $56 million of additional restructuring and other charges. Fiscal 2010 results included restructuring and other charges, acquisition and integration costs, and pre-separation litigation income of $134 million, $8 million, and $7 million, respectively. Excluding these items, operating income increased in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010. The increase resulted from higher sales levels and related gross margin and, to a lesser degree, a reduction in employee incentive compensation-related expense, cost reduction benefits from restructuring actions, and improved manufacturing productivity, partially offset by increased material costs, price erosion, and unfavorable product mix. 40 Table of Contents Non-Operating Items Interest Expense, Net Net interest expense was $153 million, $139 million, and $135 million in fiscal 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively. The increase of $14 million in fiscal 2012 from fiscal 2011 was due to higher average debt levels. Other Income, Net In fiscal 2012, 2011, and 2010, we recorded net other income of $50 million, $27 million, and $177 million, respectively, primarily consisting of income pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement with Tyco International and Covidien. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the Tax Sharing Agreement. The income in fiscal 2011 is net of other expense of $14 million recorded in connection with the completion of fieldwork and the settlement of certain U.S. tax matters. See additional information in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The income in fiscal 2010 reflects a net increase to the receivable from Tyco International and Covidien primarily related to certain proposed adjustments to prior period income tax returns and related accrued interest, partially offset by a decrease related to the completion of certain non-U.S. audits of prior year income tax returns. Income Taxes Our operations are conducted through our various subsidiaries in a number of countries throughout the world. We have provided for income taxes based upon the tax laws and rates in the countries in which our operations are conducted and income and loss from operations is subject to taxation. Our effective income tax rate was 17.6% for fiscal 2012 and reflects income tax benefits recognized in connection with profitability in certain entities operating in lower tax rate jurisdictions. In addition, the provision for fiscal 2012 reflects an income tax benefit of $107 million recognized in connection with a reduction in the valuation allowance associated with tax loss carryforwards in certain non-U.S. locations partially offset by accruals of interest related to uncertain tax positions. Our effective income tax rate was 22.0% for fiscal 2011 and reflects income tax benefits recognized in connection with profitability in certain entities operating in lower tax rate jurisdictions partially offset by accruals of interest related to uncertain tax positions. In addition, the effective income tax rate for fiscal 2011 reflects income tax benefits of $35 million associated with the completion of fieldwork and the settlement of certain U.S. tax matters. Our effective income tax rate was 31.9% for fiscal 2010 and reflects charges of $307 million primarily associated with certain proposed adjustments to prior year income tax returns and related accrued interest partially offset by income tax benefits of $101 million recognized in connection with the completion of certain non-U.S. audits of prior year income tax returns. In addition, the effective income tax rate for fiscal 2010 reflects an income tax benefit of $72 million recognized in connection with a reduction in the valuation allowance associated with tax loss carryforwards in certain non-U.S. locations. The valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of $1,719 million and $1,921 million at fiscal year end 2012 and 2011, respectively, relates principally to the uncertainty of the utilization of certain deferred tax assets, primarily tax loss, capital loss, and credit carryforwards in various jurisdictions. We believe that we will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the income tax benefits related to the remaining net deferred tax assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The valuation allowance 41 Table of Contents was calculated in accordance with the provisions of ASC 740 which require that a valuation allowance be established or maintained when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. The calculation of our tax liabilities includes estimates for uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations across multiple global jurisdictions where we conduct our operations. Under the uncertain tax position provisions of ASC 740, we recognize liabilities for tax and related interest for issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and related interest will be due. These tax liabilities and related interest are reflected net of the impact of related tax loss carryforwards as such tax loss carryforwards will be applied against these tax liabilities and will reduce the amount of cash tax payments due upon the eventual settlement with the tax authorities. These estimates may change due to changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a settlement that differs from our current estimate of the tax liabilities and related interest. Further, management has reviewed with tax counsel the issues raised by certain taxing authorities and the adequacy of these recorded amounts. If our current estimate of tax and interest liabilities is less than the ultimate settlement, an additional charge to income tax expense may result. If our current estimate of tax and interest liabilities is more than the ultimate settlement, income tax benefits may be recognized. We have provided income taxes for earnings that are currently distributed as well as the taxes associated with several subsidiaries' earnings that are expected to be distributed in fiscal 2013. No additional provision has been made for U.S. or non-U.S. income taxes on the undistributed earnings of subsidiaries or for unrecognized deferred tax liabilities for temporary differences related to basis differences in investments in subsidiaries, as such earnings are expected to be permanently reinvested, the investments are essentially permanent in duration, or we have concluded that no additional tax liability will arise as a result of the distribution of such earnings. As of September 28, 2012, certain subsidiaries had approximately $18 billion of undistributed earnings that we intend to permanently reinvest. A liability could arise if our intention to permanently reinvest such earnings were to change and amounts are distributed by such subsidiaries or if such subsidiaries are ultimately disposed. It is not practicable to estimate the additional income taxes related to permanently reinvested earnings or the basis differences related to investments in subsidiaries. Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations, Net of Income Taxes During fiscal 2012, we sold our Touch Solutions business for net cash proceeds of $380 million, subject to working capital adjustments, of which we received $370 million during fiscal 2012. We recognized a pre-tax gain of $5 million on the transaction. The agreement includes contingent earn-out provisions through 2015 based on business performance. In connection with the divestiture, we incurred an income tax charge of $65 million, which is included in income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of income taxes on the Consolidated Statement of Operations, primarily as a result of being unable to realize a tax benefit from the write-off of goodwill at the time of the sale. We expect to make tax payments of approximately $10 million associated with this divestiture. During fiscal 2012, we sold our TE Professional Services business for net cash proceeds of $28 million, of which we received $24 million during fiscal 2012, and recognized a pre-tax gain of $2 million on the transaction. Additionally, during fiscal 2012, we recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $28 million, which is included in income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of income taxes on the Consolidated Statement of Operations, to write the carrying value of this business down to its estimated fair value less costs to sell. On December 27, 2011, the New York Court of Claims entered judgment in our favor in the amount of $25 million, payment of which was received in fiscal 2012, in connection with our former Wireless Systems business's State of New York contract. This judgment resolved all outstanding issues 42 Table of Contents between the parties in this matter. This partial recovery of a previously recognized loss, net of legal fees, is reflected in income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of income taxes on the Consolidated Statement of Operations for fiscal 2012. In fiscal 2010, we recorded income from discontinued operations of $44 million primarily in connection with the favorable resolution of certain litigation contingencies related to the Printed Circuit Group business which was sold in fiscal 2007. The Touch Solutions, TE Professional Services, Wireless Systems, and Printed Circuit Group businesses met the held for sale and discontinued operations criteria and have been included as such in all periods presented on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Prior to reclassification to discontinued operations, the Touch Solutions and TE Professional Services businesses were included in the Communications and Industrial Solutions and Network Solutions segments, respectively. The Wireless Systems business was a component of the former Wireless Systems segment, and the Printed Circuit Group business was a component of the former Other segment. See Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding discontinued operations.

Fiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011 Transportation Solutions' net sales increased $378 million, or 6.7%, to $6,007 million in fiscal 2012 from $5,629 million in fiscal 2011. Organic net sales increased by $360 million, or 6.4%, in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011. The weakening of certain foreign currencies negatively affected net sales by $197 million, or 3.5%, in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011. Fiscal 2011 included an additional week which contributed approximately $112 million in net sales. Deutsch contributed net sales of $327 million during fiscal 2012. In the automotive end market, our organic net sales increased 6.5% in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011. The increase was due primarily to growth of 15.1% in the Asia-Pacific region and 11.1% in the Americas region, partially offset by declines of 1.2% in the EMEA region. Growth in the Asia-Pacific region resulted from higher automotive production and continued recovery following the earthquake in Japan. We estimate that the earthquake in Japan negatively impacted our sales in the automotive end market by $38 million in fiscal 2011. In the Americas region, growth resulted from increased production in North America, partially offset by weakness in South America. In the EMEA region, production levels decreased as a result of financial uncertainty in Europe. In the aerospace, defense, and marine end market, our organic net sales increased 5.6% in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011. The increase was attributable to increased production in the commercial aviation market, and growth in the marine market resulting from share gains and increased oil and gas exploration driven by increased crude oil prices. Transportation Solutions' operating income of $847 million in fiscal 2012 was flat compared to fiscal 2011. Segment results for fiscal 2012 included $116 million of charges related to the acquisition of Deutsch, including $75 million of charges associated with the amortization of acquisition-related fair value adjustments primarily related to acquired inventories and customer order backlog, $27 million of acquisition and integration costs, and $14 million of restructuring and other charges. Segment results also included $16 million of net charges and $14 million of net credits to restructuring and other charges (credits) in fiscal 2012 and 2011, respectively. Excluding these items, operating income increased in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011. The increase resulted primarily from the favorable impacts of higher volume and pricing actions, partially offset by unfavorable product mix. 44 Table of Contents Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010 Transportation Solutions' net sales increased $830 million, or 17.3%, to $5,629 million in fiscal 2011 from $4,799 million in fiscal 2010 due primarily to an increase of $751 million in the automotive end market. Organic net sales increased by $621 million, or 13.0%, in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010. The strengthening of certain foreign currencies positively affected net sales by $179 million, or 3.7%, in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010. Fiscal 2011 included an additional week which contributed approximately $112 million in net sales. The divestiture of the mechatronics business in fiscal 2010 negatively impacted sales by $82 million in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010. In the automotive end market, our organic net sales growth was 13.5% in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010. The increase was attributable to growth of 17.9% in the EMEA region, 14.4% in the Americas region, and 7.7% in the Asia-Pacific region. Growth in the EMEA and Americas regions resulted from higher automotive production and increased content per vehicle. Growth in the Asia-Pacific region was negatively impacted by the earthquake in Japan. We estimate that the earthquake in Japan negatively impacted our sales in the automotive end market by $38 million in fiscal 2011. In the aerospace, defense, and marine end market, our organic net sales increased 9.5% in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010, primarily as a result of increased demand from commercial aircraft builders as they continue to increase production and growth in the marine market as a result of increased oil and gas exploration driven by increasing crude oil prices. Transportation Solutions' operating income increased $333 million to $848 million in fiscal 2011 from $515 million in fiscal 2010. Segment results included $14 million of net credits and $94 million of net charges to restructuring and other charges (credits) in fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively. Excluding these items, operating income increased in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010. The increase was due to favorable impacts of higher volume and improved manufacturing productivity, partially offset by increases in material costs and price erosion.

The weakening of certain foreign currencies negatively affected net sales by $40 million, or 0.9%, in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011. Fiscal 2011 included an additional week which contributed approximately $83 million in net sales. In the industrial end market, our organic net sales decreased 14.9% in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 due to market weakness across all regions. In the consumer devices end market, our organic net sales decreased 6.5% in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 as a result of weaker demand in the personal computer and consumer electronics markets, partially offset by strong demand in the tablet computer market and increased demand in the mobile phone market. In the data communications end market, our organic net sales decreased 15.9% in fiscal 2012 from fiscal 2011 as a result of market softness, primarily in the Asia-Pacific region, and inventory reductions in the supply chain. In the appliance end market, our organic net sales decreased 8.1% in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 due primarily to weakness in the Asia-Pacific and EMEA regions, resulting from lower demand and inventory reductions in the supply chain, partially offset by growth in demand in the Americas region. Communications and Industrial Solutions' operating income decreased $178 million to $337 million in fiscal 2012 from $515 million in fiscal 2011. Segment results included restructuring and other charges of $58 million and $65 million in fiscal 2012 and 2011, respectively. Excluding these items, operating income decreased in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011. The decrease resulted from the unfavorable impacts of lower volume and increased materials costs, partially offset by improved manufacturing productivity. Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010 Communications and Industrial Solutions' net sales increased $227 million, or 5.1%, to $4,658 million in fiscal 2011 as compared to $4,431 million in fiscal 2010.

The strengthening of certain foreign currencies positively affected net sales by $127 million, or 2.7%, in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010. Fiscal 2011 included an 46 Table of Contents additional week which contributed approximately $83 million in net sales. The divestiture of the mechatronics business in fiscal 2010 negatively impacted sales by $22 million in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010. In the industrial end market, our organic net sales increased 6.9% in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 due primarily to strong growth in the industrial machinery market, particularly in the EMEA region, as well as growth in the commercial and building and factory automation markets. In the consumer devices end market, our organic net sales decreased 7.9% in fiscal 2011 from fiscal 2010 levels due to weaker demand in the mobile phone and consumer electronics markets driven by our platform position, the negative impact of the earthquake in Japan, and soft demand in the personal computer market, partially offset by growth in the tablet computer market. In the data communications end market, our organic net sales increased 2.6% in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 due to strength in sales in the server, data storage, and wireless markets, particularly in the EMEA region. In the appliance end market, our organic net sales growth of 3.6% in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 was due to continued consumer demand in the EMEA region, partially offset by decreases in the Americas region. In fiscal 2011, Communications and Industrial Solutions' operating income decreased $103 million to $515 million from $618 million in fiscal 2010. Segment results included net restructuring and other charges of $65 million and $20 million during fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively. Excluding these items, operating income decreased in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010.

Fiscal 2011 included an additional week which contributed approximately $72 million in net sales. The acquisition of ADC on December 8, 2010 resulted in incremental net sales of $154 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2012 over the same period of fiscal 2011, as ADC contributed net sales of $198 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2012 as compared to $44 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2011. In the telecom networks end market, our organic net sales decreased 8.2% in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 due primarily to decreased capital investments by major carriers in the telecommunications industry, particularly in the Americas and EMEA regions. In the energy end market, our organic net sales increased 1.5% in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 as a result of growth in the Americas and Asia-Pacific regions. In the enterprise networks end market, our organic net sales were flat in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 levels as declines resulting from softness in the office networks were offset by increases resulting from continued data center investments. The subsea communications end market's organic net sales decreased 15.8% in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 as a result of lower levels of project activity. In fiscal 2012, Network Solutions' operating income increased $10 million to $334 million from $324 million in fiscal 2011. Segment results for fiscal 2012 included $40 million of restructuring and other charges. Segment results for fiscal 2011 included $138 million of charges related to the acquisition of ADC, including $80 million of restructuring and other charges, $39 million of charges associated with the amortization of acquisition-related fair value adjustments primarily related to acquired inventories and customer order backlog, and $19 million of acquisition and integration costs. Segment results for fiscal 2011 also included additional restructuring and other charges of $5 million. Excluding these items, operating income decreased in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011. The decrease was attributable to the unfavorable impact of lower volume, unfavorable product mix, and price erosion, partially offset by improved manufacturing productivity. 48 Table of Contents Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010 In fiscal 2011, Network Solutions' net sales increased $1,040 million, or 42.4%, to $3,491 million from $2,451 million in fiscal 2010. Organic net sales increased $76 million, or 3.3%, in fiscal 2011 from fiscal 2010. The strengthening of certain foreign currencies positively impacted net sales by $85 million, or 3.3%, in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010. Fiscal 2011 included an additional week which contributed approximately $72 million in net sales. The acquisition of ADC increased sales by $843 million, of which $24 million is related to the additional week, during fiscal 2011. The divestiture of the Dulmison connectors and fittings product line in fiscal 2010 negatively impacted sales by $12 million in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010. In the telecom networks end market, our organic net sales increase of 22.6% in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 was largely due to increased fiber network investment by telecommunications companies, particularly in the EMEA and South America regions. In the energy end market, our organic net sales increased 11.4% in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 due primarily to a continuing strong recovery across all regions. In the enterprise networks end market, our organic net sales increased 9.7% in fiscal 2011 from fiscal 2010 levels as a result of increased data center investment in the EMEA region, particularly in India, and the Asia-Pacific region. The subsea communications end market's organic net sales decreased 21.4% in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 as a result of lower levels of project activity. Network Solutions' operating income increased $12 million to $324 million in fiscal 2011 from $312 million in fiscal 2010. As discussed above, during fiscal 2011, segment results included $138 million of charges related to the acquisition of ADC. Segment results also included additional net restructuring and other charges of $5 million in fiscal 2011. In fiscal 2010, segment results included $20 million of net restructuring and other charges and $8 million of acquisition and integration costs. Excluding these items, operating income increased in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010. The increase resulted from higher volume, partially offset by unfavorable product mix, price erosion, and increased material costs. New Segment Structure Effective for Fiscal 2013 Effective for the first quarter of fiscal 2013, we reorganized our management and segments to better align the organization around our strategy. We expect the realignment to enable us to better meet our customers' needs and optimize our efficiency. Our businesses in the former Communications and Industrial Solutions segment have been moved into other segments. Also, the Aerospace, Defense, and Marine and Energy businesses, formerly included in the Transportation Solutions and Network Solutions segments, respectively, have been moved to the newly created Industrial Solutions segment. The following represents the new segment structure: Transportation Solutions This segment consists of our Automotive business. Industrial Solutions This segment contains our Industrial, Aerospace, Defense, and Marine, and Energy businesses. Consumer Solutions Our Consumer Devices and Appliances businesses are included in this segment. Network Solutions Telecom Networks, Enterprise Networks, Data Communications, and Subsea Communications businesses are presented in this segment. In this Annual Report, results for fiscal 2012 and prior periods are reported on the basis under which we managed our business in fiscal 2012 and do not reflect the fiscal 2013 segment reorganization. 49 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Our ability to fund our future capital needs will be affected by our ability to continue to generate cash from operations and may be affected by our ability to access the capital markets, money markets, or other sources of funding, as well as the capacity and terms of our financing arrangements. We believe that cash generated from operations and, to the extent necessary, these other sources of potential funding will be sufficient to meet our anticipated capital needs for the foreseeable future. Payment of our 6.00% senior notes due in October 2012 was made subsequent to fiscal year end 2012. We may use excess cash to reduce our outstanding debt, including through the possible repurchase of our debt in accordance with applicable law, to purchase a portion of our common shares pursuant to our authorized share repurchase program, to pay distributions or dividends on our common shares, or to acquire strategic businesses or product lines. The cost or availability of future funding may be impacted by financial market conditions. We will continue to monitor financial markets, to respond as necessary to changing conditions. As of September 28, 2012, our cash and cash equivalents were held principally in subsidiaries which are located throughout the world. Under current laws, substantially all of these amounts can be repatriated to Tyco Electronics Group S.A. ("TEGSA"), our Luxembourg subsidiary, which is the obligor of substantially all of our debt, and to TE Connectivity Ltd., our Swiss parent company; however, the repatriation of these amounts could subject us to additional tax costs. We provide for tax liabilities in our financial statements with respect to amounts that we expect to repatriate; however, no tax liabilities are recorded for amounts that we consider to be permanently reinvested outside Switzerland (approximately $18 billion as of September 28, 2012). Our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate earnings that are designated as permanently reinvested in order to fund our operations, including investing and financing activities. Cash Flows from Operating Activities Net cash provided by continuing operating activities was $1,888 million in fiscal 2012 as compared to $1,722 million in fiscal 2011. The increase of $166 million in fiscal 2012 over fiscal 2011 resulted primarily from improved working capital, partially offset by lower income levels. Net cash provided by continuing operating activities was $1,722 million in fiscal 2011 as compared to $1,603 million in fiscal 2010. The increase of $119 million in fiscal 2011 over fiscal 2010 primarily resulted from higher income levels, partially offset by a reduction of accrued and other current liabilities related to employee compensation-related payments, higher income taxes paid, and payments for pre-separation tax matters. Pension and postretirement benefit contributions in fiscal 2012, 2011, and 2010 were $98 million, $90 million, and $180 million, respectively. Fiscal 2010 included $69 million of voluntary pension contributions; there were no voluntary contributions in fiscal 2012 or 2011. We expect pension and postretirement benefit contributions to be $103 million in fiscal 2013, before consideration of voluntary contributions. The amount of income taxes paid, net of refunds, during fiscal 2012, 2011, and 2010 was $290 million, $299 million, and $156 million, respectively. In fiscal 2012, cash payments included $70 million for tax deficiencies related to U.S. tax matters for the years 1997 through 2000. Also during fiscal 2012, we received net reimbursements of $51 million from Tyco International and Covidien pursuant to their indemnifications for pre-separation U.S. tax matters. We expect to make additional net cash payments of approximately $26 million over the next twelve months related to these matters. These amounts include payments in which we are the primary obligor to the taxing authorities and for which we expect a portion to be reimbursed by Tyco International and Covidien under the Tax Sharing Agreement as well as indemnification payments to 50 Table of Contents Tyco International and Covidien under the Tax Sharing Agreement for tax matters where they are the primary obligor to the taxing authorities. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to pre-separation tax matters. In fiscal 2011, cash payments related to pre-separation tax matters were $129 million, net of indemnification payments under the Tax Sharing Agreement. In addition to net cash provided by operating activities, we use free cash flow as a useful measure of our performance and ability to generate cash. Free cash flow was $1,434 million in fiscal 2012 as compared to $1,342 million in fiscal 2011 and $1,333 million in fiscal 2010. The increase in free cash flow in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 was primarily driven by improved working capital, as adjusted for net payments for pre-separation tax matters of $19 million and certain Deutsch acquisition-related payments totaling $37 million, partially offset by lower income levels. The increase in free cash flow in fiscal 2011 from fiscal 2010 was primarily driven by higher income levels partially offset by lower working capital levels, as adjusted for net payments for pre-separation tax matters of $129 million, and increases in capital expenditures. The following table sets forth a reconciliation of net cash provided by continuing operating activities, the most comparable GAAP financial measure, to free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure: Fiscal 2012 2011 2010 (in millions) Net cash provided by continuing operating activities $ 1,888 $ 1,722 $ 1,603 Capital expenditures (533 ) (574 ) (380 ) Proceeds from sale of property, plant, and equipment 23 65 16 Payments related to pre-separation tax matters, net 19 129 Payments related to accrued interest on debt assumed in the acquisition of Deutsch 17 Payments to settle acquisition-related foreign currency derivative contracts 20 Pre-separation litigation payments 25 Voluntary pension contributions 69 Free cash flow $ 1,434 $ 1,342 $ 1,333 Cash Flows from Investing Activities We continue to fund capital expenditures to support new programs and to invest in machinery and our manufacturing facilities to further enhance productivity and manufacturing capabilities. Capital spending decreased $41 million in fiscal 2012 to $533 million as compared to $574 million in fiscal 2011. Capital spending was $380 million in fiscal 2010. We expect fiscal 2013 capital spending levels to be approximately 4-5% of net sales. During fiscal 2012, we acquired Deutsch. The total value paid for the transaction amounted to 1.55 billion (approximately $2.05 billion using an exchange rate of $1.33 per 1.00), net of cash acquired of $152 million. The total value paid included $659 million of debt assumed, including accrued interest, and paid off in its entirety shortly after the completion of the acquisition. During fiscal 2011, we acquired ADC for a total purchase price of approximately $1,263 million in cash (excluding cash acquired of $546 million) and $22 million of other non-cash consideration. Short-term investments acquired in connection with the acquisition of ADC were sold for proceeds of $155 million in fiscal 2011. Certain other assets acquired in connection with the acquisition of ADC 51 Table of Contents were sold for net proceeds of $111 million, of which approximately $106 million was received in fiscal 2011. We also acquired another business for $14 million in cash in fiscal 2011. During fiscal 2010, we acquired two businesses for $38 million in cash. Also during fiscal 2010, we paid cash of $55 million to acquire a business that was sold in fiscal 2012 as part of the divestiture of the Touch Solutions business. Cash Flows from Financing Activities and Capitalization Total debt at fiscal year end 2012 and 2011 was $3,711 million and $2,667 million, respectively. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding debt. In February 2012, TEGSA, our wholly-owned subsidiary, issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of 1.60% senior notes due February 3, 2015 and $500 million aggregate principal amount of 3.50% senior notes due February 3, 2022. The notes were offered and sold pursuant to an effective registration statement on Form S-3 filed on January 21, 2011. Interest on the notes is payable semi-annually on February 3 and August 3 of each year, beginning August 3, 2012. The notes are TEGSA's unsecured senior obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all existing and any future senior indebtedness of TEGSA and senior to any subordinated indebtedness that TEGSA may incur. The notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed as to payment on an unsecured senior basis by TE Connectivity Ltd. Net proceeds from the issuance of the notes due 2015 and 2022, were approximately $250 million and $498 million, respectively. In connection with the issuance of the senior notes in February 2012, the commitments of the lenders under a $700 million 364-day credit agreement, dated as of December 20, 2011, automatically terminated. On June 24, 2011, TEGSA entered into a five-year unsecured senior revolving credit facility ("Credit Facility"), with total commitments of $1,500 million. TEGSA had no borrowings under the Credit Facility at September 28, 2012 and September 30, 2011. Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at the option of TEGSA, (1) the London interbank offered rate ("LIBOR") plus an applicable margin based upon the senior, unsecured, long-term debt rating of TEGSA, or (2) an alternate base rate equal to the highest of (i) Deutsche Bank AG New York branch's base rate, (ii) the federal funds effective rate plus 1 / 2 of 1%, and (iii) one-month LIBOR plus 1%, plus, in each case, an applicable margin based upon the senior, unsecured, long-term debt rating of TEGSA. TEGSA is required to pay an annual facility fee ranging from 12.5 to 30.0 basis points based upon the amount of the lenders' commitments under the Credit Facility and the applicable credit ratings of TEGSA. The Credit Facility contains a financial ratio covenant providing that if, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, our ratio of Consolidated Total Debt (as defined in the Credit Facility) to Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Facility) for the then most recently concluded period of four consecutive fiscal quarters exceeds 3.5 to 1.0, an Event of Default (as defined in the Credit Facility) is triggered. The Credit Facility and our other debt agreements contain other customary covenants. None of our covenants are presently considered restrictive to our operations. As of September 28, 2012, we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants and believe that we will continue to be in compliance with our existing covenants for the foreseeable future. In December 2010, TEGSA issued $250 million principal amount of 4.875% senior notes due January 15, 2021. The notes were offered and sold pursuant to an effective registration statement on Form S-3 filed on July 1, 2008, as amended on June 26, 2009. Interest on the notes accrues from the issuance date at a rate of 4.875% per year and is payable semi-annually on January 15 and July 15 of each year, beginning July 15, 2011. The notes are TEGSA's unsecured senior obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all existing and any future senior indebtedness of TEGSA and senior to any subordinated indebtedness that TEGSA may incur. The notes are fully and unconditionally 52 Table of Contents guaranteed as to payment on an unsecured senior basis by TE Connectivity Ltd. Net proceeds from the issuance were approximately $249 million. In December 2010, in connection with the acquisition of ADC, we assumed $653 million of convertible subordinated notes due 2013, 2015, and 2017. Under the terms of the indentures governing these convertible subordinated notes, following the acquisition of ADC, the right to convert the notes into shares of ADC common stock changed to the right to convert the notes into cash. See Note 5 for more information on the ADC acquisition. In fiscal 2011, our ADC subsidiary commenced offers to purchase the convertible subordinated notes at par plus accrued interest, pursuant to the terms of the indentures for the notes. During fiscal 2011, $198 million principal amount of the convertible subordinated notes due 2013, $136 million principal amount of the convertible subordinated notes due 2015, and $225 million principal amount of the convertible subordinated notes due 2017 were purchased for an aggregate purchase price of $560 million. All of the purchased convertible subordinated notes have been cancelled. Our debt balance at fiscal year end 2012 included the remaining $90 million of 3.50% convertible subordinated notes due 2015 and $1 million of floating rate convertible subordinated notes due 2013. Periodically, TEGSA issues commercial paper to U.S. institutional accredited investors and qualified institutional buyers in accordance with available exemptions from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 as part of our ongoing effort to maintain financial flexibility and to potentially decrease the cost of borrowings. Borrowings under the commercial paper program are backed by the Credit Facility. As of fiscal year end 2012, TEGSA had $300 million of commercial paper outstanding at a weighted-average interest rate of 0.40%. TEGSA had no commercial paper outstanding at fiscal year end 2011. TEGSA's payment obligations under its senior notes, commercial paper, and Credit Facility are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by TE Connectivity Ltd. Neither TE Connectivity Ltd. nor any of its subsidiaries provides a guarantee as to payment obligations under the 3.50% convertible subordinated notes due 2015 and other notes issued by ADC prior to its acquisition in December 2010. Payments of common share dividends and cash distributions to shareholders were $332 million, $296 million, and $289 million in fiscal 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively. In October 2009, our shareholders approved a cash distribution to shareholders in the form of a capital reduction to the par value of our common shares of CHF 0.34 (equivalent to $0.32) per share, payable in two equal installments in the first and second quarters of fiscal 2010. We paid the first and second installments of the distribution at a rate of $0.16 per share during each of the quarters ended December 25, 2009 and March 26, 2010. These capital reductions reduced the par value of our common shares from CHF 2.43 (equivalent to $2.24) to CHF 2.09 (equivalent to $1.92). In March 2010, our shareholders approved a cash distribution to shareholders in the form of a capital reduction to the par value of our common shares of CHF 0.72 (equivalent to $0.64) per share, payable in four equal quarterly installments beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2010 through the second quarter of fiscal 2011. We paid the installments of the distribution at a rate of $0.16 per share during each of the quarters ended June 25, 2010, September 24, 2010, December 24, 2010, and March 25, 2011. These capital reductions reduced the par value of our common shares from CHF 2.09 (equivalent to $1.92) to CHF 1.37 (equivalent to $1.28). In March 2011, our shareholders approved a dividend payment to shareholders of CHF 0.68 (equivalent to $0.72) per share out of contributed surplus, payable in four equal quarterly installments beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2011 through the second quarter of fiscal 2012. We paid the installments of the dividend at a rate of $0.18 per share during each of the quarters ended June 24, 2011, September 30, 2011, December 30, 2011, and March 30, 2012. 53 Table of Contents In March 2012, our shareholders approved a cash distribution to shareholders in the form of a capital reduction to the par value of our common shares of CHF 0.80 (equivalent to $0.84) per share, payable in four equal quarterly installments beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2012 through the second quarter of fiscal 2013. We paid the first and second installments of the distribution at a rate of $0.21 per share during each of the quarters ended June 29, 2012 and September 28, 2012. These capital reductions reduced the par value of our common shares from CHF 1.37 (equivalent to $1.28) to CHF 0.97 (equivalent to $0.86). Contributed surplus established for Swiss tax and statutory purposes ("Swiss Contributed Surplus"), subject to certain conditions, is a freely distributable reserve. Under Swiss law, subject to certain conditions, distributions to shareholders made in the form of a reduction of registered share capital or from reserves from capital contributions (equivalent to Swiss Contributed Surplus) are exempt from Swiss withholding tax. During fiscal 2012, we received a favorable outcome from the Swiss tax authorities related to the classification of Swiss Contributed Surplus that confirms our presentation of Swiss Contributed Surplus as a free reserve on our statutory Swiss balance sheet. As of September 28, 2012 and September 30, 2011, Swiss Contributed Surplus was $8,940 million (equivalent to CHF 9,745 million). During fiscal 2011, our board of directors authorized a $2,250 million increase in the share repurchase authorization. We repurchased approximately 6 million of our common shares for $194 million, approximately 25 million of our common shares for $867 million, and approximately 18 million of our common shares for $488 million during fiscal 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively. At September 28, 2012, we had $1,307 million of availability remaining under our share repurchase authorization. Commitments and Contingencies The following table provides a summary of our contractual obligations and commitments for debt, minimum lease payment obligations under non-cancelable leases, and other obligations at fiscal year end 2012: Payments Due by Fiscal Year Total 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 Thereafter (in millions) Long-term debt, including current maturities $ 3,711 $ 1,015 $ 377 $ 340 $ $ $ 1,979 Interest on long-term debt (1) 1,464 160 128 115 110 110 841 Operating leases 448 123 97 75 46 34 73 Purchase obligations (2) 127 124 3 Total contractual cash obligations (3)(4)(5) $ 5,750 $ 1,422 $ 605 $ 530 $ 156 $ 144 $ 2,893 (1) Interest payments exclude the impact of our interest rate swaps. (2) Purchase obligations consist of commitments for purchases of goods and services. (3) The table above does not reflect unrecognized tax benefits of $1,795 million and related accrued interest and penalties of $1,335 million, the timing of which is uncertain. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding unrecognized tax benefits, interest, and penalties. (4) The table above does not reflect pension and postretirement benefit obligations to certain employees and former employees. We are obligated to make contributions to our pension plans and postretirement benefit plans; however, we are unable to determine the amount of plan contributions due to the inherent uncertainties of obligations of this type, including timing, interest rate charges, investment performance, and amounts of benefit payments. We expect to contribute $103 million to pension and postretirement benefit plans in fiscal 2013, before consideration of voluntary contributions. 54 Table of Contents These plans and our estimates of future contributions and benefit payments are more fully described in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. (5) Other long-term liabilities of $517 million, of which $227 million related to our ASC 460 guarantee liabilities, are excluded from the table above as we are unable to estimate the timing of payment for these items. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding ASC 460. Income Tax Matters In connection with the separation, we entered into a Tax Sharing Agreement that generally governs our, Covidien's, and Tyco International's respective rights, responsibilities, and obligations after the distribution with respect to taxes, including ordinary course of business taxes and taxes, if any, incurred as a result of any failure of the distribution of all of our shares or the shares of Covidien to qualify as a tax-free distribution for U.S. federal income tax purposes within the meaning of Section 355 of the Code or certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the spin-offs to qualify for tax-favored treatment under the Code. Pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement, upon separation, we entered into certain guarantee commitments and indemnifications with Tyco International and Covidien. Under the Tax Sharing Agreement, we, Tyco International, and Covidien share 31%, 27%, and 42%, respectively, of certain contingent liabilities relating to unresolved pre-separation tax matters of Tyco International. The effect of the Tax Sharing Agreement is to indemnify us for 69% of certain liabilities settled in cash by us with respect to unresolved pre-separation tax matters. Pursuant to that indemnification, we have made similar indemnifications to Tyco International and Covidien with respect to 31% of certain liabilities settled in cash by the companies relating to unresolved pre-separation tax matters. If any of the companies responsible for all or a portion of such liabilities were to default in its payment of costs or expenses related to any such liability, we would be responsible for a portion of the defaulting party or parties' obligation. We are responsible for all of our own taxes that are not shared pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement's sharing formula. In addition, Tyco International and Covidien are responsible for their tax liabilities that are not subject to the Tax Sharing Agreement's sharing formula. Prior to separation, certain of our subsidiaries filed combined income tax returns with Tyco International. Those and other of our subsidiaries' income tax returns are periodically examined by various tax authorities. In connection with these examinations, tax authorities, including the IRS, have raised issues and proposed tax adjustments. Tyco International, as the U.S. income tax audit controlling party under the Tax Sharing Agreement, is reviewing and contesting certain of the proposed tax adjustments. Amounts related to these tax adjustments and other tax contingencies and related interest that management has assessed under the uncertain tax position provisions of ASC 740, which relate specifically to our entities have been recorded on the Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, we may be required to fund portions of Covidien and Tyco International's tax obligations. Estimates about these guarantees have also been recognized on the Consolidated Financial Statements. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. During fiscal 2007, the IRS concluded its field examination of certain of Tyco International's U.S. federal income tax returns for the years 1997 through 2000 and issued Revenue Agent Reports which reflect the IRS' determination of proposed tax adjustments for the 1997 through 2000 period. Additionally, the IRS proposed civil fraud penalties against Tyco International arising from alleged actions of former executives in connection with certain intercompany transfers of stock in 1998 and 1999. The penalties were asserted against a prior subsidiary of Tyco International that was distributed to us in connection with the separation. Tyco International appealed certain of the proposed adjustments for the years 1997 through 2000, and Tyco International has now resolved all but one of the matters associated with the proposed tax adjustments, including reaching an agreement with the IRS on the penalty adjustment. In October 2012, the IRS issued special agreement Forms 870-AD concluding its audit of all tax matters for the period 1997 through 2000, excluding one issue that remains in dispute as described below. 55 Table of Contents The disputed issue involves the tax treatment of certain intercompany debt transactions. The IRS has asserted that certain intercompany loans originating during the period 1997 through 2000 did not constitute debt for U.S. federal income tax purposes and has disallowed related interest deductions recognized on Tyco International's U.S. income tax returns during the period. Tyco International contends that the intercompany financing qualified as debt for U.S. tax purposes and that the interest deductions reflected on the income tax returns are appropriate. The IRS and Tyco International remain unable to resolve this matter through the IRS appeals process. We understand that Tyco International expects to receive statutory notices of deficiency from the IRS early in our fiscal 2013. Upon receipt of these statutory notices, we expect that Tyco International will commence litigation of this matter with the IRS in U.S. federal court. Based upon relevant facts surrounding the intercompany debt transactions, relevant tax regulations, and applicable case law, we believe that we are adequately reserved for this matter. However, the ultimate outcome is uncertain and if the IRS were to prevail on its assertions, our share of the assessed tax, deficiency interest, and applicable withholding taxes and penalties could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position. In fiscal 2012, we made payments of $70 million for tax deficiencies related to undisputed tax adjustments for the years 1997 through 2000. Concurrent with remitting these payments, we were reimbursed $51 million from Tyco International and Covidien pursuant to their indemnifications for pre-separation tax matters. Over the next twelve months, we expect to pay approximately $26 million, inclusive of related indemnification payments, in connection with these pre-separation tax matters. During fiscal 2011, the IRS completed its field examination of certain Tyco International income tax returns for the years 2001 through 2004, issued Revenue Agent Reports which reflect the IRS' determination of proposed tax adjustments for the 2001 through 2004 period, and issued certain notices of deficiency. As a result of the completion of fieldwork and the settlement of certain tax matters in fiscal 2011, we recognized income tax benefits of $35 million and other expense of $14 million pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement. Also, in fiscal 2011, we made net cash payments of $154 million related to pre-separation deficiencies. Tyco International's income tax returns for the years 2001 through 2004 remain subject to adjustment by the IRS upon ultimate resolution of the disputed issue involving certain intercompany loans originated during the period 1997 through 2000. The IRS commenced its audit of certain Tyco International income tax returns for the years 2005 through 2007 in fiscal 2011. During fiscal 2012, the IRS commenced its audit of our income tax returns for the years 2008 through 2010. At September 28, 2012 and September 30, 2011, we have reflected $71 million and $232 million, respectively, of income tax liabilities related to the audits of Tyco International's and our income tax returns in accrued and other current liabilities as certain of these matters could be resolved within the next twelve months. We continue to believe that the amounts recorded on our Consolidated Financial Statements relating to the matters discussed above are appropriate. However, the ultimate resolution is uncertain and could result in a material impact to our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. Legal Matters In the ordinary course of business, we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims, including patent infringement claims, product liability matters, employment disputes, disputes on agreements, other commercial disputes, environmental matters, antitrust claims, and tax matters, including non-income tax matters such as value added tax, sales and use tax, real estate tax, and transfer tax. Management believes that these legal proceedings and claims likely will be resolved over an extended period of time. Although it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these proceedings, 56 Table of Contents based upon our experience, current information, and applicable law, we do not expect that the outcome of these proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. See "Part I. Item 3. Legal Proceedings" and Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding legal proceedings. At September 28, 2012, we had a contingent purchase price commitment of $80 million related to our fiscal 2001 acquisition of Com-Net. This represents the maximum amount payable to the former shareholders of Com-Net only after the construction and installation of a communications system for the State of Florida was completed and approved by the State of Florida in accordance with guidelines set forth in the contract. Under the terms of the purchase and sale agreement, we do not believe we have any obligation to the sellers. However, the sellers have contested our position and initiated a lawsuit in June 2006 in the Court of Common Pleas in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, which is in the discovery phase. A liability for this contingency has not been recorded on the Consolidated Financial Statements as we do not believe that any payment is probable or reasonably estimable at this time. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Certain of our segments have guaranteed the performance of third parties and provided financial guarantees for uncompleted work and financial commitments. The terms of these guarantees vary with end dates ranging from fiscal 2013 through the completion of such transactions. The guarantees would be triggered in the event of nonperformance, and the potential exposure for nonperformance under the guarantees would not have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. In disposing of assets or businesses, we often provide representations, warranties, and/or indemnities to cover various risks including unknown damage to assets, environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate, liability for investigation and remediation of environmental contamination at waste disposal sites and manufacturing facilities, and unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to disposition. We have no reason to believe that these uncertainties would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. At September 28, 2012, we had outstanding letters of credit and letters of guarantee in the amount of $344 million. We have recorded liabilities for known indemnifications included as part of environmental liabilities. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of these liabilities. In the normal course of business, we are liable for contract completion and product performance. In the opinion of management, such obligations will not significantly affect our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. Pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement, upon separation, we entered into certain guarantee commitments and indemnifications with Tyco International and Covidien. Under the Tax Sharing Agreement, we, Tyco International, and Covidien share 31%, 27%, and 42%, respectively, of certain contingent liabilities relating to unresolved pre-separation tax matters of Tyco International. The effect of the Tax Sharing Agreement is to indemnify us for 69% of certain liabilities settled in cash by us with respect to unresolved pre-separation tax matters. Pursuant to that indemnification, we have made similar indemnifications to Tyco International and Covidien with respect to 31% of certain liabilities settled in cash by the companies relating to unresolved pre-separation tax matters. If any of the companies responsible for all or a portion of such liabilities were to default in its payment of costs or expenses related to any such liability, we would be responsible for a portion of the defaulting party or parties' obligation. These arrangements have been valued upon our separation from Tyco International in accordance with ASC 460 and, accordingly, liabilities amounting to $241 million were recorded on 57 Table of Contents the Consolidated Balance Sheet at September 28, 2012. See Notes 12 and 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses. Our significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The following accounting policies are considered to be the most critical as they require significant judgments and assumptions that involve inherent risks and uncertainties. Management's estimates are based on the relevant information available at the end of each period. Revenue Recognition Our revenue recognition policies are in accordance with ASC 605, Revenue Recognition . Our revenues are generated principally from the sale of our products. Revenue from the sale of products is recognized at the time title and the risks and rewards of ownership pass to the customer. This generally occurs when the products reach the free-on-board shipping point, the sales price is fixed and determinable, and collection is reasonably assured. For those items where title has not yet transferred, we have deferred the recognition of revenue. A reserve for estimated returns is established at the time of sale based on historical return experience and is recorded as a reduction of sales. Other allowances include customer quantity and price discrepancies. A reserve for other allowances is generally established at the time of sale based on historical experience and is recorded as a reduction of sales. Contract revenues for construction related projects are recorded primarily on the percentage-of-completion method. Profits recognized on contracts in process are based upon estimated contract revenue and related cost to complete. Percentage-of-completion is measured based on the ratio of actual costs incurred to total estimated costs. Revisions in cost estimates as contracts progress have the effect of increasing or decreasing profits in the current period. Provisions for anticipated losses are made in the period in which they first become determinable. In addition, provisions for credit losses related to construction related projects are recorded as reductions of revenue in the period in which they first become determinable. Contract revenues for construction related projects are generated primarily in the Network Solutions segment. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Acquired intangible assets include both indeterminable-lived residual goodwill and determinable-lived identifiable intangible assets. Intangible assets with a determinable life include primarily intellectual property consisting of patents, trademarks, customer and distributor relationships, and unpatented technology with estimates of recoverability ranging from 1 to 50 years, amortized generally on a straight-line basis. An evaluation of the remaining useful life of determinable-lived intangible assets is performed on a periodic basis and when events and circumstances warrant an evaluation. We assess determinable-lived intangible assets for impairment consistent with our policy for assessing other long-lived assets for impairment. Goodwill is assessed for impairment separately from determinable-lived intangible assets by comparing the carrying value of each reporting unit to its fair value on the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter of each year or whenever we believe a triggering event requiring a more frequent assessment has occurred. In assessing the existence of a triggering event, management relies on a number of reporting-unit-specific factors including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, transactions, and market place data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management's judgment in applying these factors to the goodwill impairment analysis. 58 Table of Contents A reporting unit is generally an operating segment or one level below an operating segment that constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and regularly reviewed by segment management. At September 28, 2012, we had eight reporting units, consisting of two units in the Transportation Solutions segment, three units in the Communications and Industrial Solutions segment, and three units in the Network Solutions segment, of which one reporting unit has no goodwill. We review our reporting unit structure each year as part of our annual goodwill impairment test, or more frequently based on changes in our structure. When testing for goodwill impairment, we follow the guidance prescribed in ASC 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other . First, we perform a step I goodwill impairment test to identify a potential impairment. In doing so, we compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, goodwill may be impaired and a step II goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of any impairment loss. In the step II goodwill impairment test, we compare the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in a manner consistent with how goodwill is recognized in a business combination. We allocate the fair value of a reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit, including intangible assets, as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. Any excess of the value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill. Fair value estimates used in the step I goodwill impairment tests have been calculated using an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows of each reporting unit. The income approach has been generally supported by additional market transaction and guideline analyses. These approaches incorporate a number of assumptions including future growth rates, discount rates, income tax rates, and market activity in assessing fair value and are reporting unit specific. Changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in goodwill impairments in future periods. We completed our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 and determined that no impairment existed. Income Taxes In determining income for financial statement purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments. These estimates and judgments affect the calculation of certain tax liabilities and the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets, which arise from temporary differences between the income tax return and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results, the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent years, and our forecast of future taxable income. In estimating future taxable income, we develop assumptions including the amount of future state, federal, and non-U.S. pre-tax operating income, the reversal of temporary differences, and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses. We currently have recorded significant valuation allowances that we intend to maintain until it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will be realized. Our income tax expense recorded in the future will be reduced to the extent of decreases in our valuation allowances. The realization of our remaining deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on future taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction. Any reduction in future taxable income including any future restructuring activities may 59 Table of Contents require that we record an additional valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. An increase in the valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in such period and could have a significant impact on our future earnings. Any changes in a valuation allowance that was established in connection with an acquisition will be reflected in the income tax provision. Changes in tax laws and rates also could affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. Management is not aware of any such changes that would have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities includes estimates for uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations across multiple global jurisdictions where we conduct our operations. Under the uncertain tax position provisions of ASC 740, Income Taxes , we recognize liabilities for tax and related interest for issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and related interest will be due. These tax liabilities and related interest are reflected net of the impact of related tax loss carryforwards, as such tax loss carryforwards will be applied against these tax liabilities and will reduce the amount of cash tax payments due upon the eventual settlement with the tax authorities. These estimates may change due to changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a settlement that differs from our current estimate of the tax liabilities and related interest. Further, management has reviewed with tax counsel the issues raised by certain taxing authorities and the adequacy of these recorded amounts. If our current estimate of tax and interest liabilities is less than the ultimate settlement, an additional charge to income tax expense may result. If our current estimate of tax and interest liabilities is more than the ultimate settlement, income tax benefits may be recognized. These tax liabilities and related interest are recorded in income taxes and accrued and other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Pension and Postretirement Benefits Our pension expense and obligations are developed from actuarial assumptions. The funded status of our defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans is recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The funded status is measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation at the measurement date. For defined benefit pension plans, the benefit obligation is the projected benefit obligation, which represents the actuarial present value of benefits expected to be paid upon retirement factoring in estimated future compensation levels. For the postretirement benefit plans, the benefit obligation is the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation, which represents the actuarial present value of postretirement benefits attributed to employee services already rendered. The fair value of plan assets represents the current market value of cumulative company and participant contributions made to irrevocable trust funds, held for the sole benefit of participants, which are invested by the trustee of the funds. The benefits under pension and postretirement plans are based on various factors, such as years of service and compensation. Net periodic pension benefit cost is based on the utilization of the projected unit credit method of calculation and is charged to earnings on a systematic basis over the expected average remaining service lives of current participants. Two critical assumptions in determining pension expense and obligations are the discount rate and expected long-term return on plan assets. We evaluate these assumptions at least annually. Other assumptions reflect demographic factors such as retirement, mortality, and employee turnover. These assumptions are evaluated periodically and updated to reflect our actual experience. Actual results may differ from actuarial assumptions. The discount rate represents the market rate for high-quality fixed income investments and is used to calculate the present value of the expected future cash flows for benefit obligations to be paid under our pension plans. A decrease in the discount rate increases the present value of pension benefit obligations. At fiscal year end 2012, a 25 basis point decrease in the 60 Table of Contents discount rate would have increased the present value of our pension obligations by $135 million; a 25 basis point increase would have decreased the present value of our pension obligations by $121 million. We consider the current and expected asset allocations of our pension plans, as well as historical and expected long-term rates of return on those types of plan assets, in determining the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. A 50 basis point decrease or increase in the expected long-term return on plan assets would have increased or decreased, respectively, our fiscal 2012 pension expense by $9 million. During fiscal 2012, our investment committee made the decision to change the target asset allocation of the U.S. plans' master trust from 30% equity and 70% fixed income to 10% equity and 90% fixed income in an effort to better protect the funded status of the U.S. plans' master trust. Asset reallocation will continue over a multi-year period based on the funded status of the U.S. plans' master trust and market conditions. We expect to reach our target allocation when the funded status of the U.S. plans' master trust, as determined by the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (the "Pension Act"), will be over 100%. Based on the Pension Act definition of funded status, our target asset allocation is 35% equity and 65% fixed income at September 28, 2012. Acquisitions We account for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting. This method requires, among other things, that most assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date. We allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the estimated fair values, or as required by ASC 805. The excess of the purchase price over the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. We may engage independent third-party appraisal firms to assist us in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include but are not limited to: future expected cash flows from customer and distributor relationships, acquired developed technologies, and patents; expected costs to develop in-process research and development into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from projects when completed; brand awareness and market position, as well as assumptions about the period of time the brand will continue to be used in our product portfolio; customer and distributor attrition rates; royalty rates; and discount rates. Management's estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. Contingent Liabilities We record a loss contingency when the available information indicates it is probable that we have incurred a liability and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. When a range of possible losses with equal likelihood exists, we record the low end of the range. The likelihood of a loss with respect to a particular contingency is often difficult to predict, and determining a meaningful estimate of the loss or a range of loss may not be practicable based on information available. In addition, it is not uncommon for such matters to be resolved over many years, during which time relevant developments and new information must continuously be evaluated to determine whether a loss is probable and a reasonable estimate of that loss can be made. When a loss is probable but a reasonable estimate cannot be made, or when a loss is at least reasonably possible, disclosure is provided. 61 Table of Contents Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements In December 2011 and June 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued updates to guidance in ASC 220, Comprehensive Income , that change the presentation and disclosure requirements of comprehensive income in interim and annual financial statements. These updates to ASC 220 are effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2013; however, we early adopted these updates during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012. We now present Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income separately in our Consolidated Financial Statements. In May 2011, the FASB issued an update to guidance in ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement , that clarifies the application of fair value and enhances disclosure regarding valuation of financial instruments and level 3 fair value measurement inputs. We adopted these updates to ASC 820 in the second quarter of fiscal 2012. Adoption did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Non-GAAP Financial Measures Organic Net Sales Growth Organic net sales growth is a non-GAAP financial measure. The difference between reported net sales growth (the most comparable GAAP measure) and organic net sales growth (the non-GAAP measure) consists of the impact from foreign currency exchange rates, acquisitions, divestitures, and an additional week in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year for fiscal years which are 53 weeks in length. Organic net sales growth is a useful measure of the underlying results and trends in our business. It excludes items that are not completely under management's control, such as the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and items that do not reflect the underlying growth of the company, such as acquisition and divestiture activity and the impact of an additional week in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year for fiscal years which are 53 weeks in length. The impact of the 53 rd week was estimated using an average weekly sales figure for the last month of the fiscal year. We believe organic net sales growth provides useful information to investors because it reflects the underlying growth from the ongoing activities of our business. Furthermore, it provides investors with a view of our operations from management's perspective. We use organic net sales growth to monitor and evaluate performance, as it is an important measure of the underlying results of our operations. Management uses organic net sales growth together with GAAP measures such as net sales growth and operating income in its decision making processes related to the operations of our reporting segments and our overall company. We believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that management uses in evaluating operations. The discussion and analysis of organic net sales growth in Results of Operations above utilizes organic net sales growth as management does internally. Because organic net sales growth calculations may vary among other companies, organic net sales growth amounts presented above may not be comparable with similarly titled measures of other companies. Organic net sales growth is a non-GAAP financial measure that is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP measures. The primary limitation of this measure is that it excludes items that have an impact on our net sales. This limitation is best addressed by evaluating organic net sales growth in combination with our GAAP net sales. The tables presented in "Results of Operations" above provide reconciliations of organic net sales growth to net sales growth calculated under GAAP. Free Cash Flow Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. The difference between net cash provided by continuing operating activities (the most comparable GAAP measure) and free cash flow (the 62 Table of Contents non-GAAP measure) consists mainly of significant cash outflows and inflows that we believe are useful to identify. Free cash flow is a useful measure of our performance and ability to generate cash. It also is a significant component in our incentive compensation plans. We believe free cash flow provides useful information to investors as it provides insight into the primary cash flow metric used by management to monitor and evaluate cash flows generated from our operations. Free cash flow excludes net capital expenditures, voluntary pension contributions, and the cash impact of special items. Net capital expenditures are subtracted because they represent long-term commitments. Voluntary pension contributions are subtracted from the GAAP measure because this activity is driven by economic financing decisions rather than operating activity. Certain special items, including net payments related to pre-separation tax matters and pre-separation litigation payments, are also considered by management in evaluating free cash flow. We believe investors should also consider these items in evaluating our free cash flow. Free cash flow as presented herein may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures reported by other companies. The primary limitation of this measure is that it excludes items that have an impact on our GAAP cash flow. Also, it subtracts certain cash items that are ultimately within management's and the board of directors' discretion to direct and may imply that there is less or more cash available for our programs than the most comparable GAAP measure indicates. This limitation is best addressed by using free cash flow in combination with the GAAP cash flow results. It should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for future discretionary expenditures, as our definition of free cash flow does not consider certain non-discretionary expenditures, such as debt payments. In addition, we may have other discretionary expenditures, such as discretionary dividends, share repurchases, and business acquisitions, that are not considered in the calculation of free cash flow. The tables presented in "Liquidity and Capital Resources" above provide reconciliations of free cash flow to cash flows from continuing operating activities calculated under GAAP.
