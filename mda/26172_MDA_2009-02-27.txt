Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Cummins Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries are hereinafter sometimes referred to as "Cummins," "the Company," "the registrant," "we," "our," or "us." ORGANIZATION OF INFORMATION The following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD&A") was prepared to provide the reader with a view and perspective of our businesses through the eyes of management and should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes to those financial statements. Our MD&A is presented in the following sections: Executive Summary and Financial Highlights Results of Operations Restructuring Charges Operating Segment Results Liquidity and Capital Resources Contractual Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments Off Balance Sheet Financing Application of Critical Accounting Estimates Recently Adopted and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 25 Table of Contents EXECUTIVE SUMMARY AND FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS We are a leading global power provider that designs, manufactures, distributes and services diesel and natural gas engines, electric power generation systems and engine-related component products, including filtration and exhaust aftertreatment, fuel systems, controls and air handling systems. We sell our products to Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs), distributors and other customers worldwide. We have long-standing relationships with many of the leading manufacturers in the markets we serve, including PACCAR Inc., International Truck and Engine Corporation (Navistar International Corporation), Chrysler LLC, Volvo AB, Daimler Trucks North America (formerly Freightliner), Ford Motor Company, Case New Holland, Komatsu, and Volkswagen. We serve our customers through a network of more than 500 company-owned and independent distributor locations and approximately 5,200 dealer locations in more than 190 countries and territories. Our reportable operating segments consist of the following: Engine, Power Generation, Components and Distribution. This reporting structure is organized according to the products and markets each segment serves. This type of reporting structure allows management to focus its efforts on providing enhanced service to a wide range of customers. The Engine segment produces engines and parts for sale to customers in on-highway and various industrial markets. The engines are used in trucks of all sizes, buses and recreational vehicles, as well as various industrial applications including construction, mining, agriculture, marine, oil and gas, rail and military. The Power Generation segment is an integrated provider of power systems which sells engines, generator sets and alternators. The Components segment includes sales of filtration products, exhaust aftertreatment systems, turbochargers and fuel systems. The Distribution segment includes wholly-owned and partially-owned distributorships engaged in wholesaling engines, generator sets, and service parts, as well as performing service and repair activities on our products and maintaining relationships with various OEMs throughout the world. Our financial performance depends, in large part, on varying conditions in the markets we serve, particularly the on-highway, construction and general industrial markets. Demand in these markets tends to fluctuate in response to overall economic conditions and is particularly sensitive to changes in interest rate levels and our customers' access to credit. Our sales may also be impacted by OEM inventory levels and production schedules and stoppages. Economic downturns in markets we serve generally result in reductions in sales and pricing of our products. As a worldwide business, our operations are also affected by political, economic and regulatory matters, including environmental and emissions standards, in the countries we serve. However, our geographic diversity and broad product and service offerings have helped limit the impact of any one industry or customer and the economy of any single country on our consolidated results. In 2008, softness in the pick-up truck, recreational vehicle, and recreational marine markets worsened and evidence of a downturn in the United States (U.S.) and European economies and softening in global markets became more evident, particularly in the fourth quarter when we saw severe declines in the truck and construction businesses. Despite these unfavorable conditions, we reported increased net sales and net income during 2008 compared to 2007. Approximately 54 percent of our annual 2007 sales came from countries other than the U.S. and that trend grew to 59 percent for the year ended December 31, 2008, which helped to mitigate some of our exposure in the U.S. economy. The diversity of our business portfolio has contributed to the significant organic growth we have experienced over the past several years and continued into 2008 despite more difficult economic conditions. We continued our strong performance of the past four years into 2008 with a fifth straight year of record net sales and net income. Net income was $755 million, or $3.84 per diluted share, on sales of $14.3 billion, compared to 2007 net income of $739 million, or $3.70 per diluted share, on sales of $13.0 billion. The income improvement was driven by a 10 percent increase in net sales and a 15 percent increase in gross margin, as we benefited from improved pricing and higher demand across most of our businesses, increased market share in a number of markets and focused cost reduction 26 Table of Contents efforts. However, as the result of the deepening global credit crisis that began impacting many of our markets in the fourth quarter of 2008 and the bleak global economic outlook for 2009, we implemented targeted restructuring actions in the fourth quarter of 2008 at a pretax cost of $37 million ($26 million after-tax), or $0.13 per share. We are also taking additional restructuring actions in early 2009 to adjust for continued weakening markets and decaying economic conditions affecting most of our markets. For a detailed discussion of restructuring see "Restructuring Charges" and Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Favorable/ (Unfavorable) Years ended December 31, 2008 vs. 2007 2007 vs. 2006 Dollars in millions 2008 2007 2006 Amount Percent Amount Percent Net sales $ 14,342 $ 13,048 $ 11,362 $ 1,294 10 % $ 1,686 15 % Cost of sales 11,402 10,492 8,897 (910 ) (9 )% (1,595 ) (18 )% Gross margin 2,940 2,556 2,465 384 15 % 91 4 % Operating expenses and income Selling, general and administrative expenses 1,450 1,296 1,153 (154 ) (12 )% (143 ) (12 )% Research, development and engineering expenses 422 329 321 (93 ) (28 )% (8 ) (2 )% Equity, royalty and interest income from investees 253 205 140 48 23 % 65 46 % Restructuring charges 37 (37 ) NM % Other operating (expense) income, net (12 ) 22 (34 ) NM 22 NM Operating income 1,272 1,158 1,131 114 10 % 27 2 % Interest income 18 36 47 (18 ) (50 )% (11 ) (23 )% Interest expense 42 58 96 16 28 % 38 40 % Other (expense) income, net (70 ) 33 1 (103 ) NM 32 NM Income before income taxes and minority interests 1,178 1,169 1,083 9 1 % 86 8 % Income tax expense 360 381 324 21 6 % (57 ) (18 )% Minority interests in income of consolidated subsidiaries 63 49 44 (14 ) (29 )% (5 ) (11 )% Net income $ 755 $ 739 $ 715 $ 16 2 % $ 24 3 % Diluted earnings per share $ 3.84 $ 3.70 $ 3.55 $ 0.14 4 % $ 0.15 4 % 27 Table of Contents 2008 vs. 2007 Net Sales Net sales increased in all segments due to the following drivers. Our commercial power generation business experienced increased demand, especially internationally. We increased our market share in North American (includes the United States (U.S.) and Canada and excludes Mexico) heavy-duty truck and medium-duty truck and bus markets. Industrial engine markets demand increased, particularly the international construction and commercial marine markets. Our Distribution segment benefited from increased demand as well as the acquisition of a majority interest in three previously independent distributors. Our turbocharger and emissions solutions businesses experienced increased demand. We had a favorable impact from foreign currency translation. These increases in net sales were partially offset by softening in the U.S. economy which has resulted in a significant reduction in demand in light-duty automotive and recreational markets for engines as well as decreased demand for consumer power generation products and a significant reduction in most other markets in the fourth quarter of 2008 as the result of the economic recession. A more detailed discussion of sales by segment is presented in the Operating Segments Results section. Gross Margin Significant drivers of the change in gross margins were as follows: 2008 vs. 2007 Increase (Decrease) in millions Price $ 402 Volume/Mix 233 Production costs 47 Currency 47 Warranty expense (185 ) Material Costs (173 ) Other 13 Total $ 384 Gross margin increased by $384 million, and as a percentage of sales increased by 0.9 percentage points. Benefits from increased pricing and a more favorable volume/mix of products sold were partially offset by higher material costs reflecting the increase in commodity prices during the year and higher warranty expense. Our warranty expense reflects favorable warranty experience for some engine products and our provision related to sales in 2008 was 2.9 percent of sales, down from 3.1 percent in 2007. This result was more than offset by negative trends primarily in certain mid-range engine products launched in 2007 for which we recorded additional warranty liability of approximately $117 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. A more detailed discussion of margin by segment is presented in the "Operating Segments Results" section. 28 Table of Contents Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to increased consulting expenses of $36 million, increased compensation and related expenses of approximately $34 million, and the acquisition of a majority ownership interest in three previously independent North American distributors. Increased headcount and compensation and related expenses included salaries, variable compensation and fringe benefits across the business in support of higher volumes and business growth. Overall selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales increased to 10.1 percent in 2008 from 9.9 percent in 2007. Research, Development and Engineering Expenses Research, development and engineering expenses increased significantly, primarily due to higher spending on development programs for future products including increased headcount, compensation and related expenses. Compensation and related expenses include salaries, variable compensation and fringe benefits. Fluctuations in other miscellaneous research and development expenses were not significant individually or in the aggregate. Overall, research, development and engineering expenses as a percentage of sales increased to 2.9 percent in 2008 from 2.5 percent in 2007. Equity, Royalty and Interest Income from Investees Equity, royalty and interest income from investees increased significantly, primarily due to increases in income from North American distributors of $17 million, Dongfeng Cummins Engine Company, Ltd. (DCEC) of $14 million, increased royalty and interest income of $9 million and increased income from Chongqing Cummins Engine Company Limited (CCEC) of $8 million. Shanghai Fleetguard Filter Co., Ltd also experienced an increase of $2 million. These increases were slightly offset by decreases from Tata Cummins Ltd. (TCL) of $6 million and Cummins MerCruiser Diesel Marine LLC (MerCruiser) of $8 million. North American distributors increased primarily due to income from a joint venture which we formed in the fourth quarter of 2007. DCEC sales increased largely due to prebuy activity in the first half of 2008 prior to a mid-year emissions change. CCEC increased primarily due to increased sales volumes. TCL experienced decreased sales volumes for the year while MerCruiser profits declined due to a significant decline in the recreational marine market and increased research, development and engineering expenses. Other Operating (Expense) Income, Net Years ended December 31, 2008 2007 in millions Other operating (expense) income: Royalty income $ 12 $ 7 Gain on sale of fixed assets(1) 5 22 Flood damage expenses (5 ) Royalty expense (10 ) (4 ) Amortization of other intangibles(2) (13 ) (1 ) Other, net (1 ) (2 ) Total other operating (expense) income, net $ (12 ) $ 22 (1) The decrease in the gain on sale of fixed assets was primarily due to the $10 million gain on the sale of Universal Silencer in 2007. 29 Table of Contents (2) The increase in amortization of other intangibles was primarily due to amortization of purchased premiums related to the acquisition of a North American distributor in 2008. Interest Income Interest income decreased primarily due to lower average cash balances in 2008 compared to 2007. Interest Expense Interest expense decreased primarily due to declining short-term interest rates and a benefit from our interest rate swap. Other (Expense) Income, Net Years ended December 31, 2008 2007 in millions Other (expense) income: Change in cash surrender value of corporate owned life insurance(1) $ (36 ) $ Bank charges (12 ) (12 ) Foreign currency (losses) gains(2) (46 ) 28 Other, net 24 17 Total other (expense) income, net $ (70 ) $ 33 (1) The change in the cash surrender value of corporate owned life insurance was due to market deterioration, especially in the fourth quarter of 2008, which included the write down of certain investments to zero. (2) The foreign currency exchange losses in 2008 were due to unfavorable currency fluctuations in 2008, especially with the British Pound, the Euro, the Australian Dollar and the Indian Rupee. Income Tax Expense Our income tax rates are generally less than the 35 percent U.S. income tax rate primarily because of lower taxes on foreign earnings and research tax credits. Our effective tax rate for 2008 was 30.6 percent compared to 32.6 percent for 2007. The decrease is primarily due to greater foreign earnings in 2008, which are subject to lower tax rates. Our 2008 income tax provision also includes a $10 million (0.8 percent) reduction in the fourth quarter due to the legislative reinstatement of the U.S. research tax credit. We expect our 2009 effective tax rate to be 31 percent excluding any discrete items that may arise. Minority Interests in Income of Consolidated Subsidiaries Minority interests in income of consolidated subsidiaries eliminates the income or loss attributable to non-Cummins ownership interests in our consolidated entities. Minority interests in income of consolidated subsidiaries increased primarily due to higher income at our consolidated subsidiary in India. Cummins India Limited's (CIL's), a 51 percent owned subsidiary, minority interest increased $10 million due to the creation of a new export business in 2008 and favorable price adjustments for high horsepower products. There were no other individual fluctuations in the subsidiaries that were significant. 30 Table of Contents Net Income and Diluted Earnings Per Share Net income and diluted earnings per share increased primarily due to higher volumes, improved margins, higher equity income and a lower effective tax rate. These increases were partially offset by warranty expense, restructuring charges and investment losses primarily occurring during the fourth quarter of 2008, in addition to unfavorable foreign currency effects. Outlook Near-Term: We expect sales and profits to be lower in 2009 given the economic outlook. Our operating results in 2009 will depend on how the current global economic conditions impact the markets we serve. Forecasting for 2009 is a significant challenge with these uncertain market conditions. Many of the markets we serve are slowing significantly as a result of the credit crisis and softening global economic environment and we expect 2009 sales will be down significantly from 2008 levels. In response to anticipated market conditions we executed voluntary and involuntary separation actions in December of 2008 and January of 2009. We expect to continue to focus on cost reductions and scaling production to meet current demand. If uncertainties in the credit and capital markets continue, the overall impact on our customers as well as end user demand for our products could have a significant adverse impact on our near-term results. In light of current economic conditions, if conditions continue to worsen in 2009, it is reasonably possible that we may be required to incur impairment charges on certain assets as we decrease production or close certain manufacturing facilities in response to decreasing demand. Impairments could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position. At this time we cannot estimate these potential impairment charges. Long-Term: While there is uncertainty in the near-term market as a result of the current economic conditions, we continue to be optimistic that opportunities for long-term growth and profitability will continue in the future. 2007 vs. 2006 Net Sales Net sales increased in all segments due to the following drivers. Our commercial generator and alternator businesses benefited from improved pricing and strong organic growth. Our emission solutions and turbocharger businesses experienced strong organic growth. We benefited from improved pricing for emission compliant engines. Most on-highway and off-highway markets experienced strong demand. We had a favorable impact from foreign currency translation. These increases were partially offset by: Demand in our North American heavy-duty on-highway market decreased as a result of the 2007 change in emissions standards. We deconsolidated one of our North American joint ventures beginning in 2007 whose 2006 sales totaled $163 million. 31 Table of Contents A more detailed discussion of sales by segment is presented in the Operating Segment Results section. Gross Margin Significant drivers of the change in gross margin were as follows: 2007 vs. 2006 Increase (Decrease) in millions Price $ 516 Volume/Mix 158 Production costs (419 ) Warranty expense (87 ) Deconsolidation of a joint venture (65 ) Other (12 ) Total $ 91 Gross margin as a percentage of sales declined by 2.1 percentage points as margin percentages declined in three of our segments. The provision for warranties issued for the year was 3.1 percent of consolidated sales, compared to 2.8 percent for 2006. A more detailed discussion of margin by segment is presented in our Operating Segment Results section. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to increased compensation and related expenses of approximately $116 million in support of higher volumes and business growth, and increased consulting fees and other outside services of $32 million. Increased headcount, compensation and related expenses included salaries, variable compensation and fringe benefits across the business in support of higher volumes and business growth. Overall selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales declined to 9.9 percent in 2007 from 10.1 percent in 2006. Research, Development and Engineering Expenses Research, development and engineering expenses increased primarily due to higher spending on new product development and critical technologies for 2010 and beyond including increased headcount, compensation and related expenses to support business growth. Compensation and related expenses include salaries, variable compensation, and fringe benefits. Fluctuations in other miscellaneous research, development and engineering expenses were not significant individually or in the aggregate. Overall, research, development and engineering expenses declined to 2.5 percent in 2007 from 2.8 percent in 2006. Equity, Royalty and Interest Income from Investees Equity, royalty and interest income from investees increased significantly, primarily due to improved income from North American distributors of $35 million, DCEC of $22 million, CCEC of $7 million and MerCruiser of $5 million, while the other joint ventures had slight increases. North American distributors increased primarily as the result of organic growth, acquisitions and the deconsolidation of a North American joint venture in 2007. 32 Table of Contents Other Operating (Expense) Income, Net Years ended December 31, 2007 2006 in millions Other operating (expense) income: Gain on sale of fixed assets(1) $ 22 $ 4 Royalty income 7 3 Amortization of other intangibles (1 ) 1 Royalty expense (4 ) (3 ) Other, net (2 ) (5 ) Total other operating (expense) income, net $ 22 $ (1) The increase in the gain on sale of fixed assets was primarily due to the $10 million gain on the sale of Universal Silencer in 2007. Interest Income Interest income decreased primarily due to lower average cash balances in 2007 compared to 2006. Interest Expense Interest expense decreased primarily due to a decline of $137 million in debt balances, partially offset by higher interest rates. Other (Expense) Income, Net Years ended December 31, 2007 2006 in millions Other (expense) income: Loss on early extinguishment of debt(1) $ $ (12 ) Bank charges (12 ) (14 ) Foreign currency (losses) gains(2) 28 11 Other, net 17 16 Total other (expense) income, net $ 33 $ 1 (1) The loss on early extinguishment of debt in 2006 was incurred when we repaid our $250 million 9.5 percent notes in December of 2006. (2) The increased gains on foreign currency were primarily due to favorable currency fluctuations in 2007, especially with the British Pound, the Euro, the Indian Rupee and the Australian Dollar. Income Tax Expense Our income tax rates have been less than the 35 percent U.S. income tax rate primarily because of lower taxes on foreign income and research tax credits. Export tax benefits also reduced our tax rate prior to 2007. Our effective tax rate for 2007 was 32.6 percent compared to 29.9 percent for 2006. The increase is in part due to the full repeal after 2006 of U.S. export tax benefits which reduced our 2006 tax rate by 33 Table of Contents 1.4 percent. Our income tax provision for 2006 also included a $28 million (2.6 percent) benefit for the favorable resolution of tax uncertainties related to prior years offset by a $12 million (1.1 percent) increase for the effect of new Indiana tax legislation. Minority Interests in Income of Consolidated Subsidiaries Minority interests are primarily attributable to CIL, a 51 percent owned subsidiary and Wuxi Holset Engineering Co. Ltd. (Wuxi), a 55 percent owned subsidiary. These two subsidiaries accounted for over 80 percent of the total minority interest in 2007. These increases were partially offset by the deconsolidation of Cummins Eastern Canada LLP (CEC), a 51 percent owned subsidiary, on January 1, 2007. The remainder of the consolidated partially-owned subsidiaries had a combination of immaterial increases and decreases in income. Net Income and Diluted Earnings Per Share Net income and diluted earnings per share increased primarily due to higher volumes, significant improvement in equity earnings, lower interest expense and favorable foreign currency effects. These increases were partially offset by higher fixed costs to support growth and a higher effective tax rate. RESTRUCTURING CHARGES We have executed restructuring actions primarily in the form of voluntary and involuntary separation programs in the fourth quarter of 2008. These actions were in response to the continued deterioration we saw in our U.S. businesses and most key markets around the world in the second half of 2008, as well as a reduction in orders in most U.S. and global markets for 2009. We reduced our worldwide professional workforce by approximately 650 employees, or 4.5 percent. We offered a voluntary retirement package to certain active professional employees in the U.S. based on a clearly defined set of criteria. We also took voluntary and involuntary actions which included approximately 800 hourly employees, the majority of which received severance benefits. The compensation packages contained salary and continuation of benefits, including health care, life insurance and outplacement services. The voluntary retirement package was accepted by approximately 150 employees. The remaining professional reductions of 500 employees were involuntary. The expenses recorded during the year ended December 31, 2008, included severance costs related to both voluntary and involuntary terminations. During 2008, we incurred a pretax charge related to the professional and hourly restructuring initiatives of approximately $37 million. Employee termination and severance costs were recorded based on approved plans developed by the businesses and corporate management which specified positions to be eliminated, benefits to be paid under existing severance plans or statutory requirements and the expected timetable for completion of the plan. Estimates of restructuring were made based on information available at the time charges were recorded. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved, actual amounts paid for such activities may differ from amounts initially recorded and we may need to revise previous estimates. At December 31, 2008, of the approximately 1,450 employees to be affected by this plan, 1,250 had been terminated. If the restructuring actions are successfully implemented, we expect such actions to yield approximately $45 million to $50 million in annual savings. Approximately 41 percent of the savings from the restructuring actions will be realized in cost of sales, 44 percent in selling, general and administrative expenses, and 15 percent in research, development and engineering expenses. We expect all of the pretax charge to be paid in cash which will be funded with cash generated from operations. 34 Table of Contents The table below summarizes the balance of accrued restructuring expenses, which is included in the balance of Other accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheets for the year ended December 31, 2008: Total Expenses Payments Accrued Balance at December 31, 2008 in millions Restructuring charges(1) $ 37 $ 3 $ 34 (1) Restructuring charges include severance pay and benefits and related charges. We do not include restructuring charges in the segment results. The pretax impact of allocating restructuring charges for the year ended December 31, 2008, would have been as follows: in millions Engine $ 15 Power Generation 3 Components 14 Distribution 2 Corporate 3 Total restructuring charges $ 37 In early 2009, we announced additional reductions in our workforce, through both voluntary and involuntary actions, of approximately 1,300 employees by March 1, 2009, including 800 salaried employees and 500 hourly employees. In light of current economic conditions, if conditions continue to worsen in 2009, it is reasonably possible that we may be required to take further actions, including workforce reductions and impairments on certain assets as we decrease production or close certain manufacturing facilities in response to decreasing demand. These actions could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position. We expect our first quarter restructuring charge to exceed the amount taken in 2008. OPERATING SEGMENT RESULTS Our reportable operating segments consist of the following: Engine, Power Generation, Components, and Distribution. This reporting structure is organized according to the products and markets each segment serves. This type of reporting structure allows management to focus its efforts on providing enhanced service to a wide range of customers. The Engine segment produces engines and parts for sale to customers in on-highway and various industrial markets. The engines are used in trucks of all sizes, buses and RVs, as well as various industrial applications including construction, mining, agriculture, marine, oil and gas, rail and military. The Power Generation segment is an integrated provider of power systems which sells engines, generator sets and alternators. The Components segment includes sales of filtration products, exhaust and aftertreatment systems, turbochargers and fuel systems. The Distribution segment includes wholly-owned and partially-owned distributorships engaged in wholesaling engines, generator sets, and service parts, as well as performing service and repair activities on our products and maintaining relationships with various OEMs. We use segment EBIT (defined as earnings before interest expense, taxes and minority interests) as a primary basis for the chief operating decision-maker to evaluate the performance of each of our operating segments. Segment amounts exclude certain expenses not specifically identifiable to segments. The accounting policies of our operating segments are the same as those applied in the Consolidated Financial Statements . We prepared the financial results of our operating segments on a basis that is consistent with the manner in which we internally disaggregate financial information to 35 Table of Contents assist in making internal operating decisions. We have allocated certain common costs and expenses, primarily corporate functions, among segments differently than we would for stand-alone financial information prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). These include certain costs and expenses of shared services, such as information technology, human resources, legal and finance. We also do not allocate debt-related items, actuarial gains or losses, prior service costs or credits, restructuring charges, investment gains or losses, flood damage, or income taxes to individual segments. Segment EBIT may not be consistent with measures used by other companies. Engine Segment Results Financial data for the Engine segment was as follows: Favorable/(Unfavorable) Years ended December 31, 2008 vs. 2007 2007 vs. 2006 Dollars in millions 2008 2007 2006 Amount Percent Amount Percent External sales $ 7,432 $ 7,129 $ 6,640 $ 303 4 % $ 489 7 % Intersegment sales 1,378 1,053 871 325 31 % 182 21 % Net sales 8,810 8,182 7,511 628 8 % 671 9 % Depreciation and amortization 180 176 192 (4 ) (2 )% 16 8 % Research, development and engineering expenses 286 222 225 (64 ) (29 )% 3 1 % Equity, royalty and interest income from investees 99 92 67 7 8 % 25 37 % Interest income 10 26 36 (16 ) (62 )% (10 ) (28 )% Segment EBIT 535 589 733 (54 ) (9 )% (144 ) (20 )% Segment EBIT as a percentage of net sales 6.1 % 7.2 % 9.8 % (1.1) percentage points (2.6) percentage points Engine Net Sales by Market A summary and discussion of Engine segment net sales by market follows: Favorable/(Unfavorable) Years ended December 31, 2008 vs. 2007 2007 vs. 2006 Dollars in millions 2008 2007 2006 Amount Percent Amount Percent Heavy-duty truck $ 2,308 $ 1,948 $ 2,498 $ 360 18 % $ (550 ) (22 )% Medium-duty truck and bus 1,550 1,284 971 266 21 % 313 32 % Light-duty automotive and RV 804 1,340 1,261 (536 ) (40 )% 79 6 % Total on-highway 4,662 4,572 4,730 90 2 % (158 ) (3 )% Industrial 3,029 2,676 2,063 353 13 % 613 30 % Stationary power 1,119 934 718 185 20 % 216 30 % Total net sales $ 8,810 $ 8,182 $ 7,511 $ 628 8 % $ 671 9 % 36 Table of Contents A summary of unit shipments by engine classification (including unit shipments to Power Generation) follows: Favorable/ (Unfavorable) Years ended December 31, 2008 vs. 2007 2007 vs. 2006 2008 2007 2006 Amount Percent Amount Percent Mid-range 418,300 486,800 459,900 (68,500 ) (14 )% 26,900 6 % Heavy-duty 108,300 91,400 123,400 16,900 18 % (32,000 ) (26 )% High-horsepower 20,600 18,500 16,300 2,100 11 % 2,200 13 % Total unit shipments 547,200 596,700 599,600 (49,500 ) (8 )% (2,900 ) % 2008 vs. 2007 Net Sales Engine segment sales increased primarily due to the following drivers. Heavy-duty sales increased primarily due to an increase in our market share in the North American (includes the U.S. and Canada and excludes Mexico) heavy-duty truck markets, increased Mexican heavy-duty truck sales in the first six months of 2008 resulting from the pre-buy activity ahead of Mexico's July 1, 2008, new emissions requirements and weaker demand in the first six months of 2007 resulting from the 2006 pre-buy to replace trucks ahead of the 2007 emissions regulations change. Industrial market sales increased primarily related to strength in commercial marine and construction markets. Medium-duty trucks sales increased due to increased demand in global medium-duty truck markets, primarily due to our market share increases in the North American medium-duty truck market, weaker demand in the first six months of 2007 resulting from the 2006 pre-buy to replace trucks ahead of the 2007 emissions regulations change and strong demand in Latin America driven by strong economic conditions in Brazil in 2008. Stationary power sales increased primarily from intersegment sales to our Power Generation segment, especially internationally. Medium-duty bus sales increased due to market share gains in the North American bus market. We had a favorable impact from foreign currency translation. These increases were partially offset by a 50 percent decline in units sold to Chrysler. This decline was due to the deteriorating demand for light duty trucks in North America as the result of the softening U.S. economy and concerns over fuel prices earlier in the year. Total on-highway-related sales were 53 percent of total engine segment sales in 2008, compared to 56 percent in 2007. Segment EBIT Engine segment EBIT decreased primarily due to lower engine volumes in the mid-range on-highway truck markets, increased warranty expense and increased material cost partially offset by improved industrial engine and parts pricing and more favorable sales mix in the on-highway markets. Gross margin increased $73 million, or 6 percent; however, gross margin percentage decreased by 0.3 percentage points. Gross margin was higher due to price improvements, primarily in industrial engines, and favorable product mix. These increases were partially offset by increased warranty expense 37 Table of Contents due to the increased mix of newer emissions-driven products and higher repair costs on certain engines, in addition to increased material prices due to higher commodity prices during the year. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $30 million, or 5 percent, and remained relatively flat as a percentage of sales for the year. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to higher payroll costs as the result of salary increases and an increase in the number of segment employees during the year. Research, development and engineering expenses increased $64 million, or 29 percent, and increased 0.5 percentage points, as a percentage of sales for the year, as compared to the prior year. The increase in research, development and engineering expenses was the result of increased spending on emissions related programs. 2007 vs. 2006 Net Sales Engine segment sales increased primarily due to the following drivers. Industrial sales increased primarily due to increased demand in most markets, particularly in the construction, mining, marine, oil and gas and agriculture markets. Medium-duty truck and bus sales increased due to a 16 percent increase in medium-duty truck engine shipments and a 48 percent increase in bus engine shipments caused by increased international demand for medium-duty truck engines and increased demand for bus engines in North America. Stationary power sales increased primarily from intersegment sales to our Power Generation segment. These increases were offset by a decrease in demand in the North American heavy-duty truck market as a result of the 2007 emissions standards change. Total on-highway-related sales were 56 percent of Engine segment net sales in 2007 compared with 63 percent in 2006. Segment EBIT Engine segment EBIT decreased primarily due to lower engine volumes in the heavy-duty on-highway markets, the accompanying gross margin impact of lower absorption of fixed manufacturing costs, higher product costs and warranty accrual rates for new emissions compliant products and increased selling, general and administrative expenses. Gross margin decreased $113 million, or 8 percent, and gross margin percentage decreased 2.9 percentage points. Gross margin was lower due to higher material and warranty costs associated with the new 2007 engines. The increase in warranty expense was expected as the mix of 2007 emissions compliant engines increased. As has been our practice, and as described in our Critical Accounting Estimates, new product launches require a greater use of judgment in developing estimates until historical experience becomes available. Selling, general and administrative expense increased $64 million, or 12 percent, and remained flat as a percentage of net sales. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to higher payroll costs as the result of salary increases and an increase in infrastructure investments including the number of employees to provide for the Engine segment's growing business. Research, development and engineering expenses decreased by $3 million, or 1 percent, and decreased slightly as a percentage of net sales. These overall increased segment expenses were partially offset by higher income from joint ventures over last year, primarily due to a $22 million improvement in income at DCEC due to strong demand in the Chinese truck market. 38 Table of Contents Power Generation Segment Results Financial data for the Power Generation segment was as follows: Favorable/(Unfavorable) Years ended December 31, 2008 vs. 2007 2007 vs. 2006 Dollars in millions 2008 2007 2006 Amount Percent Amount Percent External sales $ 2,601 $ 2,375 $ 1,880 $ 226 10 % $ 495 26 % Intersegment sales 899 685 536 214 31 % 149 28 % Net sales 3,500 3,060 2,416 440 14 % 644 27 % Depreciation and amortization 41 42 36 1 2 % (6 ) (17 )% Research, development and engineering expenses 41 34 28 (7 ) (21 )% (6 ) (21 )% Equity, royalty and interest income from investees 23 17 12 6 35 % 5 42 % Interest income 3 6 7 (3 ) (50 )% (1 ) (14 )% Segment EBIT 376 334 220 42 13 % 114 52 % Segment EBIT as a percentage of net sales 10.7 % 10.9 % 9.1 % (0.2) percentage points 1.8 percentage points Our Power Generation segment includes the following businesses: commercial, consumer, power electronics, energy solutions and alternators.

Alternator business sales increased due to strong international growth, especially in China, the U.K., and Southeast Asia and improved price realization. These increases were partially offset by a significant sales decrease in our consumer business, primarily due to the softening U.S. economy. Segment EBIT Power Generation segment EBIT increased primarily due to significant price realization, increased volume and favorable product mix. This was partially offset by increased material costs, including increased engine and commodity prices. Gross margin improved $83 million, or 15 percent, and the gross margin percentage remained flat compared to the prior year. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $20 million, or 8 percent, however, selling, general and administrative expenses improved by 0.5 percentage points, as a percentage of sales. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to higher payroll costs and increases in the number of segment employees. Research, development and engineering expenses increased $7 million, or 21 percent; however, research, development and engineering expenses remained relatively flat as a percentage of sales. 2007 vs. 2006 Net Sales Power Generation segment net sales increased over 2006, primarily due to the following drivers. Commercial business sales increased as the result of improved pricing and increased demand in most regions, especially EMEA, North America, India and Latin America. Alternator business sales increased as a result of improved pricing and strong international growth. We had a favorable impact from foreign currency translation. Segment EBIT Power Generation segment EBIT increased, primarily due to the improved gross margin line as significant price realization, net of increased material costs and the absorption benefit from higher volumes improved segment income. Gross margin improved $147 million, or 35 percent, and the gross margin percentage improved by 1.1 percentage points. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $39 million, or 18 percent, however, improved by 0.6 percentage points as a percentage of net sales. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to higher payroll costs and increases in infrastructure investments including the number of employees to provide for the growing Power Generation business. Research, development and engineering expenses increased by $6 million, or 21 percent, and remained flat as a percentage of net sales. 40 Table of Contents Components Segment Results Financial data for the Components segment was as follows: Favorable/(Unfavorable) Years ended December 31, 2008 vs. 2007 2007 vs. 2006 Dollars in millions 2008 2007 2006 Amount Percent Amount Percent External sales $ 2,154 $ 2,007 $ 1,473 $ 147 7 % $ 534 36 % Intersegment sales 998 925 808 73 8 % 117 14 % Net sales 3,152 2,932 2,281 220 8 % 651 29 % Depreciation and amortization 65 59 57 (6 ) (10 )% (2 ) (4 )% Research, development and engineering expenses 95 73 68 (22 ) (30 )% (5 ) (7 )% Equity, royalty and interest income from investees 14 4 7 10 NM (3 ) (43 )% Interest income 3 3 2 % 1 50 % Segment EBIT 169 153 107 16 10 % 46 43 % Segment EBIT as a percentage of net sales 5.4 % 5.2 % 4.7 % 0.2 percentage points 0.5 percentage points Our Components segment includes the following businesses: filtration, turbochargers, emission solutions, and fuel systems.

Turbocharger business sales increased due to strong growth in North America, Europe and China, partially due to pre-buy activity in advance of new Euro III emissions standards, which fueled domestic sales in China. Emissions solutions business sales increased due to strong sales in North America as the result of price increases and North American market share gains. 41 Table of Contents These increases were partially offset by the sale of Universal Silencer and the discontinuance of a product line in 2007, which contributed a combined $75 million in sales in the year ended December 31, 2007. Segment EBIT Components segment EBIT increased primarily due to higher volumes in most of our businesses, manufacturing efficiencies and price realization in three of our businesses. Gross margin increased $69 million, or 17 percent, and the gross margin percentage increased 1.2 percentage points. The gross margin percentage improved primarily due to manufacturing efficiencies achieved in all of our businesses in 2008 and price realization greater than increased material prices due to higher commodity prices during the year, which was partially offset by increased warranty expense. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $21 million, or 10 percent, and increased 0.2 percentage points, as a percentage of sales. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to higher payroll costs and increases in the number of segment employees. Research, development and engineering expenses increased $22 million, or 30 percent, and increased 0.5 percentage points, as a percentage of sales. The increased research, development and engineering spending is focused on developing new products to meet future emissions standards for both developed and emerging markets. 2007 vs. 2006 Net Sales Components segment sales increased primarily due to the following drivers. Emissions solutions business sales increased due to high demand in all markets and geographic regions from the sale of new products to meet new on-highway emission standards. Turbocharger business sales increased significantly due to high demand in all markets and geographic regions from the sale of new products to meet the new on-highway emission standards. Filtration business sales increased primarily due to growth in emerging markets of Eastern Europe and the Middle East. Emission solutions and turbocharger businesses benefited from market share gains in North America. We had a favorable impact from foreign currency translation. Segment EBIT Components segment EBIT increased primarily due to increased volumes and gross margins in most Components businesses and the sale of a business during 2007. Gross margin improved $68 million, or 20 percent, however, the gross margin percentage decreased 1.1 percentage points. Gross margin percentages were unfavorably impacted by higher metal costs and new product introduction costs. In addition, both our emission solutions and turbo technologies businesses experienced low margins as the result of costs associated with meeting extremely strong demand. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $30 million, or 17 percent, however, selling, general and administrative expenses improved by 0.7 percentage points as a percentage of net sales. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to higher payroll costs and increases in infrastructure investments including the number of employees to provide for the growing Components business. Research, development and engineering expenses increased by $5 million, or 7 percent, however, research, development and engineering expenses improved by 42 Table of Contents 0.5 percentage points as a percentage of net sales. Segment EBIT was also favorably impacted by the $10 million gain on the sale of Universal Silencer.

We experienced strong organic growth in all regions, mainly in Europe, the South Pacific, and the Middle East. We had higher sales from the acquisition of a majority ownership interest in three previously independent distributors of $260 million. We had a favorable impact from foreign currency translation. The higher sales were led by increased sales volumes in power generation, parts and engine volumes, followed by service. Segment EBIT Distribution segment EBIT increased primarily due to increased sales volumes for power generation, parts and engines followed by service and improved pricing. However, segment EBIT decreased as a percentage of sales, primarily due to unfavorable currency translation adjustments which negatively impacted our EBIT as a percentage of sales by 1.3 percentage points. Excluding the $17 million impact of three new distributors consolidated during the year and one new North American joint venture, EBIT was $225 million for the year and decreased 0.3 percentage points as a percentage of sales. Gross margin increased by $145 million, or 45 percent, and improved 0.7 percentage points as a percentage of sales. The increase in gross margin was primarily due to the increase in sales volumes and improved pricing. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $78 million, or 31 percent, however, selling, general and administrative expenses improved by 1.2 percentage points as a percentage of sales. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to higher payroll costs as the result of 2008 salary increases and an increase in the number of segment employees including increased costs related to the acquisition of three new distributors and the North American joint venture. 43 Table of Contents 2007 vs. 2006 Net Sales Distribution segment sales increased as a result of the following drivers. We experienced organic growth in Europe and the Middle East primarily due to increased sales of power generation equipment in both regions. We had a favorable impact from foreign currency translation. The higher sales were led by increased sales volumes in power generation, engine and parts. These increases were partially offset by the deconsolidation of one of our North American joint ventures that accounted for approximately $163 million or 12 percent of sales in the year ended 2006. Segment EBIT Distribution segment EBIT increased primarily due to equity, royalty and interest income from investees led by a $35 million increase from our North American Distributors. Gross margin improved $14 million, or 5 percent, however, the gross margin percentage decreased 1.4 percentage points. The decrease in gross margin percentage was primarily due to the deconsolidation of one of our North American joint ventures in 2007. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $15 million, or 6 percent, however, selling, general and administrative expenses improved by 0.7 percentage points as a percentage of net sales. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to higher payroll costs as the result of 2007 salary increases, an increase in infrastructure investments, including the number of employees to provide for the growing Distribution business and unfavorable foreign currency translation. Reconciliation of Segment EBIT to Income Before Income Taxes and Minority Interests The table below reconciles the segment information to the corresponding amounts in the Consolidated Statements of Income: Years ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 in millions Total segment EBIT $ 1,322 $ 1,263 $ 1,204 Non-segment EBIT(1) (102 ) (36 ) (25 ) Total EBIT $ 1,220 $ 1,227 $ 1,179 Less: Interest expense 42 58 96 Income before income taxes and minority interests $ 1,178 $ 1,169 $ 1,083 (1) Includes intercompany eliminations and unallocated corporate expenses.

There were no significant unallocated corporate expenses in 2007 or 2006. Geographic Markets Sales to international markets were 59 percent of total net sales in 2008, compared with 54 percent of total net sales in 2007 and 50 percent of total net sales in 2006. 44 Table of Contents A summary of net sales (dollar amount and percentage of total) by geographic territory follows (dollars in millions): Years ended December 31, (in millions) 2008 2007 2006 United States $ 5,817 41 % $ 6,007 46 % $ 5,719 50 % Asia/Australia 3,008 21 % 2,444 19 % 1,794 16 % Europe/CIS(1) 2,586 18 % 2,326 18 % 1,633 14 % Mexico/Latin America 1,473 10 % 1,171 9 % 886 8 % Canada 619 4 % 405 3 % 743 7 % Africa/Middle East 839 6 % 695 5 % 587 5 % Total international 8,525 59 % 7,041 54 % 5,643 50 % Total consolidated net sales $ 14,342 100 % $ 13,048 100 % $ 11,362 100 % (1) The Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) refers to a regional organization of former Soviet Republics. 45 Table of Contents LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Management's Assessment of Liquidity We believe our financial condition and liquidity remain strong despite the downturn in the U.S. and global economies. Our strong balance sheet and improved credit ratings enabled us to secure a new Three-Year Revolving Credit Facility in the third quarter of 2008. We assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate adequate cash to fund our operating, investing and financing activities. Cash provided by operations is our principal source of liquidity. As of December 31, 2008, other sources of liquidity include: cash and cash equivalents of $426 million, marketable securities of $77 million, $1.06 billion available under our revolving credit facility, $170 million, based on eligible receivables, available under our accounts receivable sales program and $194 million available under international credit facilities. The maturity schedule of our existing long-term debt does not require significant cash outflows in the intermediate term. Required annual principal payments range from $12 million to $32 million over each of the next five years. While the impact of the continued market volatility cannot be predicted, we believe our liquidity will provide us with the financial flexibility needed to fund working capital, capital expenditures, projected pension obligations, dividend payments and debt service obligations. We have considered the impact of recent market instability and credit availability in assessing the adequacy of our liquidity and capital resources. We expect that general market conditions could impact the rate at which we realize our receivables in the future and could impact eligible receivables under our accounts receivable program, however, we expect to generate positive cash flow from operations in 2009. We will continue to diligently monitor our receivables for potential slowing in collections that could occur as a result of softening economic conditions and our customer's access to credit. The overall decline in market valuations has impacted the current value of our pension trusts as discussed in more detail below. At this time, we are comfortable that the available credit capacity under our revolving credit facility is available to us. This assertion is based upon the fact that we drew upon our revolving credit facility with a prompt repayment in February 2009 to confirm participation by the banks included in the facility. As a result, we believe our access to liquidity sources has not been materially impacted by the current credit environment and we do not expect that it will be materially impacted in the near future. There can be no assurance, however, that the cost or availability of future borrowings, if any, in the debt markets or our credit facilities will not be materially impacted by the ongoing capital market disruptions. A significant portion of our cash flows is generated outside the U.S. More than half of our cash and cash equivalents and most of our marketable securities at December 31, 2008, are denominated in foreign currencies. We manage our worldwide cash requirements considering available funds among the many subsidiaries through which we conduct our business and the cost effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed. The repatriation of cash balances from certain subsidiaries could have adverse tax consequences; however, those balances are generally available without legal restrictions to fund ordinary business operations at the local level. We have and will continue to transfer cash from these subsidiaries to us and to other international subsidiaries when it is cost effective to do so. 46 Table of Contents Working Capital Summary We fund our working capital with cash from operations and short-term borrowings when necessary. Various assets and liabilities, including short-term debt, can fluctuate significantly from month to month depending on short-term liquidity needs. As a result, working capital is a prime focus of management attention. 2008 2007 in millions Current assets $ 4,713 $ 4,815 Current liabilities 2,639 2,711 Working capital $ 2,074 $ 2,104 Current ratio 1.79 1.78 Days' sales in receivables 48 53 Inventory turnover 6.2 6.5 Current assets decreased $102 million, primarily due to a $216 million decrease in receivables due to lower sales in the fourth quarter, a $151 million decrease in cash (see Cash Flows below), and a decrease of $43 million in marketable securities due to the decline in the overall market. These decreases were partially offset by a $146 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets, a $91 million increase in inventory and a $71 million increase in deferred income taxes. The increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets was primarily due to the increase in refundable income taxes. Current liabilities decreased $72 million, primarily due to a decrease in accounts payable of $254 million due to reduced purchases in the fourth quarter, a decrease in accrued compensation, benefits and retirement costs of $77 million and a decrease in short-term borrowings of $50 million. These decreases were offset by an increase of $212 million in other accrued expenses and an increase in accrued warranty of $97 million. The increase in other accrued expenses was primarily due to the recognition of liabilities related to commodity and currency hedges, increased deferred revenue and increased workers compensation accruals. Cash Flows Cash and cash equivalents decreased by $151 million during the year ended December 31, 2008. The change in cash and cash equivalents is as follows: 2008 2007 2006 in millions Net cash provided by operating activities $ 987 $ 810 $ 840 Net cash used in investing activities (848 ) (515 ) (277 ) Net cash used in financing activities (237 ) (576 ) (508 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash (53 ) 18 6 Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents $ (151 ) $ (263 ) $ 61 Operating Activities 2008 vs. 2007 Net cash provided by operating activities increased $177 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to 2007. In both 2008 and 2007, our principal source of cash from operations was net income of $755 million and $739 million, respectively, which reflected strong operational performance in both years. For 2008, the net income contribution was partially offset by a growth in working capital of $267 million and pension contributions of $102 million. The growth in 2008 working capital was 47 Table of Contents largely driven by higher inventories of $251 million and lower accounts payable of $174 million which was partially offset by higher accrued expenses of $124 million and a decrease in accounts receivable of $88 million. The increase in inventory was primarily to support strong business growth while the decrease in accounts payable was more reflective of early shutdowns in many of our manufacturing facilities at the close of 2008, as demand softened throughout the fourth quarter. The increase in accrued expenses was primarily due to an increase in warranty expense and the decrease in accounts receivable was driven by the early shutdown and softening demand. For 2007, working capital increased by $139 million as sales and production growth generated a combined increase in inventory and accounts receivable of $458 million. However, this amount was largely funded by a $353 million increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, also in support of strong volumes. In addition, pension contributions of $250 million offset strong net income performance. Pensions The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon a variety of variables and assumptions including return on invested assets, market interest rates and levels of voluntary contributions to the plans. As the result of the ongoing credit crisis and the related market recession, our pension assets have experienced significant deterioration during 2008. Through the end of 2008, short-term returns for both our U.S. and U.K. pension plans are significantly below our long-term expected rate of return of 8.25 percent and 7.25 percent, respectively, used in our assumptions due to adverse conditions in the equity markets. As a result of losses experienced in global equity markets which began at the end of the third quarter and accelerated in the fourth quarter, our pension funds had significant negative returns for 2008, which resulted in a $695 million ($445 million after-tax) charge to shareholders' equity in the fourth quarter and thus will create increased pension costs in 2009. Approximately 96 percent of our pension plan assets are invested in highly liquid investments such as equity and fixed income securities. The remaining four percent of our plan assets are invested in less liquid but market valued investments, including real estate and private equity. We made pension contributions of $102 million to our pension plans in 2008. We anticipate making contributions of $125 million to $135 million to our pension plans in 2009. Expected contributions to our defined pension plans in 2009 will meet or exceed the current funding requirements. Claims and premiums for other postretirement benefits are expected to approximate $53 million in 2009. The $102 million of pension contributions in 2008 included voluntary contributions of $70 million. These contributions and payments include payments from Company funds either to increase pension plan assets or to make direct payments to plan participants. 2007 vs. 2006 Net cash provided by operating activities declined $30 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to 2006. In both 2007 and 2006, our principal source of cash from operations was net income of $739 million and $715 million, respectively, which reflected strong operational performance in both years. For 2007, working capital increased by $139 million as sales and production growth generated a combined increase in inventory and accounts receivable of $458 million. However, this amount was largely funded by a $353 million increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities. In addition, pension contributions of $250 million offset net income performance. For 2006, working capital increased by $191 million as sales and production growth generated a combined increase in inventory and accounts receivable of $459 million which was partially funded by a $272 million increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities. In addition, pension contributions of $266 million offset strong net income performance. 48 Table of Contents Investing Activities 2008 vs. 2007 Net cash used in investing activities increased $333 million for the year ended 2008, compared to 2007. The increase was primarily due to a $190 million increase in capital expenditures, higher investments in businesses of $122 million related to the purchase of three previously independent distributors and the acquisition of Consolidated Diesel Corporation, a manufacturing facility (see Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information), increased cash flows for undesignated hedges of $39 million and higher investments in and advances to equity investees of $23 million. These increases were partially offset by a $29 million increase in the proceeds from the sale of equity investments due to the sale of the European Engine Alliance in 2008 (see Note 21 to our Consolidated Financial Statements ). Capital expenditures for the year ended 2008 increased 54 percent over 2007 to support our growth, and included investments to increase capacity and to fund development of our new products. Our investments in capacity improvements and development of new products accelerated across all of our businesses. We continue to invest approximately 35 percent of our capital in low-cost regions of the world to further leverage our opportunities for cost reduction and future growth opportunities. Capital expenditures for 2008 were $543 million. In preparation for the challenging economic climate expected in 2009, we have tightened capital expenditures to preserve cash during the recession, and as a result, expect an approximate 30 percent reduction of spending from 2008 levels. This spending excludes any assets that may need to be purchased as a result of the flood. We anticipate remaining flood related expenditures will range from $55 million to $65 million and will occur over the next four quarters. 2007 vs. 2006 Net cash used in investing activities increased $238 million in 2007, compared to 2006. The increase was primarily due to a $104 million increase in capital expenditures, a $57 million outflow for the purchase of long-term investments, an increase of $48 million in cash used for investments in and advances to equity investees and an increased outflow of $18 million for the acquisition of businesses, the majority of which was to acquire the remaining 50 percent equity ownership in a 50/50 joint venture. 49 Table of Contents Capital expenditures for the year ended 2007 increased 42 percent over 2006 to support our growth, and included investments to increase capacity and to fund development of our new products. Financing Activities 2008 vs. 2007 Net cash used in financing activities decreased $339 million in 2008, compared to 2007. The majority of the decrease in cash outflows was due to the decrease in repurchase of common stock of $207 million, the increase in proceeds from borrowings of $61 million, the $50 million increase in proceeds from sale of stock held by employee benefit trust and a $45 million increase in net borrowings under short-term credit arrangements. These fluctuations were partially offset by the increase in dividend payments of $33 million. Our total debt was $698 million as of December 31, 2008, compared with $674 million at December 31, 2007. Total debt as a percent of our total capital, including total long-term debt, was 17.8 percent at December 31, 2008, compared to 16.5 percent at December 31, 2007. The 2008 debt to capital ratio was negatively impacted by a $675 million ($433 million after tax) charge to shareholders' equity to recognize the funded status of our defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans. 2007 vs. 2006 Net cash used in financing activities increased $68 million in 2007, compared to 2006. The majority of the increase in cash outflows is due to the increase in repurchases of common stock of $214 million and a decrease in the proceeds from borrowings of $79 million, which was partially offset by a $256 million decrease in payments on borrowings and capital leases. Revolving Credit Agreement On June 30, 2008, we entered into a Three-Year Revolving Credit Agreement, dated as of June 30, 2008 (the "Credit Agreement"), with a syndicate of lenders and issuers named therein. The Credit Agreement provides a $1.1 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the "Credit Facility"), the proceeds of which are to be used to provide working capital or for other general corporate purposes of Cummins. The Credit Facility matures on June 30, 2011. The Credit Facility is unsecured and amounts payable under it will rank pro rata with all other unsecured, unsubordinated indebtedness of Cummins. A portion of the Credit Facility, up to $100 million, is available for swingline loans denominated in U.S. dollars. Loans will bear interest at (i) a base rate or (ii) a rate equal to LIBOR plus an applicable margin based on the credit ratings of Cummins outstanding senior unsecured long-term debt. Based on our current long-term debt ratings, the applicable margin on LIBOR loans was 2.0 percent per annum as of December 31, 2008. Loans may be prepaid without premium or penalty, subject to customary breakage costs. The Credit Facility replaces $650 million in aggregate principal amount of a revolving credit facility (Former Credit Agreement) maintained by Cummins which was terminated effective June 30, 2008. The Credit Agreement includes covenants substantially similar to those in the Former Credit Agreement, including, among others, (a) a leverage ratio, (b) fixed charge coverage ratio, (c) limitations on priority indebtedness, (d) limitations on our ability to consummate a merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets and (e) limitations on our ability to change the nature of our business. The obligation of Cummins to pay amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility may be accelerated upon the occurrence of an "Event of Default" as defined in the Credit Agreement. Such 50 Table of Contents Events of Default include, among others, (a) Cummins failure to pay the principal of, or interest on, borrowings under the Credit Facility, (b) any representation or warranty of Cummins in the Credit Agreement proving to be materially false or misleading, (c) Cummins breach of any of its covenants contained in the Credit Agreement and (d) the bankruptcy or insolvency of Cummins. There are no material relationships between Cummins or its affiliates and any of the Lenders, other than as described above. Repurchase of Common Stock We announced in February 2009 that we have temporarily suspended our stock repurchase program to conserve cash. In December 2007, the Board of Directors authorized the acquisition of up to $500 million of Cummins common stock. We began making purchases under the plan in March 2008 and purchased $128 million of stock during 2008 at an average cost of $55.49 per share. In July 2006, the Board of Directors authorized us to acquire up to eight million shares of Cummins common stock. In 2007, we repurchased approximately $335 million of common stock, at an average cost of $55.76 per share, representing approximately six million shares. This concluded the share repurchase program authorized by the Board of Directors in July 2006. Quarterly Dividends In July 2008, the Board of Directors voted to increase the quarterly cash dividend per share by 40 percent and increased cash dividends from $0.125 per common share to $0.175 per common share. Dividends per share paid to common shareholders for the years ended December 31, were as follows: Quarterly Dividends 2008 2007 2006 First Quarter $ 0.125 $ 0.09 $ 0.075 Second Quarter 0.125 0.09 0.075 Third Quarter 0.175 0.125 0.09 Fourth Quarter 0.175 0.125 0.09 Total dividends paid to common shareholders for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 were $122 million, $89 million, and $66 million, respectively. Declaration and payment of dividends in the future depends upon income and liquidity position, among other factors. Financial Covenants and Credit Rating A number of our contractual obligations and financing agreements, such as our revolving credit facility and our equipment sale-leaseback agreements have restrictive covenants and/or pricing modifications that may be triggered in the event of downward revisions to our corporate credit rating. There have been no events in 2008 to impede our compliance with these covenants. On March 10, 2008, Standard & Poor's (S&P) upgraded our senior unsecured debt ratings from "BBB-" to "BBB" and revised our outlook to stable citing Cummins' improved operating performance over the past several years, including during the expected emissions-related downturn in heavy-duty truck demand in 2007, combined with significant on- and off-balance sheet debt reduction, and increased business diversification. On June 17, 2008, Fitch upgraded our senior unsecured debt ratings from "BBB" to "BBB+" citing Cummins' recent market share gains and improving credit profile, including improvement in Cummins' geographic and business diversification. 51 Table of Contents Our current ratings and outlook from each of the credit rating agencies are shown in the table below. Credit Rating Agency Senior L-T Debt Rating S-T Debt Rating Outlook Moody's Investors Service, Inc. Baa3 Non-Prime Stable Standard & Poor's BBB NR Stable Fitch BBB+ BBB+ Stable CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND OTHER COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS A summary of payments due for our contractual obligations and commercial commitments, as of December 31, 2008, is shown in the tables below: Contractual Cash Obligations 2009 2010-2011 2012-2013 After 2013 Total (in millions) Loans payable $ 39 $ $ $ $ 39 Long-term debt and capital lease obligations(1) 94 168 122 1,540 1,924 Operating leases 54 70 30 43 197 Capital expenditures 163 84 9 256 Purchase commitments for inventory 443 2 445 Other purchase commitments 118 45 4 167 Pension funding(2) 28 28 Other postretirement benefits 53 106 100 244 503 Total $ 992 $ 475 $ 265 $ 1,827 $ 3,559 (1) Includes principal payments and expected interest payments based on the terms of the obligations. In February of 2009, we renegotiated our sale and leaseback transaction to extend the term for an additional two years and removed the requirement to provide residual insurance. The lease obligations are included in this line item. See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our sale and leaseback transaction. (2) We are contractually obligated to fund $28 million in 2009; however, our expected range of total pension contributions for 2009 is approximately $125 million to $135 million. Due to the ongoing capital market disruptions we are unable to predict funding requirements beyond 2009. The contractual obligations reported above exclude our unrecognized tax benefits of $57 million, all of which is non-current, as of December 31, 2008. We are not able to reasonably estimate the 52 Table of Contents period in which cash outflows relating to uncertain tax contingencies could occur. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.

See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the commitment. OFF BALANCE SHEET FINANCING Sale of Accounts Receivable In July 2007, we amended our agreement with a financial institution to sell a designated pool of trade receivables to Cummins Trade Receivables, LLC (CTR), a wholly-owned special purpose subsidiary, to extend the facility until July 2010, and raised the purchase limitation from $200 million to $400 million. The agreement also provides us with an option to increase the purchase limitation up to $500 million upon approval. As necessary, CTR may transfer a direct interest in its receivables, without recourse, to the financial institution. To maintain a balance in the designated pools of receivables sold, we sell new receivables to CTR as existing receivables are collected. Receivables sold to CTR in which an interest is not transferred to the financial institution are included in "Receivables, net" on our Consolidated Balance Sheets . The maximum interest in sold receivables that can be outstanding at any point in time is limited to the lesser of $400 million or the amount of eligible receivables held by CTR. There are no provisions in this agreement that require us to maintain a minimum investment credit rating; however, the terms of the agreement contain the same financial covenants as our revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2008, the amount available under this program was $170 million. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, there were no amounts outstanding under this program. Financing Arrangements for Related Parties In accordance with the provisions of various joint venture agreements, we may purchase and/or sell products and components from/to the joint ventures and the joint ventures may sell products and components to unrelated parties. The transfer price of products purchased from the joint ventures may differ from normal selling prices. Certain joint venture agreements transfer product to us at cost, some transfer product to us on a cost-plus basis and other agreements provide for the transfer of products at market value. APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES A summary of our significant accounting policies is included in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements of this annual report which discusses accounting policies that we have selected from acceptable alternatives. There were no accounting policies adopted during 2008 that had a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Our Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP which often requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect 53 Table of Contents the reported amounts presented and disclosed in the financial statements. Our management reviews these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience, changes in business conditions and other relevant factors they believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. In any given reporting period, our actual results may differ from the estimates and assumptions used in preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements. Critical accounting estimates are defined as follows: the estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the estimate was made; different estimates reasonably could have been used; or if changes in the estimate are reasonably likely to occur from period to period and the change would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Our senior management has discussed the development and selection of our accounting policies, related accounting estimates and the disclosures set forth below with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. We believe our critical accounting estimates include those addressing the estimation of liabilities for warranty programs, accounting for income taxes, pension benefits and annual assessment of recoverability of goodwill. Warranty Programs We estimate and record a liability for warranty programs, primarily base warranty and other than product recalls, at the time our products are sold. Our estimates are based on historical experience and reflect management's best estimates of expected costs at the time products are sold and subsequent adjustment to those expected costs when actual costs differ. As a result of the uncertainty surrounding the nature and frequency of product recall programs, the liability for such programs is recorded when we commit to a recall action, which generally occurs when it is announced. Our warranty liability is generally affected by component failure rates, repair costs and the time of failure. Future events and circumstances related to these factors could materially change our estimates and require adjustments to our liability. New product launches require a greater use of judgment in developing estimates until historical experience becomes available. Product specific experience is typically available four or five quarters after product launch, with a clear experience trend evident eight quarters after launch. We generally record warranty expense for new products upon shipment using a factor based upon historical experience only in the first year, a blend of actual product and historical experience in the second year and product specific experience thereafter. Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements contains a summary of the activity in our warranty liability account for 2008 and 2007 including adjustments to pre-existing warranties. Accounting for Income Taxes We determine our provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Future tax benefits of tax loss and credit carryforwards are also recognized as deferred tax assets. We evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax assets each quarter by assessing the likelihood of future profitability and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize our net deferred tax assets. At December 31, 2008, we recorded net deferred tax assets of $835 million. These assets include $40 million for the value of tax loss and credit carryforwards. A valuation allowance of $25 million has been recorded to reduce the tax assets to the net value management believes is more likely than not to be realized. In the event our operating performance deteriorates, future assessments could conclude that a larger valuation allowance will be needed to further reduce the deferred tax assets. In addition, we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to tax audits in these jurisdictions. These audits can involve complex issues, which may require an extended period of time to resolve. We reduce our net tax assets for the estimated additional tax and interest that may result from tax authorities disputing uncertain tax positions we 54 Table of Contents have taken and we believe we have made adequate provision for income taxes for all years that are subject to audit based upon the latest information available. A more complete description of our income taxes and the future benefits of our tax loss and credit carryforwards is disclosed in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Pension Benefits We sponsor a number of pension plans primarily in the U.S. and the U.K. and to a lesser degree in various other countries. In the U.S. and the U.K. we have several major defined benefit plans that are separately funded. We account for our pension programs in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 87, "Employers' Accounting for Pensions," (SFAS 87) and SFAS No. 158, "Employers' Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132 (R)" (SFAS 158). SFAS 87 requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined using an actuarial basis. As a result, our pension benefit programs are based on a number of statistical and judgmental assumptions that attempt to anticipate future events and are used in calculating the expense and liability related to our plans. These assumptions include discount rates used to value liabilities, assumed rates of return on plan assets, future compensation increases, employee turnover rates, actuarial assumptions relating to retirement age, mortality rates and participant withdrawals. The actuarial assumptions we use may differ significantly from actual results due to changing economic conditions, participant life span and withdrawal rates. These differences may result in a material impact to the amount of net periodic pension expense to be recorded in our Consolidated Financial Statements in the future. SFAS 158 requires an employer to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur through comprehensive income. The Statement also requires an employer to measure the funded status of a plan as of the date of its year-end statement of financial position. We adopted SFAS 158, except for the measurement date change, as required on December 31, 2006. We adopted the measurement date change as of January 1, 2008. The expected long-term return on plan assets is used in calculating the net periodic pension expense. We considered several factors in developing our expected rate of return on plan assets. The long-term rate of return considers historical returns and expected returns on current and projected asset allocations and is generally applied to a 5-year average market value of return. The long-term rate of return on plan assets represents an estimate of long-term returns on an investment portfolio consisting of a mixture of equities, fixed income, real estate and other miscellaneous investments. The differences between the actual return on plan assets and expected long-term return on plan assets are recognized in the asset value used to calculate net periodic expense over five years. The table below sets forth the expected return assumptions used to develop our pension expense for the period 2006-2008 and our expected rate for 2009. Long-Term Expected Return Assumptions 2009 2008 2007 2006 U.S. Plans 8.25 % 8.25 % 8.50 % 8.50 % Non-U.S. Plans 7.25 % 7.25 % 7.24 % 7.24 % A lower expected rate of return will increase our net periodic pension expense and reduce profitability. The difference between the expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred from recognition in our results of operations and, under certain circumstances such as when the difference exceeds 10 percent of the market value of plan assets or the projected benefit obligation (PBO), 55 Table of Contents amortized over future years of service. This is also true of changes to actuarial assumptions. As of December 31, 2008, we had net pension actuarial losses of $837 million and $322 million for the U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans, respectively. Under SFAS 158, the actuarial gains and losses are recognized and recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss. As these amounts exceed 10 percent of our PBO, the excess is amortized over the average remaining service lives of participating employees. The table below sets forth the net periodic pension expense for the period 2006-2008 and our expected expense for 2009. 2009 2008 2007 2006 Pension Expense (in millions) $ 82 $ 71 $ 98 $ 120 The decrease in periodic pension expense in 2008 was due to higher expected returns on assets driven by the significant pension contributions we made in 2007. Another key assumption used in the development of the net periodic pension expense is the discount rate. The discount rates used to develop our net periodic pension expense are set forth in the table below. Discount Rates 2009 2008 2007 2006 U.S. Plans 6.20 % 6.10 % 5.60 % 5.60 % Non-U.S. Plans 6.20 % 5.80 % 4.96 % 4.95 % Changes in the discount rate assumptions will impact the interest cost component of the net periodic pension expense calculation. The discount rate enables us to state expected future cash payments for benefits as a present value on the measurement date. The guidelines for setting this rate are discussed in EITF D-36 which suggests the use of a high-quality corporate bond rate. We used bond information provided by Standard & Poors for the U.S. and iBoxx for the U.K. All bonds used to develop our hypothetical portfolio in the U.S. and U.K. were high-quality, non-callable bonds (AA- or better) as of December 31, 2008. However, for the U.K., we removed the bonds from the index that were downgraded during December 2008, but had not yet been removed from the iBoxx AA index at the measurement date. The average yield of this hypothetical bond portfolio was used as the benchmark for determining the discount rate to be used to value the obligations of the plans subject to SFAS 87 and SFAS No. 106, "Employer's Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions." In addition, for the U.S. plans, the cash flows were matched to the Citigroup Pension Discount Curve as of December 31, 2008. The results of that exercise provided a 6.257 percent rate which confirmed our selection. Our model called for 60 years of benefit payments. For the U.S. plans, the sum of the cash flows from the 60 bonds matched the cash flow from the benefit payment stream upon completion of the process. The number of bonds purchased for each issue was used to determine the price of the entire portfolio. The discount rate benchmark was set to the internal rate of return needed to discount the cash flows to arrive at the portfolio price. In developing the U.K. discount rate, excess cash flows resulted in the early years of the 60 year period when the sum of the cash flow from the bonds maturing in later years exceeded the benefit payments in early years, thus no bonds maturing in early years are needed. As a result, the price of the entire portfolio of bonds was too high because all benefit payments were covered with excess cash flow remaining. We made no adjustment to the cash flow and the discount rate was determined as the internal rate of return needed to discount the cash flows to arrive at the portfolio price. 56 Table of Contents The table below sets forth the estimated impact on our 2009 net periodic pension expense relative to a change in the discount rate and a change in the expected rate of return on plan assets. Impact on Pension Expense Increase (Decrease) in millions Discount rate used to value liabilities: 0.25 percent increase $ (4 ) 0.25 percent decrease 4 Expected rate of return on assets: 1 percent increase (25 ) 1 percent decrease 25 The above sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time. A higher discount rate decreases the plan obligations and decreases our net periodic pension expense. A lower discount rate increases the plan obligations and increases our net periodic pension expense. It should be noted that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear. Our investment policies in the U.S. and U.K. provide for the rebalancing of assets to maintain our long-term strategic asset allocation. We are committed to its long-term strategy and do not attempt to time the market given empirical evidence that asset allocation is more critical than individual asset or investment manager selection. Rebalancing of the assets has and continues to occur. The rebalancing is critical to having the proper weighting of assets to achieve the expected total portfolio returns. Based upon our target asset allocations it is anticipated that our U.S. investment policy will generate an average annual return over the 20-year projection period equal to or in excess of 7.5 percent approximately 50 percent of the time while returns of 9.0 percent or greater are anticipated 25 percent of the time. Except for the short-term adverse conditions in the equity markets in 2008, our recent three-year average rates of return have exceeded 10.0 percent. As a result, based on the historical returns and forward-looking return expectations, we believe an investment return assumption of 8.25 percent per year for U.S. pension assets is reasonable. The methodology used to determine the rate of return on pension plan assets in the U.K. was based on establishing an equity-risk premium over current long-term bond yields adjusted based on target asset allocations. Our strategy with respect to our investments in pension plan assets is to be invested with a long-term outlook. Therefore, the risk and return balance of our asset portfolio should reflect a long-term horizon. Our pension plan asset allocation at December 31, 2008 and 2007 and target allocation for 2009 are as follows: Percentage of Plan Assets at December 31, Target Allocation 2009 Investment description 2008 2007 Equity securities 55-60 % 56.0 % 63.5 % Fixed income 30-35 % 39.6 % 32.3 % Real estate/Other 7-10 % 4.4 % 4.2 % Total 100.0 % 100.0 % Actual cash funding for our pension plans is governed by employee benefit and tax laws and the Pension Protection Act of 2006 ("the Act"). The Act extends the use of an average corporate bond rate for determining current liabilities for funding purposes. Among its many provisions, the Act establishes a 100 percent funding target for plan years beginning after December 31, 2007, which has now been extended by the U.S. Congress due to the recession. Our funding strategy is to make contributions to our various qualified plans in accordance with statutory funding requirements and any additional 57 Table of Contents contributions we determine are appropriate. The table below sets forth our pension contributions for the period 2007-2008 and our expected range of contributions for 2009. 2009 2008 2007 Contributions (in millions) $ 125-135 $ 102 $ 250 Contributions beyond 2009 will depend on the funded status of our plans at that time in relation to the targeted funding established under the Act. Our qualified pension plans in the U.S. and outside the U.S. were under-funded at December 31, 2008, by a total of $581 million due to pension trust asset performance. Under SFAS 158, the actuarial gains and losses and prior service costs (credits) are recognized and recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss. Increases in actuarial losses reduced our shareholders' equity by $445 million (after tax) in 2008. The increases resulted from plan asset performance in 2008. Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements provides a summary of our pension benefit plan activity, the funded status of our plans and the amounts recognized in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Annual Assessment for Recoverability of Goodwill Under the provisions of SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" (SFAS 142), the carrying value of goodwill is reviewed annually. The fair value of each reporting unit was estimated by discounting the future cash flows less requirements for working capital and fixed asset additions. Our valuation method requires us to make projections of revenue, operating expenses, working capital investment and fixed asset additions for the reporting units over a multi-year period. Additionally, management must estimate its weighted-average cost of capital for each reporting unit for use as a discount rate. The discounted cash flows are compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit and, if less than the carrying value, a separate valuation of the goodwill is required to determine if an impairment loss has occurred. As of the end of the third quarter in 2008, we performed the annual impairment assessment required by SFAS 142 and determined that our goodwill was not impaired. At December 31, 2008, our recorded goodwill was $362 million. Changes in our projections or estimates, a deterioration of our operating results and the related cash flow effect or a significant increase in the discount rate could decrease the estimated fair value of our reporting units and result in a future impairment of goodwill. RECENTLY ADOPTED AND RECENTY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109" (FIN 48), which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement process for recording in the financial statements, uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. In addition, FIN 48 provides guidance on the derecognition, classification, accounting in interim periods and disclosure requirements for uncertain tax positions. The adoption of FIN 48, effective January 1, 2007, did not have a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements . See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the adoption of this standard. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements" (SFAS 157), which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The adoption of SFAS 157, effective January 1, 2008, did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements . See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the adoption of this standard. 58 Table of Contents In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, "Employers' Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R)" (SFAS 158). This statement requires balance sheet recognition of the overfunded or underfunded status of pension and postretirement benefit plans. In addition, the measurement date (the date at which plan assets and the benefit obligation are measured) is required to be the company's fiscal year end. During 2006, we adopted the provisions (except for the measurement date change) of SFAS 158, "Employers' Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R)," which resulted in a $94 million non-cash charge to equity. We adopted the measurement date provisions of SFAS 158 effective January 1, 2008. The majority of our pension and postretirement plans previously used a November 30 measurement date. All plans are now measured at December 31, consistent with the company's fiscal year end. The non-cash effect of the adoption of the measurement date provisions of SFAS 158 decreased shareholders' equity by approximately $10 million ($7 million after-tax) and increased long-term liabilities by approximately $10 million. There was no effect on our results of operations. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the adoption of this standard. Accounting Pronouncements Issued But Not Yet Effective In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), "Business Combinations" (SFAS 141R), which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. SFAS 141R makes significant changes to both the accounting and disclosures related to the acquisition of a business and could materially impact how we account for future business combination transactions. Because the standard will only impact transactions entered into after January 1, 2009, SFAS 141R will not impact our Consolidated Financial Statements upon adoption. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, "Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements" (SFAS 160), which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. SFAS 160 amends Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51, "Consolidated Financial Statements" (ARB 51) and establishes accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. For Cummins, the most significant impact of the standard, at adoption, will be to reclass a majority of our minority interests ($250 million at December 31, 2008) to be included as a part of equity, which may affect certain performance and equity ratios. We are currently evaluating the potential additional impact that SFAS 160 may have on our Consolidated Financial Statements . In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, "Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" (SFAS 161), which is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008. SFAS 161 amends SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" (SFAS 133) and requires enhanced disclosures about a company's derivative and hedging activities. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS 161 to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements , but are still evaluating the additional disclosure requirements.
