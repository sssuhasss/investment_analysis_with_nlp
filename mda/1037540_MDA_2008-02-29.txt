Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report. Forward-Looking Statements This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, principally, but not only, under the captions Business-Business and Growth Strategies, Risk Factors and Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. We caution investors that any forward-looking statements in this report, or which management may make orally or in writing from time to time, are based on management beliefs and on assumptions made by, and information currently available to, management. When used, the words anticipate, believe, estimate, expect, intend, may, might, plan, project, result should, will, and similar expressions which do not relate solely to historical matters are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions and are not guarantees of future performance, which may be affected by known and unknown risks, trends, uncertainties and factors that are beyond our control. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may differ materially from those anticipated, estimated or projected by the forward-looking statements. We caution you that, while forward-looking statements reflect our good faith beliefs when we make them, they are not guarantees of future performance and are impacted by actual events when they occur after we make such statements. We expressly disclaim any responsibility to update our forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Accordingly, investors should use caution in relying on past forward-looking statements, which are based on results and trends at the time they are made, to anticipate future results or trends. Some of the risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward-looking statements include, among others, the following: general risks affecting the real estate industry (including, without limitation, the inability to enter into or renew leases, dependence on tenants financial condition, and competition from other developers, owners and operators of real estate); failure to manage effectively our growth and expansion into new markets and sub-markets or to integrate acquisitions and developments successfully; 40 Table of Contents risks and uncertainties affecting property development and construction (including, without limitation, construction delays, cost overruns, inability to obtain necessary permits and public opposition to such activities); risks associated with the availability and terms of financing and the use of debt to fund acquisitions and developments, including the risk associated with interest rates impacting the cost and/or availability of financing; risks associated with forward interest rate contracts and the effectiveness of such arrangements; risks associated with downturns in the national and local economies, increases in interest rates, and volatility in the securities markets; risks associated with actual or threatened terrorist attacks; costs of compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act and other similar laws; potential liability for uninsured losses and environmental contamination; risks associated with our potential failure to qualify as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended; possible adverse changes in tax and environmental laws; the impact of newly adopted accounting principles on our accounting policies and on period-to-period comparisons of financial results; risks associated with possible state and local tax audits; and risks associated with our dependence on key personnel whose continued service is not guaranteed. The risks included here are not exhaustive. Other sections of this report, including Part I, Item 1A- Risk Factors, include additional factors that could adversely affect our business and financial performance. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors, nor can we assess the impact of all such risk factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results. Investors should also refer to our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for future periods and current reports on Form 8-K as we file them with the SEC, and to other materials we may furnish to the public from time to time through current reports on Form 8-K or otherwise. Overview We are a fully integrated self-administered and self-managed REIT and one of the largest owners and developers of Class A office properties in the United States. Our properties are concentrated in five markets Boston, midtown Manhattan, Washington, D.C., San Francisco and Princeton, NJ. We generate revenue and cash primarily by leasing our Class A office space to our tenants. Factors we consider when we lease space include the creditworthiness of the tenant, the length of the lease, the rental rate to be paid, the costs of tenant improvements, current and anticipated operating costs and real estate taxes, our current and anticipated vacancy, current and anticipated future demand for office space generally and general economic factors. We also generate cash through the sale of assets, which may be either non-core assets or core assets that command premiums from real estate investors. The impact of the current state of the economy, including rising unemployment and constrained capital, on our company is unknown. Our core strategy has always been to operate in supply constrained markets with high barriers to entry and to focus on executing long-term leases with financially strong tenants. Historically, this combination has tended to reduce our exposure to down cycles and, based on our current occupancy and recent 41 Table of Contents leasing success, lack of available supply in our markets and limited lease rollover, we believe we are well positioned to withstand a slowing economy. The state of the debt capital markets is continuing to deteriorate with many lenders, including CMBS providers, out of the market and others such as banks and life insurance companies tightening their credit standards and cautiously allocating capital. We believe our current liquidity, including our cash balances and the availability under our $605 million line of credit, is sufficient to meet our foreseeable capital needs and helps to insulate us from the difficulties in the capital markets. In fact, we believe that, given our strong balance sheet and liquidity, we will have opportunities to capitalize on the current environment and we intend to seek acquisitions of high-quality real estate at attractive returns. Although we intend to pursue such acquisitions, we continue to believe that the returns we can generate from developments will be greater than those we can expect from acquisitions. Since the beginning of 2005 we have completed over $4.3 billion of asset sales and have redeployed a significant amount of the proceeds into our development pipeline. We started approximately $1.7 billion of developments in 2007, including commencing construction on our approximately 1.0 million square foot office tower in New York City at 250 West 55th Street and on our 815,000 square foot mixed-use Russia Wharf development in Boston. We entered 2008 with an active development program of approximately $2.1 billion, and although we will consider additional asset sales, we do not expect our sales volume to be comparable to that of prior years and we currently do not have any assets on the market. We believe our focus on new development will enhance our long-term return on equity and earnings growth as these developments are placed in-service in 2009, 2010 and 2011. Update on Recent Regulatory Initiatives On August 31, 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB ) issued proposed FASB Staff Position No. APB 14-a Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement) (the proposed FSP ) that would require the liability and equity components of convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion (including partial cash settlement) to be separately accounted for in a manner that reflects the issuer nonconvertible debt borrowing rate. The proposed FSP, if issued as currently contemplated, would require that the initial debt proceeds from the sale of Boston Properties Limited Partnership ( BPLP ) $862.5 million of 2.875% exchangeable senior notes due 2037 and $450.0 million of 3.75% exchangeable senior notes due 2036 be allocated between a liability component and an equity component in a manner that reflects interest expense at the interest rate of similar nonconvertible debt. The resulting debt discount would be amortized over the period during which the debt is expected to be outstanding (i.e., through the first optional redemption dates) as additional non-cash interest expense. The proposed FSP would be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2007 and interim periods within those fiscal years, and it would be applied retrospectively to BPLP outstanding exchangeable senior notes for all periods presented. Based on our current understanding of the application of the proposed FSP, this would result in an aggregate of approximately $18 million (net of incremental capitalized interest) of additional non-cash interest expense for fiscal 2008. Excluding the impact of capitalized interest, the additional non-cash interest expense would be approximately $20 million to $22 million, and this amount (before netting) will increase in subsequent reporting periods through the first optional redemption dates as the debt accretes to its par value over the same period. There can be no assurance that the proposed FSP will be issued in the form currently contemplated by the FASB, or at all, and therefore its ultimate impact on our interest expense may differ materially from the aforementioned estimate. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. These judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. If our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different, it is 42 Table of Contents possible that different accounting policies would have been applied resulting in a different presentation of our financial statements. From time to time, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. In the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results, adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information. Below is a discussion of accounting policies that we consider critical in that they may require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. Real Estate Upon acquisitions of real estate, we assess the fair value of acquired tangible and intangible assets, including land, buildings, tenant improvements, above- and below-market leases, origination costs, acquired in-place leases, other identified intangible assets and assumed liabilities in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ( SFAS ) No. 141, Business Combinations and allocate the purchase price to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities, including land at appraised value and buildings at replacement cost. We assess and consider fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize discount and/or capitalization rates that we deem appropriate, as well as available market information. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including the historical operating results, known and anticipated trends, and market and economic conditions. The fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property considers the value of the property as if it were vacant. We also consider an allocation of purchase price of other acquired intangibles, including acquired in-place leases that may have a customer relationship intangible value, including (but not limited to) the nature and extent of the existing relationship with the tenants, the tenants credit quality and expectations of lease renewals. Based on our acquisitions to date, our allocation to customer relationship intangible assets has been immaterial. We record acquired above- and below-market leases at their fair values (using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) equal to the difference between (1) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to each in-place lease and (2) management estimate of fair market lease rates for each corresponding in-place lease, measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease for above-market leases and the initial term plus the term of any below-market fixed rate renewal options for below-market leases. Other intangible assets acquired include amounts for in-place lease values that are based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant lease. Factors to be considered include estimates of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease-up periods considering current market conditions, and costs to execute similar leases. In estimating carrying costs, we include real estate taxes, insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease-up periods, depending on local market conditions. In estimating costs to execute similar leases, we consider leasing commissions, legal and other related expenses. Real estate is stated at depreciated cost. The cost of buildings and improvements includes the purchase price of property, legal fees and other acquisition costs. Costs directly related to the development of properties are capitalized. Capitalized development costs include interest, internal wages, property taxes, insurance, and other project costs incurred during the period of development. Management reviews its long-lived assets used in operations for impairment when there is an event or change in circumstances that indicates an impairment in value. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of its assets is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. If such impairment is present, an impairment loss is recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its fair value. The evaluation of anticipated cash flows is highly subjective and is based in part on assumptions regarding future occupancy, rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results in future periods. Since cash flows on properties considered to be long-lived assets to be held and used as defined by SFAS No. 144 Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, ( SFAS No. 144 ) are considered on an undiscounted basis to determine whether an asset has been impaired, our established strategy of holding properties over the long term directly decreases the likelihood of recording an impairment loss. If our strategy changes or market conditions otherwise dictate an earlier sale date, an impairment loss may be recognized and such loss could be material. If we determine that impairment has occurred, the affected assets must be reduced to their fair value. No such impairment losses have been recognized to date. 43 Table of Contents SFAS No. 144 requires that qualifying assets and liabilities and the results of operations that have been sold, or otherwise qualify as held for sale, be presented as discontinued operations in all periods presented if the property operations are expected to be eliminated and we will not have significant continuing involvement following the sale. The components of the property net income that is reflected as discontinued operations include the net gain (or loss) upon the disposition of the property held for sale, operating results, depreciation and interest expense (if the property is subject to a secured loan). We generally consider assets to be held for sale when the transaction has been approved by our Board of Directors, or a committee thereof, and there are no known significant contingencies relating to the sale, such that the property sale within one year is considered probable. Following the classification of a property as held for sale, no further depreciation is recorded on the assets. A variety of costs are incurred in the acquisition, development and leasing of properties. After the determination is made to capitalize a cost, it is allocated to the specific component of a project that is benefited. Determination of when a development project is substantially complete and capitalization must cease involves a degree of judgment. Our capitalization policy on development properties is guided by SFAS No. 34 Capitalization of Interest Cost and SFAS No. 67 Accounting for Costs and the Initial Rental Operations of Real Estate Projects. The costs of land and buildings under development include specifically identifiable costs. The capitalized costs include pre-construction costs essential to the development of the property, development costs, construction costs, interest costs, real estate taxes, salaries and related costs and other costs incurred during the period of development. We consider a construction project as substantially completed and held available for occupancy upon the completion of tenant improvements, but no later than one year from cessation of major construction activity. We cease capitalization on the portion (1) substantially completed and (2) occupied or held available for occupancy, and we capitalize only those costs associated with the portion under construction. Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures Except for ownership interests in variable interest entities, we account for our investments in joint ventures under the equity method of accounting because we exercise significant influence over, but do not control, these entities. These investments are recorded initially at cost, as Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures, and subsequently adjusted for equity in earnings and cash contributions and distributions. Any difference between the carrying amount of these investments on our balance sheet and the underlying equity in net assets is amortized as an adjustment to equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures over the life of the related asset. Under the equity method of accounting, our net equity is reflected within the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and our share of net income or loss from the joint ventures is included within the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The joint venture agreements may designate different percentage allocations among investors for profits and losses, however, our recognition of joint venture income or loss generally follows the joint venture distribution priorities, which may change upon the achievement of certain investment return thresholds. For ownership interests in variable interest entities, we consolidate those in which we are the primary beneficiary. Our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures are reviewed for impairment, periodically, if events or circumstances change indicating that the carrying amount of our investments may not be recoverable. The ultimate realization of our investment in unconsolidated joint ventures is dependent on a number of factors, including the performance of each investment and market conditions. We will record an impairment charge if we determine that a decline in the value of an unconsolidated joint venture is other than temporary. Revenue Recognition Base rental revenue is reported on a straight-line basis over the terms of our respective leases. In accordance with SFAS No. 141, we recognize rental revenue of acquired in-place above- and below-market leases at their fair values over the terms of the respective leases. Accrued rental income as reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets represents rental income recognized in excess of rent payments actually received pursuant to the terms of the individual lease agreements. 44 Table of Contents Our leasing strategy is generally to secure creditworthy tenants that meet our underwriting guidelines. Furthermore, following the initiation of a lease, we continue to actively monitor the tenant creditworthiness to ensure that all tenant related assets are recorded at their realizable value. When assessing tenant credit quality, we: review relevant financial information, including: financial ratios; net worth; debt to market capitalization; and liquidity; evaluate the depth and experience of the tenant management team; and assess the strength/growth of the tenant industry. As a result of the underwriting process, tenants are then categorized into one of three categories: (1) low risk tenants; (2) the tenant credit is such that we require collateral, in which case we: require a security deposit; and/or reduce upfront tenant improvement investments; or (3) the tenant credit is below our acceptable parameters. We maintain a rigorous process of monitoring the credit quality of our tenant base. We provide an allowance for doubtful accounts arising from estimated losses that could result from the tenant inability to make required current rent payments and an allowance against accrued rental income for future potential losses that we deem to be unrecoverable over the term of the lease. Tenant receivables are assigned a credit rating of 1-4 with a rating of 1 representing the highest possible rating with no allowance recorded and a rating of 4 representing the lowest credit rating, recording a full reserve against the receivable balance. Among the factors considered in determining the credit rating include: payment history; credit status and change in status (credit ratings for public companies are used as a primary metric); change in tenant space needs (i.e., expansion/downsize); tenant financial performance; economic conditions in a specific geographic region; and industry specific credit considerations. If our estimates of collectibility differ from the cash received, the timing and amount of our reported revenue could be impacted. The average remaining term of our in-place tenant leases was approximately 7.4 years as of December 31, 2007. The credit risk is mitigated by the high quality of our existing tenant base, reviews of prospective tenants risk profiles prior to lease execution and frequent monitoring of our portfolio to identify potential problem tenants. Recoveries from tenants, consisting of amounts due from tenants for common area maintenance, real estate taxes and other recoverable costs, are recognized as revenue in the period the expenses are incurred. Tenant reimbursements are recognized and presented in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force, or EITF, Issue 45 Table of Contents 99-19 Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, or Issue 99-19. Issue 99-19 requires that these reimbursements be recorded on a gross basis, as we are generally the primary obligor with respect to purchasing goods and services from third-party suppliers, have discretion in selecting the supplier and have credit risk. We also receive reimbursement of payroll and payroll related costs from third parties which we reflect on a net basis in accordance with Issue 99-19. Our hotel revenues are derived from room rentals and other sources such as charges to guests for long-distance telephone service, fax machine use, movie and vending commissions, meeting and banquet room revenue and laundry services. Hotel revenues are recognized as earned. We receive management and development fees from third parties. Management fees are recorded and earned based on a percentage of collected rents at the properties under management, and not on a straight-line basis, because such fees are contingent upon the collection of rents. We review each development agreement and record development fees on a straight-line basis or percentage of completion depending on the risk associated with each project. Profit on development fees earned from joint venture projects is recognized as revenue to the extent of the third party partners ownership interest. Gains on sales of real estate are recognized pursuant to the provisions of SFAS No. 66, Accounting for Sales of Real Estate. The specific timing of the sale is measured against various criteria in SFAS No. 66 related to the terms of the transactions and any continuing involvement in the form of management or financial assistance associated with the properties. If the sales criteria are not met, we defer gain recognition and account for the continued operations of the property by applying the finance, installment or cost recovery methods, as appropriate, until the sales criteria are met. Depreciation and Amortization We compute depreciation and amortization on our properties using the straight-line method based on estimated useful asset lives. In accordance with SFAS No. 141, we allocate the acquisition cost of real estate to land, building, tenant improvements, acquired above- and below-market leases, origination costs and acquired in-place leases based on an assessment of their fair value and depreciate or amortize these assets over their useful lives. The amortization of acquired above- and below-market leases and acquired in-place leases is recorded as an adjustment to revenue and depreciation and amortization, respectively, in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Fair Value of Financial Instruments For purposes of disclosure, we calculate the fair value of our mortgage notes payable and unsecured senior notes. We discount the spread between the future contractual interest payments and future interest payments on our mortgage debt and unsecured notes based on a current market rate. In determining the current market rate, we add our estimate of a market spread to the quoted yields on federal government treasury securities with similar maturity dates to our own debt. Because our valuations of our financial instruments are based on these types of estimates, the fair value of our financial instruments may change if our estimates do not prove to be accurate. Results of Operations The following discussion is based on our Consolidated Financial Statements for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005. At December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, we owned or had interests in a portfolio of 139, 131 and 121 properties, respectively (the Total Property Portfolio ). As a result of changes within our Total Property Portfolio, the financial data presented below shows significant changes in revenue and expenses from period-to-period. Accordingly, we do not believe that our period-to-period financial data with respect to the Total 46 Table of Contents Property Portfolio are necessarily meaningful. Therefore, the comparisons of operating results for the years ended 2007, 2006 and 2005 show separately the changes attributable to the properties that were owned by us throughout each period compared (the Same Property Portfolio ) and the changes attributable to the properties included in Properties Acquired, Sold, Repositioned and Placed-in Service. In our analysis of operating results, particularly to make comparisons of net operating income between periods meaningful, it is important to provide information for properties that were in-service and owned by us throughout each period presented. We refer to properties acquired or placed in-service prior to the beginning of the earliest period presented and owned by us through the end of the latest period presented as our Same Property Portfolio. The Same Property Portfolio therefore excludes properties placed in-service, acquired or repositioned after the beginning of the earliest period presented or disposed of prior to the end of the latest period presented. Net operating income, or NOI, is a non-GAAP financial measure equal to net income available to common shareholders, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, plus cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle (net of minority interest), minority interest in Operating Partnership, losses from early extinguishments of debt, depreciation and amortization, interest expense, general and administrative expense, less gains on sales of real estate from discontinued operations (net of minority interest), income from discontinued operations (net of minority interest), gains on sales of real estate and other assets (net of minority interest), income from unconsolidated joint ventures, minority interest in property partnerships, interest and other income and development and management services revenue. We use NOI internally as a performance measure and believe NOI provides useful information to investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations because it reflects only those income and expense items that are incurred at the property level. Therefore, we believe NOI is a useful measure for evaluating the operating performance of our real estate assets. Our management also uses NOI to evaluate regional property level performance and to make decisions about resource allocations. Further, we believe NOI is useful to investors as a performance measure because, when compared across periods, NOI reflects the impact on operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs and acquisition and development activity on an unleveraged basis, providing perspective not immediately apparent from net income. NOI excludes certain components from net income in order to provide results that are more closely related to a property results of operations. For example, interest expense is not necessarily linked to the operating performance of a real estate asset and is often incurred at the corporate level as opposed to the property level. In addition, depreciation and amortization, because of historical cost accounting and useful life estimates, may distort operating performance at the property level. NOI presented by us may not be comparable to NOI reported by other REITs that define NOI differently. We believe that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of our operating results, NOI should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented in our consolidated financial statements. NOI should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity or ability to make distributions. Comparison of the year ended December 31, 2007 to the year ended December 31, 2006 The table below shows selected operating information for the Same Property Portfolio and the Total Property Portfolio. The Same Property Portfolio consists of 102 properties, including properties acquired or placed in-service on or prior to January 1, 2006 and owned through December 31, 2007, totaling approximately 25.5 million net rentable square feet of space (excluding square feet of structured parking). The Total Property Portfolio includes the effects of the other properties either placed in-service, acquired or repositioned after January 1, 2006 or disposed of on or prior to December 31, 2007. Properties Placed In-Service includes our 505 9 th Street joint venture project. In connection with partially placing this property in-service, we consolidated the joint venture entity that owns the property as of October 1, 2007 due to the involvement we have in the venture once the property is operational. The Same Property Portfolio includes our Cambride Center Marriott hotel property, but does not include the Long Wharf Marriott hotel property, which was sold on March 23, 2007. This table includes a reconciliation from the Same Property Portfolio to the Total Property Portfolio by also providing information for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 with respect to the properties which were acquired, placed in-service, repositioned or sold. 47 Table of Contents Same Property Portfolio Properties Sold Properties Acquired Properties Placed In-Service Properties Repositioned Total Property Portfolio (dollars in thousands) 2007 2006 Increase/ (Decrease) % Change 2007 2006 2007 2006 2007 2006 2007 2006 2007 2006 Increase/ (Decrease) % Change Rental Revenue: Rental Revenue $ 1,196,883 $ 1,142,388 $ 54,495 4.77 % $ 21,902 $ 124,828 $ 48,940 $ 8,244 $ 32,313 $ 24,117 $ 27,199 $ 20,402 $ 1,327,237 $ 1,319,979 $ 7,258 0.55 % Termination Income 6,882 6,999 (117 ) (1.67 )% 1,138 100 6,982 8,137 (1,155 ) (14.19 )% Total Rental Revenue 1,203,765 1,149,387 54,378 4.73 % 21,902 125,966 49,040 8,244 32,313 24,117 27,199 20,402 1,334,219 1,328,116 6,103 0.50 % Real Estate Operating Expenses 419,054 389,872 29,182 7.49 % 6,369 35,439 14,964 2,239 7,995 4,731 7,458 5,424 455,840 437,705 18,135 4.14 % Net Operating Income, excluding hotel 784,711 759,515 25,196 3.32 % 15,533 90,527 34,076 6,005 24,318 19,386 19,741 14,978 878,379 890,411 (12,032 ) (1.35 )% Hotel Net Operating Income(1) 10,046 8,048 1,998 24.83 % 10,046 8,048 1,998 24.83 % Consolidated Net Operating Income(1) 794,757 767,563 27,194 3.54 % 15,533 90,527 34,076 6,005 24,318 19,386 19,741 14,978 888,425 898,459 (10,034 ) (1.12 )% Other Revenue: Development and Management Services 20,553 19,820 733 3.70 % Interest and Other 89,706 36,677 53,029 144.58 % Total Other Revenue 110,259 56,497 53,762 95.16 % Other Expenses: General and administrative expense 69,882 59,375 10,507 17.70 % Interest Expense 285,887 298,260 (12,373 ) (4.15 )% Depreciation and amortization 246,016 238,585 7,431 3.11 % 2,767 18,049 24,155 3,531 8,731 7,365 4,361 3,032 286,030 270,562 15,468 5.72 % Loss from early extinguishments of debt 3,417 32,143 (28,726 ) (89.37 )% Total Other Expenses 246,016 238,585 7,431 3.11 % 2,767 18,049 24,155 3,531 8,731 7,365 4,361 3,032 645,216 660,340 (15,124 ) (2.29 )% Income before minority interests $ 548,741 $ 528,978 $ 19,763 3.74 % $ 12,766 $ 72,478 $ 9,921 $ 2,474 $ 15,587 $ 12,021 $ 15,380 $ 11,946 $ 353,468 $ 294,616 $ 58,852 19.98 % Income from unconsolidated joint ventures $ 5,799 $ 7,230 $ (1,431 ) (19.79 )% $ 15,125 $ 17,455 $ (496 ) $ (178 ) $ $ $ $ 20,428 24,507 (4,079 ) (16.64 )% Income from discontinued operations, net of minority interest $ $ $ $ 6,206 $ 16,104 $ $ $ $ $ $ 6,206 16,104 (9,898 ) (61.46 )% Minority interest in property partnership (84 ) 2,013 (2,097 ) (104.17 )% Minority interest in Operating Partnership (64,916 ) (69,999 ) 5,083 7.26 % Gains on sales of real estate, net of minority interest 789,238 606,394 182,844 30.15 % Gains on sales of real estate from discontinued operations, net of minority interest 220,350 220,350 100.0 % Net Income available to common shareholders $ 1,324,690 $ 873,635 $ 451,055 51.63 % (1) For a detailed discussion of NOI, including the reasons management believes NOI is useful to investors, see page 47. Hotel Net Operating Income for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 is comprised of Hotel Revenue of $37,811 and $33,014, respectively, less Hotel Expenses of $27,765 and $24,966, respectively, per the Consolidated Income Statement. 48 Table of Contents Rental Revenue The increase of approximately $7.3 million in the Total Property Portfolio Rental Revenue is comprised of increases and decreases within the five categories that comprise our Total Property Portfolio. Rental revenue from the Same Property Portfolio increased approximately $54.5 million, Properties Sold decreased approximately $102.9 million, Properties Acquired increased approximately $40.7 million, Properties Placed In-Service increased approximately $8.2 million and Properties Repositioned increased approximately $6.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. We incur certain tenant specific property costs for which we are reimbursed from our tenants. Starting in 2007, we have included these reimbursements in rental revenue and included the tenant specific operating cost within real estate operating expenses. This income and expense classification in 2007 results in a presented increase to comparable rental revenue and real estate operating expenses, however does not impact our consolidated net operating income. For the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, the rental income and real estate operating expense gross up was approximately $8.9 million and $12.0 million, respectively. Rental revenue from the Same Property Portfolio increased approximately $54.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. Included in the Same Property Portfolio rental revenue is an overall increase in base rental revenue of approximately $39.1 million, offset by a decrease of approximately $7.3 million in straight-line rents. Approximately $18.8 million of the increase from the Same Property Portfolio was due to an increase in recoveries from tenants which correlates with the increase in operating expenses. Approximately $3.9 million of the increase from the Same Property Portfolio was due to an increase in parking and other income. The increase in rental revenue from Properties Placed In-Service relates to partially placing in-service our 505 9th Street development project in the fourth quarter of 2007, placing in-service our Seven Cambridge Center development project in the first quarter of 2006 and 12290 Sunrise Valley in the second quarter of 2006. Rental revenue from Properties Placed In-Service increased approximately $8.2 million, as detailed below: Date Placed In-Service Rental Revenue for the year ended December 31 Property 2007 2006 Change (in thousands) Seven Cambridge Center First Quarter, 2006 $ 22,138 $ 19,939 $ 2,199 12290 Sunrise Valley Second Quarter, 2006 6,338 4,178 2,160 505 9th Street Fourth Quarter, 2007 3,837 3,837 Total $ 32,313 $ 24,117 $ 8,196 The acquisition of 6601 & 6605 Springfield Center Drive, 103 Fourth Avenue, Kingstowne Towne Center, the Mountain View Properties and North First Business Park in 2007, and 303 Almaden Boulevard, 3200 Zanker Road and Four and Five Cambridge Center in 2006, increased revenue from Properties Acquired by approximately $40.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 as detailed below: Date Acquired Rental Revenue for the year ended December 31 Property 2007 2006 Change (in thousands) Four and Five Cambridge Center November 30, 2006 $ 18,605 $ 1,265 $ 17,340 Kingstowne Towne Center March 30, 2007 10,631 10,631 3200 Zanker Road August 10, 2006 10,520 3,839 6,681 303 Almaden Boulevard June 30, 2006 6,402 3,140 3,262 Mountain View Properties November 27, 2007 1,275 1,275 103 Fourth Avenue January 29, 2007 720 720 6601 & 6605 Springfield Center Drive January, 2007 685 685 North First Business Park December 13, 2007 102 102 Total $48,940 $8,244 $40,696 49 Table of Contents Rental revenue from Properties Repositioned for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased approximately $6.8 million over the year ended December 31, 2006. Our Capital Gallery expansion project is included in Properties Repositioned for the year ended December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006. In April 2006, tenants began to take occupancy and we placed our Capital Gallery expansion project in-service in July 2006. The aggregate increase in rental revenue was offset by the sales of Democracy Center and 5 Times Square in 2007 and 280 Park Avenue in 2006. These properties have not been classified as discontinued operations due to our continuing involvement as the property manager for each property through agreements entered into at the time of sale. Rental Revenue from Properties Sold decreased by approximately $102.9 million, as detailed below: Date Sold Rental Revenue for the year ended December 31 Property 2007 2006 Change (in thousands) Democracy Center August 7, 2007 $ 12,016 $ 17,825 $ (5,809 ) 5 Times Square February 15, 2007 9,886 74,795 (64,909 ) 280 Park Avenue June 6, 2006 32,208 (32,208 ) Total $ 21,902 $ 124,828 $ (102,926 ) Termination Income Termination income for the year ended December 31, 2007 was related to multiple tenants across the Total Property Portfolio that terminated their leases, and we recognized termination income totaling approximately $7.0 million. This compared to termination income of $8.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. We expect to recognize approximately $6 million of termination income for the year 2008. Real Estate Operating Expenses The $18.1 million increase in property operating expenses (real estate taxes, utilities, insurance, repairs and maintenance, cleaning and other property-related expenses) in the Total Property Portfolio is comprised of increases and decreases within five categories that comprise our Total Property Portfolio. Operating expenses for the Same Property Portfolio increased approximately $29.2 million, Properties Sold decreased approximately $29.1 million, Properties Acquired increased approximately $12.7 million, Properties Placed In-Service increased approximately $3.3 million and Properties Repositioned increased approximately $2.0 million. Operating expenses from the Same Property Portfolio increased approximately $29.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. Included in Same Property Portfolio operating expenses is an increase in utility expenses of approximately $2.5 million, which represents an increase of approximately 3% over the prior year to date. In addition, real estate taxes increased approximately $10.7 million due to increased real estate tax assessments and repairs and maintenance increased approximately $8.4 million. The remaining $7.6 million increase in the Same Property Portfolio operating expenses is related to an increase in cleaning contracts and other general and administrative items. 50 Table of Contents The acquisition of 6601 & 6605 Springfield Center Drive, 103 Fourth Avenue, Kingstowne Towne Center, the Mountain View Properties and North First Business Park in 2007, and 303 Almaden Boulevard, 3200 Zanker Road and Four and Five Cambridge Center in 2006, increased operating expenses from Properties Acquired by approximately $12.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 as detailed below: Date Acquired Real Estate Operating Expense for the year ended December 31 Property 2007 2006 Change (in thousands) Four and Five Cambridge Center November 30, 2006 $ 6,871 $ 519 $ 6,352 Kingstowne Towne Center March 30, 2007 2,591 2,591 303 Almaden Boulevard June 30, 2006 2,345 1,223 1,122 3200 Zanker Road August 10, 2006 1,837 497 1,340 103 Fourth Avenue January 29, 2007 606 606 Mountain View Properties November 27, 2007 412 412 6601 & 6605 Springfield Center Drive January, 2007 256 256 North First Business Park December 13, 2007 46 46 Total $ 14,964 $ 2,239 $ 12,725 The increase in operating expenses from Properties Placed In-Service relates to partially placing in-service our 505 9th Street development project in the fourth quarter of 2007, placing in-service our Seven Cambridge Center development project in the first quarter of 2006 and 12290 Sunrise Valley in the second quarter of 2006.

Our Capital Gallery expansion project is included in Properties Repositioned for the year ended December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006. In April 2006, tenants began to take occupancy and during July 2006, we placed our Capital Gallery expansion project in-service. A decrease of approximately $29.1 million in the Total Property Portfolio operating expenses was due to the sales of Democracy Center and 5 Times Square in 2007 and 280 Park Avenue in 2006, as detailed below: Date Sold Real Estate Operating Expenses for the year ended December 31 Property 2007 2006 Change (in thousands) Democracy Center August 7, 2007 $ 4,204 $ 6,144 $ (1,940 ) 5 Times Square February 15, 2007 2,165 14,988 (12,823 ) 280 Park Avenue June 6, 2006 14,307 (14,307 ) Total $ 6,369 $ 35,439 $ (29,070 ) We continue to review and monitor the impact of rising energy costs, as well as other factors, on our operating budgets for fiscal year 2008. Because some operating expenses are not recoverable from tenants, an increase in operating expenses due to one or more of the foregoing factors could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. 51 Table of Contents Hotel Net Operating Income Net operating income for our hotel property increased approximately $2.0 million, a 24.8% increase for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to 2006. For the year ended December 31, 2006, the operations of the Long Wharf Marriott was included as part of discontinued operations due to its sale on March 23, 2007. The following reflects our occupancy and rate information for our Cambridge Center Marriott hotel property for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006: 2007 2006 Percentage Change Occupancy 80.0 % 75.1 % 6.5 % Average daily rate $ 217.23 $ 194.52 11.7 % Revenue per available room, REVPAR $ 173.80 $ 146.15 18.9 % Development and Management Services Development and Management Services income increased approximately $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. We have maintained management contracts following the sales of Democracy Center and 5 Times Square in 2007 as well as the sale of 280 Park Avenue on June 6, 2006 which contributed to an increase of approximately $1.1 million in management fees. A decrease of approximately $0.4 million was attributed to reduced work order income. We expect third-party fee income for the year 2008 to be between $19 million and $20 million, a slight increase due to leasing and management fees we are projecting to earn at 280 Park Avenue as well as fees generated from the additional investment in the Value-Added Fund. Interest and Other Income Interest and other income increased by approximately $53.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006 as a result of higher overall interest rates and increased cash balances. In February 2007, our Operating Partnership issued $862.5 million of 2.875% unsecured exchangeable senior notes. On February 15, 2007, we completed the sale of our long-term leasehold interest in 5 Times Square in New York City for approximately $1.23 billion in cash. On March 23, 2007, we completed the sale of the Long Wharf Marriott for approximately $225.6 million in cash. On April 5, 2007, we completed the sale of Newport Office Park for approximately $33.7 million in cash. On August 7, 2007, we completed the sale of Democracy Center for approximately $184.5 million in cash and on November 20, 2007, we completed the sale of Orbital Sciences Campus and Broad Run Business Park Building E properties for an aggregate of approximately $125.4 million in cash. We paid our special dividend and regular dividend payments totaling $6.66 per share on January 30, 2008. Our current cash balance, after the dividends and our purchase of the Mountain View Properties and North First Business Park, is approximately $750 million. As the Federal Reserve has cut interest rates, short-term investment returns have decreased significantly and therefore we anticipate interest income to be between approximately $22 million to $25 million for the year 2008. Other Expenses General and Administrative General and administrative expenses increased approximately $10.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. An overall increase of approximately $2.6 million was attributed to bonuses and salaries for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006 as well as an increase in long-term compensation expense of approximately $3.5 million. For the year ended December 31, 2007, we recognized 52 Table of Contents additional expenses related to abandoned project costs of approximately $4.5 million. We anticipate our general and administrative expenses to be between $74 million and $75 million for the year 2008. A significant portion of the expected increase results from the inclusion of the 2008 OPP Awards described below, which adds approximately $4.9 million in 2008. On January 24, 2008, our compensation committee approved outperformance awards under the 1997 Plan to our officers and employees. These awards (the 2008 OPP Awards ) are part of a new broad-based long-term incentive compensation program designed to provide our management team at several levels within the organization with the potential to earn equity awards subject to outperforming and creating shareholder value in a pay-for-performance structure. 2008 OPP Awards utilize total return to shareholders ( TRS ) over a three-year measurement period as the performance metric and include two years of time-based vesting after the end of the performance measurement period (subject to acceleration in certain events) as a retention tool. Recipients of 2008 OPP Awards will share in an outperformance pool if our TRS, including both share appreciation and dividends, exceeds absolute and relative hurdles over a three-year measurement period from February 5, 2008 to February 5, 2011, based on the average closing price of a share of our common stock of $92.8240 for the five trading days prior to and including February 5, 2008. The aggregate reward that recipients of all 2008 OPP Awards can earn, as measured by the outperformance pool, is subject to a maximum cap of $110 million, although OPP awards for an aggregate of up to approximately $104.8 million have been allocated to date and were granted on February 5, 2008. The balance remains available for future grants. We expect that under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R) Share-Based Payment the 2008 OPP Awards will have an aggregate value of approximately $19.7 million, which amount will generally be amortized into earnings over the five-year plan period (although awards for retirement-eligible employees will be amortized over a three-year period). Because the 2008 OPP Awards requires a sustained price target to achieve the threshold stock price, unless the target has actually been met by the end of the applicable reporting period, we will exclude all contingently issueable shares from the diluted EPS calculation. See Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Commencing in 2003, we issued restricted stock and/or LTIP Units, as opposed to granting stock options and restricted stock, under the 1997 Plan as our primary vehicle for employee equity compensation. An LTIP Unit is generally the economic equivalent of a share of our restricted stock. Employees vest in restricted stock and LTIP Units over a four- or five-year term (for awards granted between 2003 and November 2006, vesting is over a five-year term with annual vesting of 0%, 0%, 25%, 35% and 40%; and for awards granted after November 2006, vesting will occur in equal annual installments over a four-year term). Restricted stock and LTIP Units are valued based on observable market prices for similar instruments. Such value is recognized as an expense ratably over the corresponding employee service period. LTIP Units that were issued in January 2005 and any future LTIP Unit awards will be valued using an option pricing model in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123R. To the extent restricted stock or LTIP Units are forfeited prior to vesting, the corresponding previously recognized expense is reversed as an offset to "stock-based compensation." Stock-based compensation associated with approximately $27.6 million of restricted stock and LTIP Units granted in February 2008 and approximately $18.5 million of restricted stock and LTIP Units granted in January 2007 will be incurred ratably over the four-year vesting period. Stock-based compensation associated with approximately $11.3 million of restricted stock and LTIP Units granted in April 2006 will be incurred ratably over the five-year vesting period. Interest Expense Interest expense for the Total Property Portfolio decreased approximately $12.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. The decrease is due to (1) the repayment of outstanding mortgage debt in connection with the sale of Democracy Center in August 2007 and 280 Park Avenue in June 2006, which decreased interest expense by $11.2 million, (2) the repayment of our mortgage loans collateralized by Capital Gallery, 191 Spring Street, 101 Carnegie Center, Seven Cambridge Center, Embarcadero Center Three and Embarcadero Center Four, 504, 506, 508 and 510 Carnegie Center Properties, which decreased interest expense 53 Table of Contents by approximately $15.9 million, and (3) an increase in capitalized interest costs which results in a decrease of interest expense of approximately $18.5 million. These decreases were offset by (1) an increase of approximately $4.4 million related to interest paid on the $450 million unsecured exchangeable senior notes issued in the second quarter of 2006 by our Operating Partnership at a per annum interest rate of 3.75%, (2) an increase of approximately $26.2 million related to interest paid on the $862.5 million unsecured exchangeable senior notes issued in the first quarter of 2007 by our Operating Partnership at an effective per annum interest rate of 3.438% and (3) an increase of approximately $4.3 million related to the acquisition of Kingstowne Towne Center on March 30, 2007 as well as the consolidation of our 505 9 th joint venture property due to the involvement we now have because the property is operational. The remaining decrease is attributed to scheduled loan amortization on our outstanding debt. At December 31, 2007, our variable rate debt consisted of our construction loan at South of Market. The following summarizes our outstanding debt as of December 31, 2007 compared with December 31, 2006: December 31, 2007 2006 (dollars in thousands) Debt Summary: Balance Fixed rate $ 5,369,243 $ 3,889,447 Variable rate 122,923 711,490 Total $ 5,492,166 $ 4,600,937 Percent of total debt: Fixed rate 97.76 % 84.54 % Variable rate 2.24 % 15.46 % Total 100.00 % 100.00 % GAAP Weighted average interest rate at end of period: Fixed rate 5.58 % 6.19 % Variable rate 6.11 % 5.80 % Total 5.60 % 6.13 % Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expense for the Total Property Portfolio increased approximately $15.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. The increase in depreciation and amortization consisted of approximately $20.6 million related to the 2007 acquisitions compared with the 2006 activity, approximately $0.7 million related to partially placing in-service 505 9th Street in the fourth quarter of 2007, approximately $1.3 million related to placing Capital Gallery into service during the third quarter of 2006, and approximately $0.7 million was due to the placing in-service of our Seven Cambridge Center development project in the first quarter of 2006 and 12290 Sunrise Valley in the second quarter of 2006. The increase was offset by reductions in depreciation and amortization resulting from the sales of Democracy Center and 5 Times Square in 2007 compared with 280 Park Avenue in 2006, which resulted in an aggregate decrease of approximately $15.3 million. Depreciation and amortization in the Same Property Portfolio increased approximately $7.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. Capitalized Costs Costs directly related to the development of rental properties are not included in our operating results. These costs are capitalized and included in real estate assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and amortized over their useful lives. Capitalized development costs include interest, wages, property taxes, insurance and other project costs incurred during the period of development. Capitalized wages for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 were $11.0 million and $7.0 million, respectively. These costs are not included in the general and 54 Table of Contents administrative expenses discussed above. We expect capitalized wages to increase proportionately with our increased development activity and increased wages into 2008. Interest capitalized for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 was $31.0 million and $5.9 million, respectively. These costs are not included in the interest expense referenced above. Losses from early extinguishments of debt On February 12, 2007, we refinanced our mortgage loan collateralized by 599 Lexington Avenue located in New York City. The new mortgage financing totaling $750.0 million bears interest at a fixed interest rate of 5.57% per annum and matures on March 1, 2017. The net proceeds of the new loan were used to refinance the $225.0 million mortgage loan on 599 Lexington Avenue and the $475.0 million mortgage loan on Times Square Tower. In connection with the refinancing, the lien of the Times Square Tower mortgage was spread to 599 Lexington Avenue and released from Times Square Tower so that Times Square Tower is no longer encumbered by any mortgage debt. There was no prepayment penalty associated with the repayment. We recognized a loss from early extinguishment of debt totaling approximately $0.7 million consisting of the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs.

Minority interests in property partnerships Minority interests in property partnerships for the year ended December 31, 2007 consists of the outside equity interests in the venture that owns our Wisconsin Place Office Property as well as our 505 9 th Street project. In connection with partially placing 505 9 th Street in-service, we consolidated this entity as of October 1, 2007 due to the involvement we have in the venture once the property is operational. For the year ended December 31, 2006, minority interest in property partnership includes our outside equity interest in Citigroup Center. This venture was consolidated with our financial results because we exercised control over the entity. Due to the redemption of the minority interest holder at Citigroup Center on May 31, 2006, minority interest in property partnership no longer reflects an allocation to the minority interest holder. Minority interest in Operating Partnership Minority interest in Operating Partnership decreased $5.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006. In connection with the special dividend declared on December 17, 2007 payable on January 30, 2008, holders of Series Two Preferred Units will participate on an as-converted basis in connection with their regular May 2008 distribution payment as provided for in the Operating Partnership partnership agreement. As a result, we accrued approximately $8.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 related to the special cash distribution payable to holders of the Series Two Preferred Units and have allocated earnings to the Series Two Preferred Units of approximately $8.7 million, which amount has been reflected in minority interest in Operating Partnership for the year ended December 31, 2007. In connection with the special dividend declared on December 15, 2006 and paid on January 30, 2007, we recognized an adjustment of approximately $3.1 million in 2007 to the special cash distribution accrual and allocation of earnings to the Series Two Preferred Units, as a result of conversions of Series Two Preferred Units. This decrease was offset by an increase related to the minority interest in our Operating Partnership income allocation related to an underlying increase in allocable income. In connection with the special dividend declared on December 15, 2006 payable on January 30, 2007, holders of Series Two Preferred Units will participate on an as-converted basis in connection with their regular May 2007 distribution payment as provided for in the Operating Partnership partnership agreement. As a result, we accrued approximately $12.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 related to the special cash distribution payable to holders of the Series Two Preferred Units and have allocated earnings to the Series Two Preferred Units of approximately $12.2 million, which amount has been reflected in minority interest in Operating Partnership for the year ended December 31, 2006. 56 Table of Contents Gains on sales of real estate, net of minority interest On August 7, 2007, we sold Democracy Center in Bethesda, Maryland, for approximately $280.5 million.

Included in the Same Property Portfolio rental revenue is an overall increase in base rental revenue of approximately $35.5 million, offset by a decrease of approximately $17.5 million in straight-line rents, primarily due to the reduction of free rent at Times Square Tower during the prior year. Approximately $14.2 million of the increase from the Same Property Portfolio was due to an increase in recoveries from tenants which correlates with the increase in operating expenses. Approximately $1.0 million of the increase from the Same Property Portfolio was due to an increase in parking and other income. The increase in rental revenue from Properties Placed In-Service relates to placing in-service our Seven Cambridge Center development project in the first quarter of 2006 and 12290 Sunrise Valley in the second quarter of 2006. During the fourth quarter of 2005, we placed our West Garage phase of our Seven Cambridge Center development into service which is included as part of Seven Cambridge Center below.

Included in Same Property Portfolio operating expenses is an increase in utility expenses of approximately $5.4 million, which represents an increase of approximately 7% over the prior year to date. In addition, real estate taxes increased approximately $8.5 million due to increased real estate tax assessments, with more than half of this increase specifically attributed to properties located in New York City.

Management Service income has increased approximately $1.6 million due to management contracts following the sales of 100 East Pratt Street, Riverfront Plaza and Embarcadero Center West Tower in 2005, as well as the sale of 280 Park Avenue on June 6, 2006. Approximately $0.5 million of the increase related to tenant improvement construction management fees earned, the majority of which was in San Francisco. An increase in development income of approximately $0.4 million was due to the increasing development activity at our 505 9 th Street joint venture project. Interest and Other Income Interest and other income increased by approximately $24.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to 2005 as a result of higher overall interest rates and increased cash balances. During the second quarter of 2006, we issued $450 million of 3.75% exchangeable senior notes due 2036. On June 6, 2006, we completed the sale of 280 Park Avenue for net cash proceeds of approximately $875 million. The decision to declare a special dividend was the result of the sales of assets in 2006, including 280 Park Avenue and 265 Franklin Street. Other Expenses General and Administrative General and administrative expenses increased approximately $3.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to 2005. An overall increase of approximately $4.7 million was attributed to bonuses and salaries for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to 2005 and approximately $1.5 million related to tax savings during 2005. These increases were offset by approximately $2.1 million of decreased accounting- and legal-related expenses, and other overall decreases aggregating approximately $0.2 million. Commencing in 2003, we issued restricted stock and/or LTIP Units, as opposed to granting stock options and restricted stock, under the 1997 Plan as our primary vehicle for employee equity compensation. An LTIP Unit is generally the economic equivalent of a share of our restricted stock. Employees generally vest in restricted stock and LTIP Units over a five-year term (for awards granted prior to 2003, vesting is in equal annual installments; for those granted in 2003 through 2006, vesting occurs over a five-year term with annual vesting of 0%, 0%, 25%, 35% and 40%; and for awards granted in 2007, vesting will occur in equal annual installments over a four-year term). Restricted stock and LTIP Units are valued based on observable market prices for similar instruments. Such value is recognized as an expense ratably over the corresponding employee service period. LTIP Units that were issued in January 2005 and all subsequent LTIP Unit awards will be valued using an option pricing model in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123R. To the extent restricted stock or LTIP Units are forfeited prior to vesting, the corresponding previously recognized expense is reversed as an offset to stock-based compensation. Stock-based compensation associated with approximately $11.4 million of restricted stock and LTIP Units granted in January 2005 and approximately $11.3 million of restricted stock and LTIP Units granted in April 2006 will be incurred ratably as such restricted stock and LTIP Units vest. Interest Expense Interest expense for the Total Property Portfolio decreased approximately $9.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to 2005. The majority of the decreases are due to (1) the repayment of outstanding mortgage debt in connection with the sales of 280 Park Avenue in June 2006, Riverfront Plaza and 100 East Pratt Street in the second quarter of 2005, and Embarcadero Center West Tower in October 2005, which collectively decreased interest expense by $20.4 million and (2) the repayment of our mortgage loans collateralized by Capital Gallery, Montvale Center, 101 Carnegie Center, 191 Spring Street and 601 and 651 Gateway Boulevard, which decreased interest expense approximately $8.2 million. These decreases were offset by (1) increases of 62 Table of Contents approximately $8.6 million at Times Square Tower due to increasing interest rates (5.85% on December 31, 2006 and 4.87% on December 31, 2005) and the increased principal balance due to the refinancing of the mortgage loan in June 2005, (2) an increase of approximately $12.3 million related to interest paid on the $450 million of 3.75% exchangeable senior notes due 2036 issued in the second quarter of 2006 by our Operating Partnership and (3) a net increase of approximately $1.2 million due to the interest imputed on the unpaid redemption price related to the redemption of the outside members equity interest at Citigroup Center to reflect the fair value of debt as well as the impact of placing Seven Cambridge Center into service prior to the repayment of debt. The remaining decrease is attributed to scheduled loan amortization on our outstanding debt. At December 31, 2006, our variable rate debt consisted of our construction loan at Times Square Tower, South of Market and our secured borrowings under our unsecured line of credit. The following summarizes our outstanding debt as of December 31, 2006 compared with December 31, 2005: December 31, 2006 2005 (dollars in thousands) Debt Summary: Balance Fixed rate $ 3,889,447 $ 3,952,151 Variable rate 711,490 874,103 Total $ 4,600,937 $ 4,826,254 Percent of total debt: Fixed rate 84.54 % 81.89 % Variable rate 15.46 % 18.11 % Total 100.00 % 100.00 % GAAP Weighted average interest rate at end of period: Fixed rate 6.19 % 6.61 % Variable rate 5.80 % 4.96 % Total 6.13 % 6.31 % Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expense for the Total Property Portfolio increased approximately $9.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to 2005. The increase in depreciation and amortization consisted of approximately $7.3 million due to the placing in-service of our Seven Cambridge Center development project in the first quarter of 2006 and 12290 Sunrise Valley in the second quarter of 2006, approximately $6.8 million related to the acquisition of Prospect Place on December 30, 2005, 303 Almaden Boulevard on June 30, 2006, 3200 Zanker Road on August 10, 2006 and Four and Five Cambridge Center in November 2006, and approximately $1.4 million related to placing Capital Gallery into service during the third quarter. The increase was offset by reductions in depreciation and amortization resulting from the sales of 280 Park Avenue in June 2006 and Embarcadero Center West Tower, 100 East Pratt Street and Riverfront Plaza in 2005, which resulted in an aggregate decrease of approximately $14.2 million. Depreciation and amortization in the Same Property Portfolio increased approximately $8.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to 2005. Capitalized Costs Costs directly related to the development of rental properties are not included in our operating results. These costs are capitalized and included in real estate assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and amortized over their useful lives. Capitalized development costs include interest, wages, property taxes, insurance and other 63 Table of Contents project costs incurred during the period of development. Capitalized wages for the year ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 were $7.0 million and $5.9 million, respectively. These costs are not included in the general and administrative expenses discussed above. Interest capitalized for the year ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 was $5.9 million and $5.7 million, respectively. These costs are not included in the interest expense referenced above. Losses from early extinguishments of debt For the year ended December 31, 2006, in connection with the sale of 280 Park Avenue, we legally defeased the mortgage indebtedness collateralized by the property, totaling approximately $254.4 million. In connection with the legal defeasance of the mortgage indebtedness at 280 Park Avenue, we recognized a loss from early extinguishment of debt totaling approximately $31.4 million consisting of the difference between the value of the U.S. Treasuries and the principal balance of the mortgage loan totaling approximately $28.2 million and the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs totaling approximately $3.2 million. In addition, we repaid construction financing collateralized by our Seven Cambridge Center property. The construction financing at Seven Cambridge Center totaling approximately $112.5 million was repaid using approximately $7.5 million of available cash and $105.0 million drawn under our Unsecured Line of Credit. There was no prepayment penalty associated with the repayment for Seven Cambridge Center. We recognized losses from early extinguishments of debt totaling approximately $0.5 million consisting of the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs. We repaid the construction and permanent financing at Capital Gallery totaling approximately $34.0 million and $49.7 million using available cash. We recognized a loss from early extinguishment of debt totaling approximately $0.2 million comprised of a prepayment penalty and the write-off of unamortized deferred finance costs. During 2006, we also repaid the mortgage loan collateralized by our Embarcadero Center Three property located in San Francisco, California totaling approximately $133.4 million, the mortgage loan collateralized by our 191 Spring Street property located in Lexington, Massachusetts totaling approximately $17.9 million, the mortgage loan collateralized by our Montvale Center property located in Gaithersburg, Maryland totaling approximately $6.6 million and the mortgage loan collateralized by our 101 Carnegie Center property located in Princeton, New Jersey totaling approximately $6.6 million. There were no significant prepayment penalties or write-offs of unamortized deferred financing costs related to these repayments. In connection with the sales of 100 East Pratt Street and Riverfront Plaza in May 2005, we repaid the mortgage loans collateralized by the properties totaling approximately $188 million. For the year ended December 31, 2005, we recognized a loss from early extinguishment of debt totaling approximately $11.0 million, consisting of prepayment fees of approximately $10.8 million and the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs of approximately $0.2 million. We also recognized a $1.9 million loss from early extinguishment of debt, which relates to the refinancing of our Times Square Tower mortgage loan and the modification on our Unsecured Line of Credit. Income from Unconsolidated Joint Ventures On September 15, 2006, a joint venture in which we had a 35% interest sold 265 Franklin Street located in Boston, Massachusetts, at a sale price of approximately $170.0 million. Net cash proceeds totaled approximately $108.3 million, of which our share was approximately $37.9 million, after the repayment of mortgage indebtedness of approximately $60.8 million and unfunded tenant obligations and other closing costs of approximately $0.9 million. The venture recognized a gain on sale of real estate of approximately $51.4 million, of which our share was approximately $18.0 million, and a loss from early extinguishment of debt of approximately $0.2 million, of which our share was $0.1 million. Income from discontinued operations, net of minority interest For the year ended December 31, 2006, the Orbital Sciences Campus, Broad Run, Building E, Long Wharf Marriott and Newport Office Park were included as part of income from discontinued operations, net of minority interest. Properties included in discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2005 consisted of the Orbital Science Campus, Broad Run, Building E, Long Wharf Marriott, Newport Office Park, 40-46 Harvard Street, the Residence Inn by Marriott and Old Federal Reserve. 64 Table of Contents Minority interest in property partnership Minority interest in property partnership consists of the outside equity interests in the venture that owns Citigroup Center. This venture was consolidated with our financial results because we exercised control over the entity. Due to the redemption of the minority interest holder interest at Citigroup Center on May 31, 2006, minority interest in property partnership will no longer reflect an allocation to the minority interest holder. Minority interest in Operating Partnership Minority interest in Operating Partnership decreased $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to 2005. In connection with the special dividend declared on December 15, 2006 payable on January 30, 2007, holders of Series Two Preferred Units will participate on an as-converted basis in connection with their regular May 2007 distribution payment as provided for in the Operating Partnership partnership agreement. As a result, we accrued approximately $12.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 related to the special cash distribution payable to holders of the Series Two Preferred Units and have allocated earnings to the Series Two Preferred Units of approximately $12.2 million, which amount has been reflected in minority interest in Operating Partnership for the year ended December 31, 2006. In connection with the special cash distribution declared in July 2005, holders of Series Two Preferred Units participated on an as-converted basis in connection with their regular February 2006 distribution payment as provided for in the Operating Partnership partnership agreement. As a result, we accrued approximately $12.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 related to the special cash distribution payable to holders of the Series Two Preferred Units and allocated earnings to the Series Two Preferred Units of approximately $12.1 million, which amount is reflected in minority interest in Operating Partnership for the year ended December 31, 2005. This decrease was offset by an increase related to the minority interest in our Operating Partnership income allocation related to an underlying increase in allocable income. Gains on sales of real estate, net of minority interest On June 6, 2006, we sold 280 Park Avenue, a 1,179,000 net rentable square foot Class A office property located in midtown Manhattan, New York, for approximately $1.2 billion. Net proceeds totaled approximately $875 million after legal defeasance of indebtedness secured by the property (consisting of approximately $254.4 million of principal indebtedness and approximately $28.2 million of related defeasance costs) and the payment of transfer taxes, brokers fees and other customary closing costs. We recognized at closing a gain on sale of approximately $583.3 million (net of minority interest share of approximately $109.2 million). Due to our continuing involvement through an agreement with the buyer to manage the property for a fee after the sale, this property has not been categorized as discontinued operations. In January 2006, we recognized a $4.8 million gain (net of minority interest share of approximately $0.9 million) on the sale of a parcel of land at the Prudential Center located in Boston, Massachusetts which had been accounted for previously as a financing transaction. During January 2006, the transaction qualified as a sale for financial reporting purposes. Gains on sales of real estate for the year ended December 31, 2005 in the Total Property Portfolio primarily relate to the sales of Riverfront Plaza and 100 East Street which are not included in discontinued operations due to our continuing involvement in the management, for a fee, of these properties after the sales. In addition, the sale of Decoverly Four and Five, consisting of two undeveloped land parcels located in Rockville, Maryland are included in gains on sales of real estate and other assets for the year ended December 31, 2005. Due to our continuing involvement through an agreement with the buyer to manage the property for a fee after the sale, this property has not been categorized as discontinued operations. 65 Table of Contents Gains on sales of real estate from discontinued operations, net of minority interest Gains on sales of real estate from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2005 in the Total Property Portfolio relate to the sale of Old Federal Reserve in April 2005, Residence Inn by Marriott and 40-46 Harvard Street, both which were sold in November 2005. Cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, net of minority interest In March 2005, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143 ( FIN 47 ). FIN 47 clarifies that the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in FASB Statement No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and/or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity. At December 31, 2005, we recognized a liability for the fair value of the asset retirement obligation aggregating approximately $7.1 million, which amount is included in Accounts Payable and Accrued Expenses on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. In addition, we have recognized the cumulative effect of adopting FIN 47, totaling approximately $4.2 million, which amount is included in Cumulative Effect of a Change in Accounting Principle, Net of Minority Interest on our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2005. Liquidity and Capital Resources General Our principal liquidity needs for the next twelve months are to: fund normal recurring expenses; meet debt service and principal repayment obligations including balloon payments on maturing debt; fund capital expenditures, including tenant improvements and leasing costs; fund current development costs not covered under construction loans; fund the costs associated with the settlement of our hedge agreements at maturity; fund possible property acquisitions; and make the minimum distribution required to maintain our REIT qualification under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. On December 17, 2007, our Board of Directors declared a special cash dividend of $5.98 per common share that was paid on January 30, 2008 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on December 31, 2007. The decision to declare a special dividend was the result of the sales of assets in 2007, including 5 Times Square, Orbital Sciences Campus, Broad Run Business Park - Building E, Worldgate Plaza and Newport Office Park. The Board of Directors did not make any change in our policy with respect to regular quarterly dividends. The payment of the regular quarterly dividend of $0.68 per share and the special dividend of $5.98 per share resulted in a total payment of $6.66 per share paid on January 30, 2008. We believe that our liquidity needs during 2008, including approximately $451.0 million of estimated development costs, will be satisfied using our approximately $750 million of cash on hand, cash flows generated by operations, availability under our line of credit (currently $582.9 million) and cash flows provided by other financing activities. We may also generate cash from asset sales. Base rental revenue, recovery income from tenants, other income from operations, available cash balances, draws on our unsecured line of credit and refinancing of maturing indebtedness are our principal sources of capital used to pay operating expenses, debt service, recurring capital expenditures and the minimum distribution required to maintain our REIT qualification. 66 Table of Contents We seek to increase income from our existing properties by maintaining quality standards for our properties that promote high occupancy rates and permit increases in rental rates while reducing tenant turnover and controlling operating expenses. Our sources of revenue also include third-party fees generated by our office real estate management, leasing, development and construction businesses. Consequently, we believe our revenue, together with proceeds from financing activities, will continue to provide the necessary funds for our short-term liquidity needs. However, material changes in these factors may adversely affect our net cash flows. Such changes, in turn, could adversely affect our ability to fund distributions, debt service payments and tenant improvements. In addition, a material adverse change in our cash provided by operations may affect our ability to comply with the financial performance covenants under our unsecured line of credit and unsecured senior notes. Our principal liquidity needs for periods beyond twelve months are for the costs of developments, possible property acquisitions, scheduled debt maturities, major renovations, expansions and other non-recurring capital improvements. We expect to satisfy these needs using one or more of the following: construction loans; long-term secured and unsecured indebtedness (including unsecured exchangeable indebtedness); income from operations; income from joint ventures; sales of real estate; issuances of our equity securities and/or additional preferred or common units of partnership interest in BPLP; and our unsecured revolving line of credit or other short-term bridge facilities. We draw on multiple financing sources to fund our long-term capital needs. Our unsecured line of credit is utilized primarily as a bridge facility to fund acquisition opportunities, to refinance outstanding indebtedness and to meet short-term development and working capital needs. We generally fund our development projects with construction loans that may be partially guaranteed by BPLP, our Operating Partnership, until project completion or lease-up thresholds are achieved. To the extent that we sell assets and cannot efficiently use the proceeds for either our development activities or attractive acquisitions, we would, at the appropriate time, decide whether it is better to declare a special dividend, adopt a stock repurchase program, reduce our indebtedness or retain the cash for future investment opportunities. Such a decision will depend on many factors including, among others, the timing, availability and terms of development and acquisition opportunities, our then-current and anticipated leverage, the price of our common stock and REIT distribution requirements. At a minimum, we expect that we would distribute at least that amount of proceeds necessary for us to avoid paying corporate level tax on the applicable gains realized from any asset sales. Cash Flow Summary The following summary discussion of our cash flows is based on the consolidated statements of cash flows in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data and is not meant to be an all-inclusive discussion of the changes in our cash flows for the periods presented below. 67 Table of Contents Cash and cash equivalents were $1.5 billion and $725.8 million at December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006, respectively, representing an increase of $781.1 million. The increase was a result of the following increases and decreases in cash flows: Years ended December 31, 2007 2006 Increase (Decrease) (in thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 629,378 $ 527,979 $ 101,399 Net cash provided by investing activities $ 576,931 $ 229,756 $ 347,175 Net cash used in financing activities $ (425,176 ) $ (293,443 ) $ 131,773 Our principal source of cash flow is related to the operation of our office properties. The average term of our tenant leases is approximately 7.4 years with occupancy rates historically in the range of 92% to 98%. Our properties provide a relatively consistent stream of cash flow that provides us with resources to pay operating expenses, debt service and fund quarterly dividend and distribution payment requirements. In addition, over the past two years, we have raised capital through the sale of some of our properties and raised proceeds from secured and unsecured borrowings. In 2007, our total dividends exceeded our cash flow from operating activities due to the special dividend which was declared in December 2006 and paid to common stockholders and common unitholders of BPLP on January 30, 2007. The cash flows distributed were generated from sales of real estate assets and proceeds from the sales are included as part of cash flows from investment activities. We expect that in 2008 our total dividends will exceed our cash flow from operating activities due to the special dividend declared in December 2007. Dividends will generally exceed cash flows from operating activities during periods in which we sell significant real estate assets and distribute gains on sale that would otherwise be taxable. Cash is used in investing activities to fund acquisitions, development and recurring and nonrecurring capital expenditures. We selectively invest in new projects that enable us to take advantage of our development, leasing, financing and property management skills and invest in existing buildings that meet our investment criteria. Cash provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2007 consisted of the following: (in thousands) Net proceeds from the sales of real estate $ 1,897,988 Cash recorded upon consolidation 3,232 The cash provided by these investing activities is offset by: Net investments in unconsolidated joint ventures (7,790 ) Investments in securities (22,584 ) Recurring capital expenditures (35,506 ) Planned non-recurring capital expenditures associated with acquisition properties (1,490 ) Hotel improvements, equipment upgrades and replacements (1,127 ) Net Proceeds from the sale of real estate placed in escrow (161,321 ) Acquisitions/additions to real estate (1,094,471 ) Net cash provided by investing activities $ 576,931 Cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2007 totaled approximately $425.2 million. This consisted primarily of the $840 million of net proceeds from our offering of 2.875% unsecured exchangeable senior notes and proceeds from mortgage notes payable, offset by the repayment of our Embarcadero Center Four mortgage loan, Times Square Tower mortgage loan and other mortgage notes payable, our secured draw under our Unsecured Line of Credit, as well as the payments of dividends and distributions to shareholders and the unitholders of our Operating Partnership. Future debt payments are discussed below under the heading Debt Financing. 68 Table of Contents Capitalization At December 31, 2007, our total consolidated debt was approximately $5.5 billion. The GAAP weighted-average annual interest rate on our consolidated indebtedness was 5.60% and the weighted-average maturity was approximately 5.2 years. Debt to total market capitalization ratio, defined as total consolidated debt as a percentage of the market value of our outstanding equity securities plus our total consolidated debt, is a measure of leverage commonly used by analysts in the REIT sector. Our total market capitalization was approximately $18.5 billion at December 31, 2007. Total market capitalization was calculated using the December 31, 2007 closing stock price of $91.81 per common share and the following: (1) 119,502,485 shares of our common stock, (2) 20,271,341 outstanding common units of limited partnership of BPLP (excluding common units held by Boston Properties, Inc.), (3) an aggregate of 1,460,688 common units issuable upon conversion of all outstanding preferred units of partnership interest in BPLP, (4) an aggregate of 676,067 common units issuable upon conversion of all outstanding LTIP units, assuming all conditions have been met for the conversion of the LTIP units, and (5) our consolidated debt totaling approximately $5.5 billion. Our total consolidated debt at December 31, 2007 represented approximately 29.66% of our total market capitalization. This percentage will fluctuate with changes in the market price of our common stock and does not necessarily reflect our capacity to incur additional debt to finance our activities or our ability to manage our existing debt obligations. However, for a company like ours, whose assets are primarily income-producing real estate, the debt to total market capitalization ratio may provide investors with an alternate indication of leverage, so long as it is evaluated along with other financial ratios and the various components of our outstanding indebtedness. Debt Financing As of December 31, 2007, we had approximately $5.5 billion of outstanding indebtedness, representing 29.66% of our total market capitalization as calculated above consisting of (1) $1.472 billion (net of discount) in publicly traded unsecured debt having a weighted-average interest rate of 5.95% per annum and maturities in 2013 and 2015; (2) $450 million of publicly traded exchangeable unsecured debt having an interest rate of 3.75% per annum, an initial optional redemption date in 2013 and maturity in 2036; (3) $844.1 million (net of discount) of publicly traded exchangeable unsecured debt having an interest rate of 2.875% per annum (an effective rate of 3.438% per annum) having an initial optional redemption in 2012 and maturing in 2037; and (4) $2.7 billion of property-specific mortgage debt having a GAAP weighted-average interest rate of 6.32% per annum and weighted-average term of 5.1 years. The table below summarizes our mortgage notes payable, our senior unsecured notes and our Unsecured Line of Credit at December 31, 2007 and 2006: December 31, 2007 2006 (dollars in thousands) DEBT SUMMARY: Balance Fixed rate $ 5,369,243 $ 3,889,447 Variable rate 122,923 711,490 Total $ 5,492,166 $ 4,600,937 Percent of total debt: Fixed rate 97.76 % 84.54 % Variable rate 2.24 % 15.46 % Total 100.00 % 100.00 % GAAP Weighted average interest rate at end of period: Fixed rate 5.58 % 6.19 % Variable rate 6.11 % 5.80 % Total 5.60 % 6.13 % 69 Table of Contents The variable rate debt shown above bears interest based on various spreads over the London Interbank Offered Rate or Eurodollar rates. As of December 31, 2007, the interest rate on our variable rate debt was LIBOR/Eurodollar plus 1.25% per annum. On September 27, 2007, we entered into an interest rate swap contract to fix the one-month LIBOR index rate at 5.82% per annum on a notional amount of $96.7 million. On February 12, 2007, we repaid $700 million of variable rate indebtedness which was outstanding at December 31, 2006 consisting of (1) the $225.0 million draw on our Unsecured Line of Credit, which draw was collateralized by 599 Lexington Avenue, and (2) the mortgage loan collateralized by Times Square Tower totaling $475.0 million. The variable rate indebtedness was repaid with proceeds from a new mortgage financing secured by 599 Lexington Avenue totaling $750.0 million, which bears interest at a fixed interest rate of 5.57% per annum and matures on March 1, 2017. On December 19, 2006, we terminated our forward-starting interest rate swap contracts that we had entered into in connection with the expected new mortgage financing and received approximately $10.9 million, which amount will reduce our interest expense over the ten-year term of the financing, resulting in an effective interest rate of 5.38% per annum. Unsecured Line of Credit On August 3, 2006, we modified our $605.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility (the Unsecured Line of Credit ) by extending the maturity date from October 30, 2007 to August 3, 2010, with a provision for a one-year extension at our option, subject to certain conditions, and by reducing the per annum variable interest rate on outstanding balances from Eurodollar plus 0.65% to Eurodollar plus 0.55% per annum. Under the Unsecured Line of Credit, a facility fee equal to 15 basis points per annum is payable in quarterly installments. The interest rate and facility fee are subject to adjustment in the event of a change in our Operating Partnership unsecured debt ratings. Based on our current debt ratings, the per annum variable interest rate is Eurodollar plus 0.475%. In addition, we pay a facility fee payable quarterly of 0.125% per annum. The Unsecured Line of Credit involves a syndicate of lenders. The Unsecured Line of Credit contains a competitive bid option that allows banks that are part of the lender consortium to bid to make loan advances to the Company at a negotiated LIBOR-based rate. The Unsecured Line of Credit is available to fund working capital and general corporate purposes, including, without limitation, to fund development of properties, land and property acquisitions and to repay or reduce indebtedness. The Unsecured Line of Credit is a recourse obligation of Boston Properties Limited Partnership. Our ability to borrow under our Unsecured Line of Credit is subject to our compliance with a number of customary financial and other covenants on an ongoing basis, including: a leverage ratio not to exceed 60%, however the leverage ratio may increase to no greater than 65% provided that it is reduced back to 60% within 180 days; a secured debt leverage ratio not to exceed 55%; a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 1.40; an unsecured leverage ratio not to exceed 60%, however the leverage ratio may increase to no greater than 65% provided that it is reduced back to 60% within 180 days; a minimum net worth requirement; an unsecured debt interest coverage ratio of at least 1.75; and limitations on permitted investments. We believe we are in compliance with the financial and other covenants listed above. As of December 31, 2007, we had no amount outstanding under the Unsecured Line of Credit with the ability to borrow $582.9 million. As of February 22, 2008, we had no borrowings outstanding under our Unsecured Line of Credit. 70 Table of Contents Unsecured Senior Notes The following summarizes the unsecured senior notes outstanding as of December 31, 2007 (dollars in thousands): Coupon/ Stated Rate Effective Rate (1) Principal Amount Maturity Date (2) 10 Year Unsecured Senior Notes 6.250 % 6.296 % $ 750,000 January 15, 2013 10 Year Unsecured Senior Notes 6.250 % 6.280 % 175,000 January 15, 2013 12 Year Unsecured Senior Notes 5.625 % 5.636 % 300,000 April 15, 2015 12 Year Unsecured Senior Notes 5.000 % 5.075 % 250,000 June 1, 2015 Total principal 1,475,000 Net discount (3,087 ) Total $ 1,471,913 (1) Yield on issuance date including the effects of discounts on the notes.

Our unsecured senior notes are redeemable at our option, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to the greater of (1) 100% of their principal amount or (2) the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest discounted at a rate equal to the yield on U.S. Treasury securities with a comparable maturity plus 35 basis points (or 25 basis points in the case of the $250 million 12 Year Unsecured Senior Notes that mature on June 1, 2015), in each case plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. The indenture under which our senior unsecured notes were issued contains restrictions on incurring debt and using our assets as security in other financing transactions and other customary financial and other covenants, including (1) a leverage ratio not to exceed 60%, (2) a secured debt leverage ratio not to exceed 50%, (3) an interest coverage ratio of 1.5, and (4) unencumbered asset value to be no less than 150% of our unsecured debt. As of December 31, 2007, we were in compliance with each of these financial restrictions and requirements. BPLP investment grade ratings on its senior unsecured notes are as follows: Rating Organization Rating Moody Baa2 (stable) Standard & Poor A- (stable) FitchRatings BBB (stable) The security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, as it may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating organization. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Unsecured exchangeable senior notes 3.75% Exchangeable Senior Notes due 2036 On April 6, 2006, our Operating Partnership completed a public offering of $400 million in aggregate principal amount of its 3.75% exchangeable senior notes due 2036. On May 2, 2006, the Operating Partnership issued an additional $50 million aggregate principal amount of the notes as a result of the exercise by the underwriter of its over-allotment option. The notes mature on May 15, 2036, unless earlier repurchased, exchanged or redeemed.

The Operating Partnership will pay cash for all notes so purchased. In addition, if a fundamental change occurs prior to February 20, 2012, the Operating Partnership will increase the exchange rate for a holder who elects to exchange its notes in connection with such a fundamental change under certain circumstances. The Operating Partnership offered and sold the notes to the initial purchasers in reliance on the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933. The initial purchasers then sold the notes to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to the exemption from registration provided by Rule 144A under the Securities Act. In connection with the closing, we and our Operating Partnership entered into a Registration Rights Agreement with the initial purchasers, under which we and our Operating Partnership agreed, for the benefit of the holders of the notes, to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission and maintain a shelf registration statement providing for the sale by the holders of the notes and our common stock, if any, issuable upon exchange of the notes. The Operating Partnership will be required to pay liquidated damages in the form of specified additional interest to the holders of the notes if we fail to comply with these obligations; provided that we will not be required to pay liquidated damages with respect to any note after it has been exchanged for any of our common stock. On March 13, 2007, we filed with the SEC a registration statement covering the resale of the notes and shares of common stock issuable upon exchange of the notes. The registration statement was declared effective by the SEC on April 20, 2007.

All adjustments related to EITF 98-1 are noted below. (2) On December 19, 2006, we terminated our forward-starting interest rate swap contracts and received approximately $10.9 million, which amount will reduce our interest expense for this mortgage over the term of the financing, resulting in an effective interest rate of 5.38% per annum for the financing. The stated interest rate is 5.57% per annum. The mortgage loan requires interest only payments with a balloon payment due at maturity. (3) In accordance with EITF 98-1, the principal amount and interest rate shown were adjusted upon redemption of the outside members equity interest in the limited liability company that owns the property to reflect the fair value of the note.

(7) In accordance with EITF 98-1, the principal amount and interest rate shown were adjusted upon acquisition of the property to reflect the fair value of the note. The stated principal balance at December 31, 2007 was $52.8 million and the stated interest rate was 7.51% per annum. (8) In accordance with EITF 98-1, the principal amount and interest rate shown were adjusted upon acquisition of the property to reflect the fair value of the note. The stated principal balance at December 31, 2007 was $48.7 million and the stated interest rate was 7.58% per annum.

The stated principal balance at December 31, 2007 was $42.1 million and the stated interest rate was 5.99% per annum. (11) Includes outstanding indebtedness secured by 91 Hartwell Avenue. (12) Includes outstanding principal in the amounts of $18.0 million, $3.8 million and $1.6 million which bear interest at fixed rates of 6.70%, 8.54% and 6.75% per annum, respectively. (13) On February 1, 2008, we repaid the mortgage loan secured by this property. (14) In accordance with EITF 98-1, the principal amount and interest rate shown were adjusted upon acquisition of the property to reflect the fair value of the note. The stated principal balance at December 31, 2007 was $20.0 million and the stated interest rate was 5.96% per annum. Combined aggregate principal payments of mortgage notes payable at December 31, 2007 are as follows (in thousands): Year Principal Payments 2008 $ 598,606 2009 214,345 2010 130,807 2011 544,688 2012 100,393 Thereafter 1,119,725 Market Risk Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates. Our future earnings, cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent upon prevalent market interest rates. Our primary market risk results from our indebtedness, which bears interest at fixed and variable rates. The fair 74 Table of Contents value of our debt obligations are affected by changes in the market interest rates. We manage our market risk by matching long-term leases with long-term, fixed-rate, non-recourse debt of similar duration. We continue to follow a conservative strategy of generally pre-leasing development projects on a long-term basis to creditworthy tenants in order to achieve the most favorable construction and permanent financing terms. Approximately 98% of our outstanding debt has fixed interest rates, which minimizes the interest rate risk through the maturity of such outstanding debt. We also manage our market risk by entering into hedging arrangements with financial institutions. Our primary objectives when undertaking hedging transactions and derivative positions is to reduce our floating rate exposure and to fix a portion of the interest rate for anticipated financing and refinancing transactions. This in turn, reduces the risks that the variability of cash flows imposes on variable rate debt. Our strategy protects us against future increases in interest rates. In July and August 2007, we entered into nine interest rate contracts, known as treasury locks, which fix the 10-year treasury rate at a weighted-average rate of 4.74% per annum on notional amounts aggregating $325.0 million. The treasury locks fix the 10-year treasury rate for a long-term fixed-rate financing commencing in April 2008 and expiring in April 2018. We expect to settle the interest rate contracts at the time we lock the rate on long-term fixed-rate financing. If the 10-year treasury rate is below the fixed strike rate at the time we settle each contract, we would be required to make a payment to the contract counterparties; if the 10-year treasury rate is above the fixed strike rate at the time we cash settle each contract, we would receive a payment from the contract counterparties. The amount that we either pay or receive will equal the present value of the basis point differential between the applicable fixed strike rate and the 10-year treasury rate at the time we settle each contract. These treasury locks qualify as highly-effective cash flow hedges under SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended. In August and September 2007, we entered into four forward-starting interest rate swap contracts to lock in the 10-year treasury rate and 10-year swap spread. The swaps fixed the 10-year swap rate for a financing in July 2008 at a weighted-average rate of 5.21% per annum on notional amounts aggregating $125.0 million. The 10-year treasury rate is a component of the 10-year swap rate and the swap contracts effectively fixed the 10-year treasury rate at a weighted-average interest rate of 4.53% per annum. The forward-starting swaps fix the 10-year swap rate for a long-term fixed-rate financing commencing in July 2008 and expiring in July 2018. We expect to settle the interest rate contracts in cash at the time we lock the rate on long-term fixed-rate financing. If the 10-year swap rate is below the fixed strike rate at the time we settle each contract, we would be required to make a payment to the contract counter-parties; if the 10-year swap rate is above the fixed strike rate at the time we cash settle each contract, we would receive a payment from the contract counterparties. The amount that we either pay or receive will equal the present value of the basis point differential between the applicable fixed strike rate and the 10-year swap rate at the time we settle each contract. We believe that these swaps qualify as highly-effective cash flow hedges under SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended. On November 2, 2007, we entered into a forward-starting interest rate swap contract to lock the 10-year LIBOR swap rate on a notional amount of $25.0 million at a forward-starting 10-year swap rate of 5.05% per annum. The 10-year treasury rate is a component of the 10-year swap rate and the referenced contract effectively fixed the 10-year treasury rate at 4.38%. The swap contract goes into effect on July 31, 2008 and expires on July 31, 2018. On November 9, 2007 and November 16, 2007, we entered into treasury locks to fix the 10-year treasury rate at 4.33% per annum on a notional amount of $25 million and 4.24% per annum on a notional amount of $25.0 million, respectively. The treasury locks mature on July 31, 2008. We have effectively fixed the 10-year treasury rate at a weighted average interest rate of 4.63% per annum on notional amounts aggregating $525.0 million with our interest rate hedging program. On September 27, 2007, we entered into an interest rate swap contract to fix the one-month LIBOR index rate (including a 1.25% spread), at 5.82% per annum on a notional amount of $96.7 million. The swap contract went into effect on October 22, 2007 and expires on October 29, 2008. 75 Table of Contents We have recorded the changes in fair value of the treasury lock and swap contracts related to the effective portion of the interest rate contracts executed during 2007 totaling a liability of approximately $25.7 million in Other Liabilities and Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) within our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We expect that within the next twelve months we will reclassify into earnings as interest expense approximately $2.1 million of the amounts recorded within Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) relating to the treasury lock contracts and forward-starting interest rate swap contracts. During 2005, we entered into twelve forward-starting interest rate swap contracts to lock in the 10-year treasury rate and 10-year swap spreads. On December 19, 2006, we entered into an interest rate lock agreement with a lender for a fixed interest rate of 5.57% per annum on a ten-year mortgage financing totaling $750.0 million to be collateralized by our 599 Lexington Avenue property in New York City. We closed on the mortgage financing on February 12, 2007. In conjunction with the interest rate lock agreement, we terminated the forward-starting interest rate swap contracts and received approximately $10.9 million, which amount will reduce our interest expense over the ten-year term of the financing, resulting in an effective interest rate of 5.38% per annum. Over the next twelve months we will reclassify into earnings as a reduction of interest expense approximately $1.1 million of the amounts recorded within Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) relating to the forward-starting interest rate swap contracts. At December 31, 2007, our outstanding variable rate debt based off LIBOR totaled approximately $122.9 million, of which approximately $96.7 million is fixed at 5.82% due to the interest rate swap contract we entered into on September 27, 2007. At December 31, 2007, the interest rate on our unhedged variable rate debt was approximately 5.88%. If market interest rates on our variable rate debt had been 100 basis points greater, total interest would have increased approximately $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. At December 31, 2006, our outstanding variable rate debt based off LIBOR totaled approximately $711 million. At December 31, 2006, the average interest rate on variable rate debt was approximately 5.80%. If market interest rates on our variable rate debt had been 100 basis points greater, total interest would have increased approximately $7.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. These amounts were determined solely by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our financial instruments. Due to the uncertainty of specific actions we may undertake to minimize possible effects of market interest rate increases, this analysis assumes no changes in our financial structure. Funds from Operations Pursuant to the revised definition of Funds from Operations adopted by the Board of Governors of NAREIT, we calculate Funds from Operations, or FFO, by adjusting net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP, including non-recurring items) for gains (or losses) from sales of properties, real estate related depreciation and amortization, and after adjustment for unconsolidated partnerships, joint ventures and preferred distributions. FFO is a non-GAAP financial measure. The use of FFO, combined with the required primary GAAP presentations, has been fundamentally beneficial in improving the understanding of operating results of REITs among the investing public and making comparisons of REIT operating results more meaningful. Management generally considers FFO to be a useful measure for reviewing our comparative operating and financial performance because, by excluding gains and losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets and excluding real estate asset depreciation and amortization (which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates), FFO can help one compare the operating performance of a company real estate between periods or as compared to different companies. Our computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs or real estate companies that do not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition differently. Amount represents our share, which was 85.32%, 84.40%, 83.74%, 82.97% and 82.06% for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, after allocation to the minority interest in the Operating Partnership. 76 Table of Contents In addition to presenting FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition, we also disclose FFO, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2007, 2006, 2005 and 2003 which excludes the effects of the losses from early extinguishments of debt associated with the sales of real estate and adjustments for non-qualifying derivative contracts. The adjustment to exclude losses from early extinguishments of debt results when the sale of real estate encumbered by debt requires us to pay the extinguishment costs prior to the debt stated maturity and to write-off unamortized loan costs at the date of the extinguishment. Such costs are excluded from the gains on sales of real estate reported in accordance with GAAP. However, we view the losses from early extinguishments of debt associated with the sales of real estate as an incremental cost of the sale transactions because we extinguished the debt in connection with the consummation of the sale transactions and we had no intent to extinguish the debt absent such transactions. We believe that this supplemental adjustment more appropriately reflects the results of our operations exclusive of the impact of our sale transactions. The adjustment for net derivative losses related to non-qualifying derivative contracts for the year ended December 31, 2003 resulted from interest rate contracts we entered into prior to the effective date of SFAS No. 133 to limit our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates with respect to variable rate debt associated with real estate projects under development. Upon transition to SFAS No. 133 on January 1, 2001, the impacts of these contracts were recorded in current earnings, while prior to that time they were capitalized. Although these adjustments were attributable to a single hedging program, the underlying contracts extended over multiple reporting periods and therefore resulted in adjustments through the third quarter of 2003. Management presents FFO before the impact of non-qualifying derivative contracts because economically this interest rate hedging program was consistent with our risk management objective of limiting our exposure to interest rate volatility and the change in accounting under GAAP did not correspond to a substantive difference. Management does not currently anticipate structuring future hedging programs in a manner that would give rise to this kind of adjustment. Although our FFO, as adjusted, clearly differs from NAREIT definition of FFO, and may not be comparable to that of other REITs and real estate companies, we believe it provides a meaningful supplemental measure of our operating performance because we believe that, by excluding the effects of the losses from early extinguishments of debt associated with the sales of real estate and adjustments for non-qualifying derivative contracts, management and investors are presented with an indicator of our operating performance that more closely achieves the objectives of the real estate industry in presenting FFO. Neither FFO, nor FFO as adjusted, should be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indication of our performance. Neither FFO nor FFO, as adjusted, represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP and is not a measure of liquidity or an indicator of our ability to make cash distributions. We believe that to further understand our performance, FFO and FFO, as adjusted should be compared with our reported net income and considered in addition to cash flows in accordance with GAAP, as presented in our Consolidated Financial Statements. 77 Table of Contents The following table presents a reconciliation of net income available to common shareholders to FFO and FFO, as adjusted, for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006, 2005, 2004 and 2003: Year ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 2004 2003 (in thousands) Net income available to common shareholders $ 1,324,690 $ 873,635 $ 438,292 $ 284,017 $ 365,322 Add: Cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, net of minority interest 4,223 Minority interest in Operating Partnership 64,916 69,999 71,498 65,086 70,318 Less: Gains on sales of real estate from discontinued operations, net of minority interest 220,350 47,656 27,338 73,234 Income from discontinued operations, net of minority interest 6,206 16,104 15,327 16,292 21,957 Gains on sales of real estate and other assets, net of minority interest 789,238 606,394 151,884 8,149 57,574 Income from unconsolidated joint ventures 20,428 24,507 4,829 3,380 6,016 Minority interests in property partnerships (84 ) 2,013 6,017 4,685 1,827 Income before minority interests in property partnerships, income from unconsolidated joint ventures, minority interest in Operating Partnership, gains on sales of real estate and other assets, discontinued operations and cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 353,468 294,616 288,300 289,259 275,032 Add: Real estate depreciation and amortization(1) 295,635 283,350 274,476 257,319 216,235 Income from discontinued operations 7,274 19,081 18,303 19,843 27,087 Income from unconsolidated joint ventures(2) 4,975 6,590 4,829 3,380 6,016 Less: Minority interests in property partnerships share of Funds from Operations 437 479 113 922 3,458 Preferred distributions(3) 4,266 9,418 12,918 15,050 21,249 Funds from Operations 656,649 593,740 572,877 553,829 499,663 Add(subtract): Losses from early extinguishments of debt associated with the sales of real estate 2,675 31,444 11,041 1,474 Net derivative losses (SFAS No. 133) 1,038 Funds from Operations after supplemental adjustments to exclude losses from early extinguishments of debt associated with the sales of real estate and net derivative losses (SFAS No. 133) 659,324 625,184 583,918 553,829 502,175 Less: Minority interest in Operating Partnership share of Funds from Operations after supplemental adjustments to exclude losses from early extinguishments of debt associated with the sales of real estate and net derivative losses (SFAS No. 133) 96,808 97,519 94,946 94,332 90,102 Funds from Operations available to common shareholders after supplemental adjustments to exclude losses from early extinguishments of debt associated with the sales of real estate and net derivative losses (SFAS No. 133) $ 562,516 $ 527,665 $ 488,972 $ 459,497 $ 412,073 Our percentage share of Funds from Operations basic 85.32 % 84.40 % 83.74 % 82.97 % 82.06 % Weighted average shares outstanding basic 118,839 114,721 111,274 106,458 96,900 (1) Real estate depreciation and amortization consists of depreciation and amortization from the Consolidated Statements of Operations of $286,030, $270,562, $260,979, $244,589 and $201,690, our share of unconsolidated joint venture real estate depreciation and amortization of $8,247, $9,087, $8,554, $6,814 and $8,475, and depreciation and amortization from discontinued operations of $2,948, $6,197, $6,662, $8,352 and $8,787, less corporate related depreciation and amortization of $1,590, $1,584, $1,719, $2,436 and $2,717 and adjustment of asset retirement obligations of $0, $912, $0, $0 and $0 for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

We use NOI internally as a performance measure and believe NOI provides useful information to investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations because it reflects only those income and expense items that are incurred at the property level. Therefore, we believe NOI is a useful measure for evaluating the operating performance of our real estate assets. Our management also uses NOI to evaluate regional property level performance and to make decisions about resource allocations. Further, we believe NOI is useful to investors as a performance measure because, when compared across periods, NOI reflects the impact on operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs and acquisition and development activity on an unleveraged basis, providing perspective not immediately apparent from net income. NOI excludes certain components from net income in order to provide results that are more closely related to a property results of operations. For example, interest expense is not necessarily linked to the operating performance of a real estate asset and is often incurred at the corporate level as opposed to the property level. In addition, depreciation and amortization, because of historical cost accounting and useful life estimates, may distort operating performance at the property level. NOI presented by us may not be comparable to NOI reported by other REITs and real estate companies that define NOI differently. We believe that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of our operating results, NOI should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented in our Consolidated Financial Statements. NOI should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity or ability to make distributions. The following sets forth a reconciliation of NOI to net income available to common shareholders for the fiscal years 2003 through 2007.

We have various standing or renewable service contracts with vendors related to our property management. In addition, we have certain other utility contracts we enter into in the ordinary course of business that may extend beyond one year and that vary based on usage. These contracts are not included as part of our contractual obligations because they include terms that provide for cancellation with insignificant or no cancellation penalties. Contract terms are generally one year or less. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Joint Ventures We have investments in eight unconsolidated joint ventures (including our investment in the Value-Added Fund) with our effective ownership interests ranging from 23.89% to 51%, all of which have mortgage indebtedness. We exercise significant influence over, but do not control, these entities and therefore they are presently accounted for using the equity method of accounting. See also Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. At December 31, 2007, the debt related to these ventures was equal to approximately $565.6 million. The table below summarizes the outstanding debt of these joint venture properties at December 31, 2007: Properties Venture Ownership % GAAP Interest Rate Principal Amount (in thousands) Maturity Date Metropolitan Square 51 % 8.23 % $ 128,726 May 1, 2010 Market Square North 50 % 7.74 % 87,951 December 19, 2010 Eighth Avenue and 46th Street 50 % 8.34 % 23,600 (1) May 8, 2008 Annapolis Junction 50 % 6.27 % 14,372 September 12, 2010 901 New York Avenue 25 % 5.27 % 170,000 January 1, 2015 Circle Star 25 % 6.57 % 42,000 (2) September 1, 2013 300 Billerica Road 25 % 5.69 % 7,500 (2) January 1, 2016 Wisconsin Place 23.89 % 6.86 % 51,057 (3) March 11, 2009 (3) Wisconsin Place 23.89 % 4.38 % 7,473 (4) January 1, 2008 (4) Wisconsin Place Retail 5 % 6.62 % 32,889 (5) March 29, 2010 (5) Total $ 565,568 81 Table of Contents (1) The financing bears interest at a variable rate equal to LIBOR plus 2.25% per annum. (2) This property is owned by the Value-Added Fund. (3) Amount represents outstanding construction financing under a $96.5 million loan commitment (of which our share is $23.1 million) at a variable rate equal to LIBOR plus 1.50% per annum with a maturity in March 2009. The mortgage debt requires interest only payments with a balloon payment due at maturity. On March 29, 2007, the entity executed an amendment to its construction loan agreement. The outstanding balance on the construction loan was approximately $53.6 million of the $96.5 million commitment. The amended agreement provides for a reduction in the loan commitment amount to $69.1 million. The reduction relates to the repayment of the retail portion of the outstanding balance totaling approximately $15.9 million and an additional reduction in the borrowing capacity of approximately $11.5 million with a corresponding release of collateral in conjunction with the retail entity obtaining new construction financing. On January 29, 2008, the Wisconsin Place joint venture entity that owns and is developing the office component of the project obtained construction financing totaling approximately $115.0 million collateralized by the office property. The construction financing bears interest at a variable rate equal to LIBOR plus 1.25% per annum and matures on January 29, 2011 with two, one-year extension options. (4) In accordance with EITF 98-1, the principal amount and interest rates shown were adjusted to reflect the fair value of the note using an effective interest rate of 4.38% per annum. This note is non-interest bearing with a stated principal balance of $7.5 million and matures in January 2008. On February 1, 2008 the joint venture repaid this loan. (5) Amount represents outstanding construction financing under a $66.0 million loan commitment collateralized by the retail entity of Wisconsin Place. Wisconsin Place is a mixed-use development project consisting of office, retail and residential properties located in Chevy Chase, Maryland. The construction financing bears interest at a variable rate equal to LIBOR plus 1.375% per annum and matures on March 29, 2010 with two one-year extension options. Environmental Matters It is our policy to retain independent environmental consultants to conduct or update Phase I environmental assessments (which generally do not involve invasive techniques such as soil or ground water sampling) and asbestos surveys in connection with our acquisition of properties. These pre-purchase environmental assessments have not revealed environmental conditions that we believe will have a material adverse effect on our business, assets, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity, and we are not otherwise aware of environmental conditions with respect to our properties that we believe would have such a material adverse effect. However, from time to time environmental conditions at our properties have required and may in the future require environmental testing and/or regulatory filings, as well as remedial action. In February 1999, we (through a joint venture) acquired from Exxon Corporation a property in Massachusetts that was formerly used as a petroleum bulk storage and distribution facility and was known by the state regulatory authority to contain soil and groundwater contamination. We developed an office park on the property. We engaged a specially licensed environmental consultant to oversee the management of contaminated soil and groundwater that was disturbed in the course of construction. Under the property acquisition agreement, Exxon agreed to (1) bear the liability arising from releases or discharges of oil and hazardous substances which occurred at the site prior to our ownership, (2) continue monitoring and/or remediating such releases and discharges as necessary and appropriate to comply with applicable requirements, and (3) indemnify us for certain losses arising from preexisting site conditions. Any indemnity claim may be subject to various defenses, and there can be no assurance that the amounts paid under the indemnity, if any, would be sufficient to cover the liabilities arising from any such releases and discharges. Environmental investigations at some of our properties and certain properties owned by our affiliates have identified groundwater contamination migrating from off-site source properties. In each case we engaged a licensed environmental consultant to perform the necessary investigations and assessments, and to prepare any required submittals to the regulatory authorities. In each case the environmental consultant concluded that the 82 Table of Contents properties qualify under the regulatory program or the regulatory practice for a status which eliminates certain deadlines for conducting response actions at a site. We also believe that these properties qualify for liability relief under certain statutory provisions or regulatory practices regarding upgradient releases. Although we believe that the current or former owners of the upgradient source properties may bear responsibility for some or all of the costs of addressing the identified groundwater contamination, we will take necessary further response actions (if any are required). Other than periodic testing at some of these properties, no such additional response actions are anticipated at this time. Some of our properties and certain properties owned by our affiliates are located in urban, industrial and other previously developed areas where fill or current or historical uses of the areas have caused site contamination. Accordingly, it is sometimes necessary to institute special soil and/or groundwater handling procedures and/or include particular building design features in connection with development, construction and other property operations in order to achieve regulatory closure and/or ensure that contaminated materials are addressed in an appropriate manner. In these situations it is our practice to investigate the nature and extent of detected contamination and estimate the costs of required response actions and special handling procedures. We then use this information as part of our decision-making process with respect to the acquisition and/or development of the property. For example, we own a parcel in Massachusetts, formerly used as a quarry/asphalt batching facility, which we may develop in the future. Pre-purchase testing indicated that the site contains relatively low levels of certain contaminants. We have engaged a specially licensed environmental consultant to monitor environmental conditions at the site and prepare necessary regulatory submittals based on the results of an environmental risk characterization. A submittal has been made to the regulatory authorities in order to achieve regulatory closure at this site. The submittal included an environmental deed restriction that mandates compliance with certain protective measures in a portion of the site where low levels of residual soil contamination have been left in place in accordance with applicable laws. We expect that resolution of the environmental matters relating to the above will not have a material impact on our business, assets, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. However, we cannot assure you that we have identified all environmental liabilities at our properties, that all necessary remediation actions have been or will be undertaken at our properties or that we will be indemnified, in full or at all, in the event that such environmental liabilities arise. Newly Issued Accounting Standards In June 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 ( FIN No. 48 ). FIN No. 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a company financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on description, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. FIN No. 48 was effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. FIN No. 48, which we adopted effective January 1, 2007, did not have a material impact on our cash flows, results of operations, financial position or liquidity. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements ( SFAS No. 157 ). SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 does not require any new fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. In February 2008, the FASB deferred the effective date of SFAS No. 157 for one year for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis. The FASB also removed certain leasing transactions from the scope of SFAS No. 157. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 157 to have a material impact on our cash flows, results of operations, financial position or liquidity. 83 Table of Contents In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115 ( SFAS No. 159 ). SFAS No. 159 permits entities to choose, at specified election dates, to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses shall be reported on items for which the fair value option has been elected in earnings at each subsequent reporting date. SFAS No. 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. We are currently evaluating and assessing the impact of this statement. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations ( SFAS No. 141(R) ), which establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer shall recognize and measure in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed, any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree and goodwill acquired in a business combination. SFAS No. 141(R) is effective for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008. We are currently assessing the potential impact that the adoption of SFAS No. 141(R) will have on our financial position and results of operations. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements an Amendment of ARB No. 51 ( SFAS No. 160 ), which establishes and expands accounting and reporting standards for minority interests, which will be recharacterized as noncontrolling interests, in a subsidiary and the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. SFAS No. 160 is effective for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008. This statement is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008. We are currently assessing the potential impact that the adoption of SFAS No. 160 will have on our financial position and results of operations. Inflation Substantially all of our leases provide for separate real estate tax and operating expense escalations over a base amount. In addition, many of our leases provide for fixed base rent increases or indexed increases. We believe that inflationary increases in costs may be at least partially offset by the contractual rent increases and operating expense escalations. 84 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk As of December 31, 2007, approximately $5.4 billion of our borrowings bore interest at fixed rates, and therefore the fair value of these instruments is affected by changes in the market interest rates. The following table presents our aggregate fixed rate debt obligations as of December 31, 2007 with corresponding weighted-average interest rates sorted by maturity date and our aggregate variable rate debt obligations sorted by maturity date. The GAAP weighted average interest rate on the variable rate debt as of December 31, 2007 was 6.11% per annum. 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013+ Total Fair Value (dollars in thousands) Secured debt Fixed Rate $ 603,303 $ 95,599 $ 134,812 $ 547,210 $ 101,850 $ 1,120,431 $ 2,603,205 $ 2,675,583 Average Interest Rate 6.78 % 6.38 % 7.83 % 7.02 % 5.62 % 5.64 % 6.33 % Variable Rate $ 122,923 $ 122,923 $ 122,923 Unsecured debt Fixed Rate $ 1,471,912 $ 1,471,912 $ 1,463,747 Average Interest Rate 5.95 % 5.95 % Variable Rate Unsecured exchangeable debt Fixed Rate $ 844,126 $ 450,000 $ 1,294,126 $ 1,289,625 Average Interest Rate 3.46 % 3.79 % 3.55 % Variable Rate Total Debt $ 603,303 $ 218,522 $ 134,812 $ 547,210 $ 945,976 $ 3,042,343 $ 5,492,166 $ 5,551,878 Additional disclosure about market risk is incorporated herein by reference from Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Market Risk. 85 Table of Contents
