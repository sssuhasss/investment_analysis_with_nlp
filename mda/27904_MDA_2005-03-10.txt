ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Business Environment Financial Results Our financial performance continued to deteriorate during 2004, the fourth consecutive year we reported substantial losses. Our consolidated net loss of $5.2 billion in 2004 reflects a net charge of $2.9 billion, which is discussed elsewhere in this Form 10-K (see Notes 5, 9, 14 and 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements), a significant decline in passenger mile yield, historically high aircraft fuel prices and other cost pressures. Our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments were $1.8 billion at December 31, 2004, down from $2.7 billion at December 31, 2003. These results underscore the urgent need to make fundamental changes in the way we do business. Our financial performance for 2004 was materially adversely affected by a decrease in passenger mile yield. While Revenue Passenger Miles ( RPMs ), or traffic, rose 11% during 2004 compared to the prior year, passenger revenue increased only 6%, reflecting a 4% decrease in the passenger mile yield on a year-over-year basis. We believe the decrease in passenger mile yield reflects permanent changes in the airline industry revenue environment which have occurred primarily due to the following factors: the continuing growth of low-cost carriers with which we compete in most of our domestic markets; high industry capacity, resulting in significant fare discounting to stimulate traffic; and increased price sensitivity by our customers, enhanced by the availability of airline fare information on the Internet. Aircraft fuel prices also had a significant negative impact on our financial results in 2004. These prices reached historically high levels, as our average fuel price per gallon increased 42% to $1.16 (net of hedging gains) for 2004 compared to the prior year. Aircraft fuel expense rose 51%, or $986 million, in 2004 compared to 2003, with approximately $820 million of the increase resulting from higher fuel prices. In light of our significant losses and the decline in our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, we are making permanent structural changes that are intended to appropriately align our cost structure with the revenue we can generate in this business environment and to enable us to compete with low-cost carriers. Our Transformation Plan In 2002, we began our profit improvement program, which had a goal of reducing our unit costs and increasing our revenues. We made significant progress under this program, but increases in aircraft fuel prices and pension and related expense, and declining domestic passenger mile yields, have offset a large portion of these benefits. Accordingly, we will need substantial further reductions in our cost structure to achieve viability. At the end of 2003, we began a strategic reassessment of our business. The goal of this project was to develop and implement a comprehensive and competitive business strategy that addresses the airline industry environment and positions us to achieve long-term success. As part of this project, we evaluated the appropriate 26 Table of Contents cost reduction targets and the actions we should take to seek to achieve these targets. Key elements of our transformation plan include: Redesigning our Atlanta operation from a banked to a continuous hub to increase capacity with the same number of aircraft, to improve reliability and to reduce congestion. We implemented this initiative in January 2005. Dehubbing our Dallas/Ft. Worth operations and redeploying aircraft used in that market to grow our hub operations in Atlanta, Cincinnati and Salt Lake City, as well as offering new destinations and expanded frequencies in key focus cities such as New York City and Orlando. We implemented this initiative in January 2005. Growing Song, our low-fare operation, to 48 aircraft by converting 12 Mainline aircraft to Song service. In January 2005, we announced plans for Song to begin nonstop service from New York-JFK to Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle, San Juan and Aruba. Reducing fleet complexity by retiring up to four aircraft types in approximately four years and increasing overall fleet utilization and efficiency. Eliminating 6,000 to 7,000 non-pilot jobs by December 2005, lowering management overhead costs by approximately 15% and reducing pay and benefits, including an across-the-board 10% pay reduction for non-pilot employees effective January 1, 2005. Reducing significantly our pilot cost structure. In November 2004, we entered into an agreement with our pilots that will provide us with $1 billion in long-term, annual cost savings. Creating incentive programs for U.S.-based employees (excluding officers and director-level employees), which include (1) stock options; (2) profit sharing if our annual pre-tax income exceeds specified thresholds; and (3) monthly payments of up to $100 per employee based on our customer satisfaction and operational performance ratings. In November 2004, we granted stock options to purchase a total of 62 million shares of our common stock to approximately 60,000 employees, including pilots. Updating and upgrading customer products and services, including aircraft interiors and website functionality, and continuing two-class service in Mainline operations. Our transformation plan is intended to deliver approximately $5 billion in annual benefits by the end of 2006 (as compared to 2002) while also improving the service we provide to our customers. By the end of 2004, we achieved approximately $2.3 billion of the $5 billion in targeted benefits under our profit improvement program. We have identified, and begun implementation of, the following key initiatives to obtain the remaining $2.7 billion in targeted benefits, which we believe we are on track to achieve by the end of 2006: (in millions) 2005 2006 Non-pilot operational improvements $ 1,075 $ 1,600 Pilot cost reductions 900 1,000 Other benefits 135 125 Total $ 2,110 $ 2,725 27 Table of Contents Non-Pilot Operational Improvements. The targeted $1.6 billion of non-pilot operational improvements by the end of 2006 includes the following, which are discussed further below: (in millions) 2005 2006 Incremental profit improvement initiatives $ 600 $ 1,000 Non-pilot pay and benefit savings 350 350 Dehubbing of Dallas/ Ft. Worth operations 75 100 Continuous hub redesign 50 150 Total non-pilot operational improvements $ 1,075 $ 1,600 Incremental profit improvement initiatives consist of cost savings and revenue enhancements. These include technology and productivity enhancements, including improvements in airport processes, maintenance and distribution efficiency; and overhead reductions, including the elimination of 6,000 to 7,000 non-pilot jobs. Approximately 3,400 employees elected to participate in voluntary workforce reduction programs. Non-pilot pay and benefit savings are attributable to salary and benefit reductions. The $350 million of estimated savings includes: (1) an across-the-board, 10% pay reduction for executives and supervisory, administrative, and frontline employees that was effective January 1, 2005; (2) increases to the shared cost of healthcare coverage; (3) the elimination of a healthcare coverage subsidy for non-pilot employees who retire after January 1, 2006; and (4) reduced vacation time. In January 2005, we dehubbed our Dallas/Ft. Worth operations and redeployed aircraft from that market to grow our hub operations in Atlanta, Cincinnati and Salt Lake City. We expect to benefit from this initiative through incremental revenue primarily due to greater utilization from the redeployment of these aircraft. In January 2005, we also redesigned our Atlanta operation from a banked to a continuous hub. Although we will incur incremental costs under this initiative, we believe the related incremental revenue will more than offset these costs. We expect the net benefit to increase as we expand this initiative to our other hubs. We recorded significant gains and charges in 2004 in connection with some of our non-pilot operational initiatives. These gains and charges include (1) a $527 million gain related to the elimination of the healthcare coverage subsidy for non-pilot employees who retire after January 1, 2006, and (2) a $194 million charge related to voluntary and involuntary workforce reduction programs. For additional information about these subjects, see Note 14 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We will record additional charges relating to our non-pilot operational initiatives and pilot cost reductions, including charges related to certain facility closures and employee items, but we are not able to reasonably estimate the amount or timing of any such charges, including the amounts of such charges that may result in future cash expenditures, at this time. The targeted benefits under our transformation plan do not reflect any gains or charges described in this or the preceding paragraph. Pilot Cost Reductions. Our pilot cost structure was significantly higher than that of our competitors and needed to be reduced in order for us to compete effectively. On November 11, 2004, we and our pilots union entered into an agreement that will provide us with $1 billion in long-term, annual cost savings through a combination of changes in wages, pension and other benefits and work rules. The agreement (1) includes a 32.5% reduction to base pay rates on December 1, 2004; (2) does not include any scheduled increases in base pay rates; and (3) includes benefit changes such as a 16% reduction in vacation pay, increased cost sharing for active pilot and retiree medical benefits, the amendment of the defined benefit pension plan to stop service accrual as of December 31, 2004, and the establishment of a defined contribution pension plan as of January 1, 2005. The agreement also states certain limitations on our ability to seek to modify it if we file for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. The agreement becomes amendable on December 31, 2009. Other Benefits. Our transformation plan also targets other benefits through concessions from aircraft lessors, creditors and other vendors. During the December 2004 quarter, we entered into agreements with aircraft lessors and lenders under which we expect to receive average annual cash savings of approximately $57 million between 2005 and 2009, which will also result in some cost reductions. We also reached agreements with about 28 Table of Contents 115 suppliers under which we expect to realize average annual benefits of approximately $46 million during 2005, 2006 and 2007. SimpliFares tm . In January 2005, we announced the expansion of our SimpliFares initiative within the 48 contiguous United States. An important part of our transformation plan, SimpliFares is a fundamental change in our pricing structure which is intended to better meet customer needs; to simplify our business; and to assist us in achieving a lower cost structure. Under SimpliFares, we lowered unrestricted fares on some routes by as much as 50%; reduced the number of fare categories; implemented a fare cap; and eliminated the Saturday-night stay requirement that existed for certain fares. While SimpliFares is expected to have a negative impact on our operating results for some period, we believe it will provide net benefits to us over the longer term by stimulating traffic; improving productivity by simplifying our product; and increasing customer usage of delta.com, our lowest cost distribution channel. Liquidity. Due to the difficult revenue environment, historically high fuel prices and other cost pressures, we borrowed $2.4 billion in 2004 to fund daily operations and capital requirements, repay debt obligations and increase our liquidity. These borrowings included $830 million that we obtained during the December 2004 quarter under our financing agreements with GE Commercial Finance and Amex. These new financing agreements are essential elements of our ongoing restructuring efforts. Our borrowings under these agreements are secured by substantially all of our assets that were unencumbered immediately prior to the consummation of those agreements. During 2004, we also deferred to later years certain debt obligations that were due in 2004, 2005 and 2006. For additional information about our financing agreements with GE Commercial Finance and Amex, as well as our deferrals of debt during 2004, see Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. At December 31, 2004, we had cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments totaling $1.8 billion. In March 2005, we borrowed the final installment of $250 million under our financing agreement with Amex. We have commitments from a third party to finance on a long-term secured basis our purchase of 32 regional jet aircraft to be delivered to us in 2005 ( Regional Jet Credit Facility ). We have no other undrawn lines of credit. We have significant obligations due in 2005 and thereafter. Our obligations due in 2005 include approximately (1) $1.1 billion in operating lease payments; (2) $1.0 billion in interest payments, which may vary as interest rates change on our $5 billion principal amount of variable rate debt; (3) $835 million in debt maturities, approximately $630 million of which we expect will be cash payments (for additional information about this amount, see Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements); and (4) $450 million of estimated funding for our defined benefit pension and defined contribution plans. Absent the enactment of new federal legislation which reduces our pension funding obligations during the next several years, our annual pension funding obligations for each of 2006 through 2009 will be significantly higher than in 2005 and could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity. For additional information about our contractual commitments, see Financial Position Contractual Obligations in this Item 7. During 2005, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $1.0 billion. This covers approximately $540 million for aircraft expenditures, which includes $520 million to purchase 32 regional jets which we intend to finance under the Regional Jet Credit Facility. Our anticipated capital expenditures for 2005 also include approximately $215 million for aircraft parts and modifications and approximately $285 million for non-fleet capital expenditures. As discussed above, we do not expect to achieve the full $5 billion in targeted benefits under our transformation plan until the end of 2006. As we transition to a lower cost structure, we continue to face significant challenges due to low passenger mile yields, historically high fuel prices and other cost pressures related to interest expense and pension and related expense. Accordingly, we believe that we will record a substantial net loss in 2005, and that our cash flows from operations will not be sufficient to meet all of our liquidity needs for that period. We currently expect to meet our liquidity needs for 2005 from cash flows from operations, our available cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, the Regional Jet Credit Facility, and the final $250 million borrowing under our financing agreement with Amex. Because substantially all of our assets are encumbered and our credit ratings are low, we do not expect to be able to obtain any material amount of additional debt financing. Unless we are able to sell assets or access the capital markets by issuing equity or convertible debt 29 Table of Contents securities, we expect that our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments will be substantially lower at December 31, 2005 than at the end of 2004. Our financing agreements with GE Commercial Finance and Amex include covenants that impose substantial restrictions on our financial and business operations, including covenants that require us (1) to maintain specified levels of cash and cash equivalents and (2) to achieve certain levels of EBITDAR (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and aircraft rent, as defined). Although under our business plan we expect to be in compliance with these covenants in 2005, we do not expect to exceed either of the required levels by a significant margin. Accordingly, if any of the assumptions underlying our business plan proves to be incorrect, we might not be in compliance with these covenants, which could result in the outstanding borrowings under these agreements becoming immediately due and payable (unless the lenders waive these covenant violations). If this were to occur, we would need to seek to restructure under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. For additional information about these financing agreements, see Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Many of the material assumptions underlying our business plan are not within our control. These assumptions include that (1) we achieve in 2005 all the benefits of our transformation plan targeted to be achieved in that year and (2) the average annual jet fuel price per gallon in 2005 is approximately $1.22 (with each 1 increase in the average annual jet fuel price per gallon increasing our liquidity needs by approximately $25 million per year, unless we are successful in offsetting some or all of this increase through fare increases or additional cost reduction initiatives). Our business plan also includes significant assumptions about passenger mile yield (which we expect to be lower in 2005 as compared to 2004), interest rates, our ability to generate incremental revenues, our pension funding obligations and credit card processor holdbacks (our current Visa/Mastercard processing contract expires in August 2005). See Risk Factors Related to Delta concerning risks associated with sensitivities in our assumptions. If the assumptions underlying our business plan prove to be incorrect in any material adverse respect and we are unable to sell assets or access the capital markets, or if our level of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments otherwise declines to an unacceptably low level, we would need to seek to restructure under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Basis of Presentation of Consolidated Financial Statements The matters discussed above under Business Environment raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. Accordingly, our Consolidated Financial Statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern. Results of Operations 2004 Compared to 2003 Net Loss and Loss per Share We recorded a consolidated net loss of $5.2 billion ($41.07 diluted loss per share) in 2004, compared to a consolidated net loss of $773 million ($6.40 diluted loss per share) in 2003. Operating Revenues Operating revenues totaled $15.0 billion in 2004, a 6% increase from 2003. Passenger revenue increased 6% on a 9% increase in capacity. The increase in passenger revenue reflects an 11% rise in RPMs and a 4% decline in passenger mile yield. The increase in capacity was primarily driven by the restoration of flights that we reduced in 2003 due to the war in Iraq. The decline in the passenger mile yield reflects our lack of pricing power due to the continuing growth of low-cost carriers with which we compete in most of our domestic markets, high industry capacity and increased price sensitivity by our customers, enhanced by the availability of airline fare information on the Internet. 30 Table of Contents Passenger Revenue per ASM ( Passenger RASM ) decreased 3% to 9.09 . Load factor increased 1.4 points to 74.7%. For additional information about factors impacting our passenger revenues for 2004, see the Business Environment section above. North American Passenger Revenues. North American passenger revenues increased 4% to $11.1 billion for 2004 on a capacity increase of 7%. RPMs increased 9%, while passenger mile yield fell 4%. Passenger RASM decreased 3% to 9.28 . Load factor increased by 1.1 points to 73.7%. International Passenger Revenues. International passenger revenues increased 18% to $2.6 billion during 2004 on a capacity increase of 15%. RPMs increased 19%, while passenger mile yield remained unchanged. Passenger RASM increased 3% to 8.16 , and load factor rose 2.2 points to 78.9%. All of these increases are primarily due to the depressed levels in the prior year from the war in Iraq. Cargo and Other Revenues. Cargo revenues increased 7% to $500 million in 2004 primarily due to a 13% increase from higher international freight volume and yield, which was partially offset by a 5% decrease due to lower mail volume and yield. Cargo ton miles increased 6%, while cargo ton mile yield remained relatively flat. Other revenues increased 19% to $712 million, primarily reflecting a 6% increase due to revenue from new airport handling contracts and other miscellaneous contracts, a 5% rise due to increased administrative service charges, and a 3% increase due to higher codeshare revenue from capacity increases. We expect revenues from administrative service charges to decrease in 2005 due to a reduction in ticket change fees we implemented in conjunction with the expansion of SimpliFares in January 2005. Increased volume in administrative service charges may offset some of this anticipated decrease. Operating Expenses Operating expenses were $18.3 billion for 2004, a 23%, or $3.4 billion, increase over 2003. As discussed below, the increase in operating expenses was primarily due to (1) a $1.9 billion goodwill impairment charge recorded in 2004; (2) significantly higher fuel prices in 2004 than in 2003; and (3) $398 million in reimbursements we received under the Emergency Wartime Supplemental Appropriations Act ( Appropriations Act ) in 2003 which were recorded as an offset to operating expenses in that year. Operating capacity increased 9% to 152 billion ASMs primarily due to the restoration of capacity that we reduced in 2003 due to the war in Iraq. Operating Cost per Available Seat Mile ( CASM ) increased 13% to 12.07 . Salaries and related costs were relatively flat at $6.3 billion. This reflects a 3% decline due to a decrease in benefit expenses from our cost savings initiatives and a 2% decline due to lower Mainline headcount. These decreases were offset by (1) a 3% increase due to higher pension and related expense; (2) a 1% increase due to a 4.5% salary rate increase in May 2004 for our pilots under their collective bargaining agreement which was partially offset by their rate decrease effective December 1, 2004; and (3) a 1% increase due to growth in operations. Aircraft fuel expense increased 51%, or $986 million, to $2.9 billion, with approximately $820 million of the increase resulting from higher fuel prices which remain at historically high levels. The average fuel price per gallon increased 42% to $1.16, and total gallons consumed increased 7%. Approximately 8% and 65% of our aircraft fuel requirements were hedged during 2004 and 2003, respectively. As discussed in Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, in February 2004, we settled all of our fuel hedge contracts prior to their scheduled settlement dates, resulting in a deferred gain of $82 million that we recognized during 2004. In 2004, our fuel expense is shown net of fuel hedge gains of $105 million, which included the gain related to the early settlement. Our fuel expense for 2003 is shown net of fuel hedge gains of $152 million. Contracted services expense increased 13%, primarily reflecting a 4% increase from new contracts to provide airport handling and other miscellaneous services, a 2% increase due to technology projects, a 2% increase due to the suspension of the Transportation Security Administration ( TSA ) security fee from June 1, 2003 to September 30, 2003 and subsequent reimbursements and a 2% increase resulting from higher capacity. Expenses from our contract carrier arrangements increased 19% to $932 million, largely reflecting an 8% increase from higher fuel costs, a 7% increase due to growth under certain contract carrier arrangements and a 3% increase from higher maintenance expense. 31 Table of Contents Aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs increased 8%, primarily due to increased materials volume and higher costs from scheduled maintenance events. Other selling expenses increased 5%, primarily reflecting a 3% rise from increased credit card charges due to higher traffic and a 1% increase from advertising and promotions. Passenger service expense increased 7%, primarily due to increased traffic. During December 2004, we recorded a $1.9 billion impairment charge, primarily related to goodwill, in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ( SFAS ) No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets ( SFAS 142 ). For additional information about the impairment charge, see Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Restructuring, asset writedowns, pension settlements and related items, net totaled a $41 million net gain for 2004 compared to a $268 million net charge for 2003. The 2004 amount includes (1) a $527 million gain related to the elimination of the healthcare coverage subsidy for non-pilot employees who retire after January 1, 2006; (2) settlement charges totaling $257 million primarily related to our defined benefit pension plan for pilots ( Pilot Plan ); (3) a $194 million charge related to voluntary and involuntary workforce reduction programs; and (4) a $40 million aircraft impairment charge related to our agreement, entered into in the September 2004 quarter, to sell eight owned MD-11 aircraft. The charge for 2003 consists of (1) $212 million related to settlements under the Pilot Plan; (2) $43 million related to a net curtailment loss for the cost of pension and postretirement obligations for participants under our 2002 workforce reduction programs; and (3) $41 million associated with the planned sale of 11 B737-800 aircraft. This charge was partially offset by a $28 million reduction to operating expenses from revised estimates of remaining costs associated with our restructuring activities. For additional information about these restructuring, asset writedowns, pension settlements and related items, net, see Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Reimbursements under the Appropriations Act totaled $398 million in 2003, representing reimbursements from the U.S. government to air carriers for certain passenger and air carrier security fees paid to the TSA. We recorded these amounts as a reduction to operating expenses in our Consolidated Statement of Operations. For additional information about the Appropriations Act, see Note 18 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Other operating expenses increased 20%. This primarily reflects a 7% increase from higher professional fees mainly from our restructuring and contingency planning efforts, a 4% increase due to a loss on certain aircraft transactions, a 4% increase from a rise in the navigation charges due to increased international capacity and a 4% increase due to higher fuel taxes. Operating Loss and Operating Margin We incurred an operating loss of $3.3 billion for 2004, compared to an operating loss of $785 million for 2003. Operating margin, which is the ratio of operating income (loss) to operating revenues, was (22%) and (6%) for 2004 and 2003, respectively. Other Income (Expense) Other expense, net for 2004 was $684 million, compared to other expense, net of $404 million for 2003. This change is primarily attributable to the following: Interest expense increased $67 million for 2004 compared to 2003 primarily due to higher levels of debt outstanding and higher interest rates on variable debt. Gain (loss) from sale of investments, net was $123 million for 2004 compared to $321 million for 2003. In 2004, we sold our remaining equity interest in Orbitz, Inc. ( Orbitz ), recognizing a gain of $123 million. The gain in 2003 was primarily related to a $279 million gain from the sale of our equity investment in WORLDSPAN, L.P. ( Worldspan ) and a $28 million gain from the sale of a portion of our equity interest in Orbitz. For additional information about these investments, see Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Fair value adjustments of derivatives accounted for under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities ( SFAS 133 ) resulted in a $31 million charge for 2004 compared to a $9 million charge for 32 Table of Contents 2003. These adjustments related to our equity warrants and other similar rights in certain companies and to derivative instruments used in our fuel hedging program. For additional information about SFAS 133, see Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Gain (loss) on extinguishment of debt, net was $9 million for 2004 compared to zero in 2003. During 2004, we recorded a gain due to the exchange of certain of our unsecured 7.7% Notes due 2005 for newly issued unsecured 8.0% Senior Notes due in December 2007. During 2003, we recorded a $15 million loss from our purchase of a portion of the Delta Family-Care Savings Plan Series C Guaranteed Serial ESOP Notes ( ESOP Notes ), offset by a $15 million gain related to a debt exchange. For additional information about these transactions, see Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Income Tax Provision (Benefit) During 2004, we recorded an additional valuation allowance against our net deferred income tax assets, which resulted in a $1.2 billion non-cash charge to income tax expense on our Consolidated Statement of Operations. For additional information about the income tax valuation allowance, see Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Results of Operations 2003 Compared to 2002 Net Loss and Loss per Share We recorded a consolidated net loss of $773 million ($6.40 diluted loss per share) in 2003, compared to a consolidated net loss of $1.3 billion ($10.44 diluted loss per share) in 2002. Operating Revenues Operating revenues increased 2% to $14.1 billion in 2003 compared to 2002. Passenger revenues increased 2% to $13.0 billion. RPMs decreased 2% on a capacity decline of 4%, while passenger mile yield increased 4% to 12.73 . For information about the factors negatively impacting the revenue environment, see the Business Environment section above. During 2003, the revenue environment was also negatively impacted by the military action in Iraq. North American Passenger Revenues. North American passenger revenues increased 2% to $10.7 billion in 2003. RPMs increased 1% on a capacity decrease of 2%, while passenger mile yield increased 1%. Load factors increased by 1.6 points. International Passenger Revenues. International passenger revenues decreased 4% to $2.2 billion in 2003. RPMs fell 12% on a capacity decline of 14%, while passenger mile yield increased 9%. The decline in international revenue passenger miles, particularly in the Atlantic region, is due to the reduction in traffic in the period leading up to and during the military action in Iraq in 2003. The increase in passenger mile yield primarily relates to the reduction of capacity in certain markets and favorable foreign currency exchange rates. Cargo and Other Revenues. Cargo revenues increased 2% to $467 million in 2003. Cargo ton miles decreased 6% due to reductions in capacity, while cargo ton mile yield increased 8%. Other revenues decreased 2% to $598 million, primarily reflecting decreases due to lower revenue from certain mileage partnership arrangements as well as a decline in codeshare revenue. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in various miscellaneous revenues. Operating Expenses Operating expenses totaled $14.9 billion for 2003, decreasing 2% from 2002. Operating capacity decreased 4% to 140 billion ASMs primarily due to capacity reductions implemented as a result of the military action in Iraq. We restored most of this capacity when passenger demand improved after the end of major military combat in Iraq in May 2003. CASM rose 2% to 10.66 . Operating expenses and CASM reflect (1) Appropriations Act reimbursements received during 2003; (2) restructuring, asset writedowns, pension settlements and related items, net recorded during 2003 and 2002; and (3) Stabilization Act compensation recorded in 2002. These items are discussed below. 33 Table of Contents Salaries and related costs totaled $6.3 billion in 2003, a 3% increase from 2002. This 3% increase primarily reflects (1) a 5% increase from higher pension and related expense of approximately $290 million; (2) a 2% increase due to salary rate increases primarily for pilots in the June 2003 and June 2002 quarters under their collective bargaining agreement, and for mechanics in the June 2002 quarter; and (3) a 2% increase due to growth in our wholly owned subsidiaries regional jet operations. These increases were partially offset by a 6% decrease due to our 2002 workforce reduction programs. The increase in pension expense mainly reflects the impact of declining interest rates, a decrease in the fair value of pension plan assets and scheduled pilot salary increases, partially offset by approximately $120 million in expense reductions from the transition of our non-pilot defined benefit pension plan to a cash balance plan. For additional information related to this transition, see Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Aircraft fuel expense totaled $1.9 billion during 2003, a 15% increase from 2002. This increase is primarily due to higher fuel prices, partially offset by capacity reductions. The average fuel price per gallon rose 22% to 81.78 , while total gallons consumed decreased 6%. Our fuel cost is shown net of fuel hedge gains of $152 million for 2003 and $136 million for 2002. Approximately 65% and 56% of our aircraft fuel requirements were hedged during 2003 and 2002, respectively. For additional information about our fuel hedge contracts, see Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Depreciation and amortization expense rose 6% in 2003, primarily due to the acquisition of regional jet aircraft and an increase in software amortization associated with completed technology projects. Contracted services expense declined 12% primarily due to reduced traffic and capacity, the suspension of the air carrier security fees under the Appropriations Act between June 1, 2003 and September 30, 2003, and a decrease in contracted services across certain workgroups. For additional information about the Appropriations Act, see Note 18 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Expenses from our contract carrier arrangements increased 40% to $784 million primarily due to growth under our agreement with Chautauqua. Landing fees and other rents rose 3%, primarily due to higher landing fees adopted by airports seeking to recover lost revenue due to decreased traffic, and increased facility rates. Aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs expense fell 11%, primarily from reduced maintenance volume and materials consumption as a result of process improvement initiatives, lower capacity and our fleet simplification program. Aircraft rent expense increased 3% mainly due to our decision in the December 2002 quarter to return our B737-300 leased aircraft to service during 2003. For additional information related to this decision, see Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Other selling expenses fell 11%. This decline primarily reflects a 9% decrease related to lower booking fees from decreased traffic and a 3% decline from higher sales of mileage credits under our SkyMiles program because a portion of this revenue is recorded as an offset to other selling expenses. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in advertising expenses due to the launch of Song, our low-fare service. Passenger commission expense declined 34%, primarily reflecting a 22% decrease from the change in our commission rate structure in 2002, which resulted in the elimination of travel agent base commissions for tickets sold in the U.S. and Canada. The decrease in passenger commissions also reflects the cancellation or renegotiation of certain travel agent contracts and a lower volume of base and incentive commissions. Passenger service expense decreased 13%, primarily reflecting a 10% decline from decreased traffic and capacity, and a 7% decrease due to certain meal service-related cost savings initiatives. Restructuring, asset writedowns, pension settlements and related items, net totaled $268 million in 2003 compared to $439 million in 2002. Our 2003 charge consists of (1) $212 million related to settlements under the Pilot Plan; (2) $43 million related to a net curtailment loss for the cost of pension and postretirement obligations for participants under our 2002 workforce reduction programs; and (3) $41 million associated with the planned sale of 11 B737-800 aircraft. This charge was partially offset by a $28 million reduction to operating expenses from revised estimates of remaining costs associated with our restructuring activities. Our 2002 charge consists of (1) $251 million in asset writedowns; (2) $127 million related to our 2002 workforce reduction programs; (3) $93 million for the temporary carrying cost of surplus pilots and grounded aircraft; (4) $30 million due to the deferred delivery of certain Boeing aircraft; (5) $14 million for the closure of certain leased facilities; and (6) $3 million related to other items. This charge was partially offset by (1) the reversal of a $56 million reserve 34 Table of Contents for future lease payments related to nine B737-300 leased aircraft as a result of a decision in 2002 to return these aircraft to service and (2) a $23 million adjustment of certain prior year restructuring reserves based on revised estimates of remaining costs. For additional information on these restructuring, asset writedowns, pension settlements and related items, net, see Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Appropriations Act reimbursements totaled $398 million in 2003, representing reimbursements from the U.S. government to air carriers for certain passenger and air carrier security fees. We recorded these amounts as a reduction to operating expenses in our Consolidated Statement of Operations. For additional information about the Appropriations Act, see Note 18 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Stabilization Act compensation totaled $34 million in 2002, representing amounts we recognized as compensation in the applicable period under the Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act ( Stabilization Act ). We recorded these amounts as a reduction to operating expenses in our Consolidated Statement of Operations. For additional information about the Stabilization Act, see Note 18 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Other operating expenses fell 16%, primarily reflecting a 9% decrease due to lower insurance rates under U.S. government-provided insurance policies and lower volume-related insurance premiums due to decreased capacity and traffic, as well as a 3% decline due to lower communication and supplies expenses. Operating Loss and Operating Margin We incurred an operating loss of $785 million in 2003, compared to an operating loss of $1.3 billion in 2002. Operating margin was (6%) and (9%) for 2003 and 2002, respectively. Other Income (Expense) Other expense, net totaled $404 million during 2003, compared to other expense, net of $693 million in 2002. Included in these results are the following: A $92 million increase in interest expense in 2003 compared to 2002 primarily due to higher levels of outstanding debt in 2003. A $321 million gain in 2003 from the sale of certain investments. This primarily relates to a $279 million gain from the sale of our equity investment in Worldspan and a $28 million gain from the sale of a portion of our equity interest in Orbitz. For additional information about these investments, see Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Gain (loss) on extinguishment of debt, net was zero for 2003 compared to a $42 million loss in 2002, which resulted from our purchase of a portion of the outstanding ESOP Notes. During 2003, we recorded a $15 million loss from our purchase of a portion of the outstanding ESOP Notes, offset by a $15 million gain related to a debt exchange. For additional information about our purchase of ESOP Notes in 2003 and 2002 and our debt exchange in 2003, see Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. A $9 million charge in 2003 compared to a $39 million charge in 2002 for fair value adjustments of financial instruments accounted for under SFAS 133. This relates to derivative instruments we use in our fuel hedging program and to our equity warrants and other similar rights in certain companies. Miscellaneous income, net was $5 million in 2003 compared to $20 million in 2002 due primarily to a decrease in earnings from our equity investment in Worldspan, which we sold in June 2003. 35 Table of Contents Financial Condition and Liquidity Sources and Uses of Cash 2004 Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled $1.8 billion at December 31, 2004, compared to $2.7 billion at December 31, 2003. For 2004, net cash used in operating activities totaled $1.1 billion, which includes the following items: A $5.2 billion net loss for 2004. This net loss reflects a $1.9 billion impairment charge related to goodwill and intangible assets, $1.2 billion of depreciation and amortization, and a $1.2 billion income tax provision related to a valuation allowance against our net deferred income tax assets, all of which are non-cash items. A $455 million funding of our qualified defined benefit pension plans. A $141 million increase in total restricted cash, primarily to support certain projected insurance obligations related to workers compensation. Capital expenditures include (1) cash used for flight equipment, including advance payments; (2) cash used for ground property and equipment (including expenditures, net of reimbursements, related to our Boston airport terminal project); and (3) aircraft delivered under seller-financing arrangements (which is a non-cash item). During 2004, capital expenditures were approximately $920 million, which included the acquisition of 23 CRJ-700 aircraft. We acquired 17 of these regional jet aircraft through seller-financing arrangements for $314 million. Debt and capital lease obligations, including current maturities and short-term obligations, totaled $13.9 billion at December 31, 2004, compared to $12.6 billion at December 31, 2003. During 2004, we engaged in the following financing transactions: We entered into secured financing arrangements under which we borrowed approximately $920 million, which is due in installments through June 2020. We used approximately $500 million of this amount to repay interim financing for 18 CRJ-200 and 12 CRJ-700 aircraft. In February 2004, we issued $325 million principal amount of 2 7 / 8 % Convertible Senior Notes due 2024 ( 2 7 / 8 % Convertible Senior Notes ). In February 2004, we entered into an agreement to purchase 32 CRJ-200 aircraft to be delivered in 2005. In connection with this agreement, we received a commitment from a third party to finance, on a secured basis at the time of acquisition, our purchase of these regional jet aircraft. In July 2004 we amended three of our existing secured loan agreements with General Electric Capital Corporation ( GECC ). As a result of these amendments, we received $152 million of incremental liquidity. In November 2004, we exchanged (1) $237 million aggregate principal amount of our enhanced equipment trust certificates due in 2005 and 2006 for $235 million principal amount of newly issued 9.5% Senior Secured Notes due 2008; and (2) approximately $135 million principal amount of our unsecured 7.7% Notes due 2005 for a like principal amount of newly issued unsecured 8.0% Senior Notes due 2007 and 5,488,054 shares of our common stock. In November 2004, we entered into financing agreements with GE Commercial Finance and Amex to borrow approximately $1.1 billion. We completed agreements with other aircraft lenders to defer $112 million in debt obligations due in 2004 through 2006 to later years. During the December 2004 quarter, we entered into agreements with aircraft lessors and lenders under which we expect to receive average annual cash savings of approximately $57 million between 2005 and 2009, which will also result in some cost reductions. We issued an aggregate of 4,354,724 shares of our common stock to the aircraft lessors and lenders in these transactions. Separately, as a result of agreements with approximately 115 suppliers, we expect to realize average annual benefits of approximately $46 million during 2005, 2006 and 2007. 36 Table of Contents In October 2004, we sold eight owned MD-11 aircraft and related inventory for $227 million. We recorded a $41 million impairment charge related to the sale of the aircraft. For additional information about this charge, see Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. During November 2004, we sold our remaining equity investment in Orbitz for approximately $143 million. We recorded a $123 million gain related to this transaction. For additional information about our investment in Orbitz, see Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In March 2005, we exchanged $176 million principal amount of enhanced equipment trust certificates due in 2005 for a like aggregate principal amount of enhanced equipment trust certificates due in 2006 and 2008. For additional information about this transaction, see Note 20 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For additional information about financing and other transactions affecting liquidity, see Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For additional information about our liquidity position, see the Business Environment section above. Future Aircraft Order Commitments To preserve liquidity, we have taken the following actions regarding our orders for Mainline aircraft: During 2003, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell 11 B737-800 aircraft to a third party immediately after those aircraft are delivered to us by the manufacturer in 2005. During 2004, we deferred the delivery of the following aircraft on firm order: deferred seven B737-800 aircraft from 2005 to 2007; deferred five B737-800 aircraft from 2006 to 2007; deferred four B737-800 aircraft from 2006 to 2008; deferred two B777-200 aircraft from 2005 to 2008; and deferred three B777-200 aircraft from 2006 to 2009. Our long-term plan is to reduce our Mainline aircraft fleet by up to four fleet types over approximately the next four years. During 2005, we expect to retire 24 Mainline aircraft: 21 B737-300 and B737-200 aircraft, and three B767-200 aircraft. These retirements will not have a material impact on our 2005 Consolidated Financial Statements. We have additional aircraft commitments that are discussed below in Contractual Obligations . For additional information about our aircraft order commitments, see Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Shareowners Deficit Shareowners deficit was $5.8 billion at December 31, 2004 and $659 million at December 31, 2003. The increase in our shareowners deficit is primarily due to our $5.2 billion net loss in 2004, which includes a $1.9 billion goodwill impairment charge and a $1.2 billion income tax provision to reserve substantially all of our net deferred tax assets. For additional information about the goodwill impairment and valuation allowance, see Notes 5 and 9, respectively, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. ESOP Preferred Stock Delaware Law provides that a company may pay dividends on its stock only (1) out of its surplus, which is generally defined as the excess of a company net assets over the aggregate par value of its issued stock, or (2) from its net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is paid or from its net profits for the preceding fiscal year. Delaware Law also prohibits a company from redeeming or purchasing its stock for cash or other property, unless the company has sufficient surplus. Because we expected to have, and did in fact have, a negative surplus at December 31, 2003, our Board of Directors took the following actions, effective in December 2003, related to our ESOP Preferred Stock to comply with Delaware Law: Suspended indefinitely the payment of dividends on our ESOP Preferred Stock. Unpaid dividends on the ESOP Preferred Stock will accrue without interest, until paid, at a rate of $4.32 per share per year. The ESOP Preferred Stock is held by Fidelity Management Trust Company in its 37 Table of Contents capacity as trustee for the Delta Family-Care Savings Plan, a broad-based employee benefit plan ( Savings Plan ). Changed the form of payment we use to redeem shares of ESOP Preferred Stock when redemptions are required under the Savings Plan. For the indefinite future, we will pay the redemption price of the ESOP Preferred Stock in shares of our common stock rather than in cash. At December 31, 2004, approximately 5 million shares of ESOP Preferred Stock were held by the Savings Plan. About 4 million shares of ESOP Preferred Stock are currently allocated to the accounts of Savings Plan participants; the remainder of the shares is available for allocation in the future. We are generally required to redeem shares of ESOP Preferred Stock (1) to provide for distributions of the accounts of Savings Plan participants who terminate employment with us and request a distribution and (2) to implement annual diversification elections by Savings Plan participants who are at least age 55 and have participated in the Savings Plan for at least ten years. In these circumstances, shares of ESOP Preferred Stock are redeemable at a price ( Redemption Price ) equal to the greater of (1) $72.00 per share or (2) the fair value of the shares of our common stock issuable upon conversion of the ESOP Preferred Stock to be redeemed, plus, in either case, accrued but unpaid dividends on the shares of ESOP Preferred Stock to be redeemed. Each share of ESOP Convertible Preferred Stock is convertible into 1.7155 shares of our common stock, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. Under the terms of the ESOP Preferred Stock, we may pay the Redemption Price in cash, shares of our common stock (valued at fair value) or in a combination thereof. As discussed above, since December 2003, we have been using shares of our common stock to pay the Redemption Price when we are required to redeem ESOP Preferred Stock. During 2004, we issued 6,330,551 shares of our common stock to redeem approximately 422,000 shares of ESOP Preferred Stock under the Savings Plan. We cannot reasonably estimate future issuances of common stock for this purpose due to the various factors that would affect such an estimate, including the duration of the period during which we may not redeem ESOP Preferred Stock for cash under Delaware Law; the fair value of Delta common stock when ESOP Preferred Stock is redeemed; and the number of shares of ESOP Preferred Stock redeemed by Savings Plan participants who terminate their employment with us or elect to diversify their Savings Plan accounts. For additional information about our ESOP Preferred Stock, see Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Working Capital Position As of December 31, 2004, we had negative working capital of $2.3 billion, compared to negative working capital of $1.6 billion at December 31, 2003. This change in our negative working capital balance is primarily due to the decrease in our cash and cash equivalents, which is discussed above in Sources and Uses of Cash. Credit Ratings Our senior unsecured long-term debt is rated Ca by Moody Investors Service, Inc., CC by Standard and Poor Rating Services and C by Fitch Ratings. Moody and Fitch have stated that their ratings outlook for our senior unsecured debt is negative while Standard & Poor has stated its outlook is positive watch. Our credit ratings may be lowered further or withdrawn. While we do not have debt obligations that accelerate as a result of a credit ratings downgrade, our credit ratings have negatively impacted our ability to issue unsecured debt, renew outstanding letters of credit that back certain of our obligations and obtain certain financial instruments that we use in our fuel hedging program. Our credit ratings have also increased the cost of our financing transactions and the amount of collateral required for certain financial instruments, insurance coverage and vendor agreements. To the extent we are unable to access the capital markets, or our financing costs continue to increase, including as a result of further credit ratings downgrades, our business, financial position and results of operations would be materially adversely impacted. Subsequent to December 31, 2004, our collateral requirements related to our workers compensation insurance increased by approximately $35 million. 38 Table of Contents Covenants The GE Commercial Finance Facility includes affirmative, negative and financial covenants that impose substantial restrictions on our financial and business operations, including our ability to, among other things, incur or secure other debt, make investments, sell assets, pay dividends or repurchase stock and make capital expenditures. The Amex Facilities also contain affirmative, negative and financial covenants substantially the same as those found in the GE Commercial Finance Facility. The financial covenants require us to: maintain unrestricted funds not less than $900 million at all times until February 28, 2005, $1 billion at all times from March 1, 2005 through October 31, 2005 and $750 million at all times thereafter (the Liquidity Covenant ). maintain accounts pledged for the benefit of the lenders with funds of not less than $650 million at all times until October 31, 2005, $550 million at all times from November 1, 2005 through February 28, 2006 and $650 million at all times thereafter. The cash and cash equivalents in those accounts can be used for purposes of determining compliance with the Liquidity Covenant. not exceed specified levels of capital expenditures during each fiscal quarter. achieve specified levels of EBITDAR, as defined, for designated rolling periods (generally monthly tests for successive trailing 12-month periods) through November 2007. During 2005, we are required to achieve increasing levels of EBITDAR, including EBITDAR of $1.590 billion for the 12-month period ending December 31, 2005. Thereafter, the minimum EBITDAR level for successive trailing 12-month periods continues to increase, including $2.763 billion for the 12-month period ending December 31, 2006 and $3.136 billion for the 12-month period ending November 30, 2007. The EBITDAR covenant effectively provides that if our cash on hand exceeds the minimum cash on hand that we are required to maintain pursuant to the Liquidity Covenant by at least $100 million, then the EBITDAR level that we are required to achieve will be reduced by a specified amount. At December 31, 2004, we were in compliance with our financial covenants. Although under our business plan we expect to be in compliance with these covenants in 2005, we do not expect to exceed by a significant margin the requirements that we (1) maintain specified levels of cash and cash equivalents or (2) achieve certain levels of EBITDAR. If we are unable to comply with these covenants, the outstanding borrowings under our financing agreements with GE Commercial Finance and Amex could become immediately due and payable. For additional information concerning our covenants, see the GE Commercial Finance Facility, incorporated as Exhibit 10.5 to this Form 10-K. Our Reimbursement Agreement with GECC includes a Collateral Value Test, which is not applicable until May 2006. For additional information about this test and our financing agreements, see Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. As is customary in the airline industry, our aircraft lease and financing agreements require that we maintain certain levels of insurance coverage, including war-risk insurance. We were in compliance with these requirements at December 31, 2004 and 2003. For additional information about our war-risk insurance currently provided by the U.S. government, see Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For additional information on our liquidity, see the Business Environment section of Management Discussion and Analysis in this Form 10-K. Prior Years 2003 Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled $2.7 billion at December 31, 2003. Net cash provided by operations totaled $142 million during 2003, including net tax refunds totaling $402 million. Capital expenditures, including aircraft acquisitions under seller-financing arrangements, were $1.5 billion during 2003; this included the acquisition of 31 CRJ-200 and 20 CRJ-700 aircraft. Debt and capital lease obligations, 39 Table of Contents including current maturities and short-term obligations, totaled $12.6 billion at December 31, 2003. We issued $1.9 billion of secured long-term debt during 2003. 2002 Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled $2.0 billion at December 31, 2002. Net cash provided by operations totaled $225 million during 2002, including receipt of (1) a $472 million tax refund due to a new tax law and (2) $112 million in compensation under the Stabilization Act. Capital expenditures, including aircraft acquisitions made under seller-financing arrangements, were $2.0 billion during 2002; this included the acquisition of four B737-800, three B767-400, one B777-200, 34 CRJ-200 and 15 CRJ-700 aircraft. Debt and capital lease obligations, including current maturities and short-term obligations, totaled $10.9 billion at December 31, 2002. We issued $2.6 billion of secured long-term debt during 2002. Financial Position December 31, 2004 Compared to December 31, 2003 This section discusses certain changes in our Consolidated Balance Sheets which are not otherwise discussed in this Form 10-K. Prepaid expenses and other current assets increased by 10%, or $49 million, primarily reflecting an increase in prepaid aircraft fuel from higher fuel costs and increased prepayment requirements. Flight and ground equipment under capital leases, net of accumulated amortization, increased $243 million primarily due to the renegotiation of certain operating leases that are now classified as capital leases in accordance with SFAS 13, Accounting for Leases, due to the amendment of certain lease terms (see Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Restricted investments for our Boston airport terminal project decreased 56%, or $159 million, due primarily to the reimbursement of project expenditures during 2004. Accounts payable, deferred credits and other accrued liabilities decreased 9%, or $149 million, primarily reflecting a decrease in trade accounts payable from increased prepayment requirements in 2004. Air traffic liability increased 20% from 2003 primarily due to (1) stronger advance sales from increased capacity and (2) growth in codeshare operations. Accrued salaries and related benefits decreased 10% due primarily to (1) a lower vacation accrual at the end of 2004 due to changes in our salary rates as part of our transformation plan and (2) salary rate decreases that occurred in the December 2004 quarter primarily related to our new pilot collective bargaining agreement that was effective December 1, 2004. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2004 related to debt; operating leases; aircraft order commitments; capital leases; contract carrier obligations; interest and related payments; other material, noncancelable purchase obligations; and other liabilities. The table excludes commitments that are contingent based on events or other factors that are uncertain or unknown at this time. Some of these excluded commitments are discussed in footnote 9 to this table and in the text immediately following that footnote. Contractual Payments Due By Period After (in millions) Total 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2009 Debt (1) $ 13,450 $ 835 $ 913 $ 1,374 $ 1,549 $ 1,324 $ 7,455 Operating lease payments (2) 9,662 1,091 1,017 915 980 836 4,823 Aircraft order commitments (3) 4,161 1,002 598 1,645 510 406 Capital lease obligations (4) 1,122 158 162 134 112 146 410 Contract carrier obligations (5) 317 79 79 79 80 Interest and related payments (6) 7,514 837 737 684 592 506 4,158 Other purchase obligations (7) 342 257 17 12 12 11 33 Other liabilities (8) 69 69 Total (9) $ 36,637 $ 4,328 $ 3,523 $ 4,843 $ 3,835 $ 3,229 $ 16,879 40 Table of Contents (1) These amounts are included on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. A portion of this debt is backed by letters of credit totaling $300 million at December 31, 2004. Additionally, included in these amounts is approximately (1) $75 million and $180 million due in 2005 and 2006, respectively, under interim financing arrangements which we used to purchase regional jet aircraft that we may elect to refinance using long-term, secured financing commitments available to us from a third party and (2) $130 million in 2005 debt maturities which we do not expect to be required to repay in 2005 or which we expect to repay and then re-borrow during 2005. For additional information about our debt and related matters, see Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. (2) Our operating lease obligations are discussed in Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. A portion of these obligations is backed by letters of credit totaling $104 million at December 31, 2004. For additional information about these letters of credit, see Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. (3) Our capital expenditures in 2005 include approximately (1) $520 million related to our agreement to purchase 32 CRJ-200 aircraft, for which financing is available to us on a long-term secured basis when we acquire these aircraft and (2) $415 million related to our commitment to purchase 11 B737-800 aircraft, for which we have entered into a definitive agreement to sell to a third party immediately following delivery of these aircraft to us by the manufacturer in 2005. For additional information about these matters, see Notes 6 and 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. (4) Interest payments related to capital lease obligations are included in the table. The present value of these obligations, excluding interest, is included on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. For additional information about our capital lease obligations, see Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. (5) This amount represents our minimum fixed obligation under our contract carrier agreement with Chautauqua. Under the Chautauqua agreement, we are obligated to pay certain minimum fixed obligations. Due to an amendment to the Chautauqua agreement in March 2004, we are now able to calculate the amount of the minimum fixed obligation. Payments due after 2008 are not included in the table as minimum rates have not been contractually agreed upon. For additional information regarding our contract carrier agreements, see Contract Carriers below. (6) These amounts represent future interest payments related to our debt obligations based on the fixed and variable interest rates specified in the associated debt agreements. Payments in early 2005 related to variable rate debt are based on the specified margin and the base rate, such as LIBOR, in effect at December 31, 2004. The base rates typically reset every one to six months depending on the financing agreement. Payments for variable rate debt in late 2005 and thereafter do not consider any amount for the base rate component of the interest calculation since the rate is unknown at December 31, 2004; these payments were calculated based only on the specified margin. At December 31, 2004, by way of context, the base rate component of the interest calculation on our $5 billion of variable rate debt is approximately 2.5%. The related payments represent credit enhancements required in conjunction with certain financing agreements. (7) Includes purchase obligations pursuant to which we are required to make minimum payments for goods and services, including but not limited to communications and reservations systems, technology, insurance, fuel, flight operations, and other third party services and products. For additional information about other commitments and contingencies, see Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. (8) Represents other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets for which we are obligated to make future payments related to postretirement medical benefit costs incurred but not yet paid and payments required under the pilot collective bargaining agreement for unused vacation time. These liabilities are not included in any other line item on this table. (9) In addition to the contractual obligations included in the table, we have significant cash obligations that are not included in the table. For example, we will pay wages required under collective bargaining agreements; fund pension plans (as discussed below); purchase capacity under contract carrier arrangements (as discussed below); and pay credit card processing fees and fees for other goods and services, including those related to fuel, maintenance and commissions. While we are parties to legally binding contracts regarding these goods and services, the actual commitment is contingent on certain factors such as volume and/or variable rates that are uncertain or unknown at this time. Therefore, these items are not included in the table. In addition, purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business are excluded from the table and any amounts which we are liable for under the purchase orders are included in current liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The following items are not included in the table above: Pension Funding. Estimates of the amount and timing of future funding obligations under our pension plans are based on various assumptions. These include assumptions concerning, among other things, the actual and projected market performance of the plan assets, 30-year U.S. Treasury bond yields, statutory requirements and demographic data for pension plan participants. We estimate that our pension plan funding will be approximately $450 million for 2005. Our anticipated funding obligations under our pension plans for 2006 and thereafter vary materially depending on the assumptions used to determine these funding obligations, including potential legislative changes regarding these obligations. Absent the enactment of new federal legislation which reduces our pension funding obligations 41 Table of Contents during the next several years, our annual pension funding obligations for each of 2006 through 2009 will be significantly higher than in 2005 and could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity. Contract Carriers. We have long-term contract carrier agreements with three regional air carriers, SkyWest, Chautauqua and Republic Airline. Under these agreements, SkyWest and Chautauqua operate certain of their aircraft using our flight code, and we schedule those aircraft, sell the seats on those flights and retain the related revenues. We pay those airlines an amount, as defined in the applicable agreement, which is based on an annual determination of their cost of operating those flights and other factors intended to approximate market rates for those services. Republic Airline will begin operating certain of their aircraft using our flight code in July 2005. We expect to incur expenses of approximately $1.0 billion in 2005 under our contract carrier agreements, which includes $79 million in the table above under our contract carrier agreement with Chautauqua. Under the Chautauqua agreement, we are obligated to pay certain minimum fixed obligations. The remaining estimated expenses are not included in the table above because these expenses are contingent based on the costs associated with the operation of contract carrier flights by those air carriers as well as rates that are unknown at this time. We cannot reasonably estimate at this time our expenses under the contract carrier agreements in 2006 and thereafter, except for the minimum obligations under the Chautauqua agreement included in the table above. In April 2004, we notified FLYi, Inc. ( Flyi ), another regional air carrier that previously operated certain of their aircraft using our flight code, of our election to terminate its contract carrier agreement due to Flyi decision to operate a new low-fare airline using jet aircraft with more than 70 seats. Flyi ceased operating Delta Connection flights in November 2004. Flyi exercised its right to require us to assume the leases on the 30 Fairchild Dornier FRJ-328 regional jet aircraft that it operated for us. We are currently conducting inspections of these aircraft. After we complete the inspections, we expect to assume these leases. We estimate that the total remaining lease payments on these 30 aircraft leases will be approximately $275 million. These lease payments will be made over the remaining terms of the aircraft leases, which are approximately 13 years. We are evaluating our options for utilizing these 30 aircraft, including having another air carrier operate these aircraft for us under the Delta Connection carrier program. There are no residual value guarantees related to these leases. If we assume the leases for the 30 FRJ-328 aircraft as currently in effect, a Flyi bankruptcy or insolvency or, with respect to certain of the leases, a Flyi default under various contracts, including leases, loans and purchase contracts having a value or amount in excess of $15 million, would constitute an event of default. If an event of default were to occur, the financing parties could exercise one or more remedies, including the right to require us to purchase the aircraft at a purchase price stipulated in the applicable lease. At March 1, 2005, the purchase price for each aircraft was approximately $9 million, which we estimate exceeds the current market value of each aircraft by approximately $3 million. Our estimate of the current market value of these aircraft is based on published industry data. We cannot determine the likelihood of the occurrence of an event relating to Flyi that would constitute an event of default under the leases or the likelihood of the financing parties seeking to exercise certain remedies against us if such an event of default were to occur. Flyi has stated that as part of its restructuring effort, it has secured commitments from certain of the financing parties that, upon our assumption of the leases, such parties will effectively release Flyi from its future obligations to such financing parties under the leases. We are in discussions with the financing parties to restructure these leases so that events relating to Flyi would not constitute an event of default after we assume the leases. We may terminate certain of our contract carrier agreements without cause, which may require us to assume the leases or purchase the aircraft the contract carrier operates for us. For additional information regarding our contract carrier agreements, including our obligations if we elect to terminate certain agreements without cause, see Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. GECC Aircraft. In November 2004, as a condition to availability of the GE Commercial Finance Facility, we granted GECC the right, exercisable until November 2, 2005, to lease to us (or, at our option subject to certain conditions, certain Delta Connection carriers) up to 12 CRJ-200 aircraft then leased to another airline. Subsequent to December 31, 2004, GECC exercised this right with respect to eight CRJ-200 aircraft. The lease terms for these eight aircraft begin throughout 2005 and have terms of 138 to 168 months. We estimate that our 42 Table of Contents total lease payments for these eight aircraft will be approximately $130 million during the next 14 years. Additionally, the lease rates we will pay for these aircraft approximate current market rates. We expect to use these aircraft in our operations. Redemptions of ESOP Preferred Stock. As discussed above, we changed the form of payment we will use to redeem shares of ESOP Preferred Stock when redemptions are required under the Savings Plan. For the indefinite future, we will pay the redemption price of the ESOP Preferred Stock in shares of our common stock rather than in cash. For additional information about our ESOP Preferred Stock, see Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Legal Contingencies. We are involved in legal proceedings relating to antitrust matters, employment practices, environmental issues and other matters concerning our business. We are also a defendant in numerous lawsuits arising out of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. We cannot reasonably estimate the potential loss for certain legal proceedings because, for example, the litigation is in its early stages or the plaintiff does not specify the damages being sought. Although the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty and could have a material adverse effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements, management believes that the resolution of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Other Contingent Obligations under Contracts. In addition to the contractual obligations discussed above, we have certain contracts for goods and services that require us to pay a penalty, acquire inventory specific to us or purchase contract specific equipment, as defined by each respective contract, if we terminate the contract without cause prior to its expiration date. These obligations are contingent upon whether we terminate the contract without cause prior to its expiration date; therefore, no obligation would exist unless such a termination were to occur. Subsequent to December 31, 2004, we entered into an agreement to outsource certain human resources services. Under this agreement, we expect to pay a total of approximately $120 million over the next seven years on a declining scale, with our largest annual obligation totaling approximately $20 million to be paid in 2005. This agreement is subject to certain termination provisions. For additional information about other contingencies not discussed above as well as discussions related to general indemnifications, see Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Application of Critical Accounting Policies Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions. We periodically evaluate these estimates and assumptions, which are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates. Rules proposed by the Securities and Exchange Commission would require disclosures related to accounting estimates management makes in applying accounting policies and the initial adoption of an accounting policy that has a material impact on its financial statements. These proposed rules define critical accounting estimates as those accounting estimates which (1) require management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made and (2) would have resulted in material changes to our Consolidated Financial Statements if different estimates, which we reasonably could have used, were made. Our critical accounting estimates are briefly described below. Goodwill. SFAS 142 addresses financial accounting and reporting for goodwill and other intangible assets, including when and how to perform impairment tests of recorded balances. We have three reporting units that have assigned goodwill: Mainline, ASA and Comair. Quoted stock market prices are not available for these individual reporting units. Accordingly, consistent with SFAS 142, our methodology for estimating the fair value of each reporting unit primarily considers projected future cash flows. In applying this methodology, we (1) make assumptions about each reporting unit future cash flows based on capacity, passenger yield, traffic, operating costs and other relevant factors and (2) discount those cash flows based on each reporting unit weighted average cost of capital. Changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on our Consolidated 43 Table of Contents Financial Statements. The annual impairment test date for our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets is December 31. We performed our annual goodwill impairment test as of December 31, 2004 with the assistance of an independent valuation firm to determine the fair value of our three reporting units. As a result of our 2004 annual goodwill impairment tests, we recorded a $1.9 billion charge to write off all goodwill related to the ASA and Comair reporting units. This charge is recorded in impairment of intangible assets on our 2004 Consolidated Statement of Operations. For additional information about our accounting policy related to goodwill and other intangibles and the impairment charge we recorded in 2004, see Notes 1 and 5 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets. We record impairment losses on long-lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than their carrying amounts. The amount of impairment loss recognized is the amount by which the carrying amounts of the assets exceed the estimated fair values. In order to evaluate potential impairment as required by SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets ( SFAS 144 ), we group assets at the fleet type level (the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows) and then estimate future cash flows based on assumptions involving projections of passenger yield, fuel costs, labor costs and other relevant factors in the markets in which these aircraft operate. Aircraft fair values are estimated by management using published sources, appraisals and bids received from third parties, as available. Changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. For additional information about our accounting policy for the impairment of long-lived assets, see Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Income Tax Valuation Allowance. In accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes ( SFAS 109 ), deferred tax assets should be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The future realization of our net deferred tax assets depends on the availability of sufficient future taxable income. In making this determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence and make certain assumptions. We consider, among other things, the overall business environment; our historical earnings, including our significant pretax losses incurred during the last four years; our industry historically cyclical periods of earnings and losses; and our outlook for future years. During 2004, we recorded an additional valuation allowance against our deferred income tax assets, which resulted in a $1.2 billion charge to income tax expense on our Consolidated Statement of Operations. We recorded this additional valuation allowance because we determined that it is unclear as to the timing of when we will generate sufficient taxable income to realize our deferred income tax assets. In addition, we will no longer recognize the tax benefit of current period losses for the foreseeable future. For additional information about income taxes, see Notes 1 and 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Pension Plans. We sponsor defined benefit pension plans ( Plans ) for eligible employees and retirees. The impact of the Plans on our Consolidated Financial Statements as of December 31, 2004 and 2003 and for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002 is presented in Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We currently estimate that our defined benefit pension expense in 2005 will be approximately $440 million. The effect of our Plans on our Consolidated Financial Statements is subject to many assumptions. We believe the most critical assumptions are (1) the weighted average discount rate; (2) the rate of increase in future compensation levels; and (3) the expected long-term rate of return on Plan assets. We determine our weighted average discount rate on our measurement date primarily by reference to annualized rates earned on high quality fixed income investments and yield-to-maturity analysis specific to our estimated future benefit payments. Adjusting our discount rate (6.00% at September 30, 2004) by 0.5% would change our accrued pension cost by approximately $750 million at December 31, 2004 and change our estimated pension expense in 2005 by approximately $40 million. Our rate of increase in future compensation levels is based primarily on labor contracts currently in effect with our employees under collective bargaining agreements and expected future pay rate increases for other employees. Adjusting our estimated rate of increase in future compensation levels (-1.28% at September 30, 2004) by 0.5% would not significantly change our estimated pension expense in 2005 due primarily to recent employee pay reductions. 44 Table of Contents The expected long-term rate of return on our Plan assets is based primarily on Plan-specific asset/liability investment studies performed by outside consultants and recent and historical returns on our Plans assets. Adjusting our expected long-term rate of return (9.00% at September 30, 2004) by 0.5% would change our estimated pension expense in 2005 by approximately $35 million. For additional information about our pension plans, see Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ( SFAS ) No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment ( SFAS 123R ). This standard replaces SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation and supersedes Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. It requires that the compensation cost of share-based payment transactions be recognized in financial statements based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued. This statement is effective for us beginning July 1, 2005. We are evaluating the impact of SFAS 123R, including the transition options for adoption of this standard on our 2005 Consolidated Financial Statements. This impact may be material as we issued approximately 71 million stock options in 2004, primarily under our new broad-based employee stock option plans (see Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Market Risks Associated with Financial Instruments We have significant market risk exposure related to aircraft fuel prices and interest rates. Market risk is the potential negative impact of adverse changes in these prices or rates on our Consolidated Financial Statements. To manage the volatility relating to these exposures, we periodically enter into derivative transactions pursuant to stated policies (see Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Management expects adjustments to the fair value of financial instruments accounted for under SFAS 133 to result in ongoing volatility in earnings and shareowners deficit. The following sensitivity analyses do not consider the effects of a change in demand for air travel, the economy as a whole or additional actions by management to mitigate our exposure to a particular risk. For these and other reasons, the actual results of changes in these prices or rates may differ materially from the following hypothetical results. Aircraft Fuel Price Risk Our results of operations may be significantly impacted by changes in the price of aircraft fuel. To manage this risk, we periodically enter into heating and crude oil derivative contracts to hedge a portion of our projected annual aircraft fuel requirements. Heating and crude oil prices have a highly correlated relationship to fuel prices, making these derivatives effective in offsetting changes in the cost of aircraft fuel. We do not enter into fuel hedge contracts for speculative purposes. At December 31, 2004, we had no hedges or contractual arrangements that would reduce our fuel costs below market prices. As discussed above in this Item 7, our aircraft fuel expense rose 51%, or $986 million, in 2004 compared to 2003, with approximately $820 million of the increase resulting from higher fuel prices. During 2004, aircraft fuel accounted for 16% of our total operating expenses. Our business plan assumes that in 2005 our aircraft fuel consumption will be approximately 2.7 billion gallons and that our average annual jet fuel price per gallon will be approximately $1.22. Based on these assumptions, a 10% rise in our assumed average annual jet fuel price would increase our aircraft fuel expense by approximately $325 million in 2005. For additional information regarding our aircraft fuel price risk management program, see Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to market risk due to changes in interest rates primarily relates to our long-term debt obligations. Market risk associated with our fixed-rate long-term debt is the potential change in fair value resulting from a change in interest rates. A 10% decrease in average annual interest rates would have increased the estimated 45 Table of Contents fair value of our long-term debt by $1.6 billion at December 31, 2004 and $682 million at December 31, 2003. A 10% increase in average annual interest rates would not have had a material impact on our interest expense in 2005. At December 31, 2004, we had no interest rate swaps or contractual arrangements that would reduce our interest expense. For additional information on our long-term debt agreements, see Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Glossary of Defined Terms ASM Available Seat Mile.
