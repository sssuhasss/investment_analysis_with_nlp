Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 6 Selected Financial Data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this 2011 Form 10-K. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause our actual results to differ materially from management expectations. Factors that could cause such differences include those set forth under Part I, Item 1 Business and Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors , as well as Forward-Looking Statements discussed earlier in this 2011 Form 10-K. Overview Executive Summary We are a leading provider of managed care services to government-sponsored health care programs, serving approximately 2.6 million members nationwide. We operate exclusively within the Medicaid and Medicare programs, serving the full spectrum of eligibility groups, with a focus on lower-income beneficiaries. Our primary mission is to help our government customers deliver cost-effective health care solutions, while improving health care quality and access for these programs. We are committed to operating our business in a manner that serves our key constituents members, providers, government clients, and associates while delivering competitive returns for our investors. Business Strategy Our strategic priorities for 2012 include improving health care quality and access for our members, ensuring a competitive cost position and delivering prudent and profitable growth. See Part I, Item 1 Business for a complete definition of our strategic priorities. Key Developments and Accomplishments Presented below are key developments and accomplishments relating to progress on our strategic business priorities that occurred during 2011 and impacted our financial condition and results of operations. Effective during the fourth quarter of 2011, we expanded into four new Florida counties and are currently providing Medicaid services to an additional 16,000 Medicaid members. As a result, we now serve 36 counties in the State of Florida and we are one of the largest Medicaid plans in that state. During the 2011 third quarter, the Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services awarded us a contract to serve Kentucky Medicaid program in seven of Kentucky eight regions. In November 2011, we initially began serving approximately 116,000 beneficiaries across these seven regions. Subsequently, during the remainder of 2011 and in early 2012, membership has increased to approximately 146,000 due to members opportunity to change plans. Our contract is for three years and may be extended for up to four one-year extension periods upon mutual agreement of the parties. Under this new program, we coordinate medical, behavioral and dental health care for eligible Kentucky Medicaid beneficiaries in the TANF, CHIP and ABD programs. We currently are projecting the program will generate between $575 million and $600 million in premium revenue in 2012. In 2011, o ur Florida, Georgia and Missouri health plans received accreditation from nationally-recognized, independent organizations that measure health plans commitment to high-quality care, effective management, and accountability. We remain dedicated to our long-term target of attaining accreditation for all of our health plans. 51 Table of Contents Another important aspect of our work on quality in 2011 was the finalization of our HEDIS measures for 2010, which showed broad-based improvement across our lines of business. During the 2011 third quarter, we successfully completed an upgrade of our core operating systems. This new technology will enable further progress in our work to improve service and productivity, and positions us to comply with future regulatory changes such as the implementation of ICD-10. The upgrade will also support our health care quality and access initiatives. In 2011, through continued organizational and process refinements, we achieved a 60 basis point reduction in our SG&A expense ratio, excluding investigation-related litigation and other costs (as defined in Results of Operations, Summary of Consolidated Financial Results, Selling general and administrative expense ) . Administrative and medical cost initiatives remain an important discipline for us in light of the fiscal challenges of our state and federal customers. For 2012, we are anticipating a reduction in this ratio in the range of approximately 50 to 70 basis points. Additionally, as part of our medical expense initiatives, we have implemented provider contracting case and disease management initiatives which have contributed meaningfully to year-over-year reduction in the Medicaid MBR and, in the case of MA, have moderated the year-over-year increase in MBR. In August 2011, we entered into a $300.0 million senior secured credit agreement (the Credit Agreement ) that can be used for general corporate purposes. The Credit Agreement provides for a $150.0 million term loan facility as well as a $150.0 million revolving credit facility. Both the term loan and revolving credit facility expire in August 2016. Upon closing, we borrowed $150.0 million pursuant to the term loan facility and $146.3 million remained outstanding at December 31, 2011. This new credit agreement replaces our previous $65.0 million credit agreement, which was never drawn upon. Our new credit agreement provides liquidity in support of the significant growth opportunities available to us. In particular, additions to statutory capital may be needed for new markets, such as the new Kentucky Medicaid program, or markets experiencing significant growth. For further information regarding the new credit agreement, refer to New Credit Agreement under Liquidity and Capital Resources and in Part IV, Item 15(c) Note 10 Debt. General Economic and Political Environment We expect the U.S. Congress to continue its close scrutiny of each component of the Medicare program (including Medicare Part D drug benefits) and possibly seek to limit the private insurers role. For example, the federal government may seek to negotiate drug prices for PDPs and MA-Prescription Drug Plans, a function currently performed by plan sponsors. We also expect state legislatures to continue to focus on the impact of health care reform and state budget deficits in 2012. Many states are proposing or implementing strategies that will significantly change their current Medicaid programs. These changes include moving programs such as ABD populations into managed care; expanding existing Medicaid programs to provide coverage to those who are currently uninsured; re-procurement of existing managed care programs and mandating minimum medical benefit ratios. We cannot predict the outcome of any Congressional oversight or any legislative activity, or predict what provisions legislation or regulation will contain in any state or what effect the legislation or regulation will have on our business operations or financial results, any of which could adversely affect us. See Part I, Item 1 Business for a discussion of the current and political environment that is affecting our business. Health Care Reform We believe that the 2010 Acts will bring about significant changes to the American health care system. For further discussion of health care reform and its potential impact on our business, see Part I, Item 1 Business Health Care Reform . In addition, refer to the risks and uncertainties related to health care reform as discussed in Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors Future changes in health care law present challenges for our business that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows . 52 Table of Contents Business and Financial Outlook Premium Rates and Payments The states in which we operate continue to experience fiscal challenges which have led to budget cuts and reductions in Medicaid premiums in certain states or rate increases that are below medical costs trends. In particular, we continue to experience pressure on rates in Florida and Georgia, two states from which we derive a substantial portion of our revenue. Our rates increased approximately 2.5% - 3.0% in Georgia effective July 1, 2011. In Florida, changes that were effective September 1, 2011 had essentially no net impact on our overall rate. The ultimate premium rate is based on program type, demographic mix and geographic location. Although premiums are generally contractually payable to us before or during the month in which we are obligated to provide services to our members, we have experienced delays in premium payments from certain states. In particular, the State of Georgia passed legislation in 2010 mandating that payment for Medicaid premiums in that state be made in the middle and at the end of the month in which services are provided. Previously, such payments were made at the beginning of each month. Additionally, the Georgia DCH has recently informed us that it is delaying the payment of certain premiums for as much as $300 million during the first quarter of 2012, and plans to restore these payments during the second quarter of 2012. Payments have already been delayed in January 2012 and February 2012 to date and if the delays continue through March 2012 as planned, our consolidated operating cash flow for the first quarter of 2012 will be materially impacted. However, at this time, the delays are considered to be a timing issue and we have adequate liquidity to manage the delays. We expect our programs in Georgia and elsewhere will continue to operate as they have historically. Given the budget shortfalls in many states with which we contract, additional payment delays may occur in the future. As part of the 2010 Acts, MA payment benchmarks for 2011 were frozen at 2010 levels. Separately, CMS implemented a reduction in Medicare Advantage reimbursements of 1.6% for 2011. Beginning in 2012, additional cuts to Medicare Advantage plans will take effect (with the quartile system) with changes being phased-in over two to six years, depending on the level of payment reduction in a county. These changes could result in reduced reimbursement or payment levels. This places increased importance on administrative cost improvements and effective medical expense initiatives. Market Developments Many states are proposing or implementing strategies that will significantly change their current Medicaid programs. These changes include moving programs into managed care; expanding existing programs to provide coverage to those who are currently uninsured; and reprocurement of existing managed care programs. State budget shortfalls in many states will be a significant consideration in any changes to existing Medicaid programs. In December 2011, the Georgia DCH amended its contracts for its Medicaid programs, to provide for two additional one year option terms, exercisable by Georgia DCH, which potentially extends the total contract term until June 30, 2014. Separately, Georgia DCH recently published a consultant report evaluating alternatives for its Medicaid program that includes a suggestion that the state should maintain the current program model, and also consider expanding it to include new populations, including the ABD population, that may number as many as 350,000 individuals. In January 2012, Hawaii Department of Human Services selected us to serve the state QUEST Medicaid program, which covers beneficiaries of Hawaii TANF and CHIP, as well as other eligible beneficiaries across Hawaii. This is an expansion of Hawaii Medicaid program into managed care, where we currently serve approximately 24,000 ABD beneficiaries. We are one of five health plans selected to serve approximately QUEST 230,000 beneficiaries across the state. Beneficiaries of the QUEST program include low-income individuals, families and children who are not aged, blind or disabled. Services are expected to begin on or about July 1, 2012, and we will coordinate medical, behavioral and pharmacy services with a focus on improving health care access and the quality of care. With this new award, we become Hawaii only health plan to provide QUEST, QUEST Expanded Access and Medicare Advantage services across all six islands. We are unable to estimate our expected additional membership at this time. Other states in which we have offered health plans for several years are expanding or reprocuring their Medicaid managed care programs, which may be very complementary to our existing operations and infrastructure, including Kansas, Missouri and Ohio. In addition, we anticipate the managed long-term care procurement by the Florida Medicaid program will occur in mid-2012. Effective October 1, 2011, New York and Ohio implemented changes to their administration of prescription drug coverage for their Medicaid managed care enrollees. Pharmacy benefits that had been previously administered by the states will now be offered through health plans. This change resulted in additional revenue of approximately $28 million in 2011 and is expected to result in approximately $110.0 million to $120.0 million in additional revenue on an annual basis. New York is also working toward the potential expansion of its managed long-term care program. We participate in this program today, which includes the opportunity to coordinate Medicare and Medicaid benefits for dual members. In addition, New York is evaluating a number of alternatives for strengthening quality and cost management for its Medicaid program. 53 Table of Contents Effective January 1, 2012, we have expanded the geographic footprint of our MA plans by 19 counties to a total of 138 counties. These expansions occurred within our existing states. MA membership as of January 1, 2012 was approximately 146,000, an increase from 135,000 as of December 31, 2011. In addition, we now offer special needs plans for dually-eligible beneficiaries in all of the markets we serve. This expansion is consistent with our focus on the lower-income demographic of the market and our ability over time to serve both the Medicaid and Medicare-related coverage of these members. Based on the outcome of our 2012 stand-alone PDP bids, our 2012 plans are below the benchmarks in five of the 34 CMS regions and within the de minimis range of the benchmark in 17 other CMS regions. Comparatively, in 2011, our plans were below the benchmarks in 20 regions and within the de minimis range in eight other regions. We have retained our auto-assigned members in those 17 regions in which we bid within the de minimis range ; however, we will not be auto-assigned new members in those regions during 2012. Consequently, membership has declined to approximately 900,000 as of January 1, 2012, a decrease from 976,000 as of December 31, 2011. The Company anticipates PDP segment membership will decrease slightly during the remainder of 2012 due to normal attrition being offset by fewer new members as we will be auto-assigned newly eligible members in 2012 in only the five regions where we are below the benchmark. We believe our plans are well positioned relative to member utilization patterns, cost-sharing, and a focus on generic medications. Consequently, we believe our PDPs remain attractive to choosers, who comprise more than fifty percent of our current membership. Our revenues and medical benefits expenses for fiscal years 2011 and 2010 were lower than in prior periods due to our exit on December 31, 2009 from our MA PFFS product and our exit from Medicaid programs in certain Florida counties during 2009. Premium revenue from our PFFS product represented approximately 41% of our MA reportable operating segment revenue and 17% of our consolidated premium revenue for the 2009 fiscal year. Regulation Provider reimbursement levels are subject to change by the states and CMS. In addition, some hospital contracts are directly tied to state Medicaid fee schedules, resulting in reimbursement levels that may be adjusted up or down, generally on a prospective basis, based on adjustments made by the state to the fee schedule. We have experienced, and may continue to experience, such adjustments. Unless such adjustments are mitigated by corresponding changes in premiums, our profitability will be negatively impacted. Financial Impact of Government Investigations and Litigation For a complete discussion of government investigations and litigation including the associated financial impact, please refer to our Selling, general and administrative expense discussion under Results of Operations below and Part IV, Item 15(a) Note 11 Commitments and Contingencies . Basis of Presentation Segments Reportable operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which discrete financial information is available and evaluated on a regular basis by the Company decision-makers to determine how resources should be allocated to an individual segment and to assess performance of those segments. Previously, we reported two operating segments, Medicaid and Medicare, which coincide with our two main business lines. During the first quarter of 2010, we reassessed our segment reporting practices and made revisions to reflect our current method of managing performance and determining resource allocation, which includes reviewing the results of our PDP operations separately from other Medicare products. Accordingly, we now have three reportable segments: Medicaid, MA and PDP. The PFFS product that we exited December 31, 2009 is reported within the MA segment. The prior periods have been revised to reflect this segment presentation. 54 Table of Contents Medicaid Medicaid was established to provide medical assistance to low-income and disabled persons. It is state operated and implemented, although it is funded and regulated by both the state and federal governments. Our Medicaid segment includes plans for beneficiaries of TANF, SSI, ABD and state-based programs that are not part of Medicaid programs, such as CHIP and FHP programs for qualifying families that are not eligible for Medicaid because they exceed the applicable income thresholds. TANF generally provides assistance to low-income families with children; ABD and SSI generally provide assistance to low-income aged, blind or disabled individuals. The Medicaid programs and services we offer to our members vary by state and county and are designed to serve our various constituencies effectively in the communities we serve. Although our Medicaid contracts determine to a large extent the type and scope of health care services that we arrange for our members, in certain markets we customize our benefits in ways that we believe make our products more attractive. Our Medicaid plans provide our members with access to a broad spectrum of medical benefits from many facets of primary care and preventive programs to full hospitalization and tertiary care. In general, members are required to use our network, except in cases of emergencies, transition of care or when network providers are unavailable to meet their medical needs, and generally must receive a referral from their PCP in order to receive health care from specialists, such as surgeons or neurologists. Members do not pay any premiums, deductibles or co-payments for most of our Medicaid plans. Medicare Advantage Medicare is a federal health insurance program that provides eligible persons age 65 and over, and some disabled persons, a variety of hospital, medical and prescription drug benefits. Our MA segment consists of MA plans which, following the exit of our PFFS product on December 31, 2009, is comprised of CCPs. MA is Medicare managed care alternative to original Medicare, which provides individuals standard Medicare benefits directly through CMS. CCPs are administered through HMOs and generally require members to seek health care services and select a PCP from a network of health care providers. In addition, we offer Medicare Part D coverage, which provides prescription drug benefits, as a component of our MA plans. We cover a wide spectrum of medical services through our MA plans including, in some cases, additional benefits not covered by original Medicare, such as vision, dental and hearing services. Through these enhanced benefits, the out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our members are reduced, which allows our members to better manage their health care costs. Most of our MA plans require members to pay a co-payment, which varies depending on the services and level of benefits provided. Typically, members of our MA CCPs are required to use our network of providers except in cases such as emergencies, transition of care or when specialty providers are unavailable to meet a member medical needs. MA CCP members may see out-of-network specialists if they receive referrals from their PCPs and may pay incremental cost-sharing. In most of our markets, we also offer special needs plans to individuals who are dually-eligible for Medicare and Medicaid. These plans, commonly called D-SNPs, are designed to provide specialized care and support for beneficiaries who are eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid. We believe that our D-SNPs are attractive to these beneficiaries due to the enhanced benefit offerings and clinical support programs. Prescription Drug Plans We offer stand-alone Medicare Part D coverage to Medicare-eligible beneficiaries through our PDP segment. The Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit is supported by risk sharing with the federal government through risk corridors designed to limit the losses and gains of the drug plans and by reinsurance for catastrophic drug costs. The government subsidy is based on the national weighted average monthly bid for this coverage, adjusted for risk-factor payments. Additional subsidies are provided for dually-eligible beneficiaries and specified low-income beneficiaries. The Medicare Part D program offers national in-network prescription drug coverage that is subject to limitations in certain circumstances. Depending on medical coverage type, a beneficiary has various options for accessing drug coverage. Beneficiaries enrolled in original Medicare can either join a stand-alone PDP or forego Part D drug coverage. Beneficiaries enrolled in MA CCPs can join a plan with Part D coverage, select a separate Part D plan, or forego Part D coverage. 55 Table of Contents Segment Financial Performance Measures We use three measures to assess the performance of our reportable operating segments: premium revenue, MBR and gross margin. Our MBR measures the ratio of our medical benefits expense to premiums earned, after excluding Medicaid premium taxes. Our gross margin is defined as our premium revenue less our medical benefits expense. Our profitability depends in large part on our ability to, among other things, effectively price our health and prescription drug plans; predict and effectively manage medical benefits expense relative to the primarily fixed premiums we receive, including reserve estimates and pharmacy costs; contract with health care providers; and attract and retain members. In addition, factors such as regulation, competition and general economic conditions affect our operations and profitability. The effect of escalating health care costs, as well as any changes in our ability to negotiate competitive rates with our providers may impose further risks to our profitability and may have a material impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Premium Revenue We receive premiums from state and federal agencies for the members that are assigned to, or have selected, us to provide health care services under Medicaid and Medicare. The primarily fixed premiums we receive for each member varies according to the specific government program. The premiums we receive under each of our government benefit plans are generally determined at the beginning of the contract period. These premiums are subject to adjustment throughout the term of the contract, although such adjustments are typically made at the commencement of each new contract period. For further information regarding premium revenues, please refer below to Premium Revenue Recognition under Critical Accounting Estimates . Medical Benefits Expense Our largest expense is the cost of medical benefits that we provide, which is based primarily on our arrangements with health care providers and utilization of health care services by our members. Our arrangements with providers primarily fall into two broad categories: capitation arrangements, pursuant to which we pay the capitated providers a fixed fee per member and fee-for-service as well as risk-sharing arrangements, pursuant to which the provider assumes a portion of the risk of the cost of the health care provided. Capitation payments represented 11.0%, 12.0% and 11.0% of our total medical benefits expense for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Other components of medical benefits expense are variable and require estimation and ongoing cost management. We use a variety of techniques to manage our medical benefits expense, including payment methods to providers, referral requirements, quality and disease management programs, reinsurance and member co-payments and premiums for some of our Medicare plans. National health care costs have been increasing at a higher rate than the general inflation rate; however, relatively small changes in our medical benefits expense relative to premiums that we receive can create significant changes in our financial results. Changes in health care laws, regulations and practices, levels of use of health care services, competitive pressures, hospital costs, major epidemics, terrorism or bio-terrorism, new medical technologies and other external factors could reduce our ability to manage our medical benefits expense effectively. Estimation of medical benefits payable and medical benefits expense is our most significant critical accounting estimate. For further information regarding medical benefits expense, please refer below to Estimating Medical Benefits Expense and Medical Benefits Payable under Critical Accounting Estimates . Gross Margin and Medical Benefits Ratio Our primary tools for measuring profitability are gross margin and MBR. Changes in gross margin and MBR from period to period result from, among other things, changes in Medicaid and Medicare funding, changes in the mix of Medicaid and Medicare membership, our ability to manage medical costs and changes in accounting estimates related to IBNR claims. We use gross margin and MBRs both to monitor our management of medical benefits and medical benefits expense and to make various business decisions, including what health care plans to offer, what geographic areas to enter or exit and which health care providers to select. Although gross margin and MBRs play an important role in our business strategy, we may be willing to enter new geographical markets and/or enter into provider arrangements that might produce a less favorable gross margin and MBR if those arrangements, such as capitation or risk sharing, would likely lower our exposure to variability in medical costs or for other reasons. 56 Table of Contents Results of Operations The following table sets forth data from our consolidated statements of operations, as well as other key data used in our results of operations discussion. The historical results are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any future period. Consolidated Statements of Operations Data: For the Years Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 Revenues: (In millions, except per share data) Premium $ 6,098.1 $ 5,430.2 $ 6,867.2 Investment and other income 8.7 10.0 10.9 Total revenues 6,106.8 5,440.2 6,878.1 Expenses: Medical benefits 4,872.1 4,536.6 5,862.5 Selling, general and administrative 718.0 895.9 805.2 Medicaid premium taxes 76.2 56.4 91.0 Depreciation and amortization 26.4 23.9 23.3 Interest 6.5 0.2 3.1 Total expenses 5,699.2 5,513.0 6,785.1 Income (loss) from operations 407.6 (72.8) 93.0 Gain on repurchase of subordinated notes 10.8 Income (loss) before income taxes 418.4 (72.8) 93.0 Income tax (benefit) expense 154.2 (19.4) 53.1 Net income (loss) $ 264.2 $ (53.4) $ 39.9 Net income (loss) per common share: Basic $ 6.17 $ (1.26) $ 0.95 Diluted $ 6.10 $ (1.26) $ 0.95 Consolidated MBR 80.9 % 84.4 % 86.5 % Summary of Consolidated Financial Results Membership For the Years Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 Segment Membership Percentage of Total Membership Percentage of Total Membership Percentage of Total Medicaid 1,451,000 56.6% 1,340,000 60.3% 1,349,000 58.1% MA 135,000 5.3% 116,000 5.2% 225,000 9.7% PDP 976,000 38.1% 768,000 34.5% 747,000 32.2% Total 2,562,000 100.0% 2,224,000 100.0% 2,321,000 100.0% 2011 vs. 2010: As of December 31, 2011, we served approximately 2,562,000 members; an increase of approximately 338,000 members from December 31, 2010. We experienced membership growth in all of our segments. Our Medicaid segment grew with the launch of the Kentucky Medicaid program on November 1, 2011. As of December 31, 2011, we served 129,000 Medicaid members in Kentucky. For our MA segment, we focused on our membership growth activities during the annual election period in the fourth quarter of 2010. Our products have benefit designs that are attractive to both current and prospective members. We invested in strengthening our sales processes and organization and ensuring an effective on-boarding experience for our new members. We added approximately 19,000 MA members from December 31, 2010. In our PDP segment, our plans were below the benchmark in 20 of the 34 CMS regions in 2011, an increase of one region from 2010. Additionally, we were within the de minimis range in eight additional regions. As a result, we added approximately 208,000 PDP members compared to December 31, 2010. 57 Table of Contents In 2012, we expect membership growth in our Medicaid and MA segments, offset in part by reduced PDP segment membership. The growth expectation in Medicaid is driven by membership increases in Kentucky subsequent to our initial launch, the contract award for Hawaii QUEST Medicaid program in January that is effective July 1, 2012, as well as membership growth opportunities existing in states in which we currently operate. The growth expectation in MA is based on results of the annual election period, which resulted in an increase of approximately 10,000 members effective January 1, 2012, as well as our continued focus on dually-eligible beneficiaries. However, as a result of our 2012 PDP bids, our PDP membership declined to approximately 900,000 as of January 1, 2012. We anticipate PDP segment membership will decrease slightly during the remainder of 2012 due to normal attrition being offset by fewer new members as we will be auto-assigned newly eligible members in fewer regions. 2010 vs. 2009: As of December 31, 2010, we served approximately 2,224,000 members; a decrease of 97,000 members from the 2,321,000 members we served as of December 31, 2009. As previously discussed, our MA segment includes results from the PFFS product that we exited on December 31, 2009. The overall membership decrease was due primarily to our December 31, 2009 exit from our PFFS product, which accounted for 95,000 MA members as of December 31, 2009 as well as a decline in MA CCP membership. The decrease in MA CCP resulted from the 2009 CMS Medicare marketing sanction, which was lifted in November 2009. However, we were not eligible to receive auto-assignments of low-income subsidy, dually-eligible beneficiaries into our PDP plans for January 2010 enrollment. We received auto assignments of PDP members in subsequent months, although such assignments were below the level we typically experience in the month of January. Net income (loss) 2011 vs. 2010: For the year ended December 31, 2011, our net income was $264.2 million compared to a net loss of $53.4 million for the same period in 2010. Excluding the impact of investigation-related settlements, litigation costs and gain on repurchase of subordinated notes, all of which amounted to a net expense of $27.2 million and $167.6 million, net of tax, for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, net income increased by $177.2 million, or 155%, in 2011 compared to 2010. The increase in 2011 resulted mainly from improved results in our Medicaid segment, largely driven by increased premium revenue and the impact of net favorable reserve development of prior period medical benefits payable, rate increases in certain markets, and to a lesser extent, improved results in our PDP segment, mainly driven by an increase in membership. Such increases were partially offset by an increase in SG&A expense and interest incurred on debt. 2010 vs. 2009: For the year ended December 31, 2010, the net loss was $53.4 million compared to $39.9 million of net income for the same period in 2009. Excluding investigation-related and litigation-resolution costs of $167.6 million and $86.7 million, net of tax, net income would have been $114.2 million and $126.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The decrease in net income, as adjusted, for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the same period in the prior year was mainly the result of the loss of gross margin from the withdrawal of our PFFS product and increases in Medicare-related marketing costs, partially offset by our overall MBR improvement and reductions in SG&A expenses. Premium revenue 2011 vs. 2010: Premium revenue for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased by approximately $667.9 million, or 12%, compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to membership growth during 2011 in our PDP and MA segments, rate increases in certain of our Medicaid markets, the launch of our Kentucky Medicaid program in November 2011 and additional premiums recognized in connection with retrospective maternity claims in Georgia. Premium revenue includes $76.2 million and $56.4 million of Medicaid premium taxes for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. 58 Table of Contents 2010 vs. 2009: Our MA segment includes results from the PFFS product that we exited on December 31, 2009. Our PFFS product contributed approximately $1,133.5 million of premium revenue for the year ended December 31, 2009. We recognized $3.5 million for retrospective risk-adjusted premium settlements related to our PFFS product for the year ended December 31, 2010. Excluding the impact of premium taxes as well as premium revenue from our PFFS product, premium revenue for the year ended December 31, 2010 decreased $272.4 million, or 4.8%, to $5,370.3 million from $5,642.7 million for the same period in the prior year. The decrease in premium revenue is primarily attributable to the decline in membership in our MA segment and lower membership in our PDP segment in the first half of 2010 resulting from our loss of membership due to the 2009 CMS marketing sanction and higher returned premium under the risk corridor provisions of our PDP product, partially offset by an increase in Medicaid segment premium revenue, due primarily to reductions by certain states that occurred earlier in the year and membership growth. Premium revenue includes $56.4 million and $91.0 million of Medicaid premium taxes for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Investment and other income 2011 vs. 2010: Investment and other income amounted to $8.7 million in 2011 compared to $10.0 million in 2010. The decrease was due to lower volumes of specialty prescription drugs sold to non-members, partially offset by an increase in investment income resulting from higher average investment balances. 2010 vs. 2009: For the year ended December 31, 2010, investment and other income decreased $0.9 million, or 8.3%, to $10.0 million from $10.9 million for the same period in the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to reduced market rates on lower average cash and investment balances, partially offset by the increase in other income attributed to shifting our investment portfolio during the third quarter of 2010 from tax-exempt to taxable investments, which typically generates a higher yield, and from other income derived primarily from co-payments collected on member prescriptions and sales of prescription drugs to non-members that can vary during any particular period. Medical benefits expense 2011 vs. 2010: Total medical benefits expense for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased $335.4 million, or 7%, compared to the same period in 2010. The increase in medical benefits expense is due mainly to the increase in PDP membership, the increase in MBR in the PDP segment that was consistent with our bids, and increased membership and higher MBR in the MA segment. The increases were partially offset by lower expense in the Medicaid segment resulting principally from the impact of net favorable prior period development in medical benefits payable and our medical expense initiatives. For the year ended December 31, 2011, medical benefits expense was impacted by approximately $191.2 million of net favorable development related to prior years. For the year ended December 31, 2010, medical benefits expense was impacted by approximately $56.2 million of net favorable reserve development related to prior years. The increased net favorable development of prior years medical benefits payable experienced in 2011 compared to 2010 was primarily related to unusually low utilization in our Medicaid segment in 2010 that became clearer over time as claim payments were processed and more complete claims information was obtained. Our consolidated MBR was 80.9% and 84.4% for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The lower MBR in 2011 was due mainly to the higher net favorable prior period reserve development in 2011, rate increases in certain of our Medicaid markets, additional premiums recognized in connection with retrospective maternity claims in Georgia and the impact of our medical cost initiatives, partially offset by the higher MBR in our PDP segment that was consistent with our bid results. We anticipate that the consolidated MBR, as well as the MBRs for all three of our segments, will increase in 2012 compared to 2011 as a result of the magnitude of net favorable development of medical benefits payable that occurred in 2011. 2010 vs. 2009: As previously discussed, our MA segment includes results from the PFFS product that we exited on December 31, 2009. Medical benefits expense for our PFFS product was $984.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The wind-down of PFFS lowered medical benefits expense by approximately $33.4 million in 2010 as a result of the favorable development of 2009 and prior years medical benefits payable. Excluding the medical benefits expense from our PFFS product, total medical benefits expense for the year ended December 31, 2010, decreased $308.4 million, or 6.3%, to $4,570.0 million from $4,878.4 million for the same period in the prior year. The decrease in medical benefits expense was primarily due to the decline in membership in our other products, as well as a decrease in MBR for Medicaid and PDP. The consolidated MBR, excluding the impact from our PFFS product, was 85.1% and 86.5% for the year ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Net favorable prior period reserve development, excluding PFFS, reduced MBR by 0.4% and 0.8% in 2010 and 2009, respectively. The decline in MBR is primarily due to improved performance of our MA and PDP segments. In 2010, we benefited from utilization that was below historical levels. 59 Table of Contents Selling, general and administrative expense SG&A expense includes aggregate costs related to the resolution of the previously disclosed governmental and Company investigations and litigation, such as settlement accruals and related fair value accretion, legal fees and other similar costs; net of $25.8 million and $6.4 million of directors and officers liability insurance recoveries during December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, related to the putative class action complaints. Please refer to Part I, Item 3 Legal Proceedings for a complete discussion of investigation-related litigation and other resolution costs. We believe it is appropriate to evaluate SG&A expense exclusive of these investigation-related litigation and other resolution costs because we do not consider them to be indicative of long-term business operations. A reconciliation of SG&A expense, including and excluding such costs, is presented below. For the Years Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 (In millions) SG&A expense $ 718.0 $ 895.9 $ 805.2 Adjustments: Investigation-related litigation and other resolution costs (7.7) (258.7) (60.7) Investigation-related administrative costs, net of D&O insurance policy recovery (39.3) (7.2) (44.3) Total investigation-related litigation and other resolution costs (47.0) (265.9) (105.0) SG&A expense, excluding investigation-related litigation and other resolution costs $ 671.0 $ 630.0 $ 700.2 SG&A ratio 11.9% 16.6% 11.9% SG&A ratio, excluding investigation-related litigation and other resolution costs 11.1% 11.7% 10.3% 2011 vs. 2010: Excluding investigation-related litigation and other resolution costs, our SG&A expense increased approximately $41.0 million, or 7%, in 2011 compared to the same period in 2010. Our SG&A expense as a percentage of total revenue, excluding premium taxes ( SG&A ratio ), was 11.9% in the 2011 period compared to 16.6% for the same period in the prior year. After excluding the investigation-related litigation and other resolution costs, our SG&A ratio for 2011 was 11.1% compared to 11.7% for the same period in 2010. The improvement in our SG&A ratio, excluding investigation-related litigation and other resolution costs, represents solid progress toward our long-term goal of an adjusted SG&A ratio in the low 10% range, based on our current business and geographic mix. Business simplification projects, process management in our shared services functions, and continued evaluation of our organizational design continued to drive improvement in our administrative cost structure, partially offset by spending related to the launch of our Kentucky Medicaid program, increased costs associated with our Medicare annual election period strong sales performance, and costs incurred for other growth, regulatory and quality initiatives. An additional factor impacting the comparability of the periods was the impact of relatively low equity-based compensation expense resulting from a larger impact from forfeiture activity in 2010 compared to 2011. 2010 vs. 2009: Excluding the investigation-related litigation and other resolution costs, our SG&A expense for the year ended December 31, 2010, decreased approximately $70.2 million, or 10.0% to $630.0 million from $700.2 million for the same period in the prior year. The reduction in SG&A expense was mainly due to the exit from our PFFS product and increased operating efficiencies, offset in part by increased costs for MA CCP marketing and infrastructure investments and severance costs associated with our organizational realignment implemented during 2010. The SG&A ratio was 16.6% for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to 11.9% for the same period in the prior year. After excluding the investigation-related litigation and other resolution costs, our SG&A ratio for the year ended December 31, 2010 was 11.7% compared to 10.3% for the same period in the prior year. The increase in 2010 SG&A ratio was mainly due to a lower revenue base in 2010 resulting from the exit from our PFFS product and lower MA CCP marketing costs in 2009 due to the CMS marketing sanction. 60 Table of Contents Medicaid premium taxes Medicaid premium taxes incurred in the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 amounted to $76.2 million and $56.4 million, respectively. The increase in Medicaid premium taxes in 2011 was mainly due to the reinstatement of premium taxes by Georgia in July 2010. In October 2009, Georgia stopped assessing taxes on Medicaid premiums remitted to us, which resulted in an equal reduction to premium revenues and Medicaid premium taxes. However, effective July 1, 2010, Georgia began assessing premium taxes again on Medicaid premiums. Therefore, during the first half of 2010, we were not assessed, nor did we remit, any taxes on premiums in Georgia. We were assessed and remitted taxes on premiums in Hawaii, Missouri, New York and Ohio for both the 2011 and 2010 periods. Interest expense Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2011 was $6.5 million compared to $0.2 million and $3.1 million for the same periods in 2010 and 2009. The increase in interest expense in 2011 is mainly driven by $6.1 million of interest related to the $112.5 million subordinated notes issued in September 2011, and to a lesser extent, interest on the $150.0 million term loan, which closed on August 1, 2011. We issued $112.5 million (aggregate par value) of tradable unsecured subordinated notes on September 30, 2011 in connection with the stipulation and settlement agreement, which was approved in May 2011 to resolve the putative class action complaints previously filed against us in 2007. The subordinated notes had a fixed coupon of 6% and interest was retroactive to May 2011. Gain on repurchase of subordinated notes On December 15, 2011, we repurchased at 90% of face value all of the $112.5 million of subordinated notes issued in September 2011. The notes had an original a maturity date of December 31, 2016. We recorded a gain on the repurchase of subordinated notes in the amount of $10.8 million. For further information regarding the subordinated notes, refer to Part IV, Item 15(c) Note 10 Debt . Income tax expense (benefit) 2011 vs. 2010: Income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2011 was $154.2 million compared to an income tax benefit of $19.4 million for the same period in 2010. Our effective income tax rate on pre-tax income was 36.9% for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to 26.7% on a pre-tax loss for the same period in 2010. The comparability of the effective tax rates between 2011 and 2010 was impacted by changes related to estimated non-deductible amounts associated with investigation resolution payments, the favorable resolution of prior years state tax matters in 2011 and the incurrence of a pre-tax loss in 2010. Additionally, the effective tax rate for the 2010 period was impacted by limitations on the deductibility of certain administrative expenses associated with the resolution of investigation-related matters. 2010 vs. 2009: Income tax benefit on pre-tax loss for the year ended December 31, 2010 was $19.4 million compared to income tax expense of $53.1 million on pre-tax income for the same period in the prior year, with an effective tax rate of 26.7% and 57.1% for the year ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Our effective income tax rate in both years differed from the statutory tax rate primarily due to limitations on the deductibility of certain administrative expenses associated with the resolution of investigation-related matters as well as certain executive compensation costs. 61 Table of Contents Reconciling Segment Results The following table reconciles our reportable segment results with our income (loss) before income taxes, as reported under GAAP. Reconciling Segment Results Data: For the Years Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 Gross Margin: (In millions) Medicaid $ 744.0 $ 461.5 $ 446.1 MA 299.2 282.0 476.1 PDP 182.8 150.1 82.6 Total gross margin 1,226.0 893.6 1,004.8 Investment and other income 8.7 10.0 10.9 Other expenses (827.1) (976.4) (922.7) Income (loss) from operations $ 407.6 $ (72.8) $ 93.0 Medicaid Segment Results Medicaid Segment Results Data: For the Years Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 (In millions) Premium revenue $ 3,505.4 $ 3,252.4 $ 3,165.7 Medicaid premium taxes 76.2 56.4 91.0 Total premiums 3,581.6 3,308.8 3,256.7 Medical benefits expense 2,837.6 2,847.3 2,810.6 Gross margin $ 744.0 $ 461.5 $ 446.1 Medicaid Membership: Georgia 562,000 566,000 546,000 Florida 404,000 415,000 425,000 Other states 485,000 359,000 378,000 1,451,000 1,340,000 1,349,000 Medicaid MBR (excluding premium taxes) (1) 80.9% 87.5% 88.8% ____________ (1) MBR measures the ratio of our medical benefits expense to premiums earned, after excluding Medicaid premium taxes. Because Medicaid premium taxes are included in the premium rates established in certain of our Medicaid contracts and also recognized separately as a component of expense, we exclude these taxes from premium revenue when calculating key ratios as we believe that their impact is not indicative of operating performance. For GAAP reporting purposes, Medicaid premium taxes are included in premium revenue. 2011 vs. 2010: Excluding Medicaid premium taxes, Medicaid premium revenue for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased 8% when compared to the same period in 2010. The increase in premium revenue was mainly due to rate increases in certain markets, the launch of the Kentucky Medicaid program on November 1, 2011 and additional premiums related to certain retrospective maternity claims that were impacted by a change that the DCH made to its methodology for determining and accepting qualifying maternity claims. Medicaid medical benefits expense for the year ended December 31, 2011 decreased slightly when compared to the same period in 2010 due mainly to the impact of net favorable reserve development of prior period medical benefits payable and the impact of medical cost initiatives that we have implemented, partially offset by a change in member mix and the launch of the Kentucky Medicaid program in November 2011. The net favorable reserve development resulted primarily from unusually low utilization in 2010. Our Medicaid MBR improved by approximately 660 basis points in 2011 compared to 2010, and the decrease was also driven by the net favorable reserve development of prior period medical benefits payable, the impact of medical cost initiatives, rate increases in certain of our Medicaid markets and additional premiums recognized in connection with retrospective maternity claims in Georgia. 62 Table of Contents 2010 vs. 2009: Excluding Medicaid premium taxes, Medicaid premium revenue for the year ended December 31, 2010 increased $86.7 million to $3,252.4 million from $3,165.7 million for the same period in the prior year. The increase in premium revenue was mainly due to rate increases implemented in most markets during the year and membership growth in Georgia, partially offset by the overall decrease in membership, primarily in Florida. Membership decreased overall by approximately 9,000 members to 1,340,000 as of December 31, 2010, from 1,349,000 as of December 31, 2009. Medicaid medical benefits expense for the year ended December 31, 2010 increased $36.7 million to $2,847.3 million from $2,810.6 million from the same period in the prior year due mainly to the impact of prior period favorable reserve development experienced in 2009, increase in membership and a change in the demographic mix of our members. The decrease in Medicaid MBR for the year ended December 31, 2010 is mainly from premium increases during 2010 and the impact of medical cost initiatives that we have implemented, partially offset by the impact of the net favorable prior year reserve development recognized in 2009 that exceeds the impact of the net favorable prior year reserve development recognized in 2010. Outlook: For the Kentucky Medicaid program, membership for February 2012 is estimated to be 146,000, an increase from 116,000 as of the program launch on November 1, 2011, due to members opportunity to change plans. Based on the increase in estimated membership as well as changes in membership demographics, we currently anticipate that annual premium revenue from the Kentucky program in 2012 will be approximately $575 million to $600 million. Additionally, we were recently awarded a contract for Hawaii QUEST Medicaid program to serve TANF and CHIP members with an approximate effective date of July 1, 2012. We were one of five plans selected to serve approximately 230,000 beneficiaries across the state; however, we are unable to estimate our additional membership at this time. Medicare Advantage Segment Results MA Segment Results Data: For the Years Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 (In millions) Premium revenue $ 1,479.7 $ 1,336.1 $ 2,775.5 Medical benefits expense 1,180.5 1,054.1 2,299.4 Gross margin $ 299.2 $ 282.0 $ 476.1 MA Membership 135,000 116,000 225,000 MA MBR 79.8% 78.9% 82.8% 2011 vs. 2010: MA premium revenue for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased 11% when compared to the same period in 2010 mainly from an increase in membership. Membership increased by approximately 19,000 members between December 31, 2010 and 2011. The increase in MA premium revenue and membership was attributable to our product design, strengthening of our sales processes and heightened focus on membership growth activities during the annual election periods in 2010 and 2011. MA medical expense increased by 12% in 2011, due to the increase in membership, as well as an increase in the segment MBR. MA segment MBR increased by approximately 90 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the same period in 2010, primarily due to the favorable reserve development we experienced in 2010 from the wind-down of our PFFS plans. As a result, the segment gross margin increase in 2011 amounted to 6%. 63 Table of Contents 2010 vs. 2009: As previously discussed, our MA segment includes results from the PFFS product that we exited on December 31, 2009. Our PFFS product contributed revenues of approximately $1,133.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 and medical benefits expense for our PFFS product was $984.1 million for the same period. During 2010 we continue to administer the PFFS program, which included processing claims payments as well as providing member and provider services related to health care services provided prior to our exit on December 31, 2009. As a result, we recognized $3.5 million for retrospective risk-adjusted premium settlements related to our PFFS product for the year ended December 31, 2010. The wind-down of PFFS also lowered medical benefits expense by approximately $33.4 million as a result of the favorable development of 2009 and prior years medical benefits payable. Membership decreased by approximately 109,000 members to 116,000 as of December 31, 2010, from 225,000 as of December 31, 2009 primarily due to our exit from the PFFS plans in December 2009. Excluding premium revenue from our PFFS product, MA premium revenue for the year ended December 31, 2010 decreased $309.3 million to $1,332.6 million from $1,641.9 million for the same period in the prior year. The decrease in MA premium revenue and membership was primarily attributable due to our inability to enroll new MA CCP members during the 2009 CMS marketing sanction period. Correspondingly, MA gross margin, excluding the impact from our PFFS product in 2009, decreased by $81.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, to $245.1 million from $326.6 million compared to the same period in the prior year due to the decrease in premiums, partially offset by $33.1 million of prior period favorable reserve development in 2010 related to the PFFS product. The decrease in the 2010 MA MBR was primarily related to the withdrawal of PFFS plans, which operated at an MBR above the segment average, and the prior period favorable reserve development related to the PFFS product. Excluding the impact from our PFFS product in 2009, the MA segment MBR increased from 80.1% for the year ended December 31, 2009 to 81.6% for the year ended December 31, 2010. The overall increase in MBR was attributed to a change in the demographic mix of our members and increased utilization patterns. Outlook: For the MA segment, membership for January 2012 is estimated to be 145,000, an increase from 135,000 as of December 31, 2011. Currently, we expect MA segment membership to continue to grow during the remaining months of 2012, as we leverage our success in serving dually-eligible beneficiaries as well as the broader growth in the Medicare population. Prescription Drug Plans Segment Results For the Years Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 PDP Segment Results Data: (In millions) Premium revenue $ 1,036.8 $ 785.4 $ 835.1 Medical benefits expense 854.0 635.3 752.5 Gross margin $ 182.8 $ 150.1 $ 82.6 PDP Membership 976,000 768,000 747,000 PDP MBR 82.4% 80.9% 90.1% 2011 vs. 2010: PDP premium revenue increased 32% for the year ended December 31, 2011 when compared to the same period in 2010, resulting primarily from increased membership, partially offset by the impact of lower pricing consistent with our bid results. Membership increased by 27% in 2011, largely due to an increase in auto-assigned members resulting from our 2011 bids and the addition of one CMS region. The PDP MBR increased by 150 basis points in 2011 compared to 2010 due to our bid results, member mix and higher utilization. The segment gross margin increased by approximately 22%. 2010 vs. 2009: PDP premium revenue for the year ended December 31, 2010 decreased $49.7 million to $785.4 million from $835.1 million for the same period in the prior year. The lower premium revenue in 2010 is the result of lower membership in the first half of the year and a higher returned premium under the risk corridor provisions of the PDP product. The higher risk corridor returned premium is due to the lower claim expense in 2010. Membership increased by approximately 21,000 members to 768,000 as of December 31, 2010 from 747,000 as of December 31, 2009, despite lower membership throughout the first half of the year. PDP membership at the beginning of 2010 was lower than the end of 2009 as we were unable to receive auto-assigned membership in January 2010 following the release of the 2009 CMS marketing sanction. Membership gradually increased throughout the year as we became eligible to receive auto assignments and engage in additional marketing activities. 64 Table of Contents PDP MBR improved for the year ended December 31, 2010 due to improved performance of the product as a result of our revised product benefit design and increased generic drug dispensing through the bid process. PDP gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2010 increased $67.5 million to $150.1 million from $82.6 million for the same period in the prior year. The improvement in gross margin was due mainly to better overall performance of the Part D product and improved MBR despite the decrease in premiums. Outlook: Given our 2012 bid results discussed in Business and Financial Outlook Market Developments , PDP segment membership for January 2012 is approximately 900,000. The decrease from 976,000 as of December 31, 2011 is from the reassignment to other plans of members who were auto-assigned to us in 2011 or prior years. Currently, we anticipate PDP segment membership will decrease slightly during the remainder of 2012 due to normal attrition being offset by fewer new members as we will be auto-assigned newly eligible members in only the five regions where we are below the benchmark. Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview Each of our existing and anticipated sources of cash is impacted by operational and financial risks that influence the overall amount of cash generated and the capital available to us. For a further discussion of risks that can affect our liquidity, see Part 1, Item 1A Risk Factors . Cash Generating Activities Our business consists of operations conducted by our regulated subsidiaries, including HMOs and insurance subsidiaries, and our non-regulated subsidiaries. The primary sources of cash for our regulated subsidiaries include premium revenue, investment income and capital contributions made by us to our regulated subsidiaries. Our regulated subsidiaries are each subject to applicable state regulations that, among other things, require the maintenance of minimum levels of capital and surplus. Our regulated subsidiaries primary uses of cash include payment of medical expenses, management fees to our non-regulated third-party administrator subsidiary (the TPA ) and direct administrative costs, which are not covered by the agreement with the TPA, such as selling expenses and legal costs. We refer collectively to the cash and investment balances maintained by our regulated subsidiaries as regulated cash and regulated investments, respectively. The primary sources of cash for our non-regulated subsidiaries are management fees and dividends received from our regulated subsidiaries and investment income. Our non-regulated subsidiaries primary uses of cash include payment of administrative costs not charged to our regulated subsidiaries for corporate functions, including administrative services related to claims payment, member and provider services, information technology and debt service. Other primary uses include capital contributions made by our non-regulated subsidiaries to our regulated subsidiaries. We refer collectively to the cash and investment balances available in our non-regulated subsidiaries as unregulated cash and unregulated investments, respectively. 65 Table of Contents Cash and Investment Positions The table below presents our cash and investment positions, excluding restricted investments. As of December 31, 2011 2010 Cash and cash equivalents: (In millions) Regulated $ 1,018.9 $ 1,168.9 Unregulated 306.2 190.6 $ 1,325.1 $ 1,359.5 Investments: Regulated Auction rate securities $ 30.1 $ 40.2 Other 249.2 129.1 $ 279.3 $ 169.3 Unregulated Auction rate securities $ 2.3 $ 2.3 Other 0.1 2.3 2.4 $ 281.6 $ 171.7 Metrics: Percentage of short term investments in certificates of deposit 6.2% 44.4% Weighted-average maturity of certificates of deposit 118 Days 68 Days Annual tax equivalent portfolio yield 0.4% 0.5% Regulated cash and cash equivalents can fluctuate significantly in a particular period depending on the timing of receipts for premiums from our government partners. Our unregulated cash and cash equivalents increased by $115.6 million in 2011 primarily as a result of $147.4 million of net term loan proceeds and $92 million in dividends received from certain of our regulated subsidiaries, offset in part by $87.5 million of payments in connection with the resolution of government investigations and related litigation and the net cash impact of the repurchase of the subordinated notes and associated reduction in our fourth quarter estimated tax payment. Initiatives to Increase Our Unregulated Cash We are pursuing alternatives to raise additional unregulated cash. Some of these initiatives include, but are not limited to, consideration of obtaining dividends from certain of our regulated subsidiaries to the extent that we are able to access any available excess capital and/or accessing the debt and equity capital markets. However, we cannot provide any assurances that we will obtain applicable state regulatory approvals for additional dividends to our non-regulated subsidiaries by our regulated subsidiaries or be successful in accessing the capital markets if we determine to do so. Credit Facility In August 2011, we entered into a $300.0 million senior secured credit agreement (the Credit Agreement ) that can be used for general corporate purposes. The Credit Agreement provides for a $150.0 million term loan facility as well as a $150.0 million revolving credit facility. Upon closing, we borrowed $150.0 million pursuant to the term loan facility and incurred approximately $2.5 million of debt issuance costs that have been deferred and will be amortized over the life of the agreement. The Credit Agreement replaces the previous credit facility, which had never been drawn upon and which has now been terminated. We had at all times remained in compliance with all covenants associated with the former agreement. Both the term loan and revolving credit facility are set to expire in August 2016. Subject to adjustment for prepayments, the term loan will amortize in quarterly installments of $1,875 for the first four quarters, $3,750 for the next eight quarters, $5,625 for the next four quarters and $7,500 for the next three quarters, with the remaining balance due upon maturity. As of December 31, 2011, our remaining term loan balance was $146.3 million, which is included in the current portion of long-term debt and long-term debt line items in our consolidated balance sheet. 66 Table of Contents Table of Contents Our term loan as of December 31, 2011 bears interest at 2.56%. Loans designated by us at the time of borrowing as Alternate Base Rate ( ABR ) Loans that are outstanding under the credit facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to (i) the greatest of (a) the prime rate in effect on such day; (b) the federal funds effective rate in effect on such day plus 1/2 of 1%; and (c) the adjusted London Inter-Bank Offered Rate ( Adjusted LIBOR ) for a one-month interest period on such day plus 1% plus (ii) the applicable margin . Loans designated by us at the time of borrowing as Eurodollar Loans that are outstanding under the credit agreement bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Adjusted LIBOR for the interest period in effect for such borrowing plus the applicable margin. The applicable margin means a percentage ranging from 0.50% to 2.00% per annum for ABR Loans and a percentage ranging from 1.50% to 3.00% per annum for Eurodollar Loans, depending upon our ratio of total debt to consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ( EBITDA ). Unutilized commitments under the Credit Agreement are subject to a fee of 0.25% to 0.45% depending upon the Company ratio of total debt to consolidated EBITDA. Interest on the term loan is payable based on the LIBOR election period, which ranges from one to six months based upon our election, with interest on the unutilized commitment payable quarterly. Interest on the unutilized revolving credit facility and borrowings under the term loan were $0.3 million and $1.5 million, respectively, for a total interest expense amount of $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. As of December 31, 2011 interest payable for the term loan was $0.3 million. The Credit Agreement is subject to customary covenants and restrictions which, among other things, limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness. In addition, the Credit Agreement also includes certain financial covenants that require (a) a minimum ratio of total debt to consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreement); (b) a minimum interest expense and principal repayment coverage ratio; (c) a minimum level of statutory net worth for our HMO and insurance subsidiaries; and (d) a requirement to maintain cash in an amount equal to one year of payment obligations due and payable to the Department of Justice during the next twelve consecutive months, so long as such obligations remain outstanding. The Credit Agreement also contains customary representations and warranties and events of default. The payment of outstanding principal under the Credit Agreement and accrued interest thereon may be accelerated and become immediately due and payable upon our default of payment or other performance obligations or our failure to comply with financial or other covenants in the Credit Agreement, subject to applicable notice requirements and cure periods as provided in the Credit Agreement. As of the date of this filing, the revolving credit facility has not been drawn upon and we remain in compliance with all covenants. Issuance and Repurchase of Subordinated Notes On September 30, 2011, we issued tradable unsecured subordinated notes having an aggregate par value of $112.5 million, with a fixed coupon of 6% and a maturity date of December 31, 2016. These notes were issued in connection with the stipulation and settlement agreement, which was approved in May 2011, to resolve the putative class action complaints previously filed against us in 2007. On December 15, 2011 we repurchased all of the $112.5 million subordinated notes at 90% of face value. We recorded a gain on the repurchase of subordinated notes in the amount of $10.8 million. Interest of approximately $4.1 million was incurred on these notes in 2011, including amounts retroactive to May 2011, and was paid at the time of repurchase. For further information regarding the subordinated notes, refer to Note 10 Debt . Auction Rate Securities As of December 31, 2011, we held municipal note investments with an auction reset feature ( auction rate securities ). These notes are issued by various state and local municipal entities for the purpose of financing student loans, public projects and other activities, which carry investment grade credit ratings. Liquidity for these auction rate securities is typically provided by an auction process which allows holders to sell their notes and resets the applicable interest rate at pre-determined intervals, usually every seven or 35 days. As of the date of this Form 10-K, auctions have failed for our auction rate securities and there is no assurance that auctions will succeed in the future. An auction failure means that the parties wishing to sell their securities could not be matched with an adequate volume of buyers. In the event that there is a failed auction the indenture governing the security requires the issuer to pay interest at a contractually defined rate that is generally above market rates for other types of similar instruments. The securities for which auctions have failed will continue to accrue interest at the contractual rate and be auctioned every seven or 35 days until the auction succeeds, the issuer calls the securities, or they mature. As a result, our ability to liquidate and fully recover the carrying value of our remaining auction rate securities in the near term may be limited or non-existent. In addition, while all of our auction rate securities currently carry investment grade ratings, if the issuers are unable to successfully close future auctions and their credit ratings deteriorate, we may in the future be required to record an impairment charge on these investments. 67 Table of Contents Although auctions continue to fail, we believe we will be able to liquidate these securities without significant loss. There are government guarantees or municipal bond insurance in place and we have the ability and the present intent to hold these securities until maturity or market stability is restored. Accordingly, we do not believe our auction rate securities are impaired and as a result, we have not recorded any impairment losses for our auction rate securities. However, it could take until the final maturity of the underlying securities to realize our investments recorded value. The final maturity of the underlying securities could be as long as 28 years. The weighted-average life of the underlying securities for our auction rate securities portfolio is 23 years. During 2011, auction rate securities of $11.2 million, in the aggregate, were called at par, at the option of the issuer. Financial Impact of Government Investigation and Litigation We have expended significant financial resources in connection with the investigations and related litigation. Since the inception of these investigations through December 31, 2011, we have incurred a total of approximately $241.4 million for administrative expenses associated with, or consequential to, these governmental and Company investigations specifically for legal fees, accounting fees, consulting fees, employee recruitment and retention costs and other similar expenses, prior to any insurance recoveries. In connection with the settlement agreement that we reached with the lead plaintiffs to resolve certain putative class action complaints, which was approved by the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida in May 2011, we delivered to the escrow agent on behalf of the class, a $35.0 million non-negotiable, non-interest bearing, promissory note that was due and payable in full on July 31, 2011. This liability was previously accrued as part of amounts accrued related to the investigation resolution and this amount was paid in full on July 28, 2011. In March 2011, we paid $52.5 million and in September 2011, we issued $112.5 million of tradable unsecured subordinated notes in connection with the resolution of these class action complaints. Subsequently, in December 2011, we repurchased the subordinated notes as discussed in Issuance and Repurchase of Subordinated Notes above. In August 2010, we entered into an agreement and release with the carriers of our D&O liability insurance relating to coverage we sought for claims relating to the previously disclosed government investigations and related litigation. We agreed to accept immediate payment of $32.5 million, including $6.7 million received by us in prior years, in satisfaction of the $45.0 million face amount of the relevant D&O insurance policies and the carriers agreed to waive any rights they may have to challenge our coverage under the policies. The agreement and release did not include a $10.0 million face amount policy we maintain for non-indemnifiable securities claims by directors and officers during the same time period and such policy is not affected by the agreement and release. Accordingly, we recorded the $25.8 million of insurance proceeds as a reduction to SG&A expenses at the time the agreement was executed in 2010. No additional recoveries with respect to such matters are expected under our insurance policies and all expenses incurred by us in the future for these matters will not be further reimbursed by our insurance policies. We currently maintain directors and officers liability insurance in the amount of $125.0 million for other matters not addressed above. Regulatory Capital and Dividend Restrictions Our operations are conducted primarily through HMO and insurance subsidiaries. These subsidiaries are licensed by the insurance department in the state in which they operate, except our New York HMO subsidiary, which is licensed as a Prepaid Health Services Plan by the New York State Department of Health, and are subject to the rules, regulation and oversight of the applicable state agencies in the areas of licensing and solvency. State insurance laws and regulations prescribe accounting practices for determining statutory net income and capital and surplus. Each of our regulated subsidiaries is required to report regularly on its operational and financial performance to the appropriate regulatory agency in the state in which it is licensed. These reports describe each of our regulated subsidiaries capital structure, ownership, financial condition, certain intercompany transactions and business operations. From time to time, any of our regulated subsidiaries may be selected to undergo periodic audits, examinations or reviews by the applicable state agency of our operational and financial assertions. Each of our regulated subsidiaries generally must obtain approval from, or provide notice to, the state in which it is domiciled before entering into certain transactions such as declaring dividends in excess of certain thresholds, entering into other arrangements with related parties, and acquisitions or similar transactions involving an HMO or insurance company, or any change in control. For purposes of these laws, in general, control commonly is presumed to exist when a person, group of persons or entity, directly or indirectly, owns, controls or holds the power to vote 10% or more of the voting securities of another entity. Each of our HMO and insurance subsidiaries must maintain a minimum amount of statutory capital determined by statute or regulation. The minimum statutory capital requirements differ by state and are generally based on a percentage of annualized premium revenue, a percentage of annualized health care costs, a percentage of certain liabilities, a statutory minimum RBC requirement or other financial ratios. The RBC requirements are based on guidelines established by the NAIC, and have been adopted by most states. As of December 31, 2011, our HMO operations in Connecticut, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana, Missouri, New Jersey, Ohio and Texas as well as three of our insurance company subsidiaries were subject to RBC requirements. The RBC requirements may be modified as each state legislature deems appropriate for that state. The RBC formula, based on asset risk, underwriting risk, credit risk, business risk and other factors, generates the ACL, which represents the amount of capital required to support the regulated entity business. For states in which the RBC requirements have been adopted, the regulated entity typically must maintain a minimum of the greater of 200% of the required ACL or the minimum statutory net worth requirement calculated pursuant to pre-RBC guidelines. Our subsidiaries operating in Texas, Georgia and Ohio are required to maintain statutory capital at RBC levels equal to 225%, 250% and 300%, respectively, of the applicable ACL. Failure to maintain these requirements would trigger regulatory action by the state. At December 31, 2011, our HMO and insurance subsidiaries were in compliance with these minimum capital requirements. The combined statutory capital and surplus of our HMO and insurance subsidiaries was approximately $858.0 million and $695.0 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, compared to the required surplus of approximately $310.0 million and $300.0 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. 68 Table of Contents The statutory framework for our regulated subsidiaries minimum capital changes over time. For instance, RBC requirements may be adopted by more of the states in which we operate. These subsidiaries are also subject to their state regulators overall oversight powers. In addition, regulators could require our subsidiaries to maintain minimum levels of statutory net worth in excess of the amount required under the applicable state laws if the regulators determine that maintaining such additional statutory net worth is in the best interest of our members and other constituents. Moreover, if we expand our plan offerings in new states or pursue new business opportunities, we may be required to make additional statutory capital contributions. In addition to the foregoing requirements, our regulated subsidiaries are subject to restrictions on their ability to make dividend payments, loans and other transfers of cash. Dividend restrictions vary by state, but the maximum amount of dividends which can be paid without prior approval from the applicable state is subject to, among other things, restrictions relating to statutory capital, surplus and net income for the previous year. States may disapprove any dividend that, together with other dividends paid by a subsidiary in the prior twelve months, exceeds the regulatory maximum as computed for the subsidiary based on its statutory surplus and net income. Also, we may only invest in the types of investments allowed by the state in order to qualify as admitted assets and we are required by certain states to deposit or pledge assets that are considered as restricted assets. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, all of our restricted assets consisted of cash and cash equivalents, money market accounts, certificates of deposits, and U.S. government securities. Overview of Cash Flow Activities Our cash flows from operations are summarized as follows: For the Years Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 (In millions) Net cash provided by operations $ 162.0 $ 223.1 $ 57.9 Net cash (used in) provided by investing activities (111.6) (60.5) 63.6 Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities (84.9) 38.9 (145.4) Net cash provided by operations We generally receive premiums in advance of payments of claims for health care services; however, cash flows related to our operations can fluctuate significantly in a particular period depending on the timing of premiums receipts from our government partners or payments related to resolving government investigations and related litigation. The net cash inflow from operations for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 was primarily due to changes in the receivables and liabilities due to timing of cash receipts and payments. In 2011, we paid approximately $87.5 million in connection with resolving shareholder class action complaints. Cash flows in 2009 were negatively impacted by payments related to settlements reached with the USAO and SEC. Pursuant to the terms of the DPA, we paid the USAO a total of $44.8 million and paid the SEC $7.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2009. 69 Table of Contents As discussed in Business and Financial Outlook/ Premium Rates and Payments , the Georgia DCH has recently informed us that it is delaying the payment of certain premiums for as much as $300 million during the first quarter of 2012, and plans to restore these payments during the second quarter of 2012. Payments have already been delayed in January 2012 and February 2012 to date and if the delays continue through March 2012 as planned, our consolidated operating cash flow for the first quarter of 2012 will be materially impacted. However, at this time, the delays are considered to be a timing issue and we have adequate liquidity to manage the delays. We expect our programs in Georgia and elsewhere will continue to operate as they have historically. Net cash (used in) provided by investing activities In 2011, cash used in investing activities primarily reflects our investment of proceeds provided by our term loan into higher yielding investment alternatives, which had a net impact totaling approximately $108.7 million, and purchases of software and equipment totaling approximately $49.6 million, partially offset by $46.7 million of proceeds from the maturities of restricted investments net of purchases. In 2010, investing activities consisted primarily of net purchases of investments totaling approximately $56.0 million as well as $27.5 million of additions to property, equipment and capitalized software, partially offset by net proceeds from the maturity of restricted investments totaling approximately $23.0 million. In 2009, investing activities consisted primarily of net proceeds from the maturity of restricted investments totaling approximately $68.4 million and the net proceeds from the sale and maturities of investments totaling approximately $11.4 million, partially offset by increases in property, equipment and capitalized software totaling approximately $16.1 million. Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities Included in 2011 financing activities are the repurchase of the subordinated notes in full which approximated $101.7 million, as well as funds held for the benefit of members, which increased approximately $129.6 million in 2011. These funds represent certain subsidies funded by CMS in connection with the Medicare Part D program for which we assume no risk. This activity is partially offset with the $147.4 million of proceeds from the issuance of the term loan, net of issuance costs. In 2010, financing activities consisted primarily of funds held for the benefit of members, which increased approximately $44.7 million over 2009. In 2009, financing activities consisted primarily of the repayment in full of the outstanding amount of $152.8 million under the credit facility on its due date. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements At December 31, 2011, we did not have any off-balance sheet financing arrangements except for operating leases as described in the table below. Commitments and Contingencies The following table sets forth information regarding our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2011. Payments due to period Less Than 1 - 3 3 - 5 More than Total 1 Year Years Years 5 Years (In millions) Operating leases $ 62.1 $ 17.2 $ 27.3 $ 13.8 $ 3.8 Capital leases 5.5 2.3 3.0 0.2 Purchase obligations (1) 115.9 54.9 57.6 3.4 Unrecognized tax benefit 3.5 3.5 Amounts accrued related to investigation resolution (2) (3) 159.3 49.8 74.1 35.4 Long-term debt 146.3 11.3 33.8 101.2 Total $ 492.6 $ 139.0 $ 195.8 $ 154.0 $ 3.8 70 Table of Contents Table of Contents ____________ (1) Our purchase obligations include commitments under contracts for equipment leases, software maintenance and the purchase of pharmaceuticals from our pharmacy benefit manager. (2) Based on the terms of the Preliminary Settlement reached with the Civil Division in June 2010 to settle pending civil inquiries related to qui tam complaints filed by relators against us, which includes interest. The Preliminary Settlement is subject to completion and approval of an executed written settlement agreement and other government approvals, as discussed in Part I, Item 3 Legal Proceedings . (3) Amount includes a $10.5 million estimate related to the qui tam relators attorneys fees to be paid in addition to the Preliminary Settlement amount. We are not an obligor under or guarantor of any indebtedness of any other party; however, we may have to pay referral claims of health care providers under contract with us who are not able to pay costs of medical services provided by other providers. Critical Accounting Estimates In the ordinary course of business, we make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of our results of operations and financial condition in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ). We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions. We believe that the accounting estimates relating to premium revenue recognition, medical benefits expense and medical benefits payable, and goodwill and intangible assets are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management most difficult, subjective and complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Premium Revenue Recognition We receive premiums from state and federal agencies for the members that are assigned to, or have selected, us to provide health care services under Medicaid and Medicare contracts. The premiums we receive for each member vary according to the specific government program and are generally determined at the beginning of the contract period. These premiums are subject to adjustment throughout the term of the contract by CMS and the states throughout the term of the contracts, although such adjustments are typically made at the commencement of each new contract renewal period. We recognize premium revenues in the period in which we are obligated to provide services to our members. Premiums are billed monthly for coverage in the following month and we are paid generally in the month in which we provide services. Any amounts that have been earned and have not been received are recorded in our consolidated balance sheets as premium receivables. Any amounts received by us in advance of the period of service are recorded as a liability, unearned premiums, in our consolidated balance sheets and are not recognized as revenue until the respective services have been provided. On a monthly basis, we bill members for any premiums for which they are responsible according to their respective plan. We estimate, on an ongoing basis, the amount of member billings that may not be fully collectible based on historical trends. An allowance is established for the estimated amount that may not be collectible and a liability is established for premium expected to be returned. Historically, the allowance for member premiums receivable has not been significant relative to premium revenue. We record adjustments to revenues based on member retroactivity. These adjustments reflect changes in the number and eligibility status of enrollees subsequent to when revenue was billed. Premium payments that we receive are based upon eligibility lists produced by the government. We verify these lists to determine whether we have been paid for the correct premium category and program. From time to time, the states or CMS requires us to reimburse them for premiums that we received based on an eligibility list that a state, CMS or we later discover contains individuals who were not eligible for any government-sponsored program or belong to a plan other than ours. The verification and subsequent membership changes may result in additional amounts due to us or we may owe premiums back to the government. We estimate the amount of outstanding retroactivity adjustments each period and adjust premium revenue accordingly; if appropriate, the estimates of retroactivity adjustments are based on historical trends, premiums billed, the volume of member and contract renewal activity and other information. The amounts receivable or payable identified by us through reconciliation and verification of agency eligibility lists relate to current and prior periods. The amounts receivable from government agencies for reconciling items were $28.3 million and $0.3 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The amounts due to government agencies for reconciling items were $7.3 million and $63.3 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. These amounts are recorded net and are included in premium receivables in the consolidated balance sheets. 71 Table of Contents Medicaid Our Medicaid segment generates revenues primarily from premiums received from the states in which we operate health plans. We receive a fixed premium PMPM pursuant to our state contracts. Our Medicaid contracts with state governments are generally multi-year contracts subject to annual renewal provisions. Annual rate changes are recorded when they become effective. We generally receive premium payments during the month in which we provide services and recognize premium revenue during the period in which we are obligated to provide such services to our members. In some instances, our base premiums are subject to risk score adjustments based on the acuity of our membership relative to the entire state Medicaid membership. In Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, Missouri, New York and Ohio, we are eligible to receive supplemental payments for newborns and/or obstetric deliveries. Each state contract is specific as to what is required before payments are generated. Upon delivery of a newborn, each state is notified according to the contract. Revenue is recognized in the period that the delivery occurs and the related services are provided to our member. For the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, we recognized approximately $236 million and $220 million of such premium revenue, respectively. The revenue recognized during the year ending December 31, 2011 includes $4.5 million related to certain retrospective maternity claims from 2010, as a result of a change in the Georgia DCH methodology for accepting qualifying maternity claims made in 2011. Additionally, in some states, supplemental payments are received for certain services such as high cost drugs and early childhood prevention screenings. Revenues are recorded based on membership and eligibility data provided by the states, which may be adjusted by the states for any subsequent updates to this data. Historically, these eligibility adjustments have been immaterial in relation to total revenue recorded and are reflected in the period known. During the year ended December 31, 2011, Georgia DCH made retroactive premium adjustments for overpayments related to a reconciliation of duplicate member records and members belonging to a plan other than ours for periods dating back to the beginning of the program in 2006. In accordance with the policy stated above, we had previously identified and accrued an estimated liability for overpayments that we believed would be returned to Georgia DCH. In addition, Georgia DCH has notified us of expected retroactive premium adjustments for the understatement of historical capitation premium rates for the periods affected by duplicative enrollment. The net impact to premium revenue resulting from the adjustments was immaterial to our consolidated results of operations. Minimum Medical Expense Provisions Our Florida Medicaid and Healthy Kids contracts and Illinois Medicaid contract require us to expend a minimum percentage of premiums on eligible medical expense. To the extent that we expend less than the minimum percentage of the premiums on eligible medical expense, we are required to refund all or some portion of the difference between the minimum and our actual allowable medical expense. We estimate the amounts due to the states as a return of premium each period based on the terms of our contracts with the applicable state agency, and such amounts are included in our consolidated results of operations as adjustments to premium revenues. Our liability to states under their respective minimum medical expense provisions was $12.3 million as of December 31, 2011 and $10.7 million as of December 31, 2010. Medicare Advantage The amount of premiums we receive for each MA member is established by contract, although the rates vary according to a combination of factors, including upper payment limits established by CMS, the member geographic location, age, gender, medical history or condition, or the services rendered to the member. We also offer Part D coverage as a component of our MA plans. See Prescription Drug Plans (PDPs) below for a complete discussion of our revenue accounting policies associated with this benefit. MA premiums are due monthly and are recognized as revenue during the period in which we are obligated to provide services to members. Our MA contracts with CMS generally have terms of one year and expire at the end of each calendar year. Risk-Adjusted Premiums CMS employs a risk-adjustment model to determine the premium amount it pays for each MA member. This model apportions premiums paid to all MA plans according to the health status of each beneficiary enrolled. As a result, our CMS monthly premium payments per member may change materially, either favorably or unfavorably. The CMS risk-adjustment model pays more for MA members with predictably higher costs. Diagnosis data from inpatient and ambulatory treatment settings are used to calculate the risk-adjusted premiums we receive. We collect claims and encounter data and submit the necessary diagnosis data to CMS within prescribed deadlines. After reviewing the respective submissions, CMS establishes the monthly premium payments to plans based on normalized risk scores of each member from the prior year, generally at the beginning of the calendar year. Annually, CMS provides the updated risk scores to the plans and revises premium rates prospectively, beginning with the July remittance for current plan year members. CMS will also calculate the retroactive adjustments to premium related to the revised risk scores for the current year for current plan year members and for the prior year for prior plan year members. We reassess our estimates of the Initial CMS Settlement and the Final CMS Settlement each reporting period and any resulting adjustments are made to premium revenue. 72 Table of Contents We develop our estimates for MA risk-adjusted premiums utilizing historical experience and predictive models as sufficient member risk score data becomes available over the course of each CMS plan year. Our models are populated with available risk score data on our MA members. Risk premium adjustments are based on member risk score data from the previous year. Risk score data for members who entered our plans during the current plan year, however, is not available for use in our models; therefore, we make assumptions regarding the risk scores of this subset of our member population. All such estimated amounts are periodically updated as additional diagnosis code information is reported to CMS and adjusted to actual amounts when the ultimate adjustment settlements are either received from CMS or we receive notification from CMS of such settlement amounts. The data provided to CMS to determine the risk score is subject to audit by CMS even after the annual settlements occur. These audits may result in the refund of premiums to CMS previously received by us. While our experience to date has not resulted in a material refund, this refund could be significant in the future, which would reduce our premium revenue in the year that CMS determines repayment is required. CMS has performed and continues to perform RADV audits of selected MA plans to validate the provider coding practices under the risk adjustment model used to calculate the premium paid for each MA member. Our Florida MA plan was selected by CMS for audit for the 2007 contract year and we anticipate that CMS will conduct additional audits of other plans and contract years on an ongoing basis. The CMS audit process selects a sample of 201 enrollees for medical record review from each contract selected. We have responded to CMS audit requests by retrieving and submitting all available medical records and provider attestations to substantiate CMS-sampled diagnosis codes. CMS will use this documentation to calculate a payment error rate for our Florida MA plan 2007 premiums. CMS has not indicated a schedule for processing or otherwise responding to our submissions. CMS has indicated that payment adjustments resulting from its RADV audits will not be limited to risk scores for the specific beneficiaries for which errors are found, but will be extrapolated to the relevant plan population. In December 2010, CMS issued a draft audit sampling and payment error calculation methodology that it proposes to use in conducting these audits. CMS invited public comment on the proposed audit methodology and announced in February 2011 that it will revise its proposed approach based on the comments received. CMS has not given a specific timetable for issuing a final version of the audit sampling and payment error calculation methodology. Given that the RADV audit methodology is new and is subject to modification, there is substantial uncertainty as to how it will be applied to MA organizations like our Florida MA plan. At this time, we do not know whether CMS will require retroactive or subsequent payment adjustments to be made using an audit methodology that may not compare the coding of our providers to the coding of Original Medicare and other MA plan providers, or whether any of our other plans will be randomly selected or targeted for a similar audit by CMS . We are also unable to determine whether any conclusions that CMS may make, based on the audit of our plan and others, will cause us to change our revenue estimation process. Because of this lack of clarity from CMS, we are unable to estimate with any reasonable confidence a coding or payment error rate or predict the impact of extrapolating an applicable error rate to our Florida MA plan 2007 premiums. However, it is likely that a payment adjustment will occur as a result of these audits, and that any such adjustment could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows, possibly in 2012 and beyond. Prescription Drug Plans (PDPs) Prescription drug benefits under Part D are provided on both a stand-alone basis and also in connection with our MA plans. Annually, we provide written bids to CMS for our PDPs, which reflect the estimated costs of providing prescription drug benefits over the plan year. Substantially all of the premium for this insurance is paid by the federal government, and the balance is due from the enrolled beneficiaries. The recognition of the premium and subsidy components under Part D is described below: Member Premium We receive a monthly premium from members based on the plan year bid we submitted to CMS. The member premium, which is fixed for the entire plan year, is recognized over the contract period and reported as premium revenue. We establish a reserve for member premium that is past due that reflects our estimate of the collectability of the member premium. CMS Direct Premium Subsidy We receive a monthly premium from CMS based on the plan year bid we submitted to CMS. The monthly payment is a risk-adjusted amount per member and is based upon the member health status, as determined by CMS. The CMS premium is recognized over the contract period and reported as premium revenue. Risk Adjusted Premiums The monthly CMS Direct Premium Subsidy is based upon the members health status, which is determined by CMS, as more fully described above under " Risk Adjusted Premiums ." We do not have access to diagnosis data with respect to our stand-alone PDP members and therefore, we cannot anticipate changes in our members risk scores. Changes in CMS premiums related to risk-score adjustments for our stand-alone PDP membership are recognized when the amounts become determinable and collectability is reasonably assured, which occurs when we are notified by CMS of such adjustments. Although such adjustments have not been considered to be material in the past, future adjustments could be material. 73 Table of Contents Low-Income Premium Subsidy For qualifying LIS members, CMS pays us for some or all of the LIS member monthly premium. The CMS payment is dependent upon a member income level which is determined by the Social Security Administration. Low-income premium is recognized over the contract period and reported as premium revenue. Low-Income Cost Sharing Subsidy For qualifying LIS members, CMS will reimburse us for all or a portion of the LIS member deductible, coinsurance and co-payment amounts above the out of pocket threshold for low income beneficiaries. Low-income cost sharing subsidies are paid by CMS prospectively as a fixed amount per member per month, and are determined based upon the plan year bid we submitted to CMS. Following the plan year, CMS performs an annual reconciliation of the LICS received by the plan sponsor to the actual amount paid by the plan sponsor. Catastrophic Reinsurance Subsidy CMS reimburses us for 80% of the drug costs after a member reaches his or her out of pocket catastrophic threshold through a catastrophic reinsurance subsidy. Catastrophic reinsurance subsidies are paid by CMS prospectively as a fixed amount per member per month and are determined based upon the plan year bid we submitted to CMS. After the close of the annual plan year, CMS reconciles actual experience compared to catastrophic reinsurance subsidies paid to our plans and any differences are settled between CMS and our plans. Coverage Gap Discount Subsidy Beginning in 2011, CMS provides monthly prospective payments for pharmaceutical manufacturer discounts made available to members. The prospective discount payments are determined based upon the plan year bid submitted by plan sponsors to CMS and current plan enrollment. Following the plan year, CMS performs an annual reconciliation of the prospective discount payments received by the plan sponsor to the cost of actual manufacturer discounts made available to each plan sponsor enrollees under the program. Low-income cost sharing, catastrophic reinsurance subsidies and coverage gap discount subsidies represent funding from CMS for which we assume no risk. The receipt of these subsidies and the payments of the actual prescription drug costs related to the low-income cost sharing, catastrophic reinsurance and coverage gap discounts are not recognized as premium revenues or benefits expense, but are reported on a net basis as funds receivable/held for the benefit of members in the consolidated balance sheets. These receipts and payments are reported as financing activity in our consolidated statements of cash flows. After the close of the annual plan year, CMS reconciles actual experience to prospective payments paid to our plans and any differences are settled between CMS and our plans. Historically, we have not experienced material adjustments related to the CMS annual reconciliation of prior plan year low-income cost sharing and catastrophic reinsurance subsidies. CMS Risk Corridor Premiums from CMS are subject to risk sharing through the Medicare Part D risk corridor provisions. The CMS risk corridor calculation compares the target amount of prescription drug costs (limited to costs under the standard coverage as defined by CMS) less rebates in our annual plan bid to actual experience. Variances of more than 5% above the target amount will result in CMS making additional payments to us, and variances of more than 5% below the target amount will require us to refund to CMS a portion of the premiums we received. Risk corridor payments due to or from CMS are estimated throughout the year as if the annual contract were to terminate at the end of the reporting period, and are recognized as adjustments to premium revenues and other payables to government partners. This estimate provides no consideration of future pharmacy claims experience, but does require us to consider factors that may not be certain, including: membership, risk scores, prescription drug events, or PDEs, and rebates. Approximately nine months after the close of the annual plan year, CMS reconciles actual experience to the target amount and any differences are settled between CMS and our plans. Historically, we have not experienced material adjustments related to the CMS settlement of the prior plan year risk corridor estimate. 74 Table of Contents Estimating Medical Benefits Expense and Medical Benefits Payable The cost of medical benefits is recognized in the period in which services are provided and includes an estimate of the cost of IBNR medical benefits. Medical benefits payable included in our consolidated balance sheets represents amounts for claims fully adjudicated but not yet paid and estimates for IBNR, and includes direct medical expenses and medically-related administrative costs. Direct medical expenses include amounts paid or payable to hospitals, physicians and providers of ancillary services, such as laboratories and pharmacies. Such expense may also include reserves for estimated referral claims related to health care providers under contract with us who are financially troubled or insolvent and who may not be able to honor their obligations for the costs of medical services provided by other providers. In these instances, we may be required to honor these obligations for legal or business reasons. Based on our current assessment of providers under contract with us, such losses have not been and are not expected to be significant. Also, included in direct medical expense are estimates for provider settlements due to clarification of contract terms, out-of-network reimbursement, claims payment differences and amounts due to contracted providers under risk-sharing arrangements. Medically-related administrative costs include items such as case and disease management, utilization review services, quality assurance and on-call nurses, which are recorded in selling, general, and administrative expense. The following table provides a detail of the components of medical benefits payable: December 31, % of December 31, % of 2011 Total 2010 Total (In millions) Claims adjudicated but not yet paid $ 62.3 8% $ 50.9 7% IBNR 682.5 92% 692.1 93% Total medical benefits payable $ 744.8 $ 743.0 The medical benefits payable estimate has been and continues to be our most significant estimate included in our financial statements. We historically have used and continue to use a consistent methodology for estimating our medical benefits expense and medical benefits payable. Our policy is to record management best estimate of medical benefits payable based on the experience and information available to us at the time. This estimate is determined utilizing standard actuarial methodologies based upon historical experience and key assumptions consisting of trend factors and completion factors using an assumption of moderately adverse conditions, which vary by business segment. These standard actuarial methodologies include using, among other factors, contractual requirements, historic utilization trends, the interval between the date services are rendered and the date claims are paid, denied claims activity, disputed claims activity, benefits changes, expected health care cost inflation, seasonality patterns, maturity of lines of business and changes in membership. The factors and assumptions described above that are used to develop our estimate of medical benefits expense and medical benefits payable inherently are subject to greater variability when there is more limited experience or information available to us. The ultimate claims payment amounts, patterns and trends for new products and geographic areas cannot be precisely predicted at their onset, since we, the providers and the members do not have experience in these products or geographic areas. Standard accepted actuarial methodologies, discussed above, would allow for this inherent variability. This can result in larger differences between the originally estimated medical benefits payable and the actual claims amounts paid. Conversely, during periods where our products and geographies are more stable and mature, we have more reliable claims payment patterns and trend experience. With more reliable data, we should be able to more closely estimate the ultimate claims payment amounts; therefore, we may experience smaller differences between our original estimate of medical benefits payable and the actual claim amounts paid. In developing our estimates, we apply different estimation methods depending on the month for which incurred claims are being estimated. For the more recent months, which constitute the majority of the amount of the medical benefits payable, we estimate claims incurred by applying observed trend factors to the fixed fee PMPM costs for prior months, which costs have been estimated using completion factors, in order to estimate the PMPM costs for the most recent months. We validate our estimates of the most recent PMPM costs by comparing the most recent months utilization levels to the utilization levels in prior months and actuarial techniques that incorporate a historical analysis of claim payments, including trends in cost of care provided and timeliness of submission and processing of claims. Many aspects of the managed care business are not predictable. These aspects include the incidences of illness or disease state (such as congestive heart failure cases, cases of upper respiratory illness, the length and severity of the flu season, diabetes, the number of full-term versus premature births and the number of neonatal intensive care babies). Therefore, we must continually monitor our historical experience in determining our trend assumptions to reflect the ever-changing mix, needs and size of our membership. Among the factors considered by management are changes in the level of benefits provided to members, seasonal variations in utilization, identified industry trends and changes in provider reimbursement arrangements, including changes in the percentage of reimbursements made on a capitation as opposed to a fee-for-service basis. These considerations are reflected in the trends in our medical benefits expense. Other external factors such as government-mandated benefits or other regulatory changes, catastrophes and epidemics may impact medical cost trends. Other internal factors such as system conversions and claims processing interruptions may impact our ability to accurately predict estimates of historical completion factors or medical cost trends. Medical cost trends potentially are more volatile than other segments of the economy. Management uses considerable judgment in determining medical benefits expense trends and other actuarial model inputs. We believe that the amount of medical benefits payable as of December 31, 2011 is adequate to cover our ultimate liability for unpaid claims as of that date; however, actual payments may differ from established estimates. If the completion factors we used in estimating our IBNR for the year ended December 31, 2011 were decreased by 1%, our net income would decrease by approximately $59.6 million. If the completion factors were increased by 1%, our net income would increase by approximately $58.2 million. 75 Table of Contents Table of Contents Changes in medical benefits payable estimates are primarily the result of obtaining more complete claims information and medical expense trend data over time. Volatility in members needs for medical services, provider claims submissions and our payment processes result in identifiable patterns emerging several months after the causes of deviations from assumed trends occur. Since our estimates are based upon PMPM claims experience, changes cannot typically be explained by any single factor, but are the result of a number of interrelated variables, all of which influence the resulting medical cost trend. Differences between actual experience and estimates used to establish the liability, which we refer to as prior period developments, are recorded in the period when such differences become known, and have the effect of increasing or decreasing the reported medical benefits expense and resulting MBR in such periods. Such differences can have a material impact on results of operations in the periods in which they are recognized. After determining an estimate of the base reserve, actuarial standards of practice require that a margin for uncertainty be considered in determining the estimate for unpaid claim liabilities. If a margin is included, the claim liabilities should be adequate under moderately adverse conditions. Therefore, we make an additional estimate in the process of establishing the IBNR, which also uses standard actuarial techniques, to account for adverse conditions that may cause actual claims to be higher than estimated compared to the base reserve, for which the model is not intended to account. We refer to this additional liability as the provision for moderately adverse conditions. The provision for moderately adverse conditions is a component of our overall determination of the adequacy of our IBNR reserve and the provision for moderately adverse conditions is intended to capture the potential adverse development from factors such as our entry into new geographical markets, our provision of services to new populations such as the aged, blind and disabled, the variations in utilization of benefits and increasing medical cost, changes in provider reimbursement arrangements, variations in claims processing speed and patterns, claims payment, the severity of claims, and outbreaks of disease such as the flu. Because of the complexity of our business, the number of states in which we operate, and the need to account for different health care benefit packages among those states, we make an overall assessment of IBNR after considering the base actuarial model reserves and the provision for moderately adverse conditions. We consistently apply our IBNR estimation methodology from period to period. We review our overall estimates of IBNR on a monthly basis. As additional information becomes known to us, we adjust our assumptions accordingly to change our estimate of IBNR. Therefore, if moderately adverse conditions do not occur, evidenced by more complete claims information in the following period, then our prior period estimates will be revised downward, resulting in favorable development. However, when a portion of the development related to the prior year incurred claims is offset by an increase determined to address moderately adverse conditions for the current year incurred claims, we do not consider that development amount as having any impact on net income during the period. If moderately adverse conditions occur and are more than we estimated, then our prior period estimates will be revised upward, resulting in unfavorable development, which would decrease current period net income. The following table provides a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance of medical benefits payable: Years Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 (In millions) Balances as of beginning of period $ 743.0 $ 802.5 $ 766.2 Medical benefits incurred related to: Current period 5,124.2 4,652.9 5,983.5 Prior periods (252.1) (116.3) (121.0) Total 4,872.1 4,536.6 5,862.5 Medical benefits paid related to: Current period (4,457.9) (4,026.3) (5,250.9) Prior periods (412.3) (569.8) (575.3 Total (4,870.2) (4,596.1) (5,826.2) Balances as of end of period $ 744.9 $ 743.0 $ 802.5 76 Table of Contents Medical benefits payable recorded at December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 developed favorably by approximately $252.1 million, $116.3 million and $121.0 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. A portion of the prior period development was attributable to the release of the provision for moderately adverse conditions, which is included as part of the assumptions. The release of the provision for moderately adverse conditions was substantially offset by the provision for moderately adverse conditions established for claims incurred in the current year. Accordingly, the change in the amount of the incurred claims related to prior years in the Medical benefits payable does not directly correspond to an increase in net income recognized during the period. In addition to the release of the provision for moderately adverse conditions, medical benefits expense for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 was impacted by approximately $191.2 million and $56.2 million, respectively, of net favorable development related to prior years. The net favorable prior year reserve development during 2011 resulted primarily from 2010 medical cost trend emerging favorably in our Medicaid segment due to lower than projected utilization. The net favorable prior year reserve development in 2010 was primarily associated with the exit of the PFFS product on December 31, 2009. The factors impacting the changes in the determination of medical benefits payable discussed above were not discernible in advance. The impact became clearer over time as claim payments were processed and more complete claims information was obtained. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets We obtained goodwill and other intangible assets as a result of the acquisitions of our subsidiaries. These assets are allocated to reporting segments for impairment testing purposes. Goodwill represents the excess of the cost over the fair market value of net assets acquired. Goodwill attributable to our Medicare reporting segment was determined to be fully impaired in 2008 and was completely written off. Accordingly, all of the remaining goodwill is attributable to our Medicaid reporting segment. Other intangible assets include provider networks, trademarks, state contracts, licenses and permits. Our other intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives ranging from approximately one to 26 years. We review goodwill and other intangible assets for potential impairment at least annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances occur that may affect the estimated useful life or the recoverability of the remaining balance of goodwill or other intangible assets. Such events or changes in circumstances would include significant changes in membership, state funding, medical contracts and provider networks. We evaluate the potential impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets using both the income and market approach. In doing so, we must make assumptions and estimates, such as projected revenues and the discount factor, in estimating fair values. While we believe these assumptions and estimates are appropriate, other assumptions and estimates could be applied and might produce significantly different results. We use a two-step process to review goodwill for impairment. The first step is a screen for potential impairment, and the second step measures the amount of impairment, if any. An impairment loss is recognized for goodwill and intangible assets if the carrying value of such assets exceeds its fair value. We select the second quarter of each year for our annual goodwill potential impairment test, which generally coincides with the finalization of federal and state contract negotiations and our initial budgeting process, with the test completed during the third quarter of that year. As of our most recent testing date, we have determined that the estimated fair value of the Medicaid reporting segment exceeded its carrying value and as a result, there were no indications that would require additional impairment testing as of December 31, 2011. We evaluated the intangible assets associated with our PFFS business, which primarily consisted of state licenses for the insurance companies that underwrote that line of business. As we continue to use these company licenses for other lines of business and the licenses have a market value, we determined that these assets were not impaired.
