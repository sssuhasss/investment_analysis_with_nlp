ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS We are primarily engaged in developing, acquiring, owning and operating apartment communities in high barrier-to-entry markets of the United States. We seek to create long-term shareholder value by accessing capital on cost effective terms; deploying that capital to develop, redevelop and acquire apartment communities in high barrier-to-entry markets; operating apartment communities; and selling communities when they no longer meet our long-term investment strategy and when pricing is attractive. The net operating income of our current operating communities, as defined later in this report, is one of the financial measures that we use to evaluate community performance. Net operating income is affected by the demand and supply dynamics within our markets, our rental rates and occupancy levels, and our ability to control operating costs. Our overall financial performance is also impacted by the general availability and cost of capital and the performance of our newly developed and acquired apartment communities. This report, including the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations, contains forward-looking statements regarding future events or trends as described more fully under Forward-Looking Statements on page 61 of this report. Actual results or developments could differ materially from those projected in such statements as a result of the risk factors described in Item 1a, Risk Factors, of this report. The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and notes included elsewhere in this report. Business Description and Community Information Overview We believe that apartment communities present an attractive long-term investment opportunity compared to other real estate investments because a broad potential resident base should help reduce demand volatility over a real estate cycle. We intend to continue to pursue real estate investments in markets where constraints to new supply exist, and where new rental household formations are expected to out-pace multifamily permit activity over the course of the real estate cycle. Barriers-to-entry in our markets generally include a difficult and lengthy entitlement process with local jurisdictions and dense urban or suburban areas where zoned and entitled land is in limited supply. We regularly evaluate the allocation of our investments by the amount of invested capital and by product type within our individual markets, which are located in the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, Pacific Northwest, and Northern and Southern California regions of the United States. Our strategy is to more deeply penetrate these markets with a broad range of products and services and an intense focus on our customer. A substantial majority of our communities are upscale, which generally command among the highest rents in their markets. However, we also pursue the ownership and operation of apartment communities that target a variety of customer segments and price points, consistent with our goal of offering a broad range of products and services. We believe that, over an entire real estate cycle, lower housing affordability and the limited new supply of apartment homes in our markets will result in a higher propensity to rent and larger increases in cash flow relative to other markets. However, throughout the real estate cycle, apartment market fundamentals, and therefore operating cash flows, are affected by overall economic conditions. A number of our markets experienced economic contraction due to job losses in 2002 and 2003, particularly in the technology, telecom and financial services sectors. This resulted in a prolonged period of weak apartment market fundamentals as reflected in declining rental rates and demand. However, 2004 was a year of transition, where the economy showed signs of an early phase recovery, as evidenced by modest job growth and declining unemployment claims. The improvement in the economic environment in 2005 has resulted in stronger apartment market fundamentals. 44 This is supported by the following operating results achieved within our Established Community portfolio during 2005: we achieved year-over-year revenue growth; we transitioned from occupancy gains to increases in rental rates as the primary driver of rental revenue growth; we achieved the highest year-over-year increase in average rental rates in four years; and average economic occupancy was at or above 95% in each of our markets. Based on these results and our expectations for improving demand/supply fundamentals, we expect continued growth in the revenue and net operating income generated by our operating communities in 2006. We expect continued job growth and household formation in our markets in 2006, the principal drivers of housing demand. Condominium conversion activity has reduced the availability of rental apartments, while low single-family home affordability makes rental apartments an economically attractive housing alternative. Accordingly, we expect apartment market fundamentals to continue to improve in our markets such that apartment rental demand will outpace new supply, resulting in rental revenue growth of 5.0% to 6.0% in our Established Community portfolio in 2006, and projected NOI growth of 6.0% to 7.0%. In positioning for future growth, we increased our development volume. We currently have in excess of $1,000,000,000 under construction (measured by total projected capitalized cost of the communities at completion, including the portions owned by joint venture partners). In addition, we continue to secure new Development Rights, as discussed below, including the acquisition of land for future development. We currently have Development Rights for construction of new apartment communities that, based on total projected capitalized cost, total approximately $3,000,000,000. We anticipate starting new developments with total projected capitalized costs of $700,000,000 to $800,000,000 in 2006. These total projected capitalized costs may be impacted by increasing construction costs, particularly in the areas of payroll, utilities, concrete and steel. We also anticipate acquiring additional land held for future development for an aggregate purchase price of $75,000,000 to $100,000,000. We continue to look for opportunities to acquire existing communities through our investment in and management of a discretionary investment fund (the Fund ). During its investment period (which will end on or before March 16, 2008), the Fund will be our exclusive vehicle for acquiring apartment communities, subject to certain exceptions. The Fund acquired four communities for an aggregate purchase price of $99,907,000 during 2005 and has approximately $90,000,000 under contract for acquisition in early 2006. We will continue to focus on acquisition opportunities where we believe we can create value, generally through redevelopment or repositioning opportunities. Strong capital flows to the industry and the strength of the condominium market have resulted in an attractive selling environment. We sold seven communities during 2005 for an aggregate sales price of approximately $350,000,000, of which approximately $315,000,000 was sold to condominium converters. We anticipate asset sales of approximately $225,000,000 to $300,000,000 in 2006. While the active condominium market has created demand for multifamily apartment communities, it has also created a challenging environment for us in other ways such as: increased competition for land, resulting in, at times, the acquisition of land zoned for uses other than residential with the potential for rezoning; increased competition for subcontractors; increased competition for experienced multifamily development and construction professionals, particularly in our markets; increased competition for our customers, resulting in increased move-outs due to home ownership; and increased risks as a result of sales to condominium converters. There are indications that condominium conversion activity is slowing, which could impact the market for our assets held for sale, and as a result, the volume of assets we offer for sale. 45 Our real estate investments consist primarily of current operating apartment communities, communities in various stages of development ( Development Communities ) and Development Rights (i.e., land or land options held for development), as further described in Item 2 of this report. Our current operating communities are further distinguished as Established Communities, Other Stabilized Communities, Lease-Up Communities and Redevelopment Communities. Established Communities are generally operating communities that are consolidated for financial reporting purposes and were owned and had stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of the beginning of the prior year, which allows the performance of these communities and the markets in which they are located to be compared and monitored between years. Other Stabilized Communities are generally all other operating communities that have stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of the beginning of the current year, but had not achieved stabilization as of the beginning of the prior year. Lease-Up Communities consist of communities where construction is complete but stabilization has not been achieved. Redevelopment Communities consist of communities where substantial redevelopment is in progress or is planned to begin during the current year. A more detailed description of our reportable segments and other related operating information can be found in Note 9, Segment Reporting, of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Although each of these categories is important to our business, we generally evaluate overall operating, industry and market trends based on the operating results of Established Communities, for which a detailed discussion can be found in Results of Operations as part of our discussion of overall operating results. We evaluate our current and future cash needs and future operating potential based on acquisition, disposition, development, redevelopment and financing activities within Other Stabilized, Redevelopment and Development Communities, for which detailed discussions can be found in Liquidity and Capital Resources. As of December 31, 2005, we owned or held an ownership interest in 158 apartment communities containing 45,474 apartment homes in ten states and the District of Columbia, of which 15 communities were under construction and two communities were under reconstruction. In addition, we owned a direct or indirect ownership interest in Development Rights to develop an additional 47 communities that, if developed in the manner expected, will contain an estimated 12,495 apartment homes. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. If our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different, or different estimates or assumptions had been made, it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied, resulting in different financial results or a different presentation of our financial statements. Below is a discussion of accounting policies that we consider critical to an understanding of our financial condition and operating results and that may require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters which are inherently uncertain. As a REIT that owns, operates and develops apartment communities, our critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition, cost capitalization, asset impairment evaluation and REIT status. A discussion of our significant accounting policies, including further discussion of the accounting policies described below, can be found in Note 1, Organization and Significant Accounting Policies of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Revenue Recognition Rental income related to leases is recognized on an accrual basis when due from residents in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104, Revenue Recognition and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 13, Accounting for Leases. In accordance with our standard lease terms, rental payments are generally due on a monthly basis. Any cash concessions given at the inception of the lease are amortized over the approximate life of the lease, which is generally one year. A discussion regarding the impact of cash concessions on rental revenue for Established Communities can be found in Results of Operations. 46 Cost Capitalization We capitalize costs during the development of assets (including interest and related loan fees, property taxes and other direct and indirect costs) beginning when development efforts commence until the asset, or a portion of the asset, is delivered and is ready for its intended use, which is generally indicated by the issuance of a certificate of occupancy. We capitalize costs during redevelopment of apartment homes (including interest and related loan fees, property taxes and other direct and indirect costs) beginning when an apartment home is taken out-of-service for redevelopment until the apartment home redevelopment is completed and the apartment home is available for a new resident. Rental income and operating expenses incurred during the initial lease-up or post-redevelopment lease-up period are fully recognized as they accrue. We capitalize pre-development costs incurred in pursuit of Development Rights for which we currently believe future development is probable. These costs include legal fees, design fees and related overhead costs. Future development of these Development Rights is dependent upon various factors, including zoning and regulatory approval, rental market conditions, construction costs and availability of capital. Pre-development costs incurred in the pursuit of Development Rights for which future development is not yet considered probable are expensed as incurred. In addition, if the status of a Development Right changes, making future development no longer probable, any capitalized pre-development costs are written-off with a charge to expense. We generally capitalize only non-recurring expenditures. We capitalize improvements and upgrades only if the item: (i) exceeds $15,000; (ii) extends the useful life of the asset; and (iii) is not related to making an apartment home ready for the next resident. Under this policy, virtually all capitalized costs are non-recurring, as recurring make-ready costs are expensed as incurred. Recurring make-ready costs include: (i) carpet and appliance replacements; (ii) floor coverings; (iii) interior painting; and (iv) other redecorating costs. Because we expense recurring make-ready costs, such as carpet replacements, our expense levels and volatility are greatest in the third quarter of each year as this is when we experience our greatest amount of turnover. We capitalize purchases of personal property, such as computers and furniture, only if the item is a new addition and the item exceeds $2,500. We generally expense replacements of personal property. In 2005, 2004 and 2003, the amounts capitalized (excluding land costs) related to acquisitions, development and redevelopment were $425,170,000, $347,091,000 and $296,764,000, respectively. For Established and Other Stabilized Communities, we recorded non-revenue generating capital expenditures of $16,753,000 or $471 per apartment home in 2005, $12,347,000 or $354 per apartment home in 2004 and $11,064,000 or $333 per apartment home in 2003. In addition, revenue generating capital expenditures, such as water submetering equipment and cable installations, were $817,000, $637,000 and $529,000 in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The average maintenance costs charged to expense per apartment home, including carpet and appliance replacements, related to these communities was $1,546 in 2005, $1,348 in 2004 and $1,262 in 2003. Historically, we have experienced a gradual increase in capitalized costs and expensed maintenance costs per apartment home as the average age of our communities has increased, and expensed maintenance costs have fluctuated with turnover. Although we expect these trends to continue in the future, capitalized costs increased in 2005 over prior year growth levels as we embarked on a number of community upgrades and improvements. We expect capitalized costs in 2006 to be at or slightly above 2005 levels as we continue with these community upgrades and improvements. Asset Impairment Evaluation If there is an event or change in circumstance that indicates an impairment in the value of a community, our policy is to assess the impairment by making a comparison of the current and projected operating cash flow of the community over its remaining useful life, on an undiscounted basis, to the carrying amount of the community. If the carrying amount is in excess of the estimated projected operating cash flow of the community, we would recognize an impairment loss equivalent to an amount required to adjust the carrying amount to its estimated fair market value. Real estate assets held for sale are measured at the lower of the carrying amount or the fair value less the cost to sell. 47 We account for our investments in unconsolidated entities that were created prior to and have not been modified since June 29, 2005, and are not variable interest entities in accordance with Statement of Position 78-9, Accounting for Investments in Real Estate Ventures and Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 18, The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock. Any investments in entities that were created or modified subsequent to June 29, 2005, and are not variable interest entities are accounted for in accordance with EITF Issue No. 04-5, Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights. If there is an event or change in circumstance that indicates a loss in the value of an investment, we record the loss and reduce the value of the investment to its fair value. A loss in value would be indicated if we could not recover the carrying value of the investment or if the investee could not sustain an earnings capacity that would justify the carrying amount of the investment. REIT Status We are a Maryland corporation that has elected to be treated, for federal income tax purposes, as a REIT. We elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, for the year ended December 31, 1994 and have not revoked such election. A corporate REIT is a legal entity which holds real estate interests and must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that it currently distribute at least 90% of its adjusted taxable income to stockholders. As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to corporate level federal income tax on taxable income we distribute currently to our stockholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to federal income taxes at regular corporate rates (subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax) and may not be able to elect to qualify as a REIT for four subsequent taxable years. 48 Results of Operations Our year-over-year operating performance is primarily affected by changes in net operating income of our current operating apartment communities due to: market conditions; net operating income derived from acquisitions and development completions; the loss of net operating income related to disposed communities; and capital market, disposition and financing activity. A comparison of our operating results for the years 2005, 2004 and 2003 follows (dollars in thousands): 2005 2004 $ Change % Change 2004 2003 $ Change % Change Revenue: Rental and other income $ 666,376 $ 613,240 $ 53,136 8.7 % $ 613,240 $ 556,582 $ 56,658 10.2 % Management, development and other fees 4,304 604 3,700 612.6 % 604 931 (327 ) (35.1 %) Total revenue 670,680 613,844 56,836 9.3 % 613,844 557,513 56,331 10.1 % Expenses: Direct property operating expenses, excluding property taxes 155,481 148,705 6,776 4.6 % 148,705 134,182 14,623 10.8 % Property taxes 65,487 59,458 6,029 10.1 % 59,458 53,257 6,201 11.6 % Total community operating expenses 220,968 208,163 12,805 6.2 % 208,163 187,439 20,724 11.1 % Corporate-level property management and other indirect operating expenses 31,243 27,956 3,287 11.8 % 27,956 27,123 833 3.1 % Investments and investment management 4,834 4,690 144 3.1 % 4,690 2,948 1,742 59.1 % Interest expense, net 127,099 131,103 (4,004 ) (3.1 %) 131,103 130,178 925 0.7 % Depreciation expense 158,822 151,991 6,831 4.5 % 151,991 138,725 13,266 9.6 % General and administrative expense 25,761 18,074 7,687 42.5 % 18,074 14,830 3,244 21.9 % Total other expenses 347,759 333,814 13,945 4.2 % 333,814 313,804 20,010 6.4 % Equity in income of unconsolidated entities 7,198 1,100 6,098 554.4 % 1,100 25,535 (24,435 ) n/a Venture partner interest in profit-sharing (1,178 ) 1,178 (100.0 %) (1,178 ) (1,688 ) 510 (30.2 %) Minority interest in consolidated partnerships (1,481 ) (150 ) (1,331 ) 887.3 % (150 ) (950 ) 800 (84.2 %) Income from continuing operations before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 107,670 71,639 36,031 50.3 % 71,639 79,167 (7,528 ) (9.5 %) Discontinued operations: Income from discontinued operations 14,942 21,134 (6,192 ) (29.3 %) 21,134 31,368 (10,234 ) (32.6 %) Gain on sale of real estate assets 199,766 122,425 77,341 63.2 % 122,425 160,990 (38,565 ) (24.0 %) Total discontinued operations 214,708 143,559 71,149 49.6 % 143,559 192,358 (48,799 ) (25.4 %) Income before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 322,378 215,198 107,180 49.8 % 215,198 271,525 (56,327 ) (20.7 %) Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 4,547 (4,547 ) (100.0 %) 4,547 4,547 100.0 % Net income 322,378 219,745 102,633 46.7 % 219,745 271,525 (51,780 ) (19.1 %) Dividends attributable to preferred stock (8,700 ) (8,700 ) (8,700 ) (10,744 ) 2,044 (19.0 %) Net income available to common stockholders $ 313,678 $ 211,045 $ 102,633 48.6 % $ 211,045 $ 260,781 $ (49,736 ) (19.1 %) Net income available to common stockholders increased $102,633,000, or 48.6%, to $313,678,000 in 2005. This increase is primarily attributable to higher gains on sales of assets in 2005, including the gain related to the sale of a technology investment, as well as increased net operating income from Established Communities and newly developed communities. Net income available to common stockholders decreased $49,736,000, or 19.1%, to $211,045,000 in 2004. This decrease is primarily attributable to lower gains on sales in 2004 as compared to 2003, including the gain realized from an unconsolidated entity, and increased depreciation expense, partially offset by increased net operating income from newly developed and acquired communities. Net operating income ( NOI ) is considered by management to be an important and appropriate supplemental performance measure to net income because it helps both investors and management to understand the core operations of a community or communities prior to the allocation of any corporate-level or financing-related costs. NOI reflects the operating performance of a community and allows for an easy comparison of the operating performance of individual assets or groups of assets. In addition, because prospective buyers of real estate have different financing and overhead structures, with varying marginal impacts to overhead by acquiring real estate, NOI is considered by many in the real estate industry to be a useful measure for determining the value of a real estate asset or group of assets. We define NOI as total property revenue less direct property operating expenses, including property taxes, and NOI excludes: corporate-level income (including management, development and other fees); corporate-level property management and other indirect operating expenses; investments and investment management costs; 49 interest expense, net; general and administrative expense; equity in income of unconsolidated entities; minority interest in consolidated partnerships; venture partner interest in profit-sharing; depreciation expense; gain on sale of real estate assets; cumulative effect of change in accounting principle; and income from discontinued operations. NOI does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, NOI should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance. NOI should also not be considered an alternative to net cash flow from operating activities, as determined by GAAP, as a measure of liquidity, nor is NOI necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs. A calculation of NOI for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, along with a reconciliation to net income for each year, is as follows (dollars in thousands): For the year ended 12-31-05 12-31-04 12-31-03 Net income $ 322,378 $ 219,745 $ 271,525 Corporate-level property management and other indirect operating expenses 31,243 27,956 27,123 Corporate-level other income (4,568 ) (1,344 ) (1,520 ) Investments and investment management 4,834 4,690 2,948 Interest expense, net 127,099 131,103 130,178 General and administrative expense 25,761 18,074 14,830 Equity in income of unconsolidated entities (7,198 ) (1,100 ) (25,535 ) Minority interest in consolidated partnerships 1,481 150 950 Venture partner interest in profit-sharing 1,178 1,688 Depreciation expense 158,822 151,991 138,725 Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle (4,547 ) Gain on sale of real estate assets (199,766 ) (122,425 ) (160,990 ) Income from discontinued operations (14,942 ) (21,134 ) (31,368 ) Net operating income $ 445,144 $ 404,337 $ 368,554 The NOI increases of $40,807,000 and $35,783,000 in 2005 and 2004, respectively, as compared to the prior years, consist of changes in the following categories (dollars in thousands): 2005 2004 Increase Increase (Decrease) (1) Established Communities $ 13,052 $ (3,363 ) Other Stabilized Communities 3,786 16,010 Development and Redevelopment Communities 23,969 23,136 Total $ 40,807 $ 35,783 (1) For purposes of this table, amounts have been restated from amounts previously reported for changes in discontinued operations as described in Note 7, Discontinued Operations Real Estate Assets Sold or Held for Sale, of our Consolidated Financial Statements. 50 The NOI increase in Established Communities in 2005 was largely due to the improved apartment market fundamentals. We maintained average economic occupancy of at least 95% in all regions during the year ended December 31, 2005 and we experienced the first year-over-year increase in rental rates in three years. We reached a transition point in the components of rental revenue growth, shifting from occupancy gains to increases in rental rates. We will continue to seek increases in rental rates by increasing market rents and/or reducing concessions, and we expect revenue growth from our Established Communities of 5.0% to 6.0% in 2006 as compared to 2005. In addition, although we will continue to aggressively manage operating expenses, there is upward pressure on operating expenses from increasing utility, labor and property tax expenses. We expect operating expenses at our Established Communities to increase by 3.0% to 4.0% in 2006 as compared to 2005. Overall, we anticipate growth in NOI from our Established Communities of 6.0% to 7.0% in 2006 as compared to 2005. The Company has given projected NOI growth in 2006 only for Established Communities and not on a company-wide basis. The Company believes that NOI growth of the Established Communities assists investors in understanding management estimate of the likely contribution to operations from Established Communities. However, the Company has not provided a projection of NOI growth on a company-wide basis due to the difficulty in projecting the timing of new development starts, dispositions and acquisitions, as well as the complexities involved in projecting the allocation of corporate-level property management overhead, general and administrative costs and interest expense to communities not yet developed, disposed or acquired. NOI growth expected from Established Communities is not a projection of the Company projected consolidated financial performance or projected cash flow. Rental and other income increased in 2005 due to increased rental rates and occupancy for our Established Communities, coupled with additional rental income generated from newly developed communities. Rental and other income increased in 2004 due to rental income generated from newly developed and acquired communities, as well as increased occupancy for our Established Communities, partially offset by declines in effective rental rates for our Established Communities. We expect apartment fundamentals to continue to strengthen in 2006. Overall Portfolio The weighted average number of occupied apartment homes increased to 36,520 apartment homes for 2005 as compared to 34,540 apartment homes for 2004 and 30,774 apartment homes for 2003. This change is primarily the result of an increase in the overall occupancy rate and increased homes available from newly developed and acquired communities, partially offset by communities sold in 2005 and 2004. The weighted average monthly revenue per occupied apartment home increased to $1,516 in 2005 as compared to $1,477 in 2004 and $1,505 in 2003. Established Communities Rental revenue increased $16,523,000, or 3.6%, in 2005 and decreased $1,496,000, or 0.3%, in 2004. The increase in 2005 is due to both increased rental rates and increased economic occupancy as compared to 2004. The decrease in 2004 is due to declining rental rates, partially offset by increased economic occupancy as compared to 2003. For 2005, the weighted average monthly revenue per occupied apartment home increased 2.7% to $1,503 compared to $1,464 in 2004, primarily due to increased market rents and decreased concessions. The average economic occupancy increased from 95.2% in 2004 to 96.1% in 2005. Economic occupancy takes into account the fact that apartment homes of different sizes and locations within a community have different economic impacts on a community gross revenue. Economic occupancy is defined as gross potential revenue less vacancy loss, as a percentage of gross potential revenue. Gross potential revenue is determined by valuing occupied homes at leased rates and vacant homes at market rents. We expect rental revenue from Established Communities to increase 5.0% to 6.0% in 2006 as compared to 2005. We experienced increases in Established Communities rental revenue in all six of our regions in 2005 as compared to 2004. The largest increases in rental revenue were in Southern California, the Pacific Northwest and the Northeast, with increases of 5.7%, 4.3% and 3.7%, respectively, between years. The Northeast and Northern California regions comprise the majority of our Established Community revenue, and therefore are discussed in more detail below. 51 The Northeast region represented approximately 35.5% of Established Community rental revenue during 2005. Average rental rates increased 2.2% to $1,892 in 2005 and economic occupancy increased 1.5% during 2005. We expect job growth to improve in the Northeast in 2006, although at a more moderate rate than our other markets. We expect moderate rental rate growth in the Northeast during 2006, with Northern New Jersey leading the region in revenue growth. We expect Boston, Massachusetts to lag the region in revenue growth, as economic recovery is not occurring as quickly as in other areas of the region. Northern California, which represented approximately 31.0% in Established Community rental revenue during 2005, experienced an increase in rental revenue of 2.8% in 2005 as compared to 2004. Average rental rates increased by 2.1% to $1,448 in 2005, and economic occupancy increased 0.7% to 96.2% in 2005. Although apartment fundamentals have been weak in certain areas of Northern California, particularly in San Jose, California, 2005 was a transition point for the region. We expect Northern California to see continued improvement in apartment fundamentals, driven by accelerating job growth and reduced product in the rental market due to condominium conversion activity. We expect the improving fundamentals to translate into accelerated revenue growth. In accordance with GAAP, cash concessions are amortized as an offset to rental revenue over the approximate lease term, which is generally one year. As a supplemental measure, we also present rental revenue with concessions stated on a cash basis to help investors evaluate the impact of both current and historical concessions on GAAP based rental revenue and to more readily enable comparisons to revenue as reported by other companies. Rental revenue with concessions stated on a cash basis also allows investors to understand historical trends in cash concessions, as well as current rental market conditions. The following table reconciles total rental revenue in conformity with GAAP to total rental revenue adjusted to state concessions on a cash basis for our Established Communities for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 (dollars in thousands). Information for the year ended December 31, 2003 is not presented, as Established Community classification is not applicable prior to January 1, 2004. See Note 9, Segment Reporting, of our Consolidated Financial Statements. For the year ended 12-31-05 12-31-04 Rental revenue (GAAP basis) $ 472,367 $ 455,844 Concessions amortized 17,102 19,127 Concessions granted (14,835 ) (18,891 ) Rental revenue adjusted to state concessions on a cash basis $ 474,634 $ 456,080 Year-over-year % change GAAP revenue 3.6 % n/a Year-over-year % change cash concession based revenue 4.1 % n/a Management, development and other fees increased in 2005 as compared to 2004 due to increased asset management, property management and redevelopment fees earned from the Fund, which was formed in March 2005. In addition, construction and development fees earned from one of our unconsolidated entities in 2005 contributed to increased fee income. We expect fee income to increase in 2006 as compared to 2005 due to a full year of operations of, and an increased number of assets owned by, the Fund. 52 Direct property operating expenses, excluding property taxes increased in both 2005 and 2004, primarily due to the addition of recently developed and acquired apartment homes. For Established Communities, direct property operating expenses, excluding property taxes, increased $965,000, or 0.9%, to $104,346,000 in 2005 due primarily to increases in payroll and utility costs, partially offset by decreases in marketing and bad debt expenses. During 2004, operating expenses increased $2,131,000, or 2.2%, due primarily to increased payroll costs, as well as increased make-ready costs associated with increasing occupancy. We expect operating expenses for Established Communities to increase by 3.0% to 4.0% in 2006 as compared to 2005, primarily as a result of continued higher utility expenses and payroll costs. Operating expense growth in 2006 as compared to 2005 will be tempered due to $880,000 of expenses incurred in 2005 for land lease payments that will not be incurred in 2006 due to the exercise of a purchase option. Property taxes increased in both 2005 and 2004 due to overall higher assessments and the addition of newly developed and redeveloped apartment homes, and are impacted by the size and timing of successful tax appeals in both years. For Established Communities, property taxes increased in 2005 and 2004 by $1,530,000 and $333,000, respectively, due to overall higher assessments throughout all regions, and are impacted by the size and timing of successful tax appeals in both years. We expect property taxes to continue to increase in 2006 as compared to 2005 as local jurisdictions are expected to continue to seek additional revenue sources to offset budget deficits. However, property taxes may fluctuate due to the timing and size of successful tax appeals. We evaluate property tax increases internally, as well as engage third-party consultants, and appeal increases when appropriate. Corporate-level property management and other indirect operating expenses increased in 2005 as compared to 2004 due to increased compensation costs, as well as increased costs relating to corporate initiatives, including investments in technology and training. We expect corporate-level property management and other indirect operating expenses to increase in 2006 as compared to 2005 as compensation costs continue to increase. Investments and investment management reflects the costs incurred related to investment acquisitions, investment management and abandoned pursuit costs, which include the abandonment or impairment of development pursuits, acquisition pursuits, disposition pursuits and technology investments. Investments and investment management increased in 2005 as compared to 2004 due primarily to increased costs incurred in forming and managing the Fund, partially offset by a decrease in abandoned pursuit costs. Investments and investment management increased in 2004 as compared to 2003 due to the costs incurred in preparing for and forming the Fund, increased compensation costs and increased abandoned pursuit costs. We expect investments and investment management costs to increase in 2006 as compared to 2005 as Fund activity increases. Abandoned pursuit costs were $816,000, $1,726,000 and $1,180,000 in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Abandoned pursuit costs can be volatile, and the costs incurred in any given period may be widely different in future years. Interest expense, net decreased in 2005 as compared to 2004 primarily due to the repayment of unsecured debt and a partial reissuance at lower interest rates, as well as higher levels of capitalized interest, in connection with our increased development activity, partially offset by overall higher short-term interest rates and higher average outstanding balances on our unsecured credit facility. Interest expense, net increased in 2004 as compared to 2003 primarily due to the interest income related to a participating mortgage note included in interest expense, net in 2003 (as described more fully below), partially offset by the repayment of unsecured debt and reissuance at lower interest rates, overall lower interest rates and lower average outstanding balances on our unsecured credit facility. We expect interest expense, net to decrease during 2006 primarily due to higher levels of capitalized interest resulting from increased development activity, as well as lower average outstanding balances on our unsecured credit facility. 53 Depreciation expense increased in both 2005 and 2004 primarily due to the completion of development and redevelopment activities. General and administrative expense ( G&A ) increased in 2005 as compared to 2004 as a result of: (i) separation costs of approximately $2,100,000 due to the departure of a senior executive; (ii) the accrual of costs related to various litigation matters of approximately $1,500,000; (iii) increased board of director fees due to the acceleration of equity awards with the resignation of a director due to disability; and (iv) higher compensation costs. G&A increased in 2004 as compared to 2003 as a result of higher compensation costs, increased litigation and settlement costs associated with certain community and corporate matters, and additional corporate governance costs, including costs relating to compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. We expect expensed overhead costs, including G&A, corporate - level property management and investments and investment management, to increase from 0.0% to 5.0% in 2006 as compared to 2005. Equity in income of unconsolidated entities increased in 2005 primarily due to the gain recognized in the amount of $6,252,000 related to the sale of our investment in Rent.com to eBay. Equity in income of unconsolidated entities decreased in 2004 as compared to 2003 primarily due to our 50% share of the gain received on a community sold in 2003 which was accounted for under the equity method. Venture partner interest in profit-sharing in 2004 and 2003 represented the income allocated to our venture partner in a profit-sharing arrangement as discussed in Note 6, Investments in Unconsolidated Entities, of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Effective December 2004, we no longer account for our interest in this venture as a profit-sharing arrangement, and therefore during 2005, no income or loss from venture partner interest in profit-sharing was recognized. Minority interest in consolidated partnerships increased in 2005 and decreased in 2004 due to the consolidation of an entity under FASB Interpretation No. 46 ( FIN 46 ), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of ARB No. 51, as revised in December 2003. Effective January 1, 2004, we consolidated an entity from which we held a participating mortgage note due to the implementation of FIN 46 as discussed in Note 1, Organization and Significant Accounting Policies, of our Consolidated Financial Statements. We did not hold an equity interest in this entity, and therefore 100% of the entity net loss was recognized as minority interest in consolidated partnerships during the year ended December 31, 2004. In October 2004, we received payment in full of the outstanding mortgage note due from this entity. Upon repayment of the mortgage note, our economic interest in this entity ended, and therefore this entity was no longer considered a variable interest entity under FIN 46 and we discontinued consolidation. Income from discontinued operations represents the net income generated by communities sold during the period from January 1, 2003 through December 31, 2005 or considered held for sale as of December 31, 2005. See Note 7, Discontinued Operations Real Estate Assets Sold or Held for Sale of our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. The decreases in 2005 and 2004 are due to the sale of seven communities and one office building in 2005 and five communities in 2004, eliminating the income generated from these assets upon disposition. Gain on sale of real estate assets increased in 2005 and decreased in 2004 due to the volume and size of dispositions in each year. The amount of gains realized depends on many factors, including the number of communities sold, the size and carrying value of those communities and local market conditions. We expect to continue to sell communities based on overall portfolio allocation needs as well as to respond to market opportunities. Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in 2004 is a result of the implementation of FIN 46, discussed above, and represents the difference between the net assets consolidated under FIN 46 and the previously recorded net assets. Dividends attributable to preferred stock decreased during 2004 primarily as a result of several preferred stock redemptions during 2003. 54 Funds from Operations Attributable to Common Stockholders ( FFO ) FFO is considered by management to be an appropriate supplemental measure of our operating and financial performance because, by excluding gains or losses related to dispositions of previously depreciated property and excluding real estate depreciation, which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates, FFO can help one compare the operating performance of a real estate company between periods or as compared to different companies. We believe that in order to understand our operating results, FFO should be examined with net income as presented in our Consolidated Financial Statements. For a more detailed discussion and presentation of FFO, see Selected Financial Data, included in Item 6 of this report. Liquidity and Capital Resources Factors affecting our liquidity and capital resources are our cash flows from operations, financing activities and investing activities. Operating cash flow has historically been determined by: (i) the number of apartment homes currently owned, (ii) rental rates, (iii) occupancy levels and (iv) operating expenses with respect to apartment homes. The timing, source and amount of cash flow provided by financing activities and used in investing activities are sensitive to the capital markets environment, particularly to changes in interest rates. The timing and type of capital markets activity in which we engage, as well as our plans for development, redevelopment, acquisition and disposition activity, are affected by changes in the capital markets environment, such as changes in interest rates or the availability of cost-effective capital. We regularly review our liquidity needs, the adequacy of cash flow from operations, and other expected liquidity sources to meet these needs. We believe our principal short-term liquidity needs are to fund: normal recurring operating expenses; debt service and maturity payments; preferred stock dividends and DownREIT partnership unit distributions; the minimum dividend payments required to maintain our REIT qualification under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986; development and redevelopment activity in which we are currently engaged; and capital calls for the Fund as required. We anticipate that we can fully satisfy these needs from a combination of cash flow provided by operating activities, proceeds from asset dispositions and borrowing capacity under our variable rate unsecured credit facility. Cash and cash equivalents totaled $6,106,000 at December 31, 2005, an increase of $4,585,000 from $1,521,000 at December 31, 2004. The following discussion relates to changes in cash due to operating, investing and financing activities, which are presented in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows included elsewhere in this report. Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities increased to $306,639,000 in 2005 from $275,617,000 in 2004, primarily due to additional NOI from our Established Community operations, as well as NOI from recently developed communities, partially offset by the loss of NOI from the 12 communities sold in 2005 and 2004, as discussed earlier in this report. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities of $19,761,000 in 2005 related to investments in assets through development, redevelopment and acquisition of apartment communities, including the acquisition of a partner interest in a real estate joint venture, substantially all of which is offset by proceeds from asset dispositions, including the proceeds from the sale of a technology investment. During 2005, we invested $459,376,000 in the purchase and development of real estate and capital expenditures: we began the development of 12 new communities. These communities, if developed as expected, will contain a total of 3,365 apartment homes, and the total capitalized cost, including land acquisition costs, is projected to be approximately $882,700,000. We completed the development; 55 of seven communities containing an aggregate of 1,971 apartment homes for a total capitalized cost, including land acquisition cost, of $408,200,000; we completed the redevelopment of three communities containing 1,094 apartment homes for a total capitalized cost of $196,700,000, of which $165,700,000 was incurred prior to redevelopment; we acquired the 75% equity interest of a third-party partner in a joint venture owning one community for a net purchase price of $57,415,000; we contributed $6,278,000 for a 15.2% equity interest in the Fund, which upon contribution owned four apartment communities containing a total of 879 apartment homes with an aggregate gross real estate value of $112,852,000. We also received net proceeds of $87,948,000 as reimbursement for acquiring and warehousing these communities. In December 2005, we contributed an additional $5,303,000 to the Fund, bringing our total equity investment in the Fund to approximately $11,600,000; we acquired 13 parcels of land in connection with Development Rights, for an aggregate purchase price of $115,849,000; and we had capital expenditures relating to current communities real estate assets of $17,570,000 and non-real estate capital expenditures of $1,520,000. Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities totaled $282,293,000 in 2005, consisting primarily of dividends paid, certain unsecured note repayments and mortgage note repayments, partially offset by the issuance of common stock for option exercises, the issuance of unsecured notes and mortgage notes payable including draws on construction loans and an increase in borrowings under our unsecured credit facility. See Note 3, Notes Payable, Unsecured Notes and Credit Facility, and Note 4, Stockholders Equity, of our Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information. Variable Rate Unsecured Credit Facility We have a $500,000,000 revolving variable rate unsecured credit facility with JPMorgan Chase Bank and Wachovia Bank, N.A. serving as banks and syndication agents for a syndicate of commercial banks and Bank of America, serving as bank and administrative agent. Under the terms of the credit facility, we may elect to increase the facility by up to an additional $150,000,000, provided that one or more banks (from the syndicate or otherwise) voluntarily agree to provide the additional commitment. No member of the syndicate of banks can prohibit such increase; such an increase in the facility will only be effective to the extent banks (from the syndicate or otherwise) choose to commit to lend additional funds. We pay participating banks, in the aggregate, an annual facility fee of approximately $750,000. The unsecured credit facility bears interest at varying levels based on the London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ), rating levels achieved on our unsecured notes and on a maturity schedule selected by us. The current stated pricing is LIBOR plus 0.55% per annum (5.12% on January 31, 2006). The spread over LIBOR can vary from LIBOR plus 0.50% to LIBOR plus 1.15% based upon the rating of our long-term unsecured debt. In addition, a competitive bid option is available for borrowings of up to $250,000,000. This option allows banks that are part of the lender consortium to bid to provide us loans at a rate that is lower than the stated pricing provided by the unsecured credit facility. The competitive bid option may result in lower pricing if market conditions allow. We had no outstanding balance under this competitive bid option at January 31, 2006. We are subject to (i) certain customary covenants under the unsecured credit facility, including, but not limited to, maintaining certain maximum leverage ratios, a minimum fixed charges coverage ratio and minimum unencumbered assets and equity levels, and (ii) prohibitions on paying dividends in amounts that exceed 95% of our FFO, except as may be required to maintain our REIT status. The credit facility matures in May 2008, assuming our exercise of a one-year renewal option. At January 31, 2006, $16,000,000 was outstanding, $39,504,000 was used to provide letters of credit and $444,496,000 was available for borrowing under the unsecured credit facility. 56 Future Financing and Capital Needs Debt Maturities One of our principal long-term liquidity needs is the repayment of long-term debt at the time that such debt matures. For unsecured notes, we anticipate that no significant portion of the principal of these notes will be repaid prior to maturity. If we do not have funds on hand sufficient to repay our indebtedness as it becomes due, it will be necessary for us to refinance the debt. This refinancing may be accomplished by uncollateralized private or public debt offerings, additional debt financing that is collateralized by mortgages on individual communities or groups of communities, draws on our unsecured credit facility or by additional equity offerings. Although we believe we will have the capacity to meet our long-term liquidity needs, we cannot assure you that additional debt financing or debt or equity offerings will be available or, if available, that they will be on terms we consider satisfactory. The following debt activity occurred during the year ended December 31, 2005: We repaid $150,000,000 in previously issued unsecured notes in January 2005, along with any unpaid interest, pursuant to their scheduled maturity. No prepayment penalty was incurred; We issued $100,000,000 in unsecured notes in March 2005 under our existing shelf registration statement at an annual effective interest rate of 4.999%. Interest on these notes is payable semi-annually on March 15 and September 15, and they mature in March 2013; In connection with the admission of outside investors into the Fund, we deconsolidated the assets and liabilities of four communities owned by the Fund, including $24,869,000 in fixed rate mortgage debt secured by two of the communities; We made a payment in the amount of $36,142,000 to the third-party lender of a joint venture entity that was unconsolidated at December 31, 2004 but was consolidated in March 2005 upon acquisition of the 75% equity interest of the third-party partner; and We assumed $4,566,000 in fixed rate debt in connection with the acquisition of a parcel of improved land. We currently have an effective shelf registration statement on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The shelf registration statement originally provided for the issuance of $750,000,000 of debt and equity in one or more public offerings, however, only $370,984,000 remains available for issuance. We expect to increase our debt and equity capacity in early 2006. However, we cannot assure you that market conditions will permit us to issue debt or equity securities on cost-effective terms or that the registration statement will remain available and effective at all times. 57 The table below details debt maturities for the next five years, excluding our unsecured credit facility, for debt outstanding at December 31, 2005 (dollars in thousands).

(2) Financed by variable rate, tax-exempt debt, but the interest rate on a portion of this debt is effectively fixed at December 31, 2005 and 2004 through a swap agreement. The portion of the debt fixed through a swap agreement decreases (and therefore the variable portion of the debt increases) monthly as payments are made to a principal reserve fund. (3) Variable rates are given as of December 31, 2005. (4) Financed by variable rate debt, but interest rate is capped through an interest rate protection agreement. (5) Balances outstanding do not include $818 and $552 of debt discount as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, reflected in unsecured notes on our Consolidated Balance Sheets included elsewhere in this report. (6) This community was deconsolidated in March 2005 upon the admission of outside investors into the Fund. 58 Future Financing and Capital Needs Portfolio and Other Activity As of December 31, 2005, we had 15 new communities under construction, for which a total estimated cost of $598,412,000 remained to be invested. In addition, we had two communities under reconstruction, for which a total estimated cost of $1,656,000 remained to be invested. Substantially all of the capital expenditures necessary to complete the communities currently under construction and reconstruction, as well as development costs related to pursuing Development Rights, will be funded from: the remaining capacity under our current $500,000,000 unsecured credit facility; the net proceeds from sales of existing communities; retained operating cash; the issuance of debt or equity securities; and/or private equity funding. Before planned reconstruction activity, including reconstruction activity related to the Fund as discussed below, or the construction of a Development Right begins, we intend to arrange adequate financing to complete these undertakings, although we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such financing. In the event that financing cannot be obtained, we may have to abandon Development Rights, write-off associated pre-development costs that were capitalized and/or forego reconstruction activity. In such instances, we will not realize the increased revenues and earnings that we expected from such Development Rights or reconstruction activity and significant losses could be incurred. We have invested in the Fund, a private, discretionary investment vehicle that will acquire and operate apartment communities in our markets. The Fund will serve, until March 16, 2008 or until 80% of its committed capital is invested, as the exclusive vehicle through which we will acquire apartment communities, subject to certain exceptions. These exceptions include significant individual asset and portfolio acquisitions, properties acquired in tax-deferred transactions and acquisitions that are inadvisable or inappropriate for the Fund, if any. The Fund will not restrict our development activities, and will terminate after a term of eight years, subject to two one-year extensions. The Fund has nine institutional investors, including us, with combined capital commitments of $330,000,000. A significant portion of the investments made in the Fund by its investors are being made through AvalonBay Value Added Fund, Inc., a Maryland corporation that will qualify as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code (the Fund REIT ). A wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company is the general partner of the Fund and has committed $50,000,000 to the Fund and the Fund REIT (of which approximately $11,600,000 has been invested as of January 31, 2006) representing a 15.2% combined general partner and limited partner equity interest. Under the Fund documents, the Fund has the ability to employ leverage through debt financings up to 65% on a portfolio basis, which, if achieved, would enable the Fund to invest up to $940,000,000. From time to time we use joint ventures to hold or develop individual real estate assets. We generally employ joint ventures primarily to mitigate asset concentration or market risk and secondarily as a source of liquidity. We may also use joint ventures related to mixed-use land development opportunities where our partners bring development and operational expertise to the venture. Each joint venture or partnership agreement has been and will continue to be individually negotiated, and our ability to operate and/or dispose of a community in our sole discretion may be limited to varying degrees depending on the terms of the joint venture or partnership agreement. However, we can not assure you that we will achieve our objectives through joint ventures. In evaluating our allocation of capital within our markets, we sell assets that do not meet our long-term investment criteria or when capital and real estate markets allow us to realize a portion of the value created over the past business cycle and redeploy the proceeds from those sales to develop and redevelop communities. In response to real estate and capital markets conditions, including strong institutional demand for real estate assets in our markets and demand from condominium converters, we sold seven communities with net proceeds in the aggregate of $344,185,000 in 2005, and expect to sell communities at an aggregate sales price of $225,000,000 to $300,000,000 in 2006. We cannot assure you that assets can continue to be sold on terms that we consider satisfactory or that market conditions will continue 59 to make the sale of assets an appealing strategy. Because the proceeds from the sale of communities may not be immediately redeployed into revenue generating assets, the immediate effect of a sale of a community for a gain is to increase net income, but reduce future total revenues, total expenses, NOI and FFO. As of January 31, 2006, we have one community classified as held for sale under GAAP. We are actively pursuing the disposition of this community and expect to close on this disposition within the next twelve months. However, we cannot assure you that this community will be sold as planned. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We own interests in unconsolidated real estate entities, with ownership interests up to 50%. Four of these unconsolidated real estate entities, Avalon Terrace, LLC, CVP I, LLC, Mission Bay Venture Partners, LLC and the Fund, have debt outstanding as of December 31, 2005 as follows. Additional discussion of these entities can be found in Note 6, Investments in Unconsolidated Entities, of our Consolidated Financial Statements located elsewhere in this report. Avalon Terrace, LLC has $37,200,000 of fixed rate debt which matures in November 2010 and is payable by the unconsolidated real estate entity with operating cash flow from the underlying real estate. We have not guaranteed the debt on Avalon Terrace, LLC, nor do we have any obligation to fund this debt should the unconsolidated real estate entity be unable to do so. CVP I, LLC has outstanding bonds in the amount of $117,000,000 which mature in February 2009, assuming exercise of two one-year renewal options, and are payable by the unconsolidated real estate entity. In connection with the general contractor services that we provided to CVP I, LLC, the entity that owns and developed Avalon Chrystie Place I, we have provided a construction completion guarantee to the lender in order to fulfill their standard financing requirements related to the bond financing. Our obligations under this guarantee will terminate once all of the lender standard completion requirements have been satisfied. We currently expect this to occur in early 2006. Mission Bay Venture Partners, LLC has a construction loan in the amount of $94,400,000 (of which $28,354,000 is outstanding as of December 31, 2005), which matures in September 2010, assuming exercise of two one-year renewal options, and is payable by the unconsolidated real estate entity. In connection with the general contractor services that we provide to Mission Bay Venture Partners, LLC, the entity that owns and is developing Avalon Mission Bay North II, we have provided a construction completion guarantee to the lender in order to fulfill their standard financing requirements related to the construction financing. Our obligations under this guarantee will terminate following construction completion once all of the lender standard completion requirements have been satisfied. We currently expect this to occur in 2007. The Fund has six mortgage loans with amounts outstanding of $16,765,000, $16,575,000, $31,500,000, $23,806,000, $7,960,000 and $16,500,000, which mature in October 2011, April 2012, July 2012, August 2013, February 2028 (but can be prepaid after February 2008 without penalty) and October 2012, respectively. These mortgage loans are secured by the underlying real estate. In addition, the Fund has a credit facility with $37,100,000 outstanding as of December 31, 2005, which matures in January 2008. The mortgage loans and the credit facility are payable by the Fund with operating cash flow from the underlying real estate, and the credit facility is secured by capital commitments. We have not guaranteed the debt of the Fund, nor do we have any obligation to fund this debt should the Fund be unable to do so. In addition, as part of the formation of the Fund, we have provided to one of the limited partners a guarantee. The guarantee provides that, if, upon final liquidation of the Fund, the total amount of all distributions to that partner during the life of the Fund (whether from operating cash flow or property sales) does not equal the total capital contributions made by that partner, then we will pay the partner an amount equal to the shortfall, but in no event more than 10% of the total capital contributions made by the partner (maximum of approximately $1,700,000 as of December 31, 2005). We have not recorded a liability related to this guarantee as of December 31, 2005, as the fair value of the real estate assets owned by the Fund is considered adequate to cover such payment under a liquidation scenario. 60 There are no other lines of credit, side agreements, financial guarantees or any other derivative financial instruments related to or between us and our unconsolidated real estate entities. In evaluating our capital structure and overall leverage, management takes into consideration our proportionate share of this unconsolidated debt. Contractual Obligations We currently have contractual obligations consisting primarily of long-term debt obligations and lease obligations for certain land parcels and regional and administrative office space. Scheduled contractual obligations required for the next five years and thereafter are as follows as of December 31, 2005 (dollars in thousands): Payments due by period Less than 1 More than 5 Total Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years Years Long-Term Debt Obligations (1) $ 2,367,382 $ 223,787 $ 510,799 $ 463,185 $ 1,169,611 Operating Lease Obligations (2) 1,185,093 3,454 6,915 6,044 1,168,680 Total $ 3,552,475 $ 227,241 $ 517,714 $ 469,229 $ 2,338,291 (1) Includes $66,800 outstanding under our variable rate unsecured credit facility as of December 31, 2005. The table of contractual obligations assumes repayment of this amount in 2006 See Liquidity and Capital Resources. Amounts exclude interest payable as of December 31, 2005. (2) Includes land leases expiring between July 2029 and March 2142. Amounts do not include any adjustment for purchase options available under the land leases. Inflation and Deflation Substantially all of our apartment leases are for a term of one year or less. In an inflationary environment, this may allow us to realize increased rents upon renewal of existing leases or the beginning of new leases. Short-term leases generally minimize our risk from the adverse effects of inflation, although these leases generally permit residents to leave at the end of the lease term and therefore expose us to the effect of a decline in market rents. In a deflationary rent environment, we may be exposed to declining rents more quickly under these shorter term leases. Forward-Looking Statements This Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements as that term is defined under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You can identify forward-looking statements by our use of the words believe, expect, anticipate, intend, estimate, assume, project, plan, may, shall, will and other similar expressions in this Form 10-K, that predict or indicate future events and trends and that do not report historical matters. These statements include, among other things, statements regarding our intent, belief or expectations with respect to: our potential development, redevelopment, acquisition or disposition of communities; the timing and cost of completion of apartment communities under construction, reconstruction, development or redevelopment; the timing of lease-up, occupancy and stabilization of apartment communities; the pursuit of land on which we are considering future development; the anticipated operating performance of our communities; cost, yield and earnings estimates; our declaration or payment of distributions; our joint venture and discretionary fund activities; our policies regarding investments, indebtedness, acquisitions, dispositions, financings and other matters; our qualification as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code; 61 the real estate markets in Northern and Southern California and markets in selected states in the Mid-Atlantic, Northeast, Midwest and Pacific Northwest regions of the United States and in general; the availability of debt and equity financing; interest rates; general economic conditions; and trends affecting our financial condition or results of operations. We cannot assure the future results or outcome of the matters described in these statements; rather, these statements merely reflect our current expectations of the approximate outcomes of the matters discussed. You should not rely on forward-looking statements because they involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. These risks, uncertainties and other factors, which we describe in Item 1a, Risk Factors, elsewhere in this report, may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from the anticipated future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. In addition, these forward-looking statements represent our estimates and assumptions only as of the date of this report. We do not undertake to update these forward-looking statements, and therefore they may not represent our estimates and assumptions after the date of this report.
