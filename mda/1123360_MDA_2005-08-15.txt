ITEM 7 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements about our plans and expectations of what may happen in the future. Forward-looking statements are based on a number of assumptions and estimates that are inherently subject to significant risks and uncertainties, and our results could differ materially from the results anticipated by our forward-looking statements as a result of many known and unknown factors, including but not limited to those discussed in Exhibit 99.1 to this report. See also Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Statements located above Item 1 Business . You should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with Item 6 Selected Financial Data and Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data appearing elsewhere in this annual report. General We are a leading payments company. As a high-volume processor of electronic transactions, we enable consumers, corporations, government agencies and other profit and non-profit business enterprises to facilitate payments to purchase goods and services or further other economic goals. Our role is to serve as an intermediary in the exchange of information and funds that must occur between parties so that a transaction can be completed. Including our time as part of National Data Corporation, now known as NDCHealth, or NDC, we have provided transaction processing services since 1967. We were incorporated in Georgia as Global Payments Inc. in September 2000. We operate in one business segment, electronic transaction payment processing, and provide products and services throughout the United States, Canada and Europe with our merchant services offerings, primarily targeting customers in many vertical industries including government, professional services, restaurants, universities, utilities, gaming, retail and health care. We also conduct business in the United States, Latin America, Europe, Morocco, and the Philippines in connection with our consumer-to-consumer money transfer offering, where our main customers are immigrant laborers. Our merchant services offerings provide merchants and financial institutions with credit and debit card transaction processing, check services, and terminal management. We use two basic business models to market our merchant services offerings. One model, referred to as direct merchant services, features a salaried and commissioned sales force, ISOs, and independent sales representatives, all of whom sell our end-to-end services directly to merchants. Our other model, referred to as indirect merchant services, provides the same basic products and services as direct merchant services, primarily to financial institutions and ISOs on an unbundled basis, that in turn resell our products and their services to their merchants. Our direct merchant services offering is marketed in the United States and Canada, and our indirect merchant services are marketed in the United States, Canada and Central and Eastern Europe. For the fiscal year ended May 31, 2005, approximately 74% of our total revenue arose from direct merchant services and approximately 13% arose from indirect merchant services. Direct merchant services revenue is generated on services primarily priced as a percentage of transaction value, whereas indirect merchant services 18 Table of Contents revenue is generated on services primarily priced on a specified amount per transaction. In both merchant services models, we also charge for other processing fees unrelated to the number of transactions or the transaction value. Our money transfer product and service offerings include a variety of services such as consumer-to-consumer and business-to-business money transfer, financial electronic data interchange, and account balance, management information, and depositing reporting. Approximately 13% of our total revenue for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2005 is from money transfer services. Our products and services are marketed through a variety of distinct sales channels that include a large, dedicated direct sales force, ISOs, independent sales representatives and an internal telesales group, originating retail branch outlets, trade associations, alliance bank relationships and financial institutions. Executive Overview We reported strong financial results for fiscal 2005. In fiscal 2005, revenue increased $155.0 million, or 24.6%, to $784.3 million from $629.3 million in fiscal 2004. Revenue growth was primarily driven by the growth in our direct merchant service and consumer-to-consumer money transfer offerings and acquisitions closed late in fiscal 2004. Operating income was $160.1 million for fiscal 2005, compared to $112.9 million in the prior year comparable period, which resulted in an increase in operating margin to 20.4% for fiscal 2005 from 17.9% for fiscal 2004. Net income increased $30.5 million or 48.8% to $92.9 million in fiscal 2005 from $62.4 million in the prior year comparable period, resulting in a $0.73 increase in diluted earnings per share to $2.33 in fiscal 2005 from $1.60 in fiscal 2004. The operating income amounts reflect restructuring and other charges of $3.7 million, or $0.06 per diluted share, and $9.6 million, or $0.16 per diluted share, in fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004, respectively. Restructuring and other charges represented 0.5% and 1.5% of revenue in the fiscal years ended May 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. On December 21, 2004, we closed the acquisition from various individual shareholders of all of the outstanding equity interests in the following related privately held companies: United Europhil, S.A., a Spanish corporation; Tropical Express, S.L., a Spanish LLC; United Europhil Belgique, S.P.R.L, a Belgian company; and United Europhil UK, Ltd., an English company, which we collectively refer to throughout this report as Europhil or the Europhil acquisition. These entities engage in money transmittal and ancillary services from the countries in which the legal entities reside primarily to settlement locations in Latin America, Morocco, and the Philippines. The total consideration paid for this transaction, which was paid in cash at closing, was 15.5 million, or approximately $20.8 million at exchange rates in effect at closing. The companies acquired in connection with the Europhil acquisition are being operated through a newly formed Spanish holding company named DolEx Dollar Express Europe. The purpose of the transaction was to further our strategy of expanding our customer base and market share geographically. The results of Europhil operations were included in our consolidated financial statements commencing on December 22, 2004. On June 30, 2004, we acquired the remaining 49% interest in the Cash & Win product line from Comerica Bank. Prior to the acquisition, we effectively owned 51% of the Cash & Win product line because it was owned and operated by Global Payments Comerica Alliance, LLC, our joint venture with Comerica Bank. The Cash & Win product line provides credit and debit card cash advance services to patrons of the gaming industry. The total cash consideration paid for this interest was approximately $7.8 million. Effective July 1, 2004, we began recognizing 100% of the net income of the Cash & Win product line in our consolidated statements of income. Components of Income Statement We derive our revenues from three primary sources: charges based on volumes and fees for services, charges based on transaction quantity, and equipment sales, leases and service fees. Revenues generated by these 19 Table of Contents areas depend upon a number of factors, such as demand for and price of our services, the technological competitiveness of our product offerings, our reputation for providing timely and reliable service, competition within our industry, and general economic conditions. Cost of service consists primarily of the cost of operational-related personnel, including those who monitor our transaction processing systems and settlement; transaction processing systems, including third-party services such as the costs of settlement channels for consumer-to-consumer money transfer services; network telecommunications capability, depreciation and occupancy costs associated with the facilities performing these functions; and provisions for operating losses. Sales, general and administrative expenses consists primarily of salaries, wages and related expenses paid to sales personnel, non-revenue producing customer support functions and administrative employees and management, commissions to independent contractors and ISOs, advertising costs, other selling expenses, and occupancy of leased space directly related to these functions. Other income and expense consists of interest income and expense and other miscellaneous items of income and expense. Results of Operations Fiscal Year Ended May 31, 2005 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended May 31, 2004 Revenues In fiscal 2005, revenue increased $155.0 million or 24.6% to $784.3 million from $629.3 million in the prior year. We attribute this revenue growth primarily to increases from our direct merchant services and consumer-to-consumer money transfer offerings and acquisitions closed late in fiscal 2004. We intend to continue to grow our domestic and international presence, build our ISO sales channel, increase customer satisfaction, assess opportunities for profitable acquisition growth, pursue enhanced products and services for our customers, and leverage our existing business model. We expect our fiscal 2006 revenue to range from $839 million to $870 million, reflecting growth of 7% to 11%, compared to $784 million in fiscal 2005. During fiscal 2005, we have reclassified portions of our money transfer service offering to merchant services to better align those service offerings. The prior year periods presented reflect such reclassifications. The Company service offering revenues from external customers are as follows (dollars in millions): Fiscal Year Ended May 31, 2005 2004 % Change Merchant services $ 680.8 $ 579.4 17.5 % Money transfer 103.5 49.9 107.4 % $ 784.3 $ 629.3 24.6 % Merchant services We experienced continued growth in our domestic direct merchant channel by continuing to sign mid-market merchants in various vertical markets to maintain our diversification. The increase in revenue reflects mid teen transaction growth in our domestic direct card merchant channel, primarily driven by increases in our ISO sales channel. We believe this transaction growth compares favorably to industry trends. According to The Nilson Report dated February 2005, industry growth averaged 13%. Our domestic average dollar value of transaction, or average ticket, and our domestic average discount revenue per dollar value volume, or spread, experienced a modest increase for fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004. We are expecting high single digit to low teen revenue growth for our domestic direct merchant channel during fiscal 2006. 20 Table of Contents Our Canadian transactions processed for fiscal 2005 remained steady compared to the prior year, with growth in credit card processing revenue offset by a decrease in debit card processing revenue. Our average ticket declined slightly, primarily due to our decision to exit from our Air Canada contracts. Repricing initiatives generated a mid-single digit increase in our spread. We expect mid to high single digit revenue growth in Canada during fiscal 2006. Our European transactions grew more than 20% during fiscal 2005, largely due to strong market growth in the Central and Eastern European region. During fiscal 2005, we expanded operations into Bulgaria, Poland, Romania, Russia, and Slovakia. We expect European revenue growth in the mid single digit to low double digit range for fiscal 2006, due to strong industry growth, partially offset by the expected deconversion of a large customer. These revenue growth factors were partially offset by continued and expected high-teen declines in our domestic indirect channel. These declines are attributed to the industry consolidation of financial institutions and competitive pricing pressures. Money transfer Consumer-to-consumer money transfer revenue is primarily driven by transaction levels and unit pricing. Our consumer-to-consumer money transfer transactions processed for the year experienced greater than 20% growth over annualized prior year processing. Continued industry growth and the addition of new U.S. originating branch locations, including locations added through acquisition, also contributed to DolEx transaction volume growth. In addition, the December 2004 acquisition of Europhil contributed an additional $5.0 million in revenue in fiscal 2005. Our business strategy is to competitively price our money transfer services, which we believe will further expand our customer base and increase our market share. Further, our use of fixed-cost employees rather than variable-cost agents at the originating point of sale enhances this strategy, as higher transaction levels will provide enhanced future leverage. For fiscal 2006, we anticipate that our DolEx-branded revenue will expand in the low to mid teens compared to fiscal 2005. Operating expenses Cost of service increased by $47.9 million, or 16.6%, to $337.3 million in fiscal 2005 from $289.4 million in fiscal 2004. As a percentage of revenue, cost of service decreased to 43.0% in fiscal 2005 from 46.0% in the prior year. This decrease in cost of service as a percentage of revenue is primarily due to the integration of our acquisitions, ongoing consolidation strategy, other cost reduction initiatives, and the achievement of greater economies of scale. The increase in the cost of service expense is primarily attributable to the operating expenses and intangible asset amortization relating to businesses acquired in fiscal 2005 and late fiscal 2004. Sales, general and administrative expenses increased by $65.8 million, or 30.3%, to $283.2 million in fiscal 2005 from $217.4 million in the prior year. As a percentage of revenue, these expenses increased to 36.1% for fiscal 2005 compared to 34.5% for fiscal 2004. The increase in sales, general and administrative expenses and the increase in such expenses as a percentage of revenue are primarily due to growth in commission payments to ISOs resulting from the increased revenue in this sales channel. The ISO business generally produces lower margins than the other direct business due to the ongoing commission payments to the ISOs. This commission model differs from our other sales channels where the commissions are paid for a finite period. In addition, these increases are also attributed to ongoing investments made in our direct sales channels, business development costs, and additional sales, general and administrative expenses inherited in connection with our recent acquisitions. Restructuring and other charges Fiscal 2005 During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company, consistent with its strategy to leverage infrastructure and consolidate operations, committed to plans to close a location and consolidate its and other functions into 21 Table of Contents existing locations. These restructuring plans required associated management and staff reductions and will require contract termination and related facility closure costs in connection with an operating lease at one location during fiscal 2006. The Company expects to complete the plans by the third quarter of fiscal 2006. We recorded restructuring charges of $0.8 million in fiscal 2005 and expect to incur approximately $3.0 million in fiscal 2006 in connection with these plans. The fiscal 2005 charge was partially offset by a $0.4 million reduction to expenses arising from the favorable resolution of certain restructuring items related to the fiscal 2003 restructuring plans described below. In addition, the Company recognized other charges of $3.3 million in connection with the termination of an executive officer, including $2.7 million related to acceleration of options, under his employment agreement Fiscal 2004 During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003, we announced the closure and consolidation of three operating facilities and their related functions into existing operating centers. We implemented the plan in April 2003 and completed it in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004. Our facility closure plan included the following: closing our Cleveland location which housed our merchant settlement function and consolidating it into our Baltimore facility; relocating our terminal deployment and related services from our Winston-Salem facility to our Baltimore and St. Louis facilities; and closing our Salt Lake City check operating facility and relocating to our primary check operating facility in Niles, Illinois. In addition to these activities, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, we incurred restructuring costs of $2.7 million associated with the termination and position elimination of an executive officer. Total costs and expenses associated with these activities for fiscal 2004 and 2003 were approximately $10.9 million. One-time employee termination benefits were approximately $8.4 million and the balance relates to contract termination and other related facility closure costs and expenses. In fiscal 2004, we recognized net restructuring and other charges of $9.6 million. See Note 10 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Operating income Operating income increased $47.2 million or 41.8% to $160.1 million for fiscal 2005 compared to $112.9 million in the prior fiscal year. This resulted in an operating margin of 20.4% for fiscal 2005 compared to 17.9% for fiscal 2004. This increase in operating income and related margin increase includes restructuring and other charges of $3.7 million or 0.5% of revenue and $9.6 million or 1.5% of revenue in fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004, respectively. The changes in operating income and operating margins are primarily due to the revenue growth factors and benefits from acquisition integration and other cost factors described further above. We anticipate an operating income margin ranging from 21.3% to 21.8% for fiscal 2006, excluding the effect of future restructuring charges. Other income/expense Other income/expense increased as a net expense by $2.0 million or 48.4% to $6.2 million for fiscal 2005 compared to $4.2 million in the prior fiscal year. This increase is primarily due to increased interest expense in connection with a full year of interest expense associated with the DolEx acquisition borrowings and a rising interest rate environment. During fiscal 2006, we expect to incur net interest and other expense between $2.5 million and $3.5 million. 22 Table of Contents Minority interest Minority interest, net of tax benefit allocated to minority interest in a taxable entity, decreased $0.8 million, or 10.0% to $7.7 million for fiscal 2005 compared to $8.5 million in the prior fiscal year. This decrease is due to the elimination of the minority shareholder interest in the Cash & Win product and the reduction in minority interest relating to our successful MUZO tender offer in fiscal 2004. For fiscal 2006, we are expecting minority interest, net of tax benefit allocated to minority interest in a taxable entity, to be between $8.0 million and $9.5 million. Net income Net income increased $30.5 million or 48.8% to $92.9 million in fiscal 2005 from $62.4 million in the prior fiscal year, resulting in a $0.73 increase in diluted earnings per share to $2.33 in fiscal 2005 from $1.60 in the prior fiscal year. This increase in net income and diluted earnings per share includes restructuring charges of $2.4 million, net of tax, or $0.06 diluted earnings per share and $6.0 million, net of tax, or $0.16 diluted earnings per share, in fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004, respectively. In fiscal 2005, our tax rate, reflected as the provision for income taxes divided by income before income tax and minority interest, decreased to 34.66% from 34.73% in fiscal 2004. For fiscal 2006, we anticipate lowering this tax rate to 34.10% from 34.66% in fiscal 2005. The changes in our effective tax rate are due to tax planning initiatives and the impact of international growth, primarily in European markets where statutory rates are lower than U.S. rates. See Note 7 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We expect diluted earnings per share to range from $2.67 to $2.79 for fiscal 2006, excluding the impact of future restructuring charges and the previously announced stock split discussed in Item 1 of this report. Fiscal Year Ended May 31, 2004 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended May 31, 2003 Revenues In fiscal 2004, revenue increased $113.2 million, or 22%, to $629.3 million from $516.1 million in the prior year comparable period. We attribute this revenue growth primarily to increases in our domestic direct merchant services offering and acquisitions closed in fiscal 2004. The Company service offering revenues from external customers are as follows (dollars in millions): Fiscal Year Ended May 31, 2004 2003 % Change Merchant services $ 579.4 $ 508.0 14 % Money transfer 49.9 8.1 516 % $ 629.3 $ 516.1 22 % Merchant services Our merchant services offering revenue increased 14% in fiscal 2004. This revenue growth includes $10.2 million in revenue from the MUZO acquisition. We experienced continued growth in our domestic direct merchant channel by continuing to sign mid-market merchants in various vertical markets to maintain our diversification. The increase in revenue reflects high-teen transaction growth in our domestic direct card merchant channel, primarily driven by increases in our ISO sales channel. We believe this transaction growth compares favorably with industry trends. According to The Nilson Report dated February 2004, industry growth averaged 12%. Our domestic average dollar value of transaction, or average ticket, remained stable and we experienced an increase in our domestic average discount revenue per dollar value volume, or spread, for fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003. Our Canadian transactions processed for fiscal 2004 grew in the low to mid-single digits compared to the prior year. This reflects the impact of the recent removal from our portfolio of certain lower margin, higher risk merchants, such as airlines and travel agencies. The average ticket and spread in Canada declined in fiscal 2004 23 Table of Contents compared to the prior year. The declines in average ticket and spread are primarily due to the recent mix of merchant signings, such as the addition of petroleum and grocery retailers, partially offset by the strategic removal of certain lower margin, higher risk merchants. The decline in Canadian revenue was more than offset by a stronger year-over-year Canadian currency exchange rate. These revenue growth factors were partially offset by continued and expected high-teen declines in our domestic indirect channel. These declines are attributed to the industry consolidation of financial institutions and competitive pricing pressures. Money transfer Our revenue growth from the money transfer offering in fiscal 2004 includes an additional $42.5 million relating to our DolEx acquisition completed on November 12, 2003. The consumer-to-consumer money transfer service offering revenue is primarily driven by transaction levels and unit pricing. Consumer-to-consumer money transfer transactions for the year experienced double-digit growth, primarily due to continued industry growth, additional U.S. originating branch locations, and a more competitive unit pricing strategy compared to the prior year. Operating expenses Cost of service increased by $29.1 million, or 11%, to $289.4 million in fiscal 2004 from $260.3 million in fiscal 2003. As a percentage of revenue, cost of service decreased to 46% in fiscal 2004 from 50% in the prior year. This decrease in cost of service as a percentage of revenue is primarily due to the integration of our acquisitions, other cost reduction initiatives, and the achievement of a greater economy of scale with our operating expenses. The increase in the cost of service expense is primarily attributable to the increased operating expenses and acquired intangible asset amortization through our recent acquisitions. Sales, general and administrative expenses increased by $56.1 million or 35% to $217.4 million in fiscal 2004 from $161.3 million in the prior year. As a percentage of revenue, these expenses increased to 35% for fiscal 2004 compared to 31% for fiscal 2003. The increase in sales, general and administrative expenses and the increase in such expenses as a percentage of revenue are primarily due to growth in commission payments to ISOs resulting from the increased revenue in this sales channel. The ISO business generally produces lower margins than the other direct business due to the ongoing commission payments to the ISOs. This commission model differs from our other sales channels where the commissions are paid for a finite period. In addition, these increases are attributed to ongoing investments made in our direct sales channels, business development costs, and additional sales, general and administrative expenses inherited in connection with our recent acquisitions. Operating income Operating income increased $19.6 million or 21% to $112.9 million for fiscal 2004 compared to $93.3 million in the prior fiscal year. This resulted in an operating margin of 17.9% for fiscal 2004 compared to 18.1% for fiscal 2003. This increase in operating income and related margin decrease includes restructuring and other charges of $9.6 million or 1.5% of revenue and $1.3 million or 0.2% of revenue in fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003, respectively. The changes in operating income and operating margins are primarily due to the revenue growth factors and benefits from acquisition integration and other cost factors described further above. These improvements are partially offset by the impact of restructuring and other charges. Other income/expense Other income/expense increased as a net expense by $1.1 million to $4.2 million for fiscal 2004 compared to $3.1 million in the prior fiscal year. The increase is due to increased interest expense related to additional 24 Table of Contents borrowing in the second half of fiscal 2004 used to finance our acquisitions. The increases in other expenses were partially offset by a gain of approximately $0.6 million from the sale of stock in an unrelated public company included in interest and other income. Global Payments initially received these shares in partial consideration for the sale of a business in June 2000. Minority interest Minority interest, net of tax benefit allocated to minority interest in a taxable entity, increased $3.5 million resulting from the minority interest in earnings of MUZO (of which we owned 52.6% from the initial acquisition date until May 14, 2004) and increases in earnings from our existing alliance with Comerica Bank in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003. Net income Net income increased $9.1 million, or 17%, to $62.4 million in fiscal 2004 from $53.3 million in the prior year, resulting in a $0.19 increase in diluted earnings per share to $1.60 in fiscal 2004 from $1.41 in the prior fiscal year. This increase in net income and diluted earnings per share includes restructuring and other charges of $6.0 million, net of tax, or $0.16 diluted earnings per share and $0.8 million, net of tax, or $0.02 diluted earnings per share, in fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003, respectively. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash flow generated from operations provides us with a significant source of liquidity to meet our needs. At May 31, 2005, we had cash and cash equivalents totaling $49.0 million. Net cash provided by operating activities increased $137.4 million to $229.6 million in fiscal 2005 from $92.2 million in fiscal 2004. The increase in cash flow from operations was primarily due to the increase in net income and the decrease in settlement processing assets resulting from timing differences. These timing differences are primarily due to the fluctuations in volume, the net funding with our member sponsors regarding of credit and debit card sales volume funded to merchants and the settlement received from the card associations and debit networks. See Settlement processing assets/obligations under Note 1 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details. Net cash used in investing activities decreased $81.7 million to $65.1 million in fiscal 2005 from $146.8 million in fiscal 2004 due to the reduction in business acquisition activities in fiscal 2005. Capital expenditures increased $9.7 million to $34.3 million in fiscal 2005 from $24.6 million in fiscal 2004 due to investments in software, infrastructure and Canadian merchant terminals. In fiscal 2006, we expect approximately $25 million to $35 million in total capital spending primarily to invest in ongoing capital for acquired businesses, as well as systems development and hardware relating to our next generation front-end processing system, which we anticipate will be completed over the next two years. In fiscal 2005, $152.4 million, net was used in financing activities compared to $50.1 million, net provided by financing activities in fiscal 2004. This change was primarily due to our use of cash from operations to repay fiscal 2004 borrowings under our credit facilities, which were used to finance business acquisitions. We believe that our current level of cash and borrowing capacity under our committed lines of credit described below, together with future cash flows from operations, are sufficient to meet the needs of our existing operations and planned requirements for the foreseeable future. As of May 31, 2005, we do not have any material capital commitments, other than commitments under capital and operating leases or planned expansions see Commitments and Contractual Obligations below for more details. 25 Table of Contents We regularly evaluate cash requirements for current operations, commitments, development activities and acquisitions and we may elect to raise additional funds for these purposes in the future, either through the issuance of debt, equity or otherwise. Our cash flow strategy has remained unchanged and is to first pay off debt, second, to continue to make capital investments in our business and third, to pursue acquisitions that meet our growth strategies. Credit Facilities On November 25, 2003, we entered into a three-year, $350 million revolving credit facility agreement with a syndicate of U.S. banks. The credit agreement contains certain financial and non-financial covenants and events of default customary for financings of this nature. The facility expires in November 2006 and has a variable interest rate based on a market short-term floating rate plus a margin that varies according to our leverage position. In addition, the facility allows us to expand the facility size to $500 million by requesting additional commitments from existing or new lenders. We plan to use the credit facility to fund future strategic acquisitions and to provide a source of working capital for general corporate purposes. This agreement replaces our prior credit facilities with U.S. banks, which had an aggregate capacity of $150 million. As of May 31, 2005 and 2004, we had $50 million and $122 million, respectively, outstanding on our U.S. credit facilities. On November 23, 2004, we entered into a 364-day, amended and restated credit facility, with the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce ( CIBC ) as administrative agent, and a syndicate of U.S. banks, which we refer to as our Canadian Credit Facility. This $175 million Canadian, or approximately $139 million U.S. based on exchange rates existing on May 31, 2005, Canadian Credit Facility replaced the previous credit facility with CIBC, which provided working capital that allowed us to provide certain Canadian merchants with same day value for their VISA credit card deposits. Same day value is the practice of giving merchants value for credit card transactions on the date of the applicable sale, even though we receive the corresponding settlement funds from VISA Canada/International at a later date. The amounts borrowed under the Canadian Credit Facility are restricted in use to pay Canadian VISA merchants and such amounts are generally received from VISA Canada/International on the following day. CIBC currently owns approximately 15% of our outstanding common stock. The Canadian Credit Facility consists of two components: (i) a revolving line of credit of up to $100 million Canadian, or approximately $80 million U.S. based on exchange rates existing on May 31, 2005, which is provided by a syndicate of U.S. banks and which we refer to as the Tranche A Loans and (ii) a revolving line of credit of up to $75 million Canadian, or approximately $60 million U.S. based on exchange rates existing on May 31, 2005, which is provided by CIBC and which we refer to as the Tranche B Loans. The Canadian Credit Facility also contains an additional overdraft facility available to cover larger advances during periods of peak credit card usage. The Tranche A Loans bear interest at a variable rate based on the U.S. dollar Prime Rate, Canadian dollar LIBOR or U.S. dollar LIBOR, and the Tranche B Loans bear interest at a variable rate based on the CIBC Offered Rate (an overnight rate in Canadian dollars), Canadian dollar LIBOR, or the Canadian dollar Prime Rate. Our obligations under the Canadian Credit Facility are secured by a first priority security interest in the members accounts receivable from VISA Canada/International for our transactions processed through the CIBC VISA BIN, and the bank accounts in which the settlement funds are deposited, and by guarantees from certain of our subsidiaries. These guarantees are subordinate to any guarantees granted by such subsidiaries under our U.S. credit facility. The Canadian Credit Facility also contains certain financial and non-financial covenants and events of default customary for financings of this nature. The Canadian Credit Facility is scheduled to expire on November 18, 2005, and can be renewed for up to two consecutive 364-day periods at the option of all parties. We plan to seek renewal of the Canadian Credit Facility, but in the event we are unable to do so, we believe we can meet our capital requirements under our U.S. credit facility. At May 31, 2005 and 2004, there was $10.8 million and $113.2 million (Canadian) outstanding on this credit facility, or approximately $8.6 million and $83.1 million (U.S.), respectively, based on exchange rates in effect on such dates. 26 Table of Contents Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby we have financial guarantees, subordinated retained interest, derivative instruments, or other contingent arrangements that expose us to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities, or other obligations under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides us with financing, liquidity, market, or credit risk support other than the guarantee products described under Application of Critical Accounting Policies below. Commitments and Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments as of May 31, 2005: Contractual Obligation Payments Due by Period Total Less than 1 Year 2-3 Years 4-5 Years 6+ Years Line of credit $ 50,000 $ 50,000 $ $ $ Line of credit with related party 8,606 8,606 Notes payable (principal only) (Note 8) 1,347 1,347 Capital lease obligations (Note 12) 2,627 1,857 770 Operating leases (Note 12) 70,565 17,759 26,361 18,104 8,341 $ 133,145 $ 79,569 $ 27,131 $ 18,104 $ 8,341 Note: This table excludes other obligations that we may have, such as employee benefit plan obligations, and other current and long-term liabilities reflected in our consolidated balance sheets. We do not have any material purchase commitments as of May 31, 2005. We believe that cash flows from operations and borrowing programs will provide adequate sources of liquidity and capital resources to meet our expected long-term needs for the operation of our business and the satisfaction of these obligations and commitments. Application of Critical Accounting Policies In applying the accounting policies that we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements, we necessarily make accounting estimates that affect our reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Some of these accounting estimates require us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time we make the accounting estimates. We base these assumptions and the resulting estimates on historical information and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, and we evaluate these assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis, however, in many instances we reasonably could have used different accounting estimates, and in other instances changes in our accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, with the result in each case being a material change in the financial statement presentation of our financial condition or results of operations. We refer to accounting estimates of this type as critical accounting estimates. The critical accounting estimates that we discuss below are those that we believe are most important to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements. Accounting estimates necessarily require subjective determinations about future events and conditions. Therefore, the following descriptions of critical accounting estimates are forward-looking statements, and actual results could differ materially from the results anticipated by these forward-looking statements. You should read the following in conjunction with Note 1 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and Risk Factors contained in Exhibit 99.1 to this annual report. Reserve for operating losses We process credit card transactions for direct merchants and recognize revenue based on a percentage of the gross amount charged. Our direct merchant customers have the liability for 27 Table of Contents any charges properly reversed by the cardholder. In the event, however, that we are not able to collect such amount from the merchants, due to merchant fraud, insolvency, bankruptcy or any other reason, we may be liable for any such reversed charges. We require cash deposits, guarantees, letters of credit and other types of collateral by certain merchants to minimize any such contingent liability, and we also utilize a number of systems and procedures to manage merchant risk. We have, however, historically experienced losses due to merchant defaults. During fiscal 2003, we adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 45: Guarantor Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others referred to as FIN 45, which requires all guarantees be recorded at their fair value at inception. We believe our potential liability for the full amount of the charge is a guarantee under FIN 45. We estimate the fair value of the guarantees by including a fair value margin to our estimate of operational losses. This estimate of operating losses is comprised of known losses and a historical analysis based on a percentage of credit card sales volumes processed. This estimation process has been materially accurate historically. The adoption of FIN 45 did not have a material impact on the liability, as the operating loss estimate materially approximated the fair value estimate at the time of adoption. As of May 31, 2005 and 2004, $4.2 million and $6.5 million, respectively, has been recorded for guarantees associated with merchant card processing and is included in settlement processing obligations in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The expense associated with the valuation allowance is included in cost of service in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. Expenses of $9.1 million, $12.5 million, and $15.6 million were recorded for fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, for these losses. We also have a check guarantee business. Similar to the credit card business, we charge our merchants a percentage of the gross amount of the check and guarantee payment of the check to the merchant in the event the check is not honored by the checkwriter bank. We have the right to collect the full amount of the check from the checkwriter but have not historically recovered 100% of the guaranteed checks. Our check guarantee reserve is based on historical and projected loss experiences. As of May 31, 2005 and 2004, we had a check guarantee reserve of $4.0 million and $4.3 million, respectively, which is included in claims receivable, net, in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Expenses of $13.0 million, $12.0 million, and $10.4 million were recorded for fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, for these losses and are included in cost of service in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. The estimated check returns and recovery amounts are subject to the risk that actual amounts returned and recovered in the future may differ significantly from estimates used in calculating the valuation allowance. In addition, we defer the revenue representing the fair value of the guarantee, until the guarantee is satisfied. Goodwill and long-lived asset valuations We regularly evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the carrying amounts of goodwill, property and equipment, and other intangible assets may warrant revision or may not be recoverable. Goodwill and other indefinite-life intangible assets are evaluated for impairment by applying a fair value based test. Property and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment when facts and circumstances indicate the carrying value of such assets may exceed their fair values. When factors indicate that these long-lived assets should be evaluated for possible impairment, we assess the potential impairment by determining whether the carrying value of such long-lived assets will be recovered through the future undiscounted cash flows expected from use of the asset and its eventual disposition. In our opinion, the long-lived assets, including goodwill, property and equipment, and other intangible assets are appropriately valued at May 31, 2005 and May 31, 2004. 28 Table of Contents
