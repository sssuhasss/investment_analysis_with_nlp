Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The terms "Company", "we", "our" and "us" as used in this Form 10-K refer to Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. and its subsidiaries. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K. Overview The following factors, among others, could cause actual results and future events to differ from those set forth or contemplated in the forward-looking statements: Changes in general economic conditions or in the real estate and life science industries; Risks and uncertainties related to how successful our tenants are in discovering, developing, making or selling their products and technologies; Potential liability for damages resulting from our tenant's use of hazardous materials; Adverse changes in the annual appropriations received by our government tenants; Economic conditions in our markets could adversely affect our business; Loss of a tenant could have a negative impact on our business; We may have difficulty managing our growth; Our debt service obligations may have adverse consequences on our business operations; Our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan restrict our ability to engage in some business activities; Ability to obtain additional capital to further our business objectives; Difficulties in identifying properties for acquisition or operating them successfully; Risks associated with completing developments and redevelopments; Our failure to qualify and maintain our status as a real estate investment trust under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986; Losses in excess of our insurance coverage; Environmental uncertainties; Failure to comply with laws, including the Americans with Disabilities Act and similar laws; and Ability to retain our senior executives. Our success also depends upon economic trends generally and various market conditions. We caution you not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which reflect our analysis only and speak as of the date of this report or, if different, as of the dates indicated in the statements. We assume no obligation to update or supplement forward-looking statements. We are a publicly-traded real estate investment trust focused primarily on the ownership, operation, management, acquisition, expansion and selective redevelopment and development of high quality, strategically located properties containing office/laboratory space leased principally to tenants in the life science industry. We refer to these properties as "life science properties". In 2004, we: Acquired 23 properties with an aggregate of approximately 1,630,000 rentable square feet. In addition, we completed the development of a property with an aggregate of approximately 104,000 rentable square feet. Expanded our unsecured line of credit from $440 million to $500 million and extended its term to December 2007, which may be further extended at our sole option for an additional one-year period. Expanded our unsecured term loan from $150 million to $250 million and extended its term to December 2009. Sold one property with approximately 42,000 rentable square feet. Completed a public offering of 5,185,500 shares of our 8.375% Series C cumulative redeemable preferred stock ("Series C preferred stock"). Redeemed all of the outstanding shares of our 9.50% Series A cumulative preferred stock with proceeds from the Series C preferred stock offering. Our primary source of revenue is rental income and tenant recoveries from leases at the properties we own. Of the 112 properties we owned as of December 31, 2004, four were acquired in 1994, nine in 1996, nine in 1997, 26 in 1998, six in 1999, 11 in 2000, five in 2001, four in 2002, four in 2003 (the "2003 Properties") and 23 in 2004. In addition, we completed the development of one property in 1999, five properties in 2000 (together with the 11 properties acquired in 2000, the "2000 Properties"), two properties in 2001 (together with the five properties acquired in 2001, the "2001 Properties"), two properties in 2002 (together with the four properties acquired in 2002, the "2002 Properties") and one property in 2004 (together with the 23 properties acquired in 2004, the "2004 Properties"). As a result of these acquisition and development activities, as well as our ongoing leasing and redevelopment activities, there have been significant increases in total revenues and expenses, including significant increases in total revenues and expenses for 2004 as compared to 2003, and for 2003 as compared to 2002. Critical Accounting Policies Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"). Our significant accounting policies are described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. The preparation of these financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. We base these estimates, judgments and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. REIT Compliance We have elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust ("REIT") under the Internal Revenue Code. Qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the Internal Revenue Code to our operations and financial results, and the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control. We believe that our current organization and method of operation comply with the rules and regulations promulgated under the Internal Revenue Code to enable us to qualify, and continue to qualify, as a REIT. However, it is possible that we have been organized or have operated in a manner that would not allow us to qualify as a REIT, or that our future operations could cause us to fail to qualify. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, then we will be required to pay federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on our taxable income at regular corporate rates. If we lose our REIT status, then our net earnings available for investment or distribution to stockholders would be significantly reduced for each of the years involved and we would no longer be required to make distributions to our stockholders. Rental Properties and Properties Under Development In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141, "Business Combinations", we perform the following procedures when making an allocation of the purchase price of real estate: (1) estimate the value of the real estate as of the acquisition date on an "as if vacant" basis; (2) allocate the "as if vacant" value among land, land improvements, buildings, building improvements, tenant improvements and equipment; (3) calculate the value of the intangibles as the difference between the "as if vacant" value and the purchase price; and (4) allocate the intangible value to above, below and at market leases, origination costs associated with in-place leases, tenant relationships and other intangible assets. The values allocated to land improvements, buildings, building improvements, tenant improvements and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis using an estimated life of 20 years for land improvements, 40 years for buildings and building improvements, the respective lease term for tenant improvements and the estimated useful life for equipment. The values of above and below market leases are amortized over the life of the related lease and recorded as either an increase (for below market leases) or a decrease (for above market leases) to rental income. The values of at-market leases and origination costs are classified as leasing costs, included in other assets on our balance sheets and amortized over the remaining life of the lease. Rental properties and properties under development are individually evaluated for impairment when conditions exist which may indicate that it is probable that the sum of expected future undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the property. Upon determination that impairment has occurred, a write-down is recorded to reduce the carrying amount of the property to its estimated fair value. Capitalization of Costs In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 34, "Capitalization of Interest Cost" ("SFAS 34") and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 67, "Accounting for Costs and Initial Rental Operations of Real Estate Projects" ("SFAS 67"), we capitalize direct construction and development costs, including predevelopment costs, interest, property taxes, insurance and other costs directly related and essential to the acquisition, development or construction of a project. Pursuant to SFAS 34 and SFAS 67, capitalization of construction and development costs is required while activities are ongoing to prepare an asset for its intended use. Costs incurred after a project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use are expensed as incurred. Costs previously capitalized related to abandoned acquisition or development opportunities are written-off. Should development activity cease, a portion of interest, property taxes, insurance and certain costs would no longer be eligible for capitalization, and would be expensed as incurred. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. We also capitalize costs directly related and essential to our leasing activities. These costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the related leases. Costs that were previously capitalized and which related to unsuccessful leasing opportunities are written-off. Accounting for Investments We hold equity investments in certain publicly-traded companies and privately held entities primarily involved in the life science industry. All of our investments in publicly-traded companies are considered "available for sale" in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities" ("SFAS 115"), and are recorded at fair value. Fair value has been determined as the closing trading price at the balance sheet date, with unrealized gains and losses shown as a separate component of stockholders' equity. The classification of investments under SFAS 115 is determined at the time each investment is made, and such determination is reevaluated at each balance sheet date. The cost of investments sold is determined by the specific identification method, with net realized gains included in other income. Investments in privately held entities are generally accounted for under the cost method because we do not influence any operating or financial policies of the entities in which we invest. Certain investments are accounted for under the equity method in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 18, "The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock" and Emerging Issues Task Force Topic D-46, "Accounting for Limited Partnership Investments". Under the equity method of accounting, we record our investment initially at cost and adjust the carrying amount of the investment to recognize our share of the earnings or losses of the investee subsequent to the date of our investment. For all of our investments, if a decline in the fair value of an investment below its carrying value is determined to be other than temporary, such investment is written-down to its estimated fair value with a non-cash charge to current earnings. The factors that we consider in making these assessments include, but are not limited to, market prices, market conditions, financial condition, prospects for favorable or unfavorable clinical trial results, new product initiatives and/or sales, and new collaborative agreements. Interest Rate Swap Agreements We utilize interest rate swap agreements to hedge a portion of our exposure to variable interest rates associated with our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan. These agreements involve an exchange of fixed and floating interest payments without the exchange of the underlying principal amount (the "notional amount"). Interest received under all of our swap agreements is based on the one-month LIBOR rate. The net difference between the interest paid and the interest received is reflected as an adjustment to interest expense. We reflect our interest rate swap agreements on the balance sheet at their estimated fair values. We use a variety of methods and assumptions based on market conditions and risks existing at each balance sheet date to determine the fair values of our interest rate swap agreements. These methods of assessing fair value result in a general approximation of value, and such value may never be realized. All of our interest rate swap agreements meet the criteria to be deemed "highly effective" under the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" in reducing our exposure to variable interest rates. Accordingly, we have categorized these instruments as cash flow hedges. While we intend to continue to meet the conditions for such hedge accounting, if hedges did not qualify as "highly effective", the changes in the fair value of the derivatives used as hedges would be reflected in earnings. We do not believe we are exposed to more than a nominal amount of credit risk in our interest rate swap agreements as our counterparties are established, well-capitalized financial institutions. Recognition of Rental Income Rental income from leases with scheduled rent increases, free rent and other rent adjustments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the respective lease terms. We include amounts currently recognized as income, and expected to be received in later years, in deferred rent in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Amounts received currently, but recognized as income in future years, are included as unearned rent in accounts payable, accrued expenses and tenant security deposits in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Tenant recoveries related to reimbursement of real estate taxes, insurance, repairs and maintenance, and other operating expenses are recognized as revenue in the period the applicable expenses are incurred. We maintain an allowance for estimated losses that may result from the inability of our tenants to make required payments. If a tenant fails to make contractual payments beyond any allowance, we may recognize additional bad debt expense in future periods equal to the amount of unpaid rent and deferred rent. Discontinued Operations We follow the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets" in determining whether a property qualifies as an asset "held for sale" and should be classified as "discontinued operations". A property is classified as "held for sale" when all of the following criteria for a plan of sale have been met: (1) management, having the authority to approve the action, commits to a plan to sell the property; (2) the property is available for immediate sale in its present condition, subject only to the terms that are usual and customary; (3) an active program to locate a buyer, and other actions required to complete the plan to sell, have been initiated; (4) the sale of the property is probable and is expected to be completed within one year; (5) the property is being actively marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value; and (6) actions necessary to complete the plan of sale indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn. When all of these criteria have been met, the property is classified as "held for sale" and its operations are classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of income. When a property is designated as "held for sale", amounts for all prior periods presented are reclassified from continuing operations to discontinued operations. A loss is recognized for any initial adjustment of the asset's carrying amount to fair value less costs to sell in the period the asset qualifies as "held for sale". Depreciation of assets is discontinued commencing on the date they are designated as "held for sale". Results of Operations Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2004 to the Year Ended December 31, 2003 Rental revenues increased by $17.5 million, or 14%, to $143.9 million for 2004 compared to $126.4 million for 2003. The increase resulted primarily from the 2003 Properties being owned for a full year and the addition of the 2004 Properties. Rental revenues from properties operating for a full year during 2004 and 2003 (the "2004 Same Properties") increased by $2.2 million, or 2.2%, primarily due to increases in rental rates and a slight increase in occupancy. The average occupancy level of the 2004 Same Properties was 97.1% as of December 31, 2004, compared to 96.6% as of December 31, 2003. Tenant recoveries increased by $3.8 million, or 12%, to $35.9 million for 2004 compared to $32.1 million for 2003. The increase resulted primarily from the 2003 Properties being owned for a full year and the addition of the 2004 Properties. Tenant recoveries for the 2004 Same Properties increased by $575,000, or 2.3%, primarily due to increases in certain recoverable operating expenses during 2004. Other income increased by $1.5 million, or 71%, to $3.5 million for 2004 compared to $2.1 million for 2003, primarily due to an increase in realized gains on investments and from a general increase in miscellaneous sources of income. Rental operating expenses increased by $5.6 million, or 17%, to $38.4 million for 2004 compared to $32.8 million for 2003. The increase resulted primarily from the 2003 Properties being owned for a full year and the addition of the 2004 Properties. Operating expenses for the 2004 Same Properties increased by $398,000, or 1.6%, primarily due to increases in salaries for property engineers, property taxes and repair and maintenance expenses offset slightly by a decrease in property insurance expenses (substantially all of which are recoverable from our tenants through tenant recoveries). General and administrative expenses increased by $894,000, or 6%, to $15.1 million for 2004 compared to $14.2 million for 2003, mainly due to compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, Operation Outreach and general increases in administrative costs. Our Operation Outreach program provides financial assistance to families of activated and deployed soldiers that faced significant financial challenges and had significant financial needs. Interest expense increased by $2.3 million, or 9%, to $28.7 million for 2004 compared to $26.4 million for 2003. The increase resulted primarily from increases in indebtedness on our unsecured line of credit, unsecured term loan and secured notes payable, and to increases in the floating interest rates on our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan. These borrowings were utilized to finance the acquisition of the 2003 and 2004 Properties, and the development and redevelopment of properties. The weighted average effective interest rate on these borrowings (not including the effect of interest rate swap agreements) increased from 2.64% as of December 31, 2003 to 3.72% as of December 31, 2004. We have entered into certain swap agreements to hedge a portion of exposure to variable interest rates with our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan (see "Liquidity and Capital Resources - Unsecured Line of Credit and Unsecured Term Loan"). Depreciation and amortization increased by $3.9 million, or 10%, to $42.5 million for 2004 compared to $38.6 million for 2003. The increase resulted primarily from depreciation associated with the 2003 Properties being owned for a full year and the addition of the 2004 Properties. Income from discontinued operations of $1.6 million for 2004 reflects the results of operations of one property that was designated as "held for sale" as of December 31, 2003. In connection with this sale, we recorded a gain of approximately $1.6 million during 2004. Income from discontinued operations of $11.1 million for 2003 reflects the results of operations of three properties that were designated as "held for sale" as of December 31, 2002. In connection with the sale of these properties, we recorded a net gain of approximately $8.3 million during 2003. Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2003 to the Year Ended December 31, 2002 Rental revenues increased by $14.7 million, or 13%, to $126.4 million for 2003 compared to $111.7 million for 2002. The increase resulted primarily from the 2002 Properties being owned for a full year and the addition of the 2003 Properties. Rental revenues from properties operating for a full year during 2003 and 2002 (the "2003 Same Properties") increased by $1.7 million, or 2.1%, due to increases in rental rates and offset by a slight decrease in occupancy. The average occupancy level of the 2003 Same Properties was 96.7% as of December 31, 2003, compared to 97.2% as of December 31, 2002. Tenant recoveries increased by $3.1 million, or 11%, to $32.1 million for 2003 compared to $29.0 million for 2002. The increase resulted primarily from the 2002 Properties being owned for a full year and the addition of the 2003 Properties. Tenant recoveries for the 2003 Same Properties increased by $659,000, or 2.9%, primarily due to increases in certain recoverable operating expenses. Other income increased by $511,000, or 33%, to $2.1 million for 2003 compared to $1.6 million for 2002, primarily due to an increase in realized gains on investments and from a general increase in miscellaneous sources of income. Rental operating expenses increased by $3.7 million, or 13%, to $32.8 million for 2003 compared to $29.1 million for 2002. The increase resulted primarily from the 2002 Properties being owned for a full year and the addition of the 2003 Properties. Operating expenses for the 2003 Same Properties increased by $871,000, or 4.1%, primarily due to an increase in property insurance and property taxes (substantially all of which are recoverable from our tenants through tenant recoveries). General and administrative expenses increased by $775,000, or 6%, to $14.2 million for 2003 compared to $13.4 million for 2002, mainly due to general increases in administrative costs, primarily payroll and related expenses. Interest expense increased by $1.4 million, or 6%, to $26.4 million for 2003 compared to $25.0 million for 2002. The increase resulted primarily from an increase in indebtedness on our unsecured line of credit, unsecured term loan and secured notes payable. These borrowings were utilized to finance the acquisition of the 2002 and 2003 Properties and the development and redevelopment of properties. The increase in interest expense was partially offset by a decrease in the floating interest rate on our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan. The weighted average effective interest rate on these borrowings (not including the effect of interest rate swap agreements) decreased from 3.07% as of December 31, 2002 to 2.64% as of December 31, 2003. We have entered into certain swap agreements to hedge a portion of exposure to variable interest rates with our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan (see "Liquidity and Capital Resources - Unsecured Line of Credit and Unsecured Term Loan"). Depreciation and amortization increased by $5.7 million, or 17%, to $38.6 million for 2003 compared to $32.9 million for 2002. The increase resulted primarily from depreciation associated with the 2002 Properties being owned for a full year and the addition of the 2003 Properties. Income from discontinued operations of $11.1 million for 2003 reflects the results of operations of three properties that were designated as "held for sale" as of December 31, 2002. In connection with the sale of these properties, we recorded a net gain of approximately $8.3 million during 2003. Income from discontinued operations of $1.8 million for 2002 reflects the results of operations of four properties that have been designated as "held for sale". In connection with these prospective sales, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $1,150,000 related to a property in the San Francisco Bay market that could not be redeveloped pursuant to its original strategic objectives. This charge has been included in income from discontinued operations for 2002. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flows Net cash provided by operating activities for 2004 decreased by $7.1 million to $67.8 million compared to $74.8 million for 2003. An increase in cash flows from our portfolio of operating properties was offset by a decrease in net cash provided by operating activities primarily from changes in operating assets (tenant security deposits and other restricted cash, deferred rent and other assets). Net cash used in investing activities for 2004 increased by $310.9 million to $450.7 million compared to $139.8 million for 2003. This increase was primarily due to an increase in property acquisitions, increases in additions to rental properties and properties under development, and a decrease in proceeds from sales of rental properties. Net cash provided by financing activities for 2004 increased by $315.0 million to $381.1 million compared to $66.2 million for 2003. This increase was primarily due to the net proceeds from our Series C preferred stock offering, increases in borrowings from our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan, and an increase in proceeds from secured notes payable. This was partially offset by the redemption of our Series A cumulative redeemable preferred stock. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of December 31, 2004, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements. Contractual Obligations and Commitments Contractual obligations as of December 31, 2004, consist of the following (in thousands): Payments by Period ----------------------------------------------- Total 2005 2006-2007 2008-2009 Thereafter - ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Secured notes payable(1) $ 635,432 $ 23,227 $ 223,598 $ 157,724 $ 230,883 Unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan 548,000 -- 298,000 250,000 -- Ground lease obligations 65,346 1,805 3,683 3,801 56,057 Other obligations 4,814 425 1,277 1,208 1,904 ------------ ---------- ---------- ---------- ----------- Total $ 1,253,592 $ 25,457 $ 526,558 $ 412,733 $ 288,844 ============ ========== ========== ========== =========== (1) Excludes unamortized premium of $3.5 million as of December 31, 2004. Secured notes payable as of December 31, 2004 included 26 notes secured by 54 properties and seven land development parcels. In December 2004, we amended our unsecured line of credit and our unsecured term loan (see "Unsecured Line of Credit and Unsecured Term Loan " below). The unsecured line of credit expires December 2007 and may be extended at our sole option for an additional one-year period. The unsecured term loan expires December 2009. Ground lease obligations as of December 31, 2004 included leases at seven of our properties and one land development parcel. These lease obligations have remaining lease terms of 28 to 51 years, exclusive of extension options. In addition to the above, we were committed under the terms of construction contracts to complete the construction of properties under development at a remaining aggregate cost of $18.3 million. As of December 31, 2004, we were also committed to fund approximately $23.2 million for the construction of building infrastructure improvements under the terms of leases and/or construction contracts and approximately $17.2 million for certain investments.

Unsecured Line of Credit and Unsecured Term Loan In December 2004, we amended our unsecured line of credit to increase our borrowing capacity from $440 million to $500 million. Borrowings under our unsecured line of credit, as amended, bear interest at a floating rate based on our election of either a LIBOR-based rate or the higher of the bank's reference rate and the Federal Funds rate, plus 0.5%. For each LIBOR-based advance, we must elect a LIBOR period of one, two, three or six months. The unsecured line of credit expires December 2007 and may be extended at our sole option for an additional one-year period. As of December 31, 2004, we had borrowings of $298.0 million outstanding on the unsecured line of credit with a weighted average interest rate of 3.72%. In December 2004, we amended our unsecured term loan to increase the loan from $150 million to $250 million. The unsecured term loan bears interest at a floating rate based on our election of either a LIBOR-based rate or the higher of the bank's reference rate and the Federal Funds rate, plus 0.5%. For each LIBOR-based advance, we must elect to fix for a period of one, two three or six months. The unsecured term loan expires in December 2009. As of December 31, 2004, we had borrowings of $250.0 million outstanding on the unsecured term loan with a weighted average interest rate of 3.72%. Our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan contain financial covenants, including, among other things, maintenance of minimum net worth, a leverage ratio and a fixed charge coverage ratio. In addition, the terms of the unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan restrict, among other things, certain investments, indebtedness, distributions and mergers. Aggregate borrowings under the unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan may be limited to an amount based on the net operating income derived from a pool of unencumbered properties. Accordingly, as we acquire or complete the development or redevelopment of additional unencumbered properties, aggregate borrowings available under the unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan will increase up to a maximum combined amount of $750 million. Under these provisions as of December 31, 2004, aggregate borrowings under our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan were limited to $666 million. Under the amended and restated unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan, we have an option to increase our maximum available commitment by an additional $100 million. We utilize interest rate swap agreements to hedge a portion of our exposure to variable interest rates associated with our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan. These agreements involve an exchange of fixed and floating interest payments without the exchange of the underlying principal amount (the "notional amount"). Interest received under all of our swap agreements is based on the one-month LIBOR rate. The net difference between the interest paid and the interest received is reflected as an adjustment to interest expense. The following table summarizes our interest rate swap agreements as of December 31, 2004 (dollars in thousands): Notional Effective at Interest Termination Fair Transaction Dates Effective Dates Amounts December 31, 2004 Pay Rates Dates Values - ---------------- ---------------- --------- ----------------- --------- ---------------- --------- July 2002 January 1, 2003 25,000 $ 25,000 3.855% June 30, 2005 $ (142) July 2002 January 1, 2003 25,000 25,000 3.865% June 30, 2005 (143) November 2002 June 1, 2003 25,000 25,000 3.115% December 31, 2005 (31) November 2002 June 1, 2003 25,000 25,000 3.155% December 31, 2005 (41) December 2002 January 2, 2003 25,000 25,000 3.285% June 30, 2006 (35) December 2002 January 2, 2003 25,000 25,000 3.285% June 30, 2006 (35) December 2003 December 31, 2004 50,000 50,000 3.000% December 30, 2005 (4) December 2003 December 30, 2005 50,000 -- 4.150% December 29, 2006 (219) December 2003 December 29, 2006 50,000 -- 5.090% October 31, 2008 (795) March 2004 December 31, 2004 25,000 25,000 2.956% December 31, 2006 186 March 2004 December 31, 2004 25,000 25,000 2.956% December 31, 2006 186 April 2004 April 30, 2004 50,000 50,000 1.550% April 29, 2005 173 April 2004 April 29, 2005 50,000 -- 3.140% April 28, 2006 81 April 2004 April 28, 2006 50,000 -- 4.230% April 30, 2007 (205) April 2004 April 30, 2007 50,000 -- 4.850% April 30, 2008 (333) June 2004 June 30, 2005 50,000 -- 4.343% June 30, 2007 (679) December 2004 December 31, 2004 50,000 50,000 3.590% January 2, 2008 (57) December 2004 January 3, 2006 50,000 -- 3.927% July 1, 2008 3 ----------------- -------- Total Interest Rate Swap Agreements in $ 350,000 $(2,090) Effect at December 31, 2004 ================= ======== size="1"> We do not believe we are exposed to more than a nominal amount of credit risk in our interest rate swap agreements as our counterparties are established, well-capitalized financial institutions. In addition, we have entered into master derivative agreements with each counterparty. These master derivative agreements (all of which are on the standard International Swaps & Derivatives Association, Inc. form) define certain terms between us and each counterparty to address and minimize certain risks associated with our swap agreements, including a default by a counterparty . As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, our interest rate swap agreements have been classified at their fair values of approximately $2.1 million and $6.3 million, respectively, in accounts payable, accrued expenses and tenant security deposits in our consolidated balance sheets. The offsetting adjustments of $2.1 million and $6.3 million, respectively, were reflected as deferred losses in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the stockholders' equity section of our consolidated balance sheets. Balances in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) are recognized in earnings as swap payments are made. Other Resources and Liquidity Requirements In June 2004, we completed a public offering of 5,185,500 shares of our 8.375% Series C cumulative redeemable preferred stock (including the shares issued upon exercise of the underwriters' over-allotment option). The shares were issued at a price of $25.00 per share, resulting in aggregate proceeds of approximately $124.0 million (after deducting underwriters' discounts and other offering costs). In December 2004, we amended and restated our existing unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan. The maximum permitted borrowings under the unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan increased to $500 million and $250 million, respectively. We may in the future elect to increase commitments under the unsecured line of credit by up to an additional $100 million. We expect to continue meeting our short-term liquidity and capital requirements generally through our working capital and net cash provided by operating activities. We believe that the net cash provided by operating activities will continue to be sufficient to enable us to make distributions necessary to continue qualifying as a REIT. We also believe that net cash provided by operating activities will be sufficient to fund recurring non- revenue enhancing capital expenditures, tenant improvements and leasing commissions. We expect to meet certain long-term liquidity requirements, such as for property acquisitions, property development and redevelopment activities, scheduled debt maturities, expansions and other non-recurring capital improvements, through net cash provided by operating activities, long-term secured and unsecured indebtedness, including borrowings under the unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan, and the issuance of additional debt and/or equity securities. Exposure to Environmental Liabilities In connection with the acquisition of all of our properties, we have obtained Phase I environmental assessments to ascertain the existence of any environmental liabilities or other issues. The Phase I environmental assessments of our properties have not revealed any environmental liabilities that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations taken as a whole, nor are we aware of any material environmental liabilities that have occurred since the Phase I environmental assessments were completed. In addition, we carry a policy of pollution legal liability insurance covering exposure to certain environmental losses at all of our properties. Capital Expenditures, Tenant Improvements and Leasing Costs The following table shows total and weighted average per square foot property-related capital expenditures, tenant improvements and leasing costs (all of which are added to the basis of the properties) related to our life science properties (excluding capital expenditures and tenant improvements that are recoverable from tenants, revenue-enhancing or related to properties that have undergone redevelopment) for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, 2002, 2001 and 2000, attributable to leases that commenced at our properties after our acquisition.

Major capital expenditures also include one-time costs related to the implementation of our national branding and signage program. Major capital expenditures for 2004 include a one-time HVAC system upgrade at one property totaling $1,551,000 ($0.25 per square foot in portfolio). Major capital expenditures for 2003 include $1,072,000 ($0.19 per square foot in portfolio) in one-time costs related to the implementation of our national branding and signage program. Recurring capital expenditures for 2002 include $552,000 ($0.10 per square foot in portfolio) related to a fully leased property in San Diego, California that underwent substantial renovation in 2002. Excludes space that has undergone redevelopment before retenanting. Capital expenditures fluctuate in any given period due to the nature, extent and timing of improvements required and the extent to which they are recoverable from our tenants. Approximately 91% of our leases provide for the recapture of certain capital expenditures (such as HVAC systems maintenance and/or replacement, roof replacement and parking lot resurfacing). In addition, we maintain an active preventative maintenance program at each of our properties to minimize capital expenditures required. Tenant improvements and leasing costs also fluctuate in any given year depending upon factors such as the timing and extent of vacancies, property age, location and characteristics, the type of lease (renewal tenant or retenanted space), the involvement of external leasing agents and overall competitive market conditions. Inflation As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, approximately 83% and 88%, respectively, of our leases (on a square footage basis) were triple net leases, requiring tenants to pay substantially all real estate taxes and insurance, common area and other operating expenses, including increases thereto. The decrease in tripe net leases from 2003 to 2004 is primarily due to gross leases added to the portfolio from properties acquired in 2004. Gross leases are generally converted to triple net leases upon renewal or rollover. In addition, as of December 31, 2004, approximately 7% of our leases (on a square footage basis) required the tenants to pay a majority of operating expenses. Approximately 89% of our leases (on a square footage basis) contained effective annual rent escalations that are either fixed (generally ranging from 3% to 3.5%) or indexed based on the consumer price index or another index. Accordingly, we do not believe that our earnings or cash flow from real estate operations are subject to any significant risk from inflation. An increase in inflation, however, could result in an increase in the cost of our variable rate borrowings, including our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan. Funds from Operations GAAP basis accounting for real estate assets utilizes historical cost accounting and assumes real estate values diminish over time. In an effort to overcome the miscorrelation between real estate values and historical cost accounting for real estate assets, the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") established the measurement tool of Funds From Operations ("FFO"). Since its introduction, FFO has become a widely used non-GAAP financial measure by REITs. We believe that FFO is helpful to investors as an additional measure of the performance of an equity REIT. We compute FFO in accordance with standards established by the Board of Governors of NAREIT in its April 2002 White Paper (the "White Paper") and related implementation guidance, which may differ from the methodology for calculating FFO utilized by other equity REITs, and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other REITs. In 2003, NAREIT issued guidance which modifies the calculation of FFO for both past and future periods. In accordance with NAREIT's revised guidance, we now include losses from early extinguishment of debt and real estate impairment charges in our calculation of FFO. As such, the reported amounts of FFO for the year ended December 31, 2002 have been modified from those previously reported. The White Paper defines FFO as net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. While FFO is a relevant and widely used measure of operating performance for REITs, it should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indication of financial performance, or to cash flows from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of our liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make distributions. (See "Liquidity and Capital Resources - Cash Flows" above for information regarding these measures of cash flow.) We believe that net income is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to FFO. The following table presents a reconciliation of net income to funds from operations for the years ended December 31, (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, ------------------------ 2004 2003 ----------- ----------- Net income $ 60,195 $ 59,643 Add: Depreciation and amortization(1) 42,523 38,901 Less: Dividends on preferred stock (12,595) (8,898) Preferred stock redemption charge(2) (1,876) -- Gain/loss on sales of property(3) (1,627) (8,286) ----------- ----------- Funds from operations $ 86,620 $ 81,360 =========== =========== Includes depreciation and amortization on assets "held for sale" reflected as discontinued operations (for the periods prior to when such assets were designated as "held for sale"). During the second quarter of 2004, we elected to redeem the 9.50% Series A cumulative redeemable preferred stock. Accordingly, in compliance with Emerging Issues Task Force Topic D-42, we recorded a charge of $1,876,000, or $0.10 per common share (diluted) in the second quarter of 2004 for costs related to the redemption of the Series A preferred stock. Gain/loss on sales of property relates to the disposition of a property in the Suburban Washington D.C. market during the first quarter of 2004, the disposition of a property in the Suburban Washington D.C. market during the fourth quarter of 2003, the disposition of a property in the Eastern Massachusetts market during the third quarter of 2003, and the disposition of a property in the San Francisco Bay market during the first quarter of 2003. Gain/loss on sales of property is included in the income statement in income from discontinued operations, net.
