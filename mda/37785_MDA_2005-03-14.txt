ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview We are a diversified, global chemical company providing innovative solutions and applications to a wide variety of end markets. We operate in three business segments: Agricultural Products, Specialty Chemicals and Industrial Chemicals. Agricultural Products principal focus is on insecticides, which are used to enhance crop yield and quality by controlling a wide spectrum of pests, and on herbicides, which are used to reduce the need for manual or mechanical weeding by inhibiting or preventing weed growth. Specialty Chemicals consists of our BioPolymer and lithium businesses and focuses on food ingredients that are used to enhance texture, structure and physical stability, pharmaceutical additives for binding and disintegrant use and lithium specialties for pharmaceutical synthesis and energy storage. Our Industrial Chemicals segment manufactures a wide range of inorganic materials, including soda ash, peroxygens and phosphorus chemicals. 2004 Highlights 2004 was a year during which we experienced sales growth in all of our business segments. We also had significant growth in income from continuing operations before income tax. Additionally, we reduced our debt levels and refinanced our Credit Agreement. Consolidated revenue of $2,051.2 million was up 7 percent from the prior year. Agricultural Products, Specialty Chemicals and Industrial Chemicals had revenue increases of 10%, 4% and 6%, respectively. Sales across all segments benefited from higher volumes and favorable foreign currency translation. Additionally, in Agricultural Products, an improved farm economy, especially in Brazil contributed to sales growth. Income from continuing operations before income tax of $131.1 million was up significantly from the prior year. This was driven by a 44% and 69% increase in operating profit in Agricultural Products and Industrial Chemicals, respectively, and lower interest expense levels. Interest expense of $80.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 decreased 16% from the prior year. Net income was $160.2 million compared to $26.5 million in 2003. Net income in 2004 included an after-tax benefit of $40.4 million due to tax adjustments offset by restructuring and other charges (gains), Astaris restructuring expenses, write-off of deferred financing fees and charges to discontinued operations. 2005 Outlook In 2005 we expect continued growth in our earnings. We expect a significant recovery in our Industrial Chemicals segment to be the primary driver of that growth as well as reduced interest expense due to lower debt levels and reduced rates following our 2004 refinancing. We expect that the improvement in Industrial Chemicals will be primarily driven by higher soda ash selling prices due to the tight supply conditions in the market. Lower debt levels and reduced interest rates are expected to lower our interest expense in 2005 as well as provide greater financial flexibility and liquidity. Critical Accounting Policies Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of asset, liabilities, revenues and expenses. We have described our accounting policies in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K. We have reviewed these accounting policies, identifying those that we believe to be critical to the preparation and understanding of our consolidated financial statements. We have reviewed with the Audit Committee those accounting policies that we have deemed critical. These policies are central to our presentation of results of operations and financial condition and require management to make estimates and judgments on certain matters. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience, current conditions and other reasonable factors. 28 Table of Contents Environmental We provide for environmental-related obligations when they are probable and amounts can be reasonably estimated. Where the available information is sufficient to estimate the amount of liability, that estimate has been used. Where the information is only sufficient to establish a range of probable liability and no point within the range is more likely than any other, the lower end of the range has been used. Estimated obligations to remediate sites that involve oversight by the EPA, or similar government agencies, are generally accrued no later than when a ROD, or equivalent, is issued, or upon completion of a RI/FS that is accepted by us and the appropriate government agency or agencies. Estimates are reviewed quarterly by our environmental remediation management, as well as by financial and legal management and, if necessary, adjusted as additional information becomes available. The estimates can change substantially as additional information becomes available regarding the nature or extent of site contamination, required remediation methods, and other actions by or against governmental agencies or private parties. Our environmental liabilities for continuing and discontinued operations are principally for costs associated with the remediation and/or study of sites at which we are alleged to have disposed of hazardous substances. Such costs principally include, among other items, RI/FS, site remediation, costs of operation and maintenance of the remediation plan, fees to outside law firms and consultants for work related to the environmental effort, and future monitoring costs. Estimated site liabilities are determined based upon existing remediation laws and technologies, specific site consultants engineering studies or by extrapolating experience with environmental issues at comparable sites. Provisions for environmental costs are reflected in income, net of probable and estimable recoveries from named PRPs or other third parties. Such provisions incorporate inflation and are not discounted to their present values. In calculating and evaluating the adequacy of our environmental reserves, we have taken into account the joint and several liability imposed by CERCLA and the analogous state laws on all PRPs and have considered the identity and financial condition of each of the other PRPs at each site to the extent possible. We have also considered the identity and financial condition of other third parties from whom recovery is anticipated, as well as the status of our claims against such parties. Although we are unable to forecast the ultimate contributions of PRPs and other third parties with absolute certainty, the degree of uncertainty with respect to each party is taken into account when determining the environmental reserve by adjusting the reserve to reflect the facts and circumstances on a site-by-site basis. Our liability includes management best estimate of the costs expected to be paid before the consideration of any potential recoveries from third parties. We believe that any recorded recoveries related to PRPs are realizable in all material respects. We have recorded recoveries representing probable realization of claims against insurance companies, U.S. government agencies and other third parties, of $12.1 million and $17.0 million, respectively, at December 31, 2004 and 2003. These recoveries are recorded as an offset to Environmental liabilities, continuing and discontinued. Cash recoveries for the years 2004, 2003 and 2002 were $6.1 million, $10.7 million and $16.2 million, respectively. In addition, at December 31, 2004 we have estimated that reasonably possible environmental loss contingencies may exceed amounts accrued by as much as $75 million. We recorded total environmental provisions related to both operating and discontinued sites of $34.1 million, $24.9 million and $10.2 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Impairments and valuation of long-lived assets Our long-lived assets include property, plant and equipment and long-term investments, goodwill and intangible assets. We test for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the net book value of these assets may not be recoverable from the estimated undiscounted expected future cash flows expected to result from their use and eventual disposition. In cases where the estimated undiscounted expected future cash 29 Table of Contents flows are less than net book value, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the net book value exceeds the estimated fair value of assets, which is based on discounted cash flows at the lowest level determinable. The estimated cash flows reflect our assumptions about selling prices, volumes, costs and market conditions over a reasonable period of time. We prepare an annual impairment test of goodwill. The assumptions used to estimate fair value include our best estimate of future growth rates, discount rates and market conditions over a reasonable period. We performed this test in 2004 and determined that no impairment charge was required. Pensions and other postretirement benefits We provide qualified and nonqualified defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans, as well as postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans to our employees. The costs (or benefits) and obligations related to these benefits reflect key assumptions related to general economic conditions, including interest (discount) rates, healthcare cost trend rates, expected rates of return on plan assets and the rates of compensation increases for employees. The costs (or benefits) and obligations for these benefit programs are also affected by other assumptions, such as average retirement age, mortality, employee turnover, and plan participation. To the extent our plans actual experience, as influenced by changing economic and financial market conditions or by changes to our own plans demographics, differs from these assumptions, the costs and obligations for providing these benefits, as well as the plans funding requirements, could increase or decrease. When actual results differ from our assumptions, the difference is typically recognized over future periods. In addition, the unrealized gains and losses related to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations may also affect periodic benefit costs in future periods. We use certain calculated values of assets under methods both to estimate the expected rate of return on assets component of pension cost and to calculate our plans funding requirements. The expected rate of return on plan assets is based on a market-related value of assets that recognizes investment gains and losses over a five-year period. We use an actuarial value of assets to determine our plans funding requirements. The actuarial value of assets must be within a certain range, high or low, of the actual market value of assets, and is adjusted accordingly. We recorded $9.2 million, $7.7 million and $4.9 million of net annual pension and other postretirement benefit cost in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, $85.9 million and $97.7 million, respectively, was recorded for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations. The recorded amounts for pension benefit obligations include additional minimum pension liabilities of $53.1 million and $43.2 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, which were recorded in the accumulated other comprehensive income section in stockholders equity. We made voluntary cash contributions to our U.S. qualified pension plan of $8.0 million and $7.0 million, respectively, for 2004 and 2003. In addition, we paid nonqualified pension benefits from company assets of $4.8 million and $2.4 million, for 2004 and 2003, respectively. We paid other postretirement benefits, net of participant contributions, of $7.2 million and $6.6 million for 2004 and 2003, respectively. Our estimated cash contributions for 2005 include approximately $3 million in nonqualified pension benefits, approximately $7.5 million in other postretirement benefits, and we plan to make voluntary cash contributions to our U.S. qualified pension plan of approximately $15 million. We select the discount rate used to calculate pension and other postretirement obligations based on a review of available yields on high-quality corporate bonds, including Moody Investors Service, Inc. ( Moody ) Aa-rated Corporate and Industrial bond indices. In selecting the discount rate for 2004, we placed particular emphasis on a portfolio of high-quality (Aa-graded) bond investments constructed by our actuary to be used for this purpose. In developing the expected long-term rate of return on asset assumption for our plan, we take into consideration the technical analysis performed by our outside actuaries, including historical market returns, information on long-term real return expectations by asset class, inflation assumptions, and expectations for 30 Table of Contents standard deviation related to these best estimates. We also consider the historical performance of our own plan trust, which has earned a compound annual rate of return of approximately 14 percent over the last 10 years (which is in excess of comparable market indices for the same period) as well as other factors. The current asset allocation for our plan is approximately 70 percent equities (U.S. and non-U.S.), 25 percent fixed-income and 5 percent cash and other short-term investments. Given an actively managed investment portfolio, the expected annual rates of return by asset class for our portfolio, using geometric averaging, and after being adjusted for an estimated inflation rate of approximately three percent, is between nine percent and eleven percent for both U.S. and non-U.S. equities, and between five percent and seven percent for fixed-income investments, which generates a total expected portfolio return that is in line with our rate of return assumption. We continually monitor the appropriateness of this rate in light of current market conditions. For the sensitivity of our pension costs to incremental changes in this assumption see our discussion below. The other postretirement benefit obligations and net periodic other postretirement benefit costs noted above do not reflect the effects of the Medicare, Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 ( Medicare Act ). In September 2004, we elected not to recognize any of the potential accounting effects of the Medicare Act because the actuarial equivalence of our retiree medical plan was undeterminable as of September 30, 2004. We required more information on how actuarial equivalence would be calculated that was not available in existing versions of the regulations in order to determine if our retiree medical plan met the threshold. On January 21, 2005, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) released the final regulations on the Medicare prescription drug benefit. The final regulations provide comprehensive guidance on how the actuarial equivalence of retiree medical plans will be determined. We are currently in the process of evaluating the final regulations to determine the estimated effects, if any, of the Medicare Act on our retiree medical plan and the other postretirement benefit liabilities and net annual other postretirement benefit costs reported in our consolidated financial statements. Sensitivity analysis related to key pension and postretirement benefit assumptions. A one-half percent increase in the assumed discount rate would have decreased pension and other postretirement benefit obligations by $51.0 million at December 31, 2004 and $47.7 million at December 31, 2003, and decreased pension and other postretirement benefit costs by $2.5 million, $0.9 million and $1.2 million for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. A one-half percent decrease in the assumed discount rate would have increased pension and other postretirement benefit obligations by $ 54.1 million at December 31, 2004 and $52.5 million at December 31, 2003, and increased pension and other postretirement benefit net periodic benefit cost by $5.0 million, $4.0 million and $1.0 million for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. A one-half percent increase in the assumed expected long-term rate of return on plan assets would have decreased pension costs by $3.2 million, $3.2 million and $3.0 million for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. A one-half percent decrease in the assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets would have increased pension costs by $3.2 million, $3.2 million and $3.0 million for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Further details on our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and net periodic benefit costs are found in Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements. Income taxes We have recorded a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized. In assessing the need for this allowance, we have considered a number of factors including future income, the jurisdictions in which such income is earned and our ongoing tax planning strategies. In the event that we determined that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made. Similarly, should we conclude that we would be able to realize certain deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, the valuation allowance was $ 55.0 million and $39.0 million, respectively. 31 Table of Contents Results of Operations 2004, 2003 and 2002 Overview Year Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 Per Share (Diluted) Per Share (Diluted) Per Share (Diluted) (In Millions, Except Per Share Data) Consolidated Revenue $ 2,051.2 $ 1,921.4 $ 1,852.9 Net income (loss) $ 160.2 $ 4.28 $ 26.5 $ 0.75 $ 65.8 $ 1.92 Net income included the following after-tax charges: Restructuring and other charges (gains) $ 2.2 $ 0.06 $ (4.8 ) $ (0.13 ) $ 18.4 $ 0.54 Astaris restructuring (1) 7.0 0.18 32.5 0.91 Write-off of deferred financing fees 6.0 0.16 Discontinued operations 15.4 0.42 13.3 0.37 3.3 0.09 Tax adjustments (71.0 ) (1.90 ) After-tax income from continuing operations excluding restructuring and other income and charges (2) $ 119.8 $ 3.20 $ 67.5 $ 1.90 $ 87.5 $ 2.55 (1) Our share of charges recorded by Astaris the phosphorous joint venture is included in Equity in (earnings) loss of affiliates. (2) We believe that the Non-GAAP financial measure After-tax income from continuing operations, excluding restructuring and other income and charges, and its presentation on a per-share basis, provides useful information about our operating results to investors and securities analysts. We also believe that excluding the effect of restructuring and other income and charges from operating results allows management and investors to compare more easily the financial performance of our underlying businesses from period to period. This measure should not be considered as a substitute for net income (loss) or other measures of performance or liquidity reported in accordance with GAAP. The explanation of the reconciling items between net income and after-tax income from continuing operations excluding restructuring and other income and charges can be found in the results of operations discussions below for 2004 compared to 2003 and for 2003 compared to 2002. See Segment Results for a detailed discussion of events affecting our results for 2004, 2003 and 2002. Results of Operations 2004 compared to 2003 In the following discussion, year refers to the year ending December 31, 2004 and prior year refers to the year ending December 31, 2003. All comparisons are between the periods unless otherwise noted. Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2004 was $2,051.2 million, an increase of 7 percent compared to the $1,921.4 million recorded in the prior year period. This increase was driven by higher sales in all our segments, which are discussed separately below. Restructuring and other charges (gains) totaled a loss of $3.5 million ($2.2 million after-tax) in 2004 compared to a gain of $(5.1) million ($(4.8) million after-tax) in 2003. The before-tax loss of $3.5 million that we recorded in 2004 was primarily a result of severance costs that are expected to result in improved cost efficiencies. Agricultural Products and Specialty Chemicals recorded $3.3 million and $0.3 million, respectively, of these severance costs. Severance costs in 2004 related to approximately 80 people most of whom separated from us in 2004. We also recorded $1.1 million of charges related to continuing environmental sites. These charges were partially offset by non-cash gains totaling $1.1 million in Industrial Chemicals and $0.1 million in Corporate. 32 Table of Contents The before-tax gain of $5.1 million in 2003 was primarily a result of the gain on the sale of an office building in Foret, our Spanish subsidiary, offset by charges related to severance costs, asset abandonments and environmental costs. The detail of these charges by segment are explained further in our results of operations analysis 2003 compared to 2002. Equity in loss (earnings) of affiliates . Equity in loss of affiliates was $2.1 million versus $68.6 million in the prior year. In 2003, Astaris began a restructuring plan to improve its financial performance. The restructuring, which included the exit of the commodity sodium tripolyphosphate ( STPP ) market, reduced fixed costs through facility and selective product rationalizations and resulted in improvement in the venture position in food and technical phosphates. The restructuring was completed in 2004 and included four facility closures and the consolidation of operations into the remaining three Astaris sites. Our portion of Astaris 2004 and 2003 restructuring charges, which totaled $11.5 million ($7.0 million, after tax) and $53.3 million ($32.5 million, after tax), respectively, were recorded in Equity in loss (earnings) of affiliates. Astaris earnings improved during 2004 compared to the prior year due to the benefits of this restructuring. Interest expense, net decreased to $78.4 million compared to $92.2 million in 2003. The decrease primarily reflects lower interest costs from the December 2003 and June 2004 term loan repricings, lower debt levels in 2004 compared to the prior year and the effect of our debt refinancing in October 2004. See our discussion on Liquidity and Capital Resources for further details on the 2004 refinancing. Write-off of deferred financing fees in 2004 represents the unamortized fees from our 2002 financing that were written off when we refinanced our debt in October 2004. Provision (benefit) for income taxes was a benefit of $44.5 million in 2004 compared with a benefit of $1.8 million for 2003 reflecting effective tax rates of (34.0%) and (4.7%), respectively. The change from 2004 to 2003 was due to tax adjustments recorded in 2004, the mix of domestic income compared to income earned outside of the U.S., dividends received from foreign operations and valuation allowance adjustments. 2004 was affected by a tax benefit of $38.6 million resulting from an adjustment to income tax liabilities due to a December 2004 pronouncement from the Internal Revenue Service, a tax benefit of $31.1 million primarily related to valuation allowance adjustments and a tax benefit of $1.3 million resulting from a refund received from the Internal Revenue Service. The tax rate in 2003 was affected by a change in the mix of domestic income compared to income earned outside of the U.S. Income we earn outside of the U.S. is typically taxed at rates lower than income earned domestically. In addition, dividends received from our foreign operations and valuation allowance adjustments further affected the benefit for income taxes in 2003. Discontinued operations . We recorded after-tax charges of $15.4 million in 2004 versus $13.3 million in 2003. 2004 charges include environmental remediation costs at sites of discontinued businesses for which we are responsible for environmental compliance and legal reserves offset by gains related to tax adjustments for previously discontinued operations. Our environmental charges included amounts totaling $11.4 million after-tax to increase our reserves for environmental issues at two sites in New Jersey and at our Middleport, New York Site. 2003 charges are primarily for environmental remediation costs at sites of discontinued businesses for which we are responsible for environmental compliance. Net Income increased to $160.2 million in 2004 compared with $26.5 million in 2003 reflecting higher earnings from our Agricultural Products and Industrial Chemicals segments and decreased interest expense somewhat offset by lower earnings in our Specialty Chemicals segment. In addition, net income for 2004 included restructuring and other charges, charges related to the Astaris restructuring, write-off of deferred financing fees, charges in our discontinued operations and tax adjustments, the sum of which totaled a benefit of $40.4 million after-tax or $1.08 per share on a diluted basis. Prior-year net income included after-tax restructuring and other charges (gains), Astaris restructuring and charges in our discontinued operations, the sum of which totaled a charge of $41.0 million after-tax or $1.15 per share on a diluted basis. 33 Table of Contents Reclassifications and Adjustments Our results for the year ended December 31, 2004, were unfavorably affected by $8.1 million ($6.0 million after-tax) or $0.16 per diluted share related to the elimination of inter-company profit in our inventory and the elimination of the recognition of revenue due to sales cutoff. Our results for the year ended December 31, 2004 were favorably affected by a $8.0 million or $0.22 per diluted share benefit recorded to income taxes related to adjustments to deferred tax liabilities and income tax valuation allowance related to prior periods. Additionally, our results for the year ended December 31, 2004 were favorably affected by a $9.0 million after-tax or $0.24 per diluted share benefit recorded to discontinued operations due to adjustments to deferred tax liabilities related to previously discontinued operations. Further, our stockholders equity was favorably affected by $10.8 million due to adjustments to deferred tax liabilities related to Technologies. We recorded this adjustment through Retained Earnings, consistent with the accounting for the 2001 spin-off of Technologies. The adjustments to our income taxes, discontinued operations and retained earnings were recorded as a result of a review of our deferred taxes and income tax valuation allowance in which balances were adjusted related to discontinued operations and to prior periods. We believe that the effect of the above eliminations and adjustments are not material to our financial position or results of operations or liquidity for any prior period. Other Financial Data Corporate Expenses increased 8 percent to $40.3 million in 2004 from $37.3 million in the prior year due entirely to higher spending related to Sarbanes-Oxley Section 404 compliance. Other income and expense, net is comprised primarily of LIFO inventory adjustments, pension expense and realized foreign currency gains and losses. Other income, net, increased to $4.6 million from $3.9 million in the prior year due to the impact of the LIFO adjustment and other non-operating items, partially offset by an adjustment in pension expense. Segment Results 2004 compared to 2003 Information about how each of these items relates to our businesses at the segment level and results by segment are discussed below and in Note 18 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K. Agricultural Products Year Ended December 31, Increase/ (Decrease) 2004 2003 $ % (in Millions) Revenue $ 703.5 $ 640.1 $ 63.4 10 % Operating Profit 118.4 82.0 36.4 44 Higher insecticide sales accounted for over half of the revenue increase and were driven by strong performance in Latin America, particularly Brazil, due to an improved farm economy and heavy pest pressures, and to a lesser extent improved performance in Europe. Increased herbicide sales resulted from growth in Brazil, new labels in Europe, strong early season demand in North America and slightly improved conditions in Asia. Favorable foreign currency effects, primarily from the stronger euro and payments from third-party producers also contributed to revenue growth. The increase in segment operating profit was due to higher sales, lower production costs and improved product mix resulting from our focus on higher-value proprietary products. 34 Table of Contents In 2005, we believe that Agricultural Products sales will be flat as growth in new products and labels coupled with continued strong performance in Brazil and Europe offsets the impact of lower selling prices resulting from generic competition in North America. Earnings are also expected to be flat as lower manufacturing costs from sourcing initiatives are offset by higher energy, raw materials and freight costs. Specialty Chemicals Year Ended December 31, Increase/ (Decrease) 2004 2003 $ % (in Millions) Revenue $ 538.0 $ 515.8 $ 22.2 4 % Operating Profit 96.1 102.1 (6.0 ) (6 ) The BioPolymer business drove most of the revenue increase with higher sales in the pharmaceutical and food ingredients markets as well as the favorable impact of foreign currency translation, primarily the euro. Revenue in the lithium business increased slightly from the prior-period as the benefits of increased sales into the battery market and favorable foreign currency translation were partially offset by lower sales into the pharmaceutical market. Segment operating profit was down 6 percent versus the prior period due to the impact of higher raw material costs and spending on Biopolymer growth initiatives partially offset by favorable foreign currency. In 2005, we expect mid-single digit revenue growth driven by strong organic growth in both the BioPolymer and lithium businesses. Full year earnings are expected to exceed the rate of sales growth, driven by productivity improvements. Industrial Chemicals Year Ended December 31, Increase/ (Decrease) 2004 2003 $ % (in Millions) Revenue $ 813.7 $ 770.6 $ 43.1 6 % Operating Profit 57.3 34.0 23.3 69 The Industrial Chemicals revenue increase was driven by improved Foret sales, our European industrial chemicals business, which resulted from favorable foreign currency translation and higher selling prices in phosphates and peroxygens. Higher alkali sales were driven by strong volume growth in export markets and improved domestic soda ash selling prices partially offset by lower net soda ash export prices in Asia and Latin America. Lower domestic peroxygen sales resulted from an unfavorable product mix and lower persulfate prices, partially offset by improved volumes. The increase in segment operating profit was due to higher sales, and improved earnings at Astaris. These benefits were slightly offset by higher energy prices, primarily natural gas and higher freight costs. Astaris earnings improved significantly as a result of its restructuring. We expect mid-single digit growth in revenue in 2005 driven by higher selling prices, particularly in soda ash. We expect full year earnings growth of approximately 50 percent, which will be driven by higher selling prices, particularly in soda ash, partially offset by higher energy, raw material and transportation costs. This outlook includes the impact of restarting 250,000 short tons of mothballed soda ash capacity. In connection with this restart we expect modest startup expenses of approximately $5 million and capital expenditures of approximately $2 million. 35 Table of Contents Results of Operations 2003 compared to 2002 Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2003 was $1,921.4 million up 4 percent compared with $1,852.9 million in 2002. This increase was due to a stronger euro, growth in Specialty Chemicals sales in the pharmaceutical market and increased Agricultural Products sales in Latin America and Europe. Restructuring and other charges (gains) totaled $(5.1) million ($(4.8) million after tax) in 2003 compared with $30.1 million ($18.4 million after tax) in 2002. The before tax gain of $5.1 million we recorded in 2003 was the result of a gain on the sale of an office building in Foret, our Spanish subsidiary, offset by charges in all segments. The gain on the building was $11.9 million, net of related costs, including severance. Severance costs were recorded in Industrial Chemicals and in both our Agricultural Products and Specialty Chemicals segments. Total 2003 severance charges, including amounts recorded at Foret, were $5.7 million and related to approximately 80 people most of whom separated from FMC in late 2003. The remaining charges in the year included non-cash charges totaling $2.8 million primarily for the abandonment of an asset in the Specialty Chemicals segment, offset by the reversal of certain workforce related and facility shutdown reserves in Corporate (as shown in the table in Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K) resulting from our ability to meet certain obligations on more favorable terms than expected when the reserves were established. The remaining other charges of $2.2 million in 2003 were related to environmental costs at operating sites, largely in our Industrial Chemicals segment. In 2002, restructuring and other charges of $30.1 million, before tax, consisted of charges related to each of our segments. The details, by segment, are discussed below. In an effort to mitigate the effects of the continued economic weakness in the markets served by our Industrial Chemicals business we undertook several cost saving initiatives that resulted in $12.4 million of restructuring charges. Included in this amount was a $5.7 million restructuring charge for the mothballing of the basic production line at our hydrogen peroxide facility in Spring Hill, West Virginia. We also mothballed our Granger facility, in Green River, Wyoming resulting in a $3.4 million restructuring charge. The majority of this charge was for facility shutdown activities and severance, all of which occurred in 2002. In addition we recorded a $3.3 million restructuring charge for costs related to reorganization efforts to reduce costs in our U.S. phosphorus chemicals business, alkali, peroxygens and at Foret. There were 150 severances related to these restructurings, all of which occurred in 2002. In Agricultural Products, we incurred $4.7 million of restructuring charges in 2002, of which $3.7 million related to the idling and reorganization of our sulfentrazone plant in Baltimore in connection with our new herbicides strategy as we shifted our focus from soybeans to higher value crops. A $1.0 million restructuring charge was recorded for reorganization costs to implement a new distribution strategy in Europe, which allows us to rely on certain strategic alliances to further penetrate and expand our European markets. Of the 108 severances related to these restructurings 57 occurred in 2002. We recorded $1.3 million of restructuring charges in our Specialty Chemicals segment in 2002 in an effort to realign product divisions within BioPolymer, both domestically and internationally. The majority of these costs resulted from the severance of 24 people, which occurred in the first half of 2003. Reorganization costs of $3.0 million and other charges of $8.7 million were also recorded in 2002. These charges are discussed in Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K. Also, of the $30.1 million of restructuring charges recorded in 2002, $11.9 million was spent in 2002. Equity in (earnings) loss of affiliates was a loss of $68.6 million in 2003 versus earnings of $4.7 million in 2002. The loss in 2003 included charges totaling $53.3 million related to the restructuring program at Astaris. Weaker affiliate earnings were primarily the result of the absence of a power resale contract, which had a prior year pre-tax benefit of approximately $12 million and decreases in selling prices resulting from competitive pressure. 36 Table of Contents Interest expense, net increased by 29 percent to $92.2 million in 2003 compared to $71.6 million in 2002 reflecting higher interest costs in 2003 from our refinancing in the fourth quarter of 2002. Provision (benefit) for income taxes was a benefit of $1.8 million in 2003 compared with a provision of $17.4 million for 2002 reflecting tax rates of (4.7)% and 20.1%, respectively. The tax rate in 2003 was affected by a change in the mix of domestic income compared to income earned outside of the U.S. Income we earn outside of the U.S. is typically taxed at rates lower than income earned domestically. In addition, dividends received from our foreign operations and a change in the valuation allowance, further contributed to the change in the provision (benefit) for income taxes from 2002 to 2003. In 2002, the tax rate resulted primarily from the effect of depletion and differing foreign tax rates. (See Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K for further details.) Discontinued operations. We recorded after-tax charges of $13.3 million and $3.3 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively, for environmental remediation costs at sites of discontinued businesses for which we are responsible for environmental compliance. (See Discontinued Operations Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K for further details.) Net Income decreased to $26.5 million in 2003 compared with $65.8 million in 2002 reflecting increased interest expense, net, and lower earnings from our Industrial Chemicals segment somewhat offset by higher earnings in our other segments. In addition, net income for 2003 included restructuring and other charges (gains), Astaris restructuring and charges in our discontinued operations totaling $41.0 million after-tax or $1.15 per share on a diluted basis. As noted in the table under Overview above, these charges related primarily to restructuring programs, particularly at our Astaris affiliate, reported in Equity in (earnings) loss of affiliates , but also included a gain on the sale of an office building and an after-tax environmental charge to discontinued operations of $13.3 million. Prior-year net income included after-tax restructuring and other charges of $18.4 million also related to primarily in Industrial Chemicals, and an after-tax environmental charge to discontinued operations of $3.3 million. Other Financial Data The following are line items from our segment profit and loss statement used to reconcile segment operating profit to consolidated income from continuing operations before income taxes and the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle (see Note 18 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K). Corporate expenses increased to $37.3 million in 2003 from $35.6 million in 2002 primarily due to higher insurance costs. Other income and expense, net is comprised primarily of realized foreign currency gains and losses, LIFO inventory adjustments and pension income or expense. Net other income was $4.3 million higher in 2003 than the 2002 loss of $0.4 million. This variance is largely attributable to a LIFO adjustment and the impact of foreign currency. Segment Results 2003 compared to 2002 Agricultural Products Year Ended December 31, Increase/ (Decrease) 2003 2002 $ % (in Millions) Revenue $ 640.1 $ 615.1 $ 25.0 4 % Operating Profit 82.0 69.5 12.5 18 37 Table of Contents The increase in sales was driven by growth in all regions, except North America, and was largely achieved in the fourth quarter of 2003. Latin America and Europe showed the most significant growth at the end of 2003. Sales in Latin America, particularly Brazil, were driven by improved market conditions, and higher sales of proprietary herbicides and insecticides used on such crops as cotton and sugar cane. Stronger European sales resulted from a number of factors, including a stronger euro, new approved uses for propriety herbicides referred to as new labels, and our overall efforts to focus on higher-value, proprietary products. These increases more than offset the decrease in North American insecticide sales into the crop protection market due to lower-than-average pest pressures. Our professional pest control and home and garden business also saw continued growth during 2003. Because of this regional sales mix, insecticides were essentially flat for the year, while higher sales of herbicides resulted in most of the revenue increase in 2003 versus 2002. For 2003, our Agricultural Products revenues were made up of 75 percent insecticides, 24 percent herbicides and 1 percent fungicides. The segment operating profit improvement in 2003 compared to 2002 was a result of higher sales, improved product mix related to our focus on higher-value proprietary products and lower production costs, some of which was related to our outsourcing strategy in some product lines. Specialty Chemicals Year Ended December 31, Increase/ (Decrease) 2003 2002 $ % (in Millions) Revenue $ 515.8 $ 488.2 $ 27.6 6 % Operating Profit 102.1 89.8 12.3 14 BioPolymer, which generated 71 percent of 2003 segment revenues, had sales increases of 4 percent compared to 2002 while sales in our lithium business, which represents 29 percent of the segment, increased by more than 10 percent compared with 2002. Segment sales increases in 2003 were driven by U.S. and European growth in BioPolymer MCC products in the pharmaceuticals market, where MCC is used as a binder and disintegrant in tablets. These increases were partially offset by lower BioPolymer sales in our food business, largely as a result of lower demand in the nutritional beverage market. Also contributing were strong lithium sales in the pharmaceutical synthesis market and in the energy storage market from military demand for rechargeable batteries. In addition, the favorable impact of foreign currency translation, primarily the euro, further contributed to the increase in revenue in 2003. Segment operating profit increased in 2003 compared to 2002 due to higher sales, favorable foreign currency translation, improved productivity and sales mix. Industrial Chemicals Year Ended December 31, Increase/ (Decrease) 2003 2002 $ % (in Millions) Revenue $ 770.6 $ 753.4 $ 17.2 2 % Operating Profit 34.0 71.6 (37.6 ) (53 ) Industrial Chemicals sales increased in 2003 due almost entirely to Foret, our European Industrial Chemicals business, where favorable currency translation and higher peroxygen selling prices resulted in a 16 percent increase in sales compared with 2002. European prices for peroxygens were driven by higher capacity utilization levels coupled with strong demand. The increased sales at Foret were partially offset by decreased 38 Table of Contents revenues in our largely North American-based alkali and peroxygens (hydrogen peroxides and active oxidants) businesses, where sales in 2003 decreased 2 percent and 4 percent, respectively, compared with the prior year. The decrease in alkali was largely a result of lower export prices for soda ash, alkali primary product, due in part to recent capacity additions in China. Despite successful implementation of some selling price increases in 2003, peroxygen sales decreased due to weaker North American hydrogen peroxide volumes to the pulp market. For 2003, our Industrial Chemicals segment revenue is made up of 46 percent Alkali, 34 percent Foret and 19 percent peroxygens. Lower segment operating profit in 2003 was largely the result of significantly lower affiliate earnings from Astaris and lower sales in our alkali and domestic peroxygen businesses. Weaker affiliate earnings from Astaris were primarily the result of the absence of a power resale contract in 2003, which had a 2002 pre-tax benefit of approximately $12 million, and decreases in selling prices resulting from competitive pressure. In 2003, Astaris began a restructuring plan to improve its financial performance. The restructuring, included the exit of the commodity sodium tripolyphosphate ( STPP ) market. Our portion of Astaris 2003 restructuring charges, which totaled $53.3 million, before tax, were recorded in Equity in (earnings) loss of affiliates . Recently Adopted and Issued Accounting Pronouncements and Regulatory Items See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10-K Liquidity and Capital Resources On October 29, 2004, we executed an amended and restated $600.0 million senior secured credit agreement (the 2004 Credit Agreement ), which provides for a $400.0 million revolving credit facility ($150 million of which is available for the issuance of letters of credit), a $100 million term loan, and a $100 million stand-alone letter of credit facility (collectively, the Credit Facilities ). The net proceeds from the initial borrowings under the Credit Facilities, available cash and certain restricted cash released concurrently with the execution of the 2004 Credit Agreement were used to repay all borrowings under and terminate the former $241.8 million term loan, and to pay fees and expenses of approximately $4.0 million. See Note 9 of our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K for a summary of the 2004 Credit Agreement terms. In connection with entering into the 2004 Credit Agreement, we wrote off approximately $9.9 million of deferred financing fees associated with the previous agreements. These deferred financing fees were included as a component of other assets in our consolidated balance sheet, which was recorded as write-off of deferred financing fees in our consolidated statements of income. Among other restrictions, the 2004 Credit Agreement contains financial covenants related to leverage (measured as the ratio of debt to adjusted earnings) and interest coverage (measured as the ratio of adjusted earnings to interest expense). We were in compliance with all covenants at December 31, 2004. Additional covenants in the 2004 Credit Agreement include, among others, restrictions on creation of liens, limitations on acquisitions, joint ventures and other investment, limitations on restricted payments, including a prohibition on the payment of dividends by FMC, and restrictions on mergers, sales of assets and other fundamental changes. Restricted cash was $9.7 million and $136.9 million at December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003, respectively. At December 31, 2003 the restricted cash shown on the consolidated balance sheet provided collateral assuring the payment of certain self-insurance obligations, environmental remediation activities, future business commitments, and reimbursement obligations under letters of credit supporting variable-rate pollution control and industrial revenue bonds. At or subsequent to the execution of the 2004 Credit Agreement, the majority of the restricted cash providing collateral supporting our obligations was released. Certain obligations were replaced with letters of credit under the Credit Facilities. 39 Table of Contents At December 31, 2004, we had term loan facility borrowings of $100.0 million and no outstanding borrowings under our $400.0 million revolving credit facility. Letters of credit outstanding totaled $146.7 million, of which $47.9 million were issued under our $400 million revolving credit facility and $98.8 million were issued under our $100 million stand-alone letter of credit facility. Revolving credit facility availability was $352.1 million and stand-alone letter of credit availability was $1.2 million at December 31, 2004. At December 31, 2003, we had term loan facility borrowings of $247.5 million and no outstanding borrowings under our $250.0 million revolving credit facility. Letters of credit outstanding under the revolving credit facility totaled $2.6 million, resulting in availability under our revolving credit facility of $247.4 million. Cash and cash equivalents, excluding restricted cash, at December 31, 2004 compared to December 31, 2003 were $212.4 million and $57.0 million, respectively. The majority of cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2004, were held by our foreign subsidiaries. We had total debt of $923.2 million and $1,050.2 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. This included $822.2 million and $1,033.4 million of long-term debt (excluding current portions of $70.8 million and $3.0 million) at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Short-term debt, which consists primarily of foreign borrowings, increased to $30.2 million at December 31, 2004 compared to $13.8 million at December 31, 2003. The $143.4 million decrease in total long-term debt at December 31, 2004 from December 31, 2003 was primarily due to the repayment of our term loan facility under the former agreement. In 2003, we paid $163.6 million, including a premium of $0.3 million, plus accrued interest, to redeem all of outstanding 6.375 percent senior notes due September 2003 and all of the 6.53 percent series-B medium-term notes due December 2003. The redemption of the notes was funded with $144.3 million from restricted cash. Statement of Cash Flows Cash provided by operating activities was $238.7 million for 2004 compared to $220.7 million for 2003 and $19.4 million for 2002, primarily reflecting higher earnings. This was offset by increased environmental spending at Pocatello in 2004. During 2003, higher cash provided by operating activities was due to lower restructuring spending of $19.3 million compared to $63.8 million in 2002 and changes in guarantees of vendor financing and accounts receivables sold. Because we are a global company with significant investment in the Euro-zone, the 2004 and 2003 increase in the euro versus the U.S. dollar had a significant effect on the amounts of our operating assets and liabilities as presented on the balance sheets. For better comparability, we exclude this effect in the section of the statement of cash flows entitled change in operating assets and liabilities. Cash required by discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 was $28.3 million, $26.1 million and $29.6 million, respectively. The majority of the spending for our discontinued operations is for environmental remediation on discontinued sites and post-employment benefits for former employees of discontinued businesses. Discontinued environmental spending was $20.5 million in 2004 compared to $21.7 million in 2003 and $16.8 million in 2002. Contributing to the decline in 2003 was the absence of certain spending included in 2002 related to the spin-off of Technologies. Cash required by investing activities was $109.4 million, $157.8 million and $110.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The decrease in 2004 was due to lower Astaris keepwell payments. In addition, in 2003, we made a $32.4 million payment to Elf Atochem for Tg Soda Ash, which was not repeated in 2004. The increase in 2003 from 2002 reflects an increase in financing commitments to Astaris and to a lesser extent higher capital expenditures in 2003. Cash contributions to Astaris were $35.5 million, $62.8 million and $29.6 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Cash provided by financing activities for 2004 was $41.2 million compared to cash required of $79.3 million in 2003. In 2002, cash provided by financing activities was $182.6 million. Contributing to the increase in cash provided by financing activities in 2004 was the increase in the number of stock options exercised and higher borrowings under our foreign credit lines. In 2003, we paid $163.6 million to redeem the entire 40 Table of Contents outstanding balance of our 6.375 percent senior notes due September 2003, plus accrued interest and to redeem at par all of the outstanding 6.53 percent series-B medium-term notes. Also contributing to the decrease in cash provided by financing activities as compared to 2002 was the completion of an equity offering in the second quarter of 2002 resulting in net proceeds of $101.3 million, which was not repeated in 2003. For the year ended December 31, 2004 we contributed approximately 136,000 shares of treasury stock to our employee benefit plans having a cost of approximately $3.6 million. Commitments and other potential liquidity needs Our cash needs for 2005 include operating cash requirements, capital expenditures, scheduled maturities of long-term debt, environmental spending and restructuring. We expect that with these needs, our debt balances, net of cash, will be approximately $140 million less than at year-end 2004. We plan to meet our liquidity needs through available cash, cash generated from operations and borrowings under our $400.0 million committed revolving credit facility. In connection with the finalization of Astaris external financing arrangements during the third quarter of 2000, we entered into an agreement with Astaris lenders under which we agreed to make payments ( keepwell payments ) sufficient to make up one-half of the shortfall in Astaris earnings below certain levels. Solutia, which owns the other 50 percent of Astaris, provided a parallel agreement under which it agreed to make up the other half of any shortfall. Astaris earnings did not meet the agreed levels for the first half of 2004 and full-year 2003 and 2002. We made keepwell payments of $35.5 million under this arrangement in 2004 compared to keepwell payments of $62.8 million in 2003 and $29.6 million in 2002. In each case, keepwell payments were applied to reduce the debt of Astaris. As previously agreed with Astaris lenders, when the lenders commitments were reduced to $20.0 million, in June 2004 we provided a $6.1 million letter of credit in lieu of a cash keepwell payment in that amount and in the third quarter of 2004 we provided a $3.9 million letter of credit. Solutia had provided a similar letter of credit in the amount of $10.0 million supporting its parallel obligation. No further keepwell payments were made in 2004. In the second half of 2003, Astaris began to implement its restructuring plan, and we recorded after-tax charges of $32.5 million primarily in connection with this plan. We recorded additional after-tax charges of $7.0 million during 2004 related to the Astaris restructuring. In support of the Astaris restructuring plan we and Solutia agreed to defer until September 2005 a total of up to approximately $30.0 million each in payments anticipated from Astaris. As of December 31, 2004, we had deferred $15.9 million in payments from Astaris under this program. In December 2003, to accommodate the financial effects on us of the Astaris restructuring plan, we were successful in obtaining favorable amendments to certain covenants in our 2002 credit facilities. Along with the favorable covenant amendments, the lenders under our 2002 credit facilities agreed to reduce the applicable margin under the term loan facility by 2.25 percent per annum. In June 2004, we received approval from our lenders for a further reduction of 0.75 percent per annum in the applicable margin under the term loan facility. In February 2005, Astaris refinanced its credit agreement and entered into a new $75.0 million revolving credit agreement with a group of lenders. In connection with this refinancing, all amounts due to us and Solutia that had previously been deferred (approximately $16 million each) were repaid, our obligation to make keepwell payments terminated, and our letters of credit in the amount of $10.0 million previously delivered in support of this obligation were cancelled. In connection with Astaris new revolving credit agreement, Solutia and we consented, subject to approval, expected in March 2005, of Solutia consent by the bankruptcy court overseeing Solutia Chapter 11 petition 41 Table of Contents (as described below), to certain restrictions imposed by the revolving credit agreement on the ability of Astaris to make certain payments to us and Solutia. These restrictions relate to the absence of a default by Astaris, achievement of a minimum EBITDA threshold (as defined in the Astaris credit agreement) for the most recent four-quarter period and minimum borrowing availability. It is possible that these restrictions would delay some payments due to FMC from Astaris, although we do not anticipate that any deferrals in 2005 would exceed $10 million. The previously agreed upon deferral agreement among Astaris, Solutia and us in support of the Astaris restructuring plan was terminated, also subject to bankruptcy court approval. In December 2003, Solutia filed a petition in the Southern District of New York under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. Since no plan of reorganization has been proposed as yet, it is unclear what effect, if any, Solutia filing will have on our interest in Astaris. Astaris has reported to date, that Solutia has substantially fulfilled its contractual financial obligations to Astaris. However, Solutia, Astaris and we are parties to several agreements, including those under which Solutia manufactures certain phosphorus chemicals for Astaris. If Solutia fails to perform its contractual obligations or seeks to reject these executory contracts with Astaris, Astaris may have to seek alternate sources of supply. Under these circumstances, Astaris may have a damage claim against Solutia. There currently does not appear to be a need for future financial support by Solutia to Astaris. However, if in the future Astaris requires additional support from both its owners that Solutia could not fulfill, this failure may in turn adversely affect Astaris and our investment in the joint venture. We provide guarantees to financial institutions on behalf of certain Agricultural Products customers, principally in Brazil, for their seasonal borrowing. Amounts recorded on our consolidated balance sheets as guarantees of vendor financing for December 31, 2004 and 2003 were $70.1 million and $44.3 million, respectively. On June 30, 1999, we acquired the assets of Tg Soda Ash, Inc. from Elf Atochem North America, Inc. ( Elf Atochem ) for approximately $51.0 million in cash and a contingent payment due at year-end 2003 based on the financial performance of the combined soda ash operations between 2001 and 2003. On December 31, 2003, we made the required estimated payment in the amount of $32.4 million based upon contract requirements. This payment is subject to final adjustments based upon the audited financial statements of the business. We do not expect this adjustment to result in any additional material payments. We continually evaluate our options for divesting real estate holdings and property, plant and equipment that are no longer integral to any of our core operating businesses. On February 17, 2005, we completed the sale to the city of San Jose, California of approximately 52 acres of land at our former Defense Systems site there. Gross proceeds from the sale were $56.2 million and net proceeds after estimated offsets, fees and expenses were approximately $50 million in the first quarter of 2005. We have an agreement with the city of San Jose for the sale of the remaining approximately 23 acres we own there. The city obligation to purchase the remaining land is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including a review by the California Department of Toxic Substances Control. Projected 2005 spending includes approximately $62 million of environmental remediation spending, of which approximately $20 million relates to Pocatello, approximately $17 million relates to the settlement of NPL sites in New Jersey, and approximately $25 million relates to other operating and discontinued business sites. This spending does not include expected spending of approximately $17 million and $7 million in 2005 and 2006, respectively, on capital projects relating to environmental control facilities. Also, we expect to spend in the range of approximately $22 million to $23 million annually in 2005 and in 2006 for environmental compliance costs, which are an operating cost of the company and are not covered by established reserves. We agreed to guarantee the performance by Technologies of certain obligations under several contracts, debt instruments, and reimbursement agreements associated with letters of credit. (See Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K.) As of December 31, 2004, these guaranteed obligations totaled $4.0 million compared to $6.8 million at December 31, 2003. We also guarantee repayment of some of the borrowings of certain foreign equity method investments. The other investment owners provided parallel agreements. As of December 31, 2004, these guarantees had maximum potential payments of $6.4 million. 42 Table of Contents At December 31, 2004 and 2003, there was $41.0 million of principal amount outstanding of variable-rate industrial and pollution control revenue bonds supported by $43.3 million in bank letters of credit. In 2003, these letters of credit were fully collateralized with cash included as part of restricted cash on the consolidated balance sheet. Concurrently with the execution of the 2004 Credit Agreement, the cash collateral was released. Short-term debt consisted primarily of foreign credit lines at December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003. We provide parent-company guarantees to lending institutions providing credit to our foreign subsidiaries. Our total significant committed contracts that we believe will affect cash over the next four years and beyond are as follows: Contractual Commitments Expected Cash Payments by Year 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 & beyond Total (in Millions) Debt maturities (1) $ 101.0 $ 10.9 $ 62.5 $ 87.7 $ 664.8 $ 926.9 Contractual interest (2) 65.4 63.6 60.5 55.8 226.6 471.9 Lease obligations (3) 27.8 26.7 21.4 20.3 134.7 230.9 Forward energy and foreign exchange contracts 2.9 1.3 4.2 Purchase Obligations (4) 55.2 13.1 68.3 Total $ 252.3 $ 115.6 $ 144.4 $ 163.8 $ 1,026.1 $ 1,702.2 (1) Excluding discounts. (2) Contractual interest is the interest we are contracted to pay on our long-term debt obligations without taking into account the interest impact of interest rate swaps related to any of this debt, which at current rates would reduce contractual interest. We had $143.0 million of long-term debt subject to variable interest rates at December 31, 2004, excluding the effect of interest rate swaps. The rate assumed for the variable interest component of the contractual interest obligation was the rate in effect at December 31, 2004. Variable rates are market determined. (3) Before recoveries. (4) Purchase obligations consist of agreements to purchase goods and services that are enforceable and legally binding on us and specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, price provisions and timing of the transaction. We have entered into a number of purchase obligations for the sourcing of materials and energy where take-or-pay arrangements apply. Since the majority of the minimum obligations under these contracts are take-or-pay commitments over the life of the contract as opposed to a year by year take-or-pay, the obligations in the table related to these types of contacts are presented in the earliest period in which the minimum obligation could be payable under these types of contracts. Contingencies During the second quarter of 2004, we reached agreement in principle with the EPA and the DOJ to settle certain liabilities at two environmental remediation sites in New Jersey. These agreements will be effective upon negotiation and entry of a final consent decree. On October 14, 2003, Solutia, our joint venture partner in Astaris (see Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements in the Form 10-K), filed a lawsuit against us with the Circuit Court of St. Louis County, Missouri claiming that, among other things, we had breached our joint venture agreement due to the alleged failure of the PPA technology we contributed to Astaris. Solutia dismissed this Missouri lawsuit in February 2004, after it had filed a virtually identical lawsuit in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in the Southern District of New York, where its Chapter 11 case is pending. Our motion to remove the lawsuit from Bankruptcy Court was granted on June 18, 2004, and the matter is now pending in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. 43 Table of Contents On January 28, 2005 we and our wholly owned subsidiary Foret received a Statement of Objections from the European Commission concerning alleged violations of competition law in the hydrogen peroxide business in Europe during the period 1994 to 2001. All of the significant European hydrogen peroxide producers also received the Statement of Objections. We also received a subpoena for documents from a grand jury sitting in the Northern District of California, which is investigating anticompetitive conduct in the hydrogen peroxide business in the United States during the period 1994 through 2003. At this time, we do not believe the investigations are related. In connection with these two matters, in February 2005 punitive class action complaints were filed against all of the U.S. hydrogen peroxide producers in various federal courts alleging violations of antitrust laws. Related cases were also filed in various state courts. We are also party to another antitrust class action pending in Federal Court in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, as well as various related state court cases alleging violations of antitrust laws involving our microcrystalline cellulose product. Dividends We paid no cash dividends in 2004, 2003 or 2002 and we do not expect to pay dividends in 2005.
