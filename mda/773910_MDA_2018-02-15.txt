Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read together with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements , which are included in this Form 10-K in Item 8, and the information set forth in Risk Factors under Item 1A. Index Page Management Overview 54 Financial Results 58 Liquidity and Capital Resources 70 Critical Accounting Estimates 78 Recent Accounting Developments 83 MANAGEMENT OVERVIEW Anadarko strategy is to explore for, develop, and commercialize resources globally; ensure health, safety, and environmental excellence; focus on financial discipline, flexibility, and value creation; and demonstrate the Company core values in all its business activities. The Company revenues, operating results, cash flows from operations, capital spending, and future growth rates are highly dependent on commodity prices, which affect the value the Company receives from its sales of oil, natural gas, and NGLs. Over the last several years, Anadarko has actively managed its portfolio to focus on higher-return, oil-levered opportunities, namely in the Delaware and DJ basins in the U.S. onshore and the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Anadarko has divested non-core gas-focused assets while also completing the GOM Acquisition in late 2016, which doubled the Company production in the Gulf of Mexico and strengthened its infrastructure and tie-back inventory. As a result of this portfolio transformation, the Company overall sales-volume product mix increased to 53% oil in 2017, compared to 40% in 2016, which significantly improved margins and returns. 54 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements 2018 Outlook The Company 2018 capital program is designed to enhance shareholder value by delivering an attractive cash return on invested capital in a $50 oil (for both WTI and Brent) and $3 natural gas (Henry Hub) price environment while advancing the development of the Company core assets. If realized commodity prices are above investment assumptions, Anadarko plans to focus on returning value directly to the stockholders versus material increases to activity, capital expenditures, and greater production volume. The Company demonstrated this focus in February 2018, by announcing a 400% increase in the quarterly cash dividend to $0.25 per share, a $500 million expansion of its share-repurchase program, and its intent to reduce outstanding indebtedness by more than $1.0 billion by retiring 2018 and 2019 Anadarko debt maturities. Anadarko currently estimates a 2018 initial capital spending range of $4.1 billion to $4.5 billion, excluding WES capital spending of approximately $1.0 billion to $1.1 billion. The Company has currently allocated approximately 86% of its 2018 capital spending budget to the U.S. onshore upstream and midstream and deepwater Gulf of Mexico; 8% to future value areas, which includes 5% to exploration and 3% to global LNG; 3% to international cash generation assets, such as oil projects in Algeria and Ghana; and 3% to corporate activities. The Company repositioned asset footprint and strong balance sheet are built to deliver through future commodity cycles. Delaware Basin Anadarko plans to allocate approximately $1.0 billion toward upstream and an additional $500 million toward Anadarko midstream investments. This program supports the continuation of the Company's efforts to build out one of the most expansive and integrated infrastructure positions in the region. The Company also is advancing its efforts to capture operatorship on 70% of its acreage position, primarily in Reeves and Loving counties. Additionally, Anadarko continues to progress the construction of three ROTFs to support its more cost-effective and environmentally beneficial tankless battery design field-wide, while also securing necessary gathering, processing, and takeaway capacity. This comprehensive build-out plan and phased development approach in the basin is expected to deliver incremental oil sales volumes during the second half of 2018, with total-year Delaware basin oil sales volumes expected to increase more than 50% relative to 2017. During 2018, the Company plans to average seven operated rigs and six completion crews. DJ Basin Anadarko expects to invest approximately $950 million on upstream activities and an additional $50 million toward Anadarko midstream investments. The Company has implemented a new completion design in the field, which has resulted in a 20% improvement in average well recovery . Anadarko expects to increase year-over-year oil sales volumes from the DJ basin by more than 30% and plans to average five operated rigs and three completions crews in the basin during the year. Deepwater Gulf of Mexico Anadarko expects to allocate approximately $1.0 billion toward its deepwater Gulf of Mexico operations. The majority of these investments are expected to be directed toward high-return oil development opportunities near operated infrastructure at Lucius, Horn Mountain, Marlin, Holstein, and Marco Polo. The Company plans to operate two floating drillships and one platform rig and spud approximately nine development wells in the Gulf of Mexico during the year. International Anadarko plans to allocate approximately $150 million toward its international cash-generating operations in Algeria and Ghana. These investments will support further drilling in the TEN development area, which is expected to commence in early 2018, as well as additional drilling operations in the Jubilee field following the Ghanaian government's recent approval of the full-field plan of development. Exploration The Company's exploration investments in 2018 are expected to total approximately $200 million. Exploration spending will primarily be focused on the Gulf of Mexico, where the Company plans to drill identified prospects near existing operated infrastructure with one floating drillship. The Company plans to allocate additional exploration investment to the U.S. onshore as it continues to identify future areas that could make a material and scalable addition to its portfolio. LNG The Company expects to invest approximately $150 million to advance the Mozambique LNG project toward FID. This includes funding Anadarko's portion of the costs associated with preparing the site of the future onshore LNG park. 55 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The Company announced a $2.5 billion share-repurchase program in September 2017, which was expanded to $3.0 billion in February 2018. The program is authorized through the end of 2018. During the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company repurchased 21.9 million shares for approximately $1.1 billion (average price of $48.33 per share) under an ASR Agreement and through open-market purchases. In February 2018, Anadarko completed a repurchase of 8.5 million shares for $500 million (average price of $58.82 per share) under an additional ASR Agreement. The Company plans to execute the remainder of the $3.0 Billion Share-Repurchase Program by the end of 2018. In the fourth quarter of 2017, in order to reduce commodity-price risk and increase the predictability of 2018 cash flows, the Company entered into strategic derivative positions covering approximately 50% of its anticipated oil sales volumes for 2018. The Company entered into two-way collars for 108 MBbls/d, consisting of a sold call at $60.48 and a purchased put at $50.00 as well as fixed price swaps for 84 MBbls/d at an average price of $61.45 . In January 2018, the Company entered into additional fixed-price swaps consisting of 280 MMBtu/d at an average price of $3.02 , increasing its coverage to slightly more than 50% of its anticipated 2018 natural-gas sales volumes. See Note 10 Derivative Instruments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Subsequent to year end, the Company divested its nonoperated interest in Alaska for net proceeds of $383 million . The transaction is subject to regulatory approval. 2017 Overview To effectively manage the influence of potential commodity-price volatility, Anadarko continued to optimize and further concentrate its portfolio on higher-return, oil-levered opportunities in areas where it possesses both scale and competitive advantages, namely the Delaware and DJ basins in the U.S. onshore and deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Much of the 2017 operational and investment focus was preparing the Delaware basin for development with increased operatorship and infrastructure to facilitate long-term growth and value. On December 22, 2017, the Tax Reform Legislation was signed into law. The Company recognized a one-time deferred tax benefit of $1.2 billion, inclusive of a $236 million increase to the Company valuation allowance on its foreign tax credit carryforwards, due to the remeasurement of its U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the 21% corporate tax rate. The Company did not recognize U.S. income tax expense related to the deemed repatriation of its foreign income as required by the new legislation as any U.S. taxes will be offset with foreign tax credits. In a $60 WTI price environment, the Tax Reform Legislation is expected to reduce the Company 2018 cash taxes by approximately $200 million. Following a home explosion in Firestone, Colorado in April 2017, the Company took precautionary measures to shut in all operated vertical wells in the DJ basin to conduct additional inspections. It subsequently tested and permanently plugged, abandoned, and capped all one-inch return lines associated with these wells. In May 2017, the Colorado Oil & Gas Conservation Commission issued a two-phase Notice to Operators (NTO) requiring all operators to inventory and integrity test existing flowlines within 1,000 feet of a building unit and abandon all inactive flowlines in such areas. During the third quarter, the Company substantially completed the requirements of the NTO. In August 2017, following a three-month review of oil and gas operations, the Governor of Colorado announced several policy initiatives designed to enhance public safety, which are to be implemented through rulemaking or legislation. The Company continues to work cooperatively with state regulators and others and is also cooperating with the NTSB in its investigation related to the accident. 56 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Significant 2017 operating and financial activities include the following: Total Company The Company oil sales volumes averaged 355 MBbls/d, representing a 12% increase from 2016 , primarily due to increased volumes from the Gulf of Mexico, partially offset by the divestiture of certain U.S. onshore assets in 2017 and 2016. The Company overall sales-volume product mix increased to 53% oil in 2017 , compared to 40% in 2016 , which significantly improved margins and returns. U.S. Onshore Total sales volumes in the Delaware basin averaged 63 MBOE/d, representing a 41% increase from 2016 , and oil sales volumes in the Delaware basin increased 13 MBbls/d, representing a 52% increase from 2016 , primarily due to continued drilling and completion activities. WES acquired a third party 50% nonoperated interest in the DBJV System in exchange for WES 33.75% interest in nonoperated Marcellus midstream assets and $155 million in cash. The Company received net proceeds of approximately $4.0 billion from divestitures of certain U.S. onshore assets during 2017. Gulf of Mexico Oil sales volumes averaged 121 MBbls/d, representing an 85% increase from 2016 , primarily due to the GOM Acquisition and continued tie-back activity at several facilities, partially offset by deferred production as a result of Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Nate and nonoperated field downtime during the second half of 2017. International The International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea issued a ruling in September 2017 regarding the delimitation of the maritime boundary between Ghana and C te d Ivoire in the Atlantic Ocean. The new maritime boundary as determined by the tribunal does not affect the TEN fields, and the operator now plans to resume development drilling in early 2018. Interim spread mooring of the FPSO at the Jubilee field in Ghana commenced in the fourth quarter of 2016 and was completed during the first quarter of 2017. In early 2018, the operator will start the first of three shutdown periods that are expected to occur in 2018 to effectively stabilize the turret and rotate the FPSO to its permanent heading. In October, the partnership received Ghanaian Government approval for the full-field plan of development, with drilling operations expected to commence in 2018. During the third quarter of 2017, the foundational legal and contractual framework was completed for the Company onshore LNG project in Mozambique. Anadarko commenced resettlement and site preparation activities, which will position the onshore area for construction of the LNG facilities. Anadarko and its co-venturers in Offshore Area 1 in Mozambique reached agreement on the project first long-term sale and purchase agreement for 2.6 MTPA with Thailand national oil and gas company, subject to the approval of the Government of Thailand. Financial The Company generated $4.0 billion of cash flow from operations and ended 2017 with $4.6 billion of cash. Prior to the end of 2017, the Company completed $1.1 billion of the share repurchases. In February 2018, the Company completed an additional $500 million of share repurchases. The Company recognized a one-time deferred tax benefit of $1.2 billion as a result of the Tax Reform Legislation. 57 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements FINANCIAL RESULTS millions except per-share amounts 2017 2016 2015 Oil, natural-gas, and NGLs sales $ 8,969 $ 7,153 $ 8,260 Gathering, processing, and marketing sales 2,000 1,294 1,226 Gains (losses) on divestitures and other, net 939 (578 ) (788 ) Revenues and other $ 11,908 $ 7,869 $ 8,698 Costs and expenses 12,580 10,468 17,507 Other (income) expense 1,016 1,230 880 Income tax expense (benefit) (1,477 ) (1,021 ) (2,877 ) Net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders $ (456 ) $ (3,071 ) $ (6,692 ) Net income (loss) per common share attributable to common stockholders diluted $ (0.85 ) $ (5.90 ) $ (13.18 ) Average number of common shares outstanding diluted 548 522 508 The following discussion pertains to Anadarko results of operations, financial condition, and changes in financial condition. Any increases or decreases for the year ended December 31, 2017 , refer to the comparison of the year ended December 31, 2017 , to the year ended December 31, 2016 . Similarly, any increases or decreases for the year ended December 31, 2016 , refer to the comparison of the year ended December 31, 2016 , to the year ended December 31, 2015 . The primary factors that affect the Company results of operations include commodity prices for oil, natural gas, and NGLs; sales volumes; the cost of finding and developing such reserves; and operating costs. 58 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Revenues and Sales Volumes millions Oil Natural Gas NGLs Total 2016 sales revenues $ 4,668 $ 1,564 $ 921 $ 7,153 Changes associated with prices 1,334 373 358 2,065 Changes associated with sales volumes 550 (589 ) (210 ) (249 ) 2017 sales revenues $ 6,552 $ 1,348 $ 1,069 $ 8,969 Increase/(decrease) vs. 2016 40 % (14 )% 16 % 25 % 2015 sales revenues $ 5,420 $ 2,007 $ 833 $ 8,260 Changes associated with prices (745 ) (241 ) 95 (891 ) Changes associated with sales volumes (7 ) (202 ) (7 ) (216 ) 2016 sales revenues $ 4,668 $ 1,564 $ 921 $ 7,153 Increase/(decrease) vs. 2015 (14 )% (22 )% 11 % (13 )% For 2017, the above table illustrates the effect of increases in commodity prices and changes associated with sales volumes. Sales volume changes during 2017 included increases related to assets acquired in the Gulf of Mexico in December 2016 (primarily oil) and decreases associated with U.S. onshore asset divestitures (primarily natural gas). For 2016, decreases in commodity prices were the main driver for the decrease in revenues. The following provides Anadarko sales volumes for the years ended December 31: 2017 Inc (Dec) vs. 2016 2016 Inc (Dec) vs. 2015 2015 Barrels of Oil Equivalent (MMBOE except percentages) United States 211 (18 )% 257 (5 )% 272 International 34 3 33 (1 ) 33 Total barrels of oil equivalent 245 (16 ) 290 (5 ) 305 Barrels of Oil Equivalent per Day (MBOE/d except percentages) United States 579 (18 )% 704 (5 )% 745 International 93 4 89 (1 ) 91 Total barrels of oil equivalent per day 672 (15 ) 793 (5 ) 836 Sales volumes represent actual production volumes adjusted for changes in commodity inventories as well as natural-gas production volumes provided to satisfy a commitment under the Jubilee development plan in Ghana. Anadarko employs marketing strategies to minimize market-related shut-ins, maximize realized prices, and manage credit-risk exposure. For additional information, see Note 10 Derivative Instruments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Production of oil, natural gas, and NGLs is usually not affected by seasonal swings in demand. 59 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Oil Sales Revenues, Average Prices, and Volumes 2017 Inc (Dec) vs. 2016 2016 Inc (Dec) vs. 2015 2015 Oil sales revenues (millions) $ 6,552 40 % $ 4,668 (14 )% $ 5,420 United States Sales volumes MMBbls 97 14 % 85 1 % 85 MBbls/d 266 14 233 1 232 Price per barrel $ 49.62 27 $ 39.06 (13 ) $ 45.00 International Sales volumes MMBbls 32 6 % 31 (2 )% 31 MBbls/d 89 6 83 (2 ) 85 Price per barrel $ 53.77 22 $ 43.93 (15 ) $ 51.68 Total Sales volumes MMBbls 129 12 % 116 % 116 MBbls/d 355 12 316 317 Price per barrel $ 50.66 26 $ 40.34 (14 ) $ 46.79 The following summarizes primary drivers for the change in oil sales revenues: millions Change in Revenues Due to Change in Prices Due to Change in Volumes 2017 vs. 2016 $ 1,884 $ 1,334 $ 550 2016 vs. 2015 (752 ) (745 ) (7 ) Oil Prices The average oil price Anadarko received decreased from 2015 through late 2016, primarily due to continued high petroleum inventories globally and stronger supply growth from OPEC. Oil prices increased in late 2016 through 2017 primarily due to the expectation of decreasing global oversupply as a result of OPEC agreement to reduce production through the end of 2018. 60 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Oil Sales Volumes 2017 vs. 2016 The Company oil sales volumes increased by 39 MBbls/d, primarily due to the following: U.S. Onshore Sales volumes for the Delaware basin increased by 13 MBbls/d, primarily due to continued drilling and completion activities in 2017. Divestitures resulted in a decrease in sales volumes of 29 MBbls/d, primarily related to the sale of the Eagleford assets in the first half of 2017. Gulf of Mexico Sales volumes increased by 56 MBbls/d, primarily due to the GOM Acquisition in December 2016 and continued tie-back activity at several facilities, partially offset by deferred production as a result of Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Nate and nonoperated field downtime during the second half of 2017. International Sales volumes for Ghana increased by 9 MBbls/d, primarily due to a full year of liftings from the TEN development project, which came online late in the third quarter of 2016, and downtime in 2016 to address new production and offtake procedures resulting from issues associated with the Jubilee field FPSO turret bearing. Shuttle tankers are conducting offtakes until the facility is permanently moored. 2016 vs. 2015 The Company oil sales volumes remained relatively flat. U.S. Onshore Sales volumes for the Delaware basin increased by 8 MBbls/d, primarily due to continued field development. Sales volumes for the DJ basin decreased by 6 MBbls/d, primarily due to reduced capital activity. Sales volumes decreased by 7 MBbls/d, primarily due to the sale of EOR assets in the first half of 2015 and the East Chalk and Wamsutter assets in the first half of 2016. Gulf of Mexico Sales volumes increased by 12 MBbls/d, primarily due to new wells coming online at K2 Complex and Caesar/Tonga in the first half of 2016, an increased flow rate at Lucius, and the achievement of first oil at Heidelberg in January 2016. International Sales volumes for Ghana decreased by 7 MBbls/d, primarily due to downtime during 2016 to address new production and offtake procedures resulting from issues associated with the Jubilee field FPSO turret bearing. Shuttle tankers are conducting offtakes until the facility is permanently moored. The decrease in volumes at Jubilee were partially offset by TEN coming online late in the third quarter of 2016. 61 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Natural-Gas Sales Revenues, Volumes, and Average Prices 2017 Inc (Dec) vs. 2016 2016 Inc (Dec) vs. 2015 2015 Natural-gas sales revenues (millions) $ 1,348 (14 )% $ 1,564 (22 )% $ 2,007 United States Sales volumes Bcf 478 (38 )% 766 (10 )% 852 MMcf/d 1,309 (37 ) 2,093 (10 ) 2,334 Price per Mcf $ 2.82 38 $ 2.04 (14 ) $ 2.36 The following summarizes primary drivers for the change in natural-gas sales revenues: millions Change in Revenues Due to Change in Prices Due to Change in Volumes 2017 vs. 2016 $ (216 ) $ 373 $ (589 ) 2016 vs. 2015 (443 ) (241 ) (202 ) Natural-Gas Prices The average natural-gas price Anadarko received decreased from 2015 through late 2016, primarily due to high gas storage levels in 2016. The increase in storage levels was a result of strong production growth in 2015 coupled with lower weather-driven residential and commercial demand in late 2015 and early 2016. This decrease was slightly offset by an increase in exports to Mexico throughout 2015 and 2016. The price increased year-over-year from 2016 to 2017 primarily due to a reduction of natural-gas storage industry-wide resulting from production declines across the industry from mid-2016 through early 2017 and stable exports to Mexico throughout 2017. Natural-Gas Sales Volumes 2017 vs. 2016 The Company natural-gas sales volumes decreased by 784 MMcf/d, primarily due to the sale of the Marcellus and Eagleford assets in the first half of 2017, the Carthage and Elm Grove assets in the second half of 2016, and the Wamsutter assets in the first half of 2016. 2016 vs. 2015 The Company natural-gas sales volumes decreased by 241 MMcf/d primarily due to the following: U.S. Onshore Sales volumes for the DJ basin increased by 98 MMcf/d, primarily due to improved performance. Sales volumes for the Delaware basin increased by 18 MMcf/d, primarily due to continued field development. Sales volumes decreased by 290 MMcf/d, primarily due to the sale of the Powder River Basin CBM assets and the Freestone assets in the second half of 2015, the Carthage assets in the second half of 2016, and the Wamsutter assets in the first half of 2016. Gulf of Mexico Sales volumes decreased by 61 MMcf/d, primarily as a result of the last producing well at Independence Hub going off line in December 2015. 62 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Natural-Gas Liquids Sales Revenues, Volumes, and Average Prices 2017 Inc (Dec) vs. 2016 2016 Inc (Dec) vs. 2015 2015 Natural-gas liquids sales revenues (millions) $ 1,069 16 % $ 921 11 % $ 833 Total Sales volumes MMBbls (1) 36 (23 )% 46 (1 )% 47 MBbls/d (2) 99 (23 ) 128 (1 ) 130 Price per barrel $ 29.54 50 $ 19.64 12 $ 17.61 _______________________________________________________________________________ (1) The percentage of NGLs sales volumes from the U.S. was 94% in 2017 and 96% in 2016 and 2015. (2) The percentage of daily NGLs sales volumes from the U.S. was 96% in 2017 and 95% in 2016 and 2015.

NGLs Sales Volumes 2017 vs. 2016 The Company NGLs sales volumes decreased by 29 MBbls/d, primarily due to the sale of the Eagleford assets in the first half of 2017 and the Carthage assets in the second half of 2016. 2016 vs. 2015 The Company NGLs sales volumes were relatively flat. 63 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Gathering, Processing, and Marketing millions except percentages 2017 Inc (Dec) vs. 2016 2016 Inc (Dec) vs. 2015 2015 Gathering, processing, and marketing sales $ 2,000 55 % $ 1,294 6 % $ 1,226 Gathering, processing, and marketing expense 1,560 44 1,087 3 1,054 Total gathering, processing, and marketing, net $ 440 113 $ 207 20 $ 172 Gathering and processing sales include revenue from the sale of NGLs and remaining residue gas extracted from natural gas purchased from third parties and processed by Anadarko as well as fee revenue earned by providing gathering, processing, compression, and treating services to third parties. Gathering and processing expense includes the cost of third-party natural gas purchased and processed by Anadarko as well as other operating and transportation expenses related to the Company costs to perform gathering and processing activities. Beginning in 2018, gathering and processing sales and expenses are expected to be impacted by ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information. Marketing sales include the margin earned from purchasing and selling third-party oil and natural gas. Marketing expense includes transportation and other operating expenses related to the Company costs to perform marketing activities. 2017 vs. 2016 Gathering, processing, and marketing, net increased by $233 million . This increase primarily related to higher throughput volumes and prices at the DBM Complex due to increased processing capacity from the start-up of newly constructed facilities in May and October 2016 and previously existing facilities returning to service after the 2016 outage at the DBM Complex. 2016 vs. 2015 Gathering, processing, and marketing, net increased by $35 million. This increase primarily related to higher gas and NGLs throughput volumes at the DJ basin and DBM Complex.

Oil and gas transportation expenses per BOE increased by $0.27 primarily due to increased oil and natural-gas transportation rates at DJ basin. 2016 vs. 2015 Oil and gas transportation expenses decreased by $115 million due to overall lower natural-gas sales volumes attributable to divestitures. Oil and gas transportation expenses per BOE decreased by $0.20 primarily due to lower costs as a result of lower natural-gas sales volumes.

The unproved property balance related to the Shenandoah project originated from the purchase price allocated to the Gulf of Mexico exploration projects from the acquisition of Kerr McGee Corporation in 2006. For additional details on the Shenandoah project, see Note 6 Suspended Exploratory Well Costs in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. The Company recognized $88 million of impairments of unproved international properties. 2016 The Company recognized a $72 million impairment of unproved properties in the Gulf of Mexico and $92 million for unproved international properties, primarily in Brazil and Tunisia, due to the Company current intentions to not pursue future exploration activities. 2015 The Company recognized a $935 million impairment of unproved Greater Natural Buttes properties and a $66 million impairment of an unproved Gulf of Mexico property as a result of lower commodity prices. The Company recognized a $109 million impairment of unproved Utica properties resulting from an assignment of mineral interests in settlement of a legal matter.

Income Tax Expense (Benefit) Total income taxes differed from the amounts computed by applying the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate to income (loss) before income taxes. The following summarizes the sources of these differences for the years ended December 31: millions except percentages 2017 2016 2015 Income tax expense (benefit) $ (1,477 ) $ (1,021 ) $ (2,877 ) Income (loss) before income taxes $ (1,688 ) $ (3,829 ) $ (9,689 ) Effective tax rate 88 % 27 % 30 % In 2017, as a result of the Tax Reform Legislation, the Company recognized a one-time deferred tax benefit of $1.2 billion primarily due to the remeasurement of its U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities, resulting in an 88% effective tax rate. Excluding this one-time benefit, the Company effective tax rate would have been 18%. The Company effective tax rate is impacted each year by the relative pretax income earned by the Company operations in the U.S., Algeria, and the rest of the world. Additionally, the Company effective tax rate is typically impacted by state income taxes (net of federal benefit), non-deductible Algerian exceptional profits tax for Algerian income tax purposes, net changes in uncertain tax positions, and dispositions of non-deductible goodwill. Excluding the one-time benefit related to the Tax Reform Legislation in 2017, the Company effective tax rate decreased from 27% in 2016 to 18% in 2017, primarily due to the higher-taxed income earned in Algeria relative to the Company pretax losses in the U.S. and Ghana as well as the impact of international exploration pretax losses with no associated tax benefit. The Company effective tax rate decreased from 30% in 2015 to 27% in 2016 primarily due to the reversal of non-deductible goodwill due to asset divestitures in 2016. The Company generated a net operating loss in 2016 and filed a carryback claim for a tax refund of $159 million , which was received in December 2017. The Company received an $881 million tentative refund in 2016 related to its $5.2 billion Tronox settlement payment in 2015. The IRS has issued a draft notice of proposed adjustment denying the deductibility of the settlement payment. If the payment is ultimately determined to not be deductible, the Company would be required to repay the tentative refund previously received plus interest, and the Company would be required to reverse the net benefit of $346 million previously recognized in its financial statements. For additional information on income taxes, see Note 13 Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. 69 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES millions 2017 2016 2015 Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ 4,009 $ 3,000 $ (1,877 ) Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities (1,028 ) (2,762 ) (4,771 ) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities (1,613 ) 2,008 220 Overview The Company has a variety of funding sources available, including cash, an asset portfolio that provides ongoing cash-flow-generating capacity, opportunities for liquidity enhancement through divestitures and joint-venture arrangements that reduce future capital expenditures, the Company credit facilities, and access to both debt and equity capital markets. In addition, an effective registration statement is available to Anadarko covering the sale of WGP common units owned by the Company. WGP and WES function with capital structures that are separate from Anadarko, consisting of their own debt instruments and publicly traded common units. During 2017, Anadarko received net proceeds of $4.0 billion from divestitures, primarily related to the sale of the Company Eagleford, Marcellus, Eaglebine, Utah CBM, and Moxa assets. As of December 31, 2017 , Anadarko had $4.6 billion of cash plus $5.0 billion of borrowing capacity under its RCFs. In January 2018, the Company received net proceeds of $383 million from the divestiture of its nonoperated interest in Alaska. Anadarko believes that its current available cash and anticipated operating cash flows will be sufficient to fund the Company projected long-term operational and capital programs as well as to fund the increase in dividends to $0.25 per share, to repurchase the remaining shares under the $3.0 Billion Share-Repurchase Program by the end of 2018, and to retire Anadarko debt maturing in 2018 and 2019. In a $60 WTI price environment, the Tax Reform Legislation is expected to reduce the Company 2018 cash taxes by approximately $200 million. The Company continuously monitors its liquidity position and evaluates available funding alternatives in light of current and expected conditions. Credit Rating As of December 31, 2017 , the Company long-term debt was rated investment grade (BBB) by both S&P and Fitch and below investment grade (Ba1) by Moody s. As a result of Moody rating, Anadarko is more likely to be required to post collateral in the form of letters of credit or cash under certain contractual arrangements such as derivative instruments, pipeline transportation contracts, and oil and gas sales contracts. Collateral related to credit-risk-related contingent features for which a net liability position existed was $170 million at December 31, 2017 , and $117 million at December 31, 2016 . For more information on credit-risk considerations, see Note 10 Derivative Instruments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. The amount of letters of credit or cash provided as assurance of the Company performance under pipeline transportation contracts and oil and gas sales contracts with respect to credit-risk-related contingent features was $263 million at December 31, 2017 , and $274 million at December 31, 2016 . 70 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Operating Activities One of the primary sources of variability in the Company cash flows from operating activities is the fluctuation in commodity prices, the impact of which Anadarko partially mitigates by periodically entering into commodity derivatives. Sales volume changes also impact cash flow but historically have not been as volatile as commodity prices. Anadarko cash flows from operating activities are also impacted by the costs related to operations and interest payments related to the Company outstanding debt. Cash flows from operating activities for 2016 were impacted by several significant items, including the $159.5 million payment of the Clean Water Act (CWA) penalty, $247 million related to severance costs and retirement benefits paid in connection with the workforce reduction program, and the receipt of an $881 million tax refund related to the income tax benefit associated with the Company 2015 tax net operating loss carryback. Excluding these 2016 items, cash flows from operating activities for 2017 were $1.5 billion higher compared to 2016 , primarily as a result of higher sales revenues due to the impact of higher commodity prices. Cash flows from operating activities for 2015 were impacted by the $5.2 billion Tronox settlement payment. Excluding the Tronox settlement payment in 2015 and the significant 2016 items mentioned above, cash flows from operating activities for 2016 were $813 million lower compared to 2015 , primarily as a result of lower sales revenues due to the impact of lower commodity prices. See Note 13 Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for discussion related to the potential repayment of the 2016 tax refund. Pension and Other Postretirement Contributions Contributions to the pension and other postretirement plans were $276 million in 2017, $120 million in 2016, and $58 million in 2015. The Company expects to contribute $152 million in 2018 to its pension and other postretirement plans. Investing Activities Capital Expenditures The following presents the Company capital expenditures: millions 2017 2016 2015 Cash Flows from Investing Activities Additions to properties and equipment (1) $ 5,031 $ 3,505 $ 6,067 Adjustments for capital expenditures Changes in capital accruals 275 (205 ) (226 ) Other (6 ) 14 47 Total capital expenditures (2) $ 5,300 $ 3,314 $ 5,888 Exploration and Production and other capital expenditures $ 3,886 $ 2,764 $ 5,118 WES Midstream capital expenditures 956 491 525 Other Midstream capital expenditures 458 59 245 _______________________________________________________________________________ (1) Additions to properties and equipment as presented within Anadarko cash flows from investing activities include cash payments for cost of properties, equipment, and facilities. The cost of properties includes the initial capitalization of drilling costs associated with all exploratory wells, whether or not they were deemed to have a commercially sufficient quantity of proved reserves. (2) Capital expenditures exclude the FPSO capital lease asset; see Financing Activities Capital Lease Obligations below. 71 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements 2017 vs. 2016 The Company capital expenditures increased by $2.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017 . Exploration and Production capital expenditures increased primarily due to higher development costs of $917 million driven by increased U.S. onshore drilling activity primarily in the DJ basin and operatorship capture in the Delaware basin as well as higher exploration costs of $363 million primarily driven by U.S. onshore acreage acquisitions and $172 million primarily due to exploration drilling in the Gulf of Mexico. These increases were partially offset by decreased development costs of $227 million driven by the TEN development project in Ghana, which achieved first oil in the third quarter of 2016. WES Midstream capital expenditures increased primarily due to $465 million related to the development of assets primarily in the Delaware and DJ basins. Other Midstream capital expenditures increased $399 million due to asset development primarily in the Delaware basin. 2016 vs. 2015 The Company capital expenditures decreased by $2.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016 . Exploration and Production capital expenditures decreased primarily due to reduced development and exploration activity, resulting in decreased development costs of $2.1 billion primarily in the U.S. onshore and decreased exploration costs of $432 million primarily in the U.S. onshore, Colombia, and Mozambique. These decreases were partially offset by increased exploration costs of $251 million primarily due to exploration drilling in the Gulf of Mexico and C te d Ivoire. Other Midstream capital expenditures decreased by $186 million and WES Midstream capital expenditures decreased by $34 million primarily due to reduced development activity. Property Exchange On March 17, 2017, WES acquired a third party 50% nonoperated interest in the DBJV System in exchange for WES 33.75% interest in nonoperated Marcellus midstream assets and $155 million in cash. WES funded the cash consideration with cash on hand and recognized a gain of $126 million as a result of this transaction. After the acquisition, the DBJV System is 100% owned by WES and consolidated by Anadarko.

In September 2016, Anadarko completed a public offering of 40.5 million shares of its common stock for net proceeds of $2.16 billion . Net proceeds were primarily used to fund the GOM Acquisition, with the remainder used for general corporate purposes. Anadarko sold 12.5 million of its WGP common units to the public for net proceeds of $476 million in 2016 and 2.3 million WGP common units to the public for net proceeds of $130 million in 2015. The proceeds for all periods were used for general corporate purposes. At December 31, 2017 , Anadarko owned 179 million WGP common units, which represents an 81.6% interest in WGP. During 2016, WES issued 22 million Series A Preferred units to private investors for net proceeds of $687 million . In July 2017, WES filed a registration statement with the SEC for the issuance of up to an aggregate of $500 million of WES common units under a continuous offering program that has not yet been initiated. Pursuant to WES registration statement filed with the SEC in August 2014 authorizing the issuance of up to an aggregate of $500 million of WES common units, WES issued approximately 874 thousand common units to the public and raised net proceeds of $57 million during 2015. The proceeds were used for general partnership purposes, including capital expenditures. During the second quarter of 2015, Anadarko issued 9.2 million 7.50% TEUs at a stated amount of $50.00 per TEU and raised net proceeds of $445 million. Each TEU is comprised of a prepaid equity purchase contract for WGP common units, subject to Anadarko right to elect to issue and deliver shares of Anadarko common stock in lieu of WGP common units, and a senior amortizing note due in June 2018. See Note 11 Tangible Equity Units in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information. Derivative Instruments Interest-rate swaps are used to fix or float interest rates on existing or anticipated indebtedness. The purpose of these instruments is to manage the Company existing or anticipated exposure to interest-rate changes. The fair value of the Company current interest-rate swap portfolio is subject to changes in interest rates. Net cash payments related to settlements and amendments of interest-rate swap agreements were $112 million in 2017 and $274 million in 2016 . For information on derivative instruments, including cash flow treatment, see Note 10 Derivative Instruments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Conveyance of Future Hard-Minerals Royalty Revenues During the first quarter of 2016, the Company conveyed a limited-term nonparticipating royalty interest in certain of its coal and trona leases to a third party for $413 million , net of transaction costs. The Company made payments for royalties of $50 million in 2017 and $25 million in 2016. For additional information on the cash flow treatment, expected timing, and scheduled payments of the conveyed royalties, see Note 15 Conveyance of Future Hard-Minerals Royalty Revenues in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Common Stock Dividends Anadarko paid dividends to its common stockholders of $111 million in 2017 , $105 million in 2016 , and $553 million in 2015 . In response to the commodity-price environment, the Company decreased the quarterly dividend from $0.27 per share to $0.05 per share in February 2016. In February 2018, the Company announced an increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.25 per share. Anadarko has paid a dividend to its common stockholders quarterly since becoming a public company in 1986. The amount of future dividends paid to Anadarko common stockholders is determined by the Board on a quarterly basis and is based on the Company earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, the effect a dividend payment would have on the Company compliance with relevant financial covenants, and other factors deemed relevant by the Board. 75 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Distributions to Noncontrolling Interest Owners Distributions to noncontrolling interest owners primarily relate to the following: millions 2017 2016 2015 WES distributions to unitholders (excluding Anadarko and WGP) (1) $ 326 $ 258 $ 231 WES distributions to Series A Preferred unitholders (2) 22 31 WGP distributions to unitholders (excluding Anadarko) (3) 81 59 37 __________________________________________________________________ (1) WES has made quarterly distributions to its unitholders since its IPO in the second quarter of 2008 and has increased its distribution from $0.30 per common unit for the third quarter of 2008 to $0.92 per common unit for the fourth quarter of 2017 (paid in February 2018 ). (2) WES made distributions of $0.68 per unit, prorated based on issuance date, to its Series A Preferred unitholders since the unit issuances in March and April 2016. As of June 30, 2017, all Series A Preferred units had converted into WES common units. See Note 23 Noncontrolling Interests in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. (3) WGP has made quarterly distributions to its unitholders since its IPO in December 2012 and has increased its distribution from $0.17875 per common unit for the first quarter of 2013 to $0.54875 per unit for the fourth quarter of 2017 (to be paid in February 2018 ). Insurance Coverage and Other Indemnities Anadarko maintains property and casualty insurance that includes coverage for physical damage to the Company properties, blowout/control of a well, restoration and redrill, sudden and accidental pollution, third-party liability, workers compensation and employers liability, and other risks. Anadarko insurance coverage includes deductibles that must be met prior to recovery. Additionally, the Company insurance is subject to exclusions and limitations, and there is no assurance that such coverage will adequately protect the Company against liability or loss from all potential consequences and damages. The Company current insurance coverage includes (a) $400 million per occurrence from Oil Insurance Limited (OIL) for physical damage to Anadarko properties on a replacement cost basis, blowout/control of well, restoration and redrill, and sudden and accidental pollution; (b) $1.2 billion per occurrence from the commercial markets for the items described in item (a) above, which is in excess of the OIL coverage and which follows the form of OIL coverage with certain exceptions; (c) $500 million from the commercial markets, which scales to Anadarko working interest, for third-party liabilities, including sudden and accidental pollution and aviation liability; and (d) $275 million for aircraft liability (in addition to the third-party liability limits described in item (c) above). Anadarko does not carry significant coverage for loss of production income from any of the Company facilities or for any losses that result from the effects of a named windstorm. The Company service agreements, including drilling contracts, generally indemnify Anadarko for injuries and death to employees of the service provider and subcontractors hired by the service provider as well as for property damage suffered by the service provider and its contractors. Also, these service agreements generally indemnify Anadarko for pollution originating from the equipment of any contractors or subcontractors hired by the service provider. 76 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements Anadarko may enter into off-balance-sheet arrangements and transactions that can give rise to material off-balance-sheet obligations. The Company material off-balance-sheet arrangements and transactions include operating lease arrangements and undrawn letters of credit. In addition, the Company enters into other contractual agreements in the normal course of business for processing, treating, transportation, and storage of oil, natural gas, and NGLs as well as for other oil and gas activities as discussed below in Obligations . Other than the items discussed above, there are no other transactions, arrangements, or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect Anadarko liquidity or availability of or requirements for capital resources.

See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for discussion of the Company significant accounting policies. Changes in facts and circumstances or additional information may result in revised estimates, and actual results may differ from these estimates. Management considers the following to be its most critical accounting estimates that involve judgment. The selection, development, and disclosure of these estimates is discussed with the Company Audit Committee. Proved Reserves Methodology Anadarko estimates its proved oil and gas reserves according to the definition of proved reserves provided by the SEC and the FASB. This definition includes oil, natural gas, and NGLs that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be economically producible in future periods from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions, operating methods, government regulations, etc. (at prices and costs as of the date the estimates are made). Prices include consideration of price changes provided only by contractual arrangements, and do not include adjustments based on expected future conditions. For reserves information, see Oil and Gas Properties and Activities Proved Reserves under Items 1 and 2 of this Form 10-K and the Supplemental Information on Oil and Gas Exploration and Production Activities under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Judgments and uncertainties Engineering estimates of the quantities of proved reserves are inherently imprecise and represent only approximate amounts because of the judgments involved in developing such information. The Company estimates of proved reserves are made using available geological and reservoir data as well as production performance data. The reliability of these estimates at any point in time depends on both the quality and quantity of the technical and economic data and the efficiency of extracting and processing the hydrocarbons. These estimates are reviewed annually by internal reservoir engineers and revised, either upward or downward, as warranted by additional data. Revisions are necessary due to changes in, among other things, development plans, reservoir performance, prices, economic conditions, and governmental restrictions as well as changes in the expected recovery associated with infill drilling. Decreases in prices, for example, may cause a reduction in some proved reserves due to reaching economic limits at an earlier projected date. A material adverse change in the estimated volumes of proved reserves could have a negative impact on DD&A and could result in property or goodwill impairments. If the estimates of proved reserves used in the UOP calculations had been lower by 10% across all properties, DD&A in 2017 would have increased by approximately $405 million. 78 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Exploratory Costs Methodology Under the successful efforts method of accounting, exploratory drilling costs are initially capitalized pending the determination of proved reserves. If proved reserves are found, drilling costs remain capitalized and are classified as proved properties. For exploratory wells that find reserves that cannot be classified as proved when drilling is completed, costs continue to be capitalized as suspended exploratory drilling costs if there have been sufficient reserves found to justify completion as a producing well and sufficient progress is being made in assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project. At the end of each quarter, management reviews the status of all suspended exploratory drilling costs in light of ongoing exploration activities, in particular, whether the Company is making sufficient progress in its ongoing exploration and appraisal efforts or, in the case of discoveries requiring government sanctioning, analyzing whether development negotiations are underway and proceeding as planned. Judgments and uncertainties Significant management judgment is required to determine whether sufficient progress has been made in assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project to continue capitalization of the exploratory drilling costs. In making this determination all relevant facts and circumstances shall be evaluated, and no single indicator is determinative. Relevant facts and circumstances include, but are not limited to, commitment of project personnel, costs being incurred to assess the reserves and their potential development, assessment in progress covering the economic, legal, political, and environmental aspects of the potential development, and the existence or active negotiations of agreements with governments or sales contracts with customers. The determination of proved reserves may take longer than one year in certain areas (generally in deepwater and international locations) depending on, among other things, the amount of hydrocarbons discovered, the outcome of planned geological and engineering studies, the need for additional appraisal drilling activities to determine whether the discovery is sufficient to support an economic development plan, and government sanctioning of development activities in certain international locations. If management determines that future appraisal drilling or development activities are unlikely to occur, associated suspended exploratory well costs are expensed. Therefore, at any point in time, the Company may have capitalized costs on its Consolidated Balance Sheets associated with exploratory wells that may be charged to exploration expense in future periods. See Note 6 Suspended Exploratory Well Costs in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information. Fair Value Methodology The Company estimates fair value of long-lived assets for impairment testing, reporting units for goodwill impairment testing when necessary, assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination or exchanged in non-monetary transactions, pension plan assets, and initial measurements of AROs. Judgments and uncertainties When the Company is required to measure fair value and there is not a market-observable price for the asset or liability or for a similar asset or liability, the Company uses the cost or income approaches depending on the quality of information available to support management assumptions. The cost approach is based on management best estimate of the current asset replacement cost. The income approach is based on management best assumptions regarding expectations of future net cash flows and discounts the expected cash flows using a commensurate risk-adjusted discount rate. Such evaluations involve significant judgment, and the results are based on expected future events or conditions such as sales prices, estimates of future oil and gas production or throughput, development and operating costs and the timing thereof, economic and regulatory climates, and other factors, most of which are often outside of management control. However, assumptions used reflect a market participant view of long-term prices, costs, and other factors and are consistent with assumptions used in the Company business plans and investment decisions. 79 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Impairments of Proved Oil and Natural-Gas Properties Methodology Proved oil and natural-gas properties are assessed for impairment when facts and circumstances indicate that net book values may not be recoverable. When impairment indicators are present, an undiscounted future net cash flow test is performed at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are independent of cash flows from other assets. If the sum of the undiscounted future net cash flows is less than the net book value of the property, the property fair value is estimated and an impairment loss is recognized for the excess, if any, of the property net book value over its estimated fair value. Judgments and uncertainties The primary assumptions used to estimate undiscounted future net cash flows include anticipated future production, commodity prices, and capital and operating costs. In most cases, the assumption that generates the most variability in undiscounted future net cash flows is future commodity prices. For impairment testing, the Company used the five-year forward strip prices for oil and natural gas, with prices subsequent to the fifth year held constant as the benchmark price in the undiscounted future net cash flows. Capital and operating costs were estimated assuming 1% escalation for the first five years and held constant thereafter. Due to the volatility of crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs prices, these cash flow estimates are inherently imprecise. Unfavorable changes in any of the primary assumptions could result in a reduction in undiscounted future cash flows and could indicate property impairment. Uncertainties related to the primary assumptions could affect the timing of an impairment. Impairments of Unproved Oil and Natural-Gas Properties Methodology Acquisition costs of unproved oil and natural-gas properties are periodically assessed for impairment and are transferred to proved oil and gas properties to the extent the costs are associated with successful exploration activities. The Company has classified unproved oil and natural-gas properties into three categories: significant, significant where probable and possible reserve estimations are available, and individually insignificant. Significant undeveloped leases are assessed individually for impairment and a valuation allowance is provided if impairment is indicated. In situations where fair values have been allocated to a significant unproved property based on estimations of probable and possible reserves as the result of a business combination or other purchase of proved and unproved properties, an undiscounted future net cash flow analysis is used to assess the property for impairment in addition to consideration of reserve volumes needed to transfer the balance of unproved property to proved property. Unproved oil and gas properties with individually insignificant lease acquisition costs are amortized on a group basis (thereby establishing a valuation allowance) over the average lease terms at rates that provide for full amortization of unsuccessful leases upon lease expiration or abandonment. Judgments and uncertainties In determining whether a significant unproved property is impaired numerous factors are considered including, but not limited to, current exploration plans, favorable or unfavorable exploration activity on the property being evaluated and/or adjacent properties, geologists evaluation of the property, and the remaining months in the lease term for the property. In situations where probable and possible reserves are available, undiscounted future net cash flows used in the impairment analysis are determined based upon management estimates of probable and possible reserves, future commodity prices, and future costs to produce the reserves. If undiscounted future net cash flows are less than the carrying value of the property, indicating impairment, the future net cash flows are discounted and compared to the carrying value for determining the amount of the impairment loss to record. The Company utilizes the same pricing and cost assumptions discussed above in Impairments of Proved Oil and Natural-Gas Properties. Uncertainties related to the primary assumptions or unfavorable revisions in estimated reserve quantities could cause a reduction in the value of a property and therefore indicate an impairment. Management assessment of the results of exploration activities, availability of funds for future activities, and the current and projected political and regulatory climate in areas in which the Company operates also impact the amounts and timing of impairment provisions. 80 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Income Taxes Methodology The Company is subject to income taxes in numerous taxing jurisdictions worldwide. The amount of income taxes recorded by the Company requires interpretations of complex rules and regulations of various tax jurisdictions throughout the world. The Company has recognized deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences, operating losses, and tax-credit carryforwards. The deferred tax assets may be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company routinely assesses the realizability of its deferred tax assets by analyzing the reversal periods of available net operating loss carryforwards and credit carryforwards, temporary differences in tax assets and liabilities, the availability of tax planning strategies, and estimates of future taxable income and other factors. The Company also routinely assesses potential uncertain tax positions and, if required, establishes accruals for such amounts, including interest where appropriate. The Company recognizes a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, based on the technical merits of the position. Judgments and uncertainties The accruals for deferred tax assets and liabilities, including deferred state income tax assets and liabilities, are subject to significant judgment by management and are reviewed and adjusted routinely based on changes in facts and circumstances. The assessment of potential uncertain tax positions requires a significant amount of judgment and are reviewed and adjusted on a periodic basis, taking into consideration the progress of ongoing tax audits, case law, and new legislation. Although management considers its tax accruals adequate, material changes in these accruals may occur in the future based on the progress of ongoing tax audits, changes in legislation, and resolution of pending tax matters. Additionally, numerous judgments and assumptions are inherent in management estimates of future taxable income used to assess the realizability of certain deferred tax assets. The estimates used are based on assumptions of proved oil and gas reserves, selling prices, and development assumptions that are consistent with the Company internal business plans. 81 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Goodwill Impairments Methodology The Company tests goodwill for impairment annually in October (or more frequently as circumstances dictate). The Company first assesses whether an impairment of goodwill is indicated through a qualitative assessment to determine the likelihood of whether the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the Company concludes it is more likely than not that fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the related carrying amount, then goodwill is not impaired and further testing is not necessary. If the qualitative assessment indicates fair value of the reporting unit may be less than its carrying amount, the Company compares the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to which goodwill is assigned to the carrying amount of the associated net assets, including goodwill, and determines whether impairment is necessary. When evaluating whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the Company assesses relevant events and circumstances, including the following: significant changes in the stock price of Anadarko, WES, and WGP significant declines in commodity prices significant increases in cost factors such as costs of drilling, production costs, and gathering, processing, and other transportation costs impairments recognized by the Company acquisitions and disposals of assets changes to the Company reserves, including changes due to fluctuations in commodity prices and updates to the Company plans or forecasts significant declines in trading multiples for midstream peers Judgments and uncertainties The first step of the goodwill impairment test requires management to make estimates regarding the fair value of each reporting unit to which goodwill has been assigned. If it is necessary to determine the fair value of the reporting unit, a combination of the income approach and the market approach would be used. Because quoted market prices for the Company reporting units are not available, management would apply judgment in determining the estimated fair value of reporting units for purposes of performing goodwill impairment tests, when such tests are necessary. Management would use information available to make these fair-value estimates, including the present values of expected future cash flows, using discount rates commensurate with the risks associated with the assets and the Exploration and Production reporting unit, control premiums and market multiples of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) for the gathering and processing and transportation reporting units. In estimating the fair value of its Exploration and Production reporting unit, an income approach to calculate the present value of expected future cash flows would be used, which would be based on forecasted assumptions. Key assumptions to the income approach would be similar to those described above regarding the impairment of long-lived assets, such as estimates of forecasted revenue and operating costs, proved reserves, the success of future exploration for and development of unproved reserves, discount rates, and other variables. Management would also include control premium assumptions based on observable market information regarding how a market participant would value the Exploration and Production reporting unit as a whole rather than as individual properties that are part of an oil and gas portfolio. Management would estimate the fair value for the WES Gathering and Processing, WES Transportation, and Other Midstream reporting units by applying an estimated multiple to projected EBITDA. Management would consider observable transactions in the market and trading multiples for peers in determining an appropriate multiple to apply against the Company projected EBITDA for these reporting units. A lower fair-value estimate in the future for any of these reporting units could result in impairment of goodwill. Factors that could trigger a lower fair-value estimate include significant declines in commodity prices, decreases in proved reserves, changes in exploration or development plans, significant property impairments, increases in operating or drilling costs, significant changes in regulations, or other negative changes to the economic environment in which Anadarko operates. 82 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Contingencies Methodology The Company is subject to various legal proceedings, claims, and liabilities that arise in the ordinary course of business. Except for contingencies acquired in a business combination, which are recorded at fair value at the time of acquisition, the Company accrues losses when such losses are probable and reasonably estimable. If the Company determines that a loss is probable and cannot estimate a specific amount for that loss, but can estimate a range of loss, the best estimate within the range is accrued. If no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other, the minimum amount of the range is accrued. The Company in-house legal counsel personnel regularly assess contingent liabilities and, in certain circumstances, consult with third-party legal counsel or consultants to assist in the evaluation of the Company liability for these contingencies. Judgments and uncertainties Management makes judgments and estimates when it establishes liabilities for litigation and other contingent matters. Estimates of litigation-related liabilities are based on the facts and circumstances of the individual case and on information currently available to the Company. The extent of information available varies based on the status of the litigation and the Company evaluation of the claim and legal arguments. In future periods, a number of factors could significantly change the Company estimate of litigation-related liabilities, including discovery activities; briefings filed with the relevant court; rulings from the court made pre-trial, during trial, or at the conclusion of any trial; and similar cases involving other plaintiffs and defendants that may set or change legal precedent. As events unfold throughout the litigation process, the Company evaluates the available information and may consult with third-party legal counsel to determine whether liability accruals should be established or adjusted. Purchase Price Allocations Methodology In connection with a business combination accounted for under the acquisition method, the acquiring company must recognize and measure assets acquired and liabilities assumed at fair value as of the acquisition date. Deferred taxes must be recorded for any differences between the assigned values and tax bases of assets and liabilities. Any excess of the purchase price over fair value assigned to assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Any excess of fair value assigned to assets and liabilities over the purchase price is recorded as a gain from a bargain purchase. The amount of goodwill or gain from a bargain purchase recorded in any particular business combination can vary significantly depending upon the values attributed to assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Judgments and uncertainties In estimating the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination, various assumptions are made. The most significant assumptions relate to the estimated fair values assigned to proved and unproved crude oil and natural gas properties. If sufficient market data is not available regarding the fair values of proved and unproved properties, estimates of the fair value of crude oil, natural-gas and NGLs reserves are prepared. The Company utilizes the same pricing and cost assumptions discussed above in Impairments of Proved Oil and Natural-Gas Properties. For estimated proved reserves, the future net cash flows are discounted using a market-based discount rate determined appropriate at the time of the acquisition. Estimated deferred taxes are based on available information concerning the tax bases of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and loss carryforwards at the acquisition date, although such estimates may change in the future as additional information becomes known. Estimated fair values of assets acquired can have a significant effect on results of operations in the future. A higher fair value assigned to a property results in higher DD&A expense, which results in lower net earnings. This increases the likelihood of impairment if future commodity prices or reserves quantities are lower than those originally used to determine fair value, or if future operating expenses or development costs are higher than those originally used to determine fair value. Impairment would have no effect on cash flows but would result in a decrease in net income for the period in which the impairment is recorded.
