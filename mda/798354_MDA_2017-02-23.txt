Results of operations . This section contains an analysis of our results of operations presented in the accompanying consolidated statements of income by comparing the results for the year ended December 31, 2016 to the results for the year ended December 31, 2015 and by comparing the results for the year ended December 31, 2015 to the results for the year ended December 31, 2014 . Liquidity and capital resources . This section provides an analysis of our cash flows and a discussion of our outstanding debt and commitments at December 31, 2016 . 16 Table of Contents Overview Company Background We are a leading global provider of financial services technology. We provide account processing systems, electronic payments processing products and services, internet and mobile banking systems, and related services. We serve over 12,000 clients worldwide, including banks, thrifts, credit unions, investment management firms, leasing and finance companies, retailers, merchants, mutual savings banks, and building societies. The majority of our revenue is generated from recurring account- and transaction-based fees under contracts that generally have terms of three to five years and high renewal rates. Most of the services we provide are necessary for our clients to operate their businesses and are, therefore, non-discretionary in nature. Our operations are principally located in the United States and are comprised of the Payments and Industry Products ( Payments ) segment and the Financial Institution Services ( Financial ) segment. The Payments segment primarily provides electronic bill payment and presentment services, internet and mobile banking software and services, person-to-person payment services, debit and credit card processing and services, and other electronic payments software and services. Our businesses in this segment also provide card and print personalization services, investment account processing services for separately managed accounts, and fraud and risk management products and services. The Financial segment provides banks, thrifts, credit unions, and leasing and finance companies with account processing services, item processing and source capture services, loan origination and servicing products, cash management and consulting services, and other products and services that support numerous types of financial transactions. Corporate and Other primarily consists of unallocated corporate expenses including share-based compensation, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, intercompany eliminations and other costs that are not considered when management evaluates segment performance. During the first quarter of 2016, we acquired two businesses for an aggregate purchase price of $265 million. We acquired the Convenience Pay Services business of Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company, which enables providers to accept electronic payments from their consumers through multiple channels, thereby expanding our biller solution offerings. We also completed our purchase of the Community Financial Services business of ACI Worldwide, Inc., further enhancing our suite of digital banking and payments solutions. During 2016, StoneRiver Group, L.P. ( StoneRiver ), a joint venture in which we own a 49% interest and account for under the equity method, recognized a net gain on the sale of a business interest, and in 2015 and 2014, recognized net gains on the sales of subsidiary businesses. Our pre-tax share of the net gains and related expenses on these transactions was $146 million in 2016 , $29 million in 2015 and $87 million in 2014 , with related tax expenses of $54 million , $13 million and $36 million , respectively. In addition, we received cash dividends of $151 million , $36 million and $110 million in 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively, from StoneRiver, which were funded from the sale transactions. Enterprise Priorities We continue to implement a series of strategic initiatives to help accomplish our mission of providing integrated technology and services solutions that enable best-in-class results for our clients. These strategic initiatives include active portfolio management of our businesses, enhancing the overall value of our existing client relationships, improving operational effectiveness, being disciplined in our allocation of capital, and differentiating our products and services through innovation. Our key enterprise priorities for 2017 are: (i) to continue to build high-quality revenue while meeting our earnings goals; (ii) to enhance client relationships with an emphasis on digital and payment solutions; and (iii) to deliver innovation and integration which enables differentiated value for our clients. Industry Trends The market for products and services offered by financial institutions continues to evolve rapidly. The financial industry regularly introduces and implements new payment, deposit, lending, investment and risk management products, and the distinctions among the products and services traditionally offered by different types of financial institutions continue to narrow as they seek to serve the same customers. At the same time, regulatory conditions and cybersecurity scrutiny have continued to create a challenging operating environment for financial institutions. For example, legislation such as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act has generated, and may continue to generate, new regulations impacting the financial industry. These conditions, along with mild economic improvement, have created heightened interest in solutions that help financial institutions win and retain customers, generate incremental revenue, comply with regulations and enhance operating efficiency. Examples of these solutions include our electronic payments solutions and channels such as internet, mobile and tablet banking, sometimes referred to as digital channels. This increased focus on digital channels by both financial institutions and their customers, as well as the growing volume and types of payment transactions in the marketplace, have increased the data and transaction processing needs of financial 17 Table of Contents institutions. We expect that financial institutions will continue to invest significant capital and human resources to process transactions, manage information, maintain regulatory compliance and offer innovative new services to their customers in this rapidly evolving and competitive environment. We anticipate that we will benefit over the long term from the trend of financial institutions moving from in-house technology to outsourced solutions as they seek to remain current on technology changes amidst an evolving marketplace. We believe that economies of scale in developing and maintaining the infrastructure, technology, products, services and networks necessary to be competitive in such an environment are essential to justify these investments, and we anticipate that demand for products that facilitate customer interaction with financial institutions, including electronic transactions through digital channels, will continue to increase, which we expect to create revenue opportunities for us. Based on these market conditions, we believe that our sizable and diverse client base, combined with our position as a leading provider of non-discretionary, recurring revenue-based products and services, gives us a solid foundation for growth. Furthermore, we believe that the integration of our products and services creates a compelling value proposition for our clients. In addition to the trends described above, the financial institutions marketplace has experienced change in composition as well. During the past 25 years, the number of financial institutions in the United States has declined at a relatively steady rate of approximately 3% per year, primarily as a result of voluntary mergers and acquisitions. Rather than reducing the overall market, these consolidations have transferred accounts among financial institutions. An acquisition benefits us when a newly combined institution is processed on our system, or elects to move to one of our systems, and negatively impacts us when a competing system is selected. Financial institution acquisitions also impact our financial results due to early contract termination fees in our multi-year client contracts, which are primarily generated when an existing client with a multi-year contract is acquired by another financial institution. These fees can vary from period to period based on the number and size of clients that are acquired and how early in the contract term the contract is terminated. Our revenue is diversified, and our focus on long-term client relationships and recurring, transaction-oriented products and services has reduced the impact that consolidation in the financial services industry has had on us. We have clients that span the entire range of financial institutions in terms of asset size and business model, and our 50 largest financial institution clients represent less than 25% of our annual revenue. In addition, we believe that our products and services can assist financial institutions with the regulatory and market challenges that they currently face by providing, among other things, new sources of revenue and opportunities to reduce their costs. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which require management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. We continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements and base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions that we believe are reasonable in light of current circumstances. Actual amounts and results could differ materially from these estimates. Acquisitions From time to time, we make strategic acquisitions that may have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. We allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction at their estimated fair values. The estimates used to determine the fair value of long-lived assets, such as intangible assets, can be complex and require significant judgments. We use information available to us to make fair value determinations and engage independent valuation specialists, when necessary, to assist in the fair value determination of significant acquired long-lived assets. While we use our best estimates and assumptions as a part of the purchase price allocation process, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of income. We are also required to estimate the useful lives of intangible assets to determine the amount of acquisition-related intangible asset amortization expense to record in future periods. We periodically review the estimated useful lives assigned to our intangible assets to determine whether such estimated useful lives continue to be appropriate. Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets We review the carrying value of goodwill for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is tested for impairment at a reporting unit level, determined to be at an operating segment level or one level below. When reviewing goodwill for impairment, we consider the amount of excess fair value over the carrying value of each reporting unit, the period of time since a reporting unit last quantitative test, the extent 18 Table of Contents to which a reorganization or disposition changes the composition of one or more of our reporting units, and other factors to determine whether or not to first perform a qualitative test. When performing a qualitative test, we assess numerous factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units are less than their respective carrying values. Examples of qualitative factors that we assess include our share price, our financial performance, market and competitive factors in our industry, and other events specific to our reporting units. If we conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we perform a two-step quantitative impairment test. The first step in the quantitative test is to compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value. We determine the fair value of a reporting unit based primarily on the present value of estimated future cash flows. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the reporting unit net assets, goodwill of that reporting unit is not impaired and further testing is not required. If the carrying value of the reporting unit net assets exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, then we perform the second step of the quantitative test to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill and any impairment charge. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves judgment and the use of significant estimates and assumptions, which include assumptions regarding the revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate estimated future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates and future economic and market conditions. Our most recent impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of 2016 determined that our goodwill was not impaired. The estimated fair values of the respective reporting units substantially exceeded the carrying values, except for a single reporting unit that exceeded the carrying value to a lesser magnitude given the short passage of time between the recent acquisition date and when we performed our most recent annual impairment assessment. We review acquired intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability is assessed by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. Measurement of any impairment loss is based on estimated fair value. Given the significance of our goodwill and intangible asset balances, an adverse change in fair value could result in an impairment charge, which could be material to our consolidated financial statements. Revenue Recognition The majority of our revenue is generated from monthly account- and transaction-based fees. Revenue is recognized as services are provided and is primarily recognized under service agreements that are long-term in nature, generally three to five years, and that do not require management to make significant judgments or assumptions. At times, however, judgment is exercised in evaluating revenue recognition, such as when a contract arrangement includes multiple product and service deliverables. Due to the quantity, size and nature of our multiple element arrangements, the judgments we make in this regard are not likely to have a material impact on revenue recognition for any individual element. Additionally, given the nature of our business and the rules governing revenue recognition, our revenue recognition practices generally do not involve significant estimates that materially affect our results of operations. Additional information about our revenue recognition policies is included in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. Results of Operations Components of Revenue and Expenses The following summary describes the components of revenue and expenses as presented in our consolidated statements of income. Processing and Services Processing and services revenue, which in 2016 represented 84% of our total revenue, is primarily generated from account- and transaction-based fees under contracts that generally have terms of three to five years. Revenue is recognized when the related transactions are processed and services have been performed. Processing and services revenue is most reflective of our business performance as a significant amount of our total operating profit is generated by these services. Cost of processing and services includes costs directly associated with providing services to clients and includes the following: personnel; equipment and data communication; infrastructure costs, including costs to maintain software applications; client support; depreciation and amortization; and other operating expenses. Product Product revenue, which in 2016 represented 16% of our total revenue, is primarily derived from integrated print and card production sales, as well as software license sales which represented less than 4% of our total revenue. Cost of product includes costs directly associated with the products sold and includes the following: costs of materials and software development; personnel; infrastructure costs; depreciation and amortization; and other costs directly associated with product revenue. 19 Table of Contents Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses primarily consist of: salaries, wages, commissions and related expenses paid to sales personnel, administrative employees and management; advertising and promotional costs; depreciation and amortization; and other selling and administrative expenses. Financial Results The following table presents certain amounts included in our consolidated statements of income, the relative percentage that those amounts represent to revenue and the change in those amounts from year to year.

Total Revenue Total revenue increased $251 million , or 5% , in 2016 and increased $188 million , or 4% , in 2015 compared to the prior years. The increase in total revenue during 2016 was due to 8% revenue growth in our Payments segment and 1% revenue growth in our Financial segment as compared to 2015 . The increase in total revenue during 2015 was attributable to 4% revenue growth in our Payments segment and 3% revenue growth in our Financial segment as compared to 2014 . Revenue in our Payments segment increased $228 million , or 8% , in 2016 and increased $115 million , or 4% , in 2015 compared to the prior years. Payments segment revenue growth during 2016 and 2015 was driven by our recurring revenue businesses as processing and services revenue increased $175 million , or 8% , and increased $129 million , or 6% , respectively, over the prior years. The growth in both years was primarily due to new client additions and increased transaction volumes from existing clients in our card services, electronic payments and digital channels businesses, as well as our biller solutions business in 2015. In 2016, Payments segment revenue growth was positively impacted by revenue from acquired businesses totaling $86 million and an increase in product revenue of $53 million , or 8% , compared to 2015, primarily due to increased volumes in our output solutions business, including a higher level of card manufacturing and personalization. The revenue growth in 2015 was partially offset by lower software license revenue as compared to 2014. Revenue in our Financial segment increased $34 million , or 1% , in 2016 and increased $76 million , or 3% in 2015 compared to the prior years. In both 2016 and 2015, Financial segment revenue growth was favorably impacted by increased processing and services revenue in our account processing and lending businesses, including higher contract termination fee revenue in 2015, as compared to the prior years. This growth was partially offset by lower revenue in our international business in 2016 and by negative foreign currency fluctuations of approximately 70 basis points in 2015. 21 Table of Contents Total Expenses Total expenses increased $117 million , or 3% , in 2016 compared to 2015 and increased $87 million , or 2% , in 2015 compared to 2014 . Total expenses as a percentage of total revenue was 73.8% , 75.1% and 76.1% in 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively. Cost of processing and services as a percentage of processing and services revenue decreased to 47.8% in 2016 compared to 49.4% in 2015 and 51.3% in 2014 . Cost of processing and services as a percentage of processing and services revenue was favorably impacted in both 2016 and 2015 by increased operating leverage in our recurring revenue businesses, as well as by operating efficiency initiatives across the company that have benefited our overall cost structure. Cost of processing and services as a percentage of processing and services revenue in 2016 was also favorably impacted by lower amortization related to certain fully amortized acquisition-related intangible assets. Cost of product as a percentage of product revenue was 84.9% in 2016 compared to 86.7% in 2015 and 84.7% in 2014 . Cost of product as a percentage of product revenue was favorably impacted in 2016 by an increase in higher-margin software license revenue and negatively impacted in 2015 by increased expenses in our output solutions business associated with additional investments to expand our card manufacturing and personalization capacity. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue was 20.0% , 19.7% and 19.2% in 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue was primarily due to acquisition and related integration costs in 2016 as compared to 2015 and increased share-based compensation and incremental costs associated with data center and real estate consolidation activities in 2015 as compared to 2014. Operating Income and Operating Margin Total operating income increased $134 million , or 10% , in 2016 and increased $101 million , or 8% , in 2015 compared to the prior years. Total operating margin increased to 26.2% in 2016 from 24.9% in 2015 and 23.9% in 2014 . Operating income and operating margin improvements in 2016 and 2015 were driven by revenue growth and operational effectiveness initiatives. Operating income in our Payments segment increased $103 million , or 12% , and increased $72 million , or 9% , in 2016 and 2015 , respectively, compared to the prior years. Operating margins were 30.5% , 29.3% and 28.0% in 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively, improving 120 basis points in 2016 and 130 basis points in 2015 . The increases in operating income and operating margin in 2016 and 2015 were primarily due to revenue growth and scale efficiencies in a number of our businesses, along with increased volumes and product mix in our output solutions business in 2016. Payments segment operating margin improvement was partially offset in 2016 by the dilutive margin impact from acquisitions and in 2015 by increased expenses associated with additional investments in our biller and output solutions businesses, along with a decrease in higher-margin software license revenue compared to the prior year. Operating income in our Financial segment was generally consistent in 2016 and increased $53 million , or 7% , in 2015 compared to the prior years. Operating margins were 33.2% , 33.8% and 32.6% in 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively, decreasing 60 basis points in 2016 and improving 120 basis points in 2015 . Operating income and operating margin in 2016 were negatively impacted by product mix, lower international revenue and increased expenses associated with incremental investments in innovation-based solutions. Operating income and operating margin were positively impacted in 2015 by revenue growth, including higher contract termination fee revenue, along with operational effectiveness initiatives and scale efficiencies primarily in our account processing businesses. The operating loss in Corporate and Other decreased $34 million in 2016 and increased $24 million in 2015 compared to the prior years. The operating loss improvement in 2016 was primarily due to lower amortization related to certain fully amortized acquisition-related intangible assets, partially offset by acquisition and related integration costs, including a $10 million non-cash impairment charge associated with the decision to replace existing software with an acquired solution. The operating loss increase in 2015 was attributable to increased costs incurred in conjunction with the achievement of our operational effectiveness objectives, including incremental costs related to data center and real estate consolidation activities, as compared to the prior year. Interest Expense Interest expense decreased $7 million in 2016 and increased $6 million in 2015 compared to the prior years. The higher interest expense in 2015 was primarily due to the reclassification of $7 million to interest expense for unamortized losses on settled cash flow hedges related to the early extinguishment of debt. Interest and Investment (Loss) Income The net interest and investment loss in 2016 was attributable to a non-cash write-off of a $7 million cost-method investment. 22 Table of Contents Loss on Early Debt Extinguishment In May 2015, we redeemed our $600 million aggregate principal amount of 3.125% senior notes due in 2016 and $500 million aggregate principal amount of 6.8% senior notes due in 2017, which resulted in a pre-tax loss on early debt extinguishment of $85 million related to make-whole payments and other costs associated with redemption. Income Tax Provision Income tax provision as a percentage of income from continuing operations before income from investment in unconsolidated affiliate was 38.6% in 2016 , 35.7% in 2015 and 36.6% in 2014 . The higher rate in 2016 and lower rate in 2015 compared to the prior years were primarily due to the level of income tax expense associated with our share of the net gains on the sales by our unconsolidated affiliate, StoneRiver, of a business interest in 2016 and subsidiary businesses in 2015. Income from Investment in Unconsolidated Affiliate Our share of the income of StoneRiver was $147 million , $32 million and $91 million in 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively. During 2016, StoneRiver recognized a net gain on the sale of a business interest, and in 2015 and 2014, recognized net gains on the sales of subsidiary businesses. Our pre-tax share of the net gains and related expenses on these transactions was $146 million in 2016 , $29 million in 2015 and $87 million in 2014 . Net Income Per Share - Diluted from Continuing Operations Net income per share-diluted from continuing operations was $4.15 in 2016 and $2.99 in both 2015 and 2014 . Net income per share-diluted from continuing operations was favorably impacted from our share of net investments gains, primarily from StoneRiver capital transactions, of $0.39 , $0.07 and $0.20 per share in 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively, and was negatively impacted in 2016 by merger and integration costs of $0.17 per share and in 2015 by debt extinguishment and refinancing costs of $0.25 per share. The amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets also reduced net income per share-diluted from continuing operations by $0.46 , $0.53 and $0.52 per share in 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively. Liquidity and Capital Resources General Our primary liquidity needs are: (i) to fund normal operating expenses; (ii) to meet the interest and principal requirements of our outstanding indebtedness; and (iii) to fund capital expenditures and operating lease payments. We believe these needs will be satisfied using cash flow generated by our operations, along with our cash and cash equivalents of $300 million and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility of $1.4 billion at December 31, 2016 . The following table summarizes our operating cash flow and capital expenditure amounts for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively. Year Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease) (In millions) 2016 2015 $ % Net income $ 930 $ 712 $ 218 Depreciation and amortization 411 417 (6 ) Share-based compensation 68 65 3 Excess tax benefits from share-based awards (51 ) (38 ) (13 ) Deferred income taxes 21 20 1 Income from investment in unconsolidated affiliate (147 ) (32 ) (115 ) Dividends from unconsolidated affiliate 151 36 115 Non-cash impairment charges 17 6 11 Loss on early debt extinguishment 85 (85 ) Net changes in working capital and other 31 75 (44 ) Operating cash flow $ 1,431 $ 1,346 $ 85 6 % Capital expenditures $ 290 $ 359 $ (69 ) (19 )% Our net cash provided by operating activities, or operating cash flow, was $1.43 billion in 2016 , an increase of 6% compared with $1.35 billion in 2015 . This increase was primarily due to improved operating results and an increase in cash dividends 23 Table of Contents received from our StoneRiver joint venture, partially offset by lower cash inflow from net working capital changes primarily related to timing of receivable collections. Our current policy is to use our operating cash flow primarily to fund capital expenditures, share repurchases and acquisitions and to repay debt rather than to pay dividends. Our capital expenditures were approximately 5% and 7% of our total revenue in 2016 and 2015 , respectively. Capital expenditures in 2015 include $70 million related to our Atlanta facility consolidation, consisting primarily of leasehold improvements and furniture and equipment, of which $25 million is offset by landlord reimbursements included in net changes in working capital and other. In 2016 and 2015 , we received cash dividends of $151 million and $36 million , respectively, from our StoneRiver joint venture. These dividends, in their entirety, represented returns on our investment and are reported in cash flows from operating activities. In addition, we acquired the Convenience Pay Services business of Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company and the Community Financial Services business of ACI Worldwide, Inc. for an aggregate purchase price of $265 million during 2016. We funded these acquisitions by utilizing a combination of available cash and existing availability under our revolving credit facility.

We were in compliance with all financial debt covenants during 2016 . Revolving Credit Facility We maintain a $2.0 billion revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of banks that matures in April 2020.

The variable interest rate on the revolving credit facility borrowings was 1.81% at December 31, 2016 . There are no significant commitment fees and no compensating balance requirements. The revolving credit facility contains various restrictions and covenants that require us, among other things, to: (i) limit our consolidated indebtedness as of the end of each fiscal quarter to no more than three and one-half times consolidated net earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and certain other adjustments during the period of four fiscal quarters then ended, and (ii) maintain consolidated net earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and certain other adjustments of at least three times consolidated interest expense as of the end of each fiscal quarter for the period of four fiscal quarters then ended.

The term loan facility contains various restrictions and covenants substantially similar to those contained in the revolving credit facility described above. Senior Notes In May 2015, we completed an offering of $1.75 billion of senior notes comprised of $850 million aggregate principal amount of 2.7% senior notes due in June 2020 and $900 million aggregate principal amount of 3.85% senior notes due in June 2025. The notes pay interest at the stated rates semi-annually on June 1 and December 1, which commenced on December 1, 2015. Our 4.625% senior notes due in October 2020 and 3.5% senior notes due in October 2022 pay interest at the stated rates on April 1 and October 1 of each year. Our 4.75% senior notes due in June 2021 pay interest at the stated rate on June 15 and December 15 of each year. The interest rates applicable to the senior notes are subject to an increase of up to two percent in the event that our credit rating is downgraded below investment grade. The indentures governing the senior notes contain covenants that, among other matters, limit (i) our ability to consolidate or merge into, or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all of our properties and assets to, another person; (ii) our and certain of our subsidiaries ability to create or assume liens, and (iii) our and certain of our subsidiaries ability to engage in sale and leaseback transactions. In October 2015, we used our available borrowings under the revolving credit facility to repay the $300 million aggregate principal amount of 3.125% senior notes. In May 2015, we used the net proceeds from the offering described above to redeem our $600 million aggregate principal amount of 3.125% senior notes due in June 2016 and $500 million aggregate principal amount of 6.8% senior notes due in November 2017. We recorded a pre-tax loss on early debt extinguishment of $85 million related to make-whole payments and other costs associated with this redemption. In addition, we paid scheduled December 2015 and December 2016 principal payments on the term loan totaling $180 million and repaid, at that time, outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility. The remaining net proceeds from the offering were used for general corporate purposes. Other Access to capital markets impacts our cost of capital, our ability to refinance maturing debt and our ability to fund future acquisitions. Our ability to access capital on favorable terms depends on a number of factors, including general market conditions, interest rates, credit ratings on our debt securities, perception of our potential future earnings and the market price of our common stock. As of December 31, 2016 , we had a corporate credit rating of Baa2 with a stable outlook from Moody Investors Service, Inc. ( Moody ) and BBB with a stable outlook from Standard & Poor Ratings Services ( S&P ) on our senior unsecured debt securities. The interest rates payable on our senior notes, revolving credit facility and term loan are subject to adjustment from time to time if Moody or S&P changes the debt rating applicable to the notes. If the ratings from Moody or S&P decrease below investment grade, the per annum interest rates are subject to increase by up to two percent. In no event will the total increase in the per annum interest rates exceed two percent above the original interest rates, nor will the per annum interest rate be reduced below the original interest rate applicable to the senior notes.
