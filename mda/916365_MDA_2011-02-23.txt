Item 7 . Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview Tractor Supply Company is the largest operator of retail farm and ranch stores in the United States and is focused on supplying the lifestyle needs of recreational farmers and ranchers and of those who enjoy the rural lifestyle, as well as tradesmen and small businesses. We operate retail stores under the names Tractor Supply Company and Del Farm Supply and operate a website under the name TractorSupply.com . Our stores are located in towns outlying major metropolitan markets and in rural communities, and they offer the following comprehensive selection of merchandise: Equine, pet and small animal products, including items necessary for their health, care, growth and containment; Hardware, truck, towing and tool products; Seasonal products, including lawn and garden items, power equipment, gifts and toys; Maintenance products for agricultural and rural use; and Work/recreational clothing and footwear. Our Tractor Supply stores typically range in size from 15,500 to 18,500 square feet of inside selling space and additional outside selling space. We use a standard 15,500 square foot prototype for new purpose-built locations. For new stores located in existing buildings, one of several layout formats is utilized. Our wholly-owned subsidiary, Del s, operated 26 stores as of December 25, 2010 in Washington, Oregon, Idaho and Hawaii. Del stores currently range in size from approximately 2,000 to 6,000 square feet of inside selling space plus additional outside and covered/sheltered selling space. Our current and long-term growth strategy is to: (1) expand geographic market presence through opening new retail stores, (2) enhance financial performance through same-store sales increases, achieved through targeted merchandising programs with an everyday value prices philosophy and supported by strong customer service, (3) enhance product margin through assortment management, vendor management, sourcing and optimization of transportation and distribution costs, (4) leverage operating costs, especially advertising, distribution and corporate overhead, (5) expand market opportunities via internet sales, and (6) expand through selective acquisition, as such opportunities arise, to enhance penetration into new and existing markets as a complimentary strategy to organic growth. We have experienced considerable sales growth over the past five years, with a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 12.0%. We project an increase of 80 to 85 new stores in 2011, an increase of approximately 8%. We opened 74 new stores in 2010 and 76 new stores in 2009, an increase of approximately 8% and 9%, respectively. We operated 1,001 retail farm and ranch stores in 44 states as of December 25, 2010. We have developed a proven method for selecting store sites and have identified over 800 potential additional markets for new Tractor Supply stores in the United States. The average cash investment for new leased stores opened in 2010 was $1.2 million for retrofit stores and $0.9 million for prototype stores. A majority of the cash outlay was for initial acquisition of inventory and capital expenditures (principally leasehold improvements, fixtures and equipment), and approximately $92,000 for pre-opening costs. We have placed significant emphasis on our merchandising programs, evaluating the sales and profitability of our products through detailed line reviews, review of vendor performance measures and modification of the overall product offerings. We believe these efforts, coupled with a strong marketing program and in-depth product knowledge training of our store team members, have enhanced our sales and financial performance. Change in Accounting Method Effective December 25, 2010, the Company elected to change its method of accounting for inventories from the lower of cost, as determined by the last-in, first-out ( LIFO ) method, or market to the lower of cost, as determined by the average cost method, or market. The Company believes the change is preferable as the average cost method better reflects the current value of inventory on the consolidated balance sheets, provides a better reflection of periodic income and improves comparability with our peers. The Company has applied this change in method of inventory costing retrospectively to all prior periods presented herein in accordance with accounting principles relating to accounting changes. All financial information in Item 8 of this 10-K has been retrospectively adjusted. See Note 1, Significant Accounting Policies, to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for a complete discussion of our change in accounting method. Stock Split On July 29, 2010, our Board of Directors announced a two-for-one split of our outstanding shares of common stock to be effected in the form of a stock dividend. On September 2, 2010, stockholders of record at the close of business on August 19, 2010, were issued one additional share of common stock for each share owned by such stockholder. The stock split increased the number of shares of common stock outstanding from approximately 36.3 million to approximately 72.7 million. Share and per-share amounts (including stock options and restricted stock units) shown in this Form 10-K reflect the split. The total number of authorized common shares and the par value thereof was not changed by the split. The number of shares held in treasury was not adjusted for the split. Seasonality and Weather Our business is highly seasonal. Historically, our sales and profits have been the highest in the second and fourth fiscal quarters due to the sale of seasonal products. Unseasonable weather, excessive precipitation, drought, and early or late frosts may also affect our sales. We believe, however, that the impact of extreme weather conditions is somewhat mitigated by the geographic dispersion of our stores. We experience our highest inventory and accounts payable levels during our first fiscal quarter for purchases of seasonal product in anticipation of the spring selling season and again during our third fiscal quarter in anticipation of the winter selling season. 14 Table of Contents Purchase Price Volatility Although we cannot determine the full effect of inflation and deflation on our operations, we believe our sales and results of operations are affected by both. We are subject to market risk with respect to the pricing of certain products and services, which include, among other items, steel, grain, petroleum, corn, soybean and other commodities as well as transportation services. Therefore, we may experience both inflationary and deflationary pressure on product cost, which may impact consumer demand and, as a result, sales and gross margin. Our strategy is to reduce or mitigate the effects of purchase price volatility principally by taking advantage of vendor incentive programs, economies of scale from increased volume of purchases, adjusting retail prices and selectively buying from the most competiti ve vendors without sacrificing quality. Due to the competitive environment, such conditions have and may continue to adversely impact our financial performance. Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates Management discussion and analysis of our financial position and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make informed estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Our financial position and/or results of operations may be materially different when reported under different conditions or when using different assumptions in the application of such policies. In the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual amounts, adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information. Our significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. The following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies, which are those that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require significant judgment or use of complex estimates. Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ From A ssumptions Revenue Recognition and Sales Returns: We recognize revenue at the time the customer takes possession of merchandise or receives services. If we receive payment before the customer has taken possession of the merchandise (as per our special order and layaway programs), the revenue is deferred until the sale is complete. Revenues from the sale of gift cards are deferred and recognized when the gift card or merchandise return card is redeemed by the customer. Income is recognized when the likelihood of the gift card or merchandise return card being redeemed by the customer is remote (referred to as breakage ). We estimate a liability for sales returns based on a rolling average of historical return trends, and we believe that our estimate for sales returns is an accurate reflection of future returns associated with past sales. Our estimation methodologies have been consistently applied from year to year; however, as with any estimate, refund activity may vary from estimated amounts. The gift card and merchandise return card breakage rate is based upon historical redemption patterns and a benefit is recognized for estimated unredeemed gift cards and merchandise return cards in proportion to those historical redemption patterns. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to recognize sales returns or breakage in the financial periods presented. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate sales returns or gift card and merchandise return card breakage. However, if actual consumer return or gift card and merchandise return card redemption patterns are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. A 50 basis point change in our sales return rate at December 25, 2010, would have affected net income by approximately $170,000 in fiscal 2010. A 50 basis point change in our gift card and merchandise return card breakage rate would have affected net income by approximately $340,000 in fiscal 2010. Inventory Valuation: Inventory Impairment Risk We identify potentially excess and slow-moving inventory by evaluating turn rates, historical and expected future sales trends, age of merchandise, overall inventory levels, current cost of inventory and other benchmarks. The estimated inventory valuation reserve to recognize any impairment in value (i.e., an inability to realize the full carrying value) is based on our aggregate assessment of these valuation indicators under prevailing market conditions and current merchandising strategies. We do not believe our merchandise inventories are subject to significant risk of obsolescence in the near term. However, changes in market conditions or consumer purchasing patterns could result in the need for additional reserves. Our impairment reserve contains uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding forecasted customer demand, and the promotional environment. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to recognize inventory impairment reserves in the financial periods presented. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate impairment. However, if assumptions regarding consumer demand or clearance potential for certain products are inaccurate, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. A 10% change in our impairment reserve at December 25, 2010, would have affected net income by approximately $490,000 in fiscal 2010. 15 Table of Contents Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ From A ssumptions Shrinkage We perform physical inventories at each store at least once a year, and we have established reserves for estimating inventory shrinkage between physical inventory counts. The reserve is established by assessing the chain-wide average shrinkage experience rate, applied to the related periods' sales volumes. Such assessments are updated on a regular basis for the most recent individual store experiences. The estimated store inventory shrink rate is based on historical experience. We believe historical rates are a reasonably accurate reflection of future trends. Our shrinkage reserve contains uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding future shrinkage trends and the effect of loss prevention measures and new merchandising strategies. We have not made any material changes in the methodology used to recognize shrinkage in the financial periods presented. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our shrinkage reserve. However, if our estimates regarding inventory losses are inaccurate, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. A 10% change in our shrinkage reserve at December 25, 2010, would have affected net income by approximately $815,000 in fiscal 2010. Vendor Support We receive funding from substantially all of our significant merchandise vendors for the promotion of our brand as well as the sale of their products through a variety of programs and arrangements, including guaranteed funding and volume rebate programs. The amounts received are subject to terms of vendor agreements, which have varying expiration dates ranging in duration from several months to a few years. Many agreements are negotiated annually and are based on expected annual purchases of the vendor product. Vendor funding is initially deferred as a reduction of the purchase price of inventory and then recognized as a reduction of cost of merchandise as the related inventory is sold. During interim periods, the amount of e xpected funding is estimated based upon initial guaranteed commitments, as well as anticipated purchase levels with applicable vendors. The estimated purchase volume and related vendor funding is based on our current knowledge of inventory levels, sales trends and expected customer demand, as well as planned new store openings and relocations. Although we believe we can reasonably estimate purchase volume and related vendor funding at interim periods, it is possible that actual year-end results could significantly differ from previously estimated amounts. Our allocation methodology contains uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding customer demand, purchasing activity, target thresholds, vendor attrition and collectibility. At the end of each fiscal year, a significant portion of the actual purchase activity is known. Thus, we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the amounts recorded as vendor support. We do not believe there is a significant collectibility risk related to vendor support amounts due us at the end of fiscal 2010. If a 10% reserve had been applied against our outstanding vendor support due as of December 25, 2010, net income would have been affected by approximately $1.6 million. Although it is unlikely that there will be any significant reduction in historical levels of vendor support, if such a reduction were to occur in future periods, the Company could experience a higher inventory balance and higher cost of sales. Freight We incur various types of transportation and delivery costs in connection with inventory purchases and distribution. Such costs are included as a component of the overall cost of inventories (on an aggregate basis) and recognized as a component of cost of merchandise sold as the related inventory is sold. We allocate freight as a component of total cost of sales without regard to inventory mix or unique freight burden of certain categories. This assumption has been consistently applied for all years presented. If a 10% increase or decrease had been applied against our current inventory capitalized freight balance, net income would have been affected by approximately $3.4 million. Share-Based Compensation: We have share-based compensation plans, which include incentive and non-qualified stock options, restricted stock units, and an employee stock purchase plan. See Note 1, Significant Accounting Policies, and Note 2, Share-Based Compensation, to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for a complete discussion of our share-based compensation programs. We estimate the fair value of our stock option awards at the date of grant utilizing a Black-Scholes option pricing model. We estimate the fair value of our market-based restricted stock units at the date of grant utilizing average market price of our stock on the date of the related award. Option-pricing models and generally accepted valuation techniques require management to make subjective assumptions and to apply judgment to determine the fair value of our awards. These assumptions and judgments include estimating the future volatility of our stock price, expected dividend yield, future employee turnover rates and future employee stock option exercise behaviors. In addition to the key assumptions used to estimate the fair value, the estimated forfeiture rate of the awarded options is a critical assumption, as it reduces expense ratably over the vesting period. Changes in these assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate and the amount of share-based compensation recognized. While we update our assumptions annually, we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to determine share-based compensation expense. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to changes in share-based compensation expense that could be material. The reported share-based compensation expense may not be representative of the actual economic cost of the share-based compensation. A 10% change in our share-based compensation expense for the year ended December 25, 2010, would have affected net income by approximately $750,000. 16 Table of Contents Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ From A ssumptions Self-Insurance Reserves: We self-insure a significant portion of our employee medical insurance, workers' compensation and general liability insurance plans. We have stop-loss insurance policies to protect from individual losses over specified dollar values. When estimating our self-insured liabilities, we consider a number of factors, including historical claims experience, demographic factors and severity factors. The full extent of certain claims, especially workers' compensation and general liability claims, may not become fully determined for several years. Our self-insured liabilities contain uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the ultimate cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not reported as of the balance sheet date. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our self-insurance reserves in the financial periods presented. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the assumptions we use to calculate insurance reserves. However, if we experience a significant increase in the number of claims or the cost associated with these claims, we may be exposed to losses that could be material. A 10% change in our self-insurance reserves at December 25, 2010, would have affected net income by approximately $1.8 million in fiscal 2010. Sales Tax Audit Reserve: A portion of our sales are to tax-exempt customers. We obtain exemption information as a necessary part of each tax-exempt transaction. Many of the states in which we conduct business will perform audits to verify our compliance with applicable sales tax laws. The business activities of our customers and the intended use of the unique products sold by us create a challenging and complex compliance environment. These circumstances also create some risk that we could be challenged as to the propriety of our sales tax compliance. While we believe we reasonably enforce sales tax compliance with our customers and endeavor to fully comply with all applicable sales tax regulations, there can be no assurance that we, upon final completion of such audits, would not have a significant liability for disallowed exemptions. We review our past audit experience and assessments with applicable states to determine if we have potential exposure for non-compliance. Any estimated liability is based on an initial assessment of compliance risk and our to-date experience with each audit. As each audit progresses, we quantify the exposure based on preliminary assessments made by the state auditors, adjusted for additional documentation that may be provided to reduce the assessment. Our sales tax audit reserve contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding the regulatory support for the complexity of agricultural-based exemptions, the ambiguity in state tax regulations, the number of ongoing audits, and the length of time required to settle with the state taxing authorities. We have not made any material changes in the methodology used to establish the sales tax audit reserve in the financial periods presented. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate the sales tax liability reserve for current audits. However, if our estimates regarding the ultimate sales tax liability are inaccurate, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. A 10% change in our sales tax liability reserve at December 25, 2010, would have affected net income by approximately $470,000 in fiscal 2010. Tax Contingencies: Our income tax returns are periodically audited by U.S. federal and state tax authorities. These audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. At any time, multiple tax years are subject to audit by the various tax authorities. In evaluating the exposures associated with our various tax filing positions, we record reserves for probable exposures. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter, for which we have established a reserve, is audited and fully resolved or clarified. We adjust our tax contingencies reserve and income tax provision in the period in which actual results of a settlement with tax authorities differs from our established reserve, the st atute of limitations expires for the relevant tax authority to examine the tax position or when more information becomes available. We recognize a liability for certain tax benefits that do not meet the minimum requirements for recognition in the financial statements. Our tax contingencies reserve contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions and whether or not the minimum requirements for recognition of tax benefits have been met. Our effective income tax rate is also affected by changes in tax law, the tax jurisdiction of new stores or business ventures, the level of earnings and the results of tax audits. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the reserves established for tax benefits not recognized. Although management believes that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable, actual results could differ, and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. To the extent we prevail in matters for which reserves have been established, or are required to pay amounts in excess of our reserves, our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected. An unfavorable tax settlement would require use of our cash and would result in an increase in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution. A favorable tax settlement would be recognized as a reduction in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution. A 10% change in our unrecognized tax benefit reserve at December 25, 2010 would have affected net income by approximately $370,000 in fiscal 2010. 17 Table of Contents Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ From A ssumptions Goodwill: Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized. We evaluate goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the goodwill may not be recoverable. We complete our impairment evaluation by performing internal valuation analyses, considering other publicly available market information and using an independent valuation firm, as appropriate. At December 26, 2009 all goodwill was associated with the Del business and, for purposes of the fiscal 2009 impairment testing, Del was considered the reporting unit. In October 2010, we reevaluated the Del reporting unit and concluded that since Del has become closely aligned in terms of management, infrastructure, philosophy and performance, we now have only one reporting unit for goodwill impairment evaluation. All goodwill at December 25, 2010 is associated with the Company as a whole. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, we completed our annual impairment testing of goodwill, and determined there was no impairment. We determined that the fair value of the reporting unit (including goodwill) was in excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit. In reaching this conclusion, the fair value of the reporting unit was determined based on a market approach. Under the market approach, the fair value is based on observed market prices. We determine fair value using widely accepted valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow and market multiple analyses. These types of analyses contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate industry economic factors and the profitability of future business strategies. Estimates include revenues, gross margins, operating costs and cash flows. We considered historical and estimated future results, economic and market conditions and the impact of planned business and operational strategies in deriving these estimates. In developing the key judgments and assumptions used to assess impairment, we consider economic, operational and market conditions that could impact the fair value of the reporting unit. These estimates and the judgments and assumptions upon which the estimates are based may differ in some respects from actual results. Should a significant or prolonged deterioration in economic conditions persist, then key judgments and assumptions may be impacted. At December 25, 2010, the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded the carrying value of its net assets by a significant amount. However, if actual results are not consistent with our current estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material. Long-Lived Assets: Long-lived assets other than goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, which are separately tested for impairment, are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. When evaluating long-lived assets for potential impairment, we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset estimated future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges). The evaluation for long-lived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is generally the individual store level. The significant assumptions used to determine estimated undiscounted cash flows include cash inflows and outflows directly resulting from the use of those assets in operations, including margin on net sales, payroll and related items, occupancy costs, insurance allocations and other costs to operate a store. If the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, we calculate an impairment loss. The impairment loss calculation compares the carrying value of the asset to the asset estimated fair value, which may be based on an estimated future cash flow model. We recognize an impairment loss if the amount of the asset carrying value exceeds the asset estimated fair value. If we recognize an impairment loss, the adjusted carrying amount of the asset becomes its new cost basis. For a depreciable long-lived asset, the new cost basis will be depreciated (amortized) over the remaining useful life of that asset. Our impairment loss calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values, including forecasting useful lives of the assets and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows. We have not made any material changes in our impairment loss assessment methodology in the financial periods presented. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate long-lived asset impairment losses. None of these estimates and assumptions are significantly sensitive, and a 10% change in any of these estimates would not have a material impact on our analysis. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values, we may be exposed to losses that could be material. 18 Table of Contents Quarterly Financial Data Our unaudited quarterly operating results for each fiscal quarter of 2010 and 2009 are shown below (in thousands, except per share amounts): First Quarter Second Quarter Third Quarter Fourth Quarter (2) 2010 (1) As Previously Reported As Adjusted As Previously Reported As Adjusted As Previously Reported As Adjusted As Reported Net sales $ 710,917 $ 710,917 $ 1,065,656 $ 1,065,656 $ 829,114 $ 829,114 $ 1,032,649 Gross margin 228,884 230,931 358,803 360,129 279,139 275,688 336,917 Operating income 14,420 16,467 122,322 123,648 50,858 47,407 78,702 Net income 9,308 10,582 76,487 77,318 32,017 29,863 50,209 Net income per share: (3) Basic $ 0.13 $ 0.15 $ 1.05 $ 1.06 $ 0.44 $ 0.41 $ 0.69 Diluted $ 0.13 $ 0.14 $ 1.02 $ 1.04 $ 0.43 $ 0.40 $ 0.67 Same-store sales increase 2.8 % 2.8 % 6.1 % 6.1 % 5.0 % 5.0 % 13.1 % First Quarter Second Quarter Third Quarter Fourth Quarter 2009 (1) As Previously Reported As Adjusted As Previously Reported As Adjusted As Previously Reported As Adjusted As Previously Reported As Adjusted Net sales $ 650,171 $ 650,171 $ 946,504 $ 946,504 $ 747,730 $ 747,730 $ 862,532 $ 862,532 Gross margin 201,036 203,870 302,198 305,901 246,038 247,934 285,685 284,184 Operating income 1,185 4,019 88,294 91,997 35,797 37,693 59,357 57,856 Net income 470 2,199 54,764 57,097 21,979 23,175 38,253 37,274 Net income per share: (3) Basic $ 0.01 $ 0.03 $ 0.76 $ 0.80 $ 0.30 $ 0.32 $ 0.53 $ 0.52 Diluted $ 0.01 $ 0.03 $ 0.75 $ 0.78 $ 0.30 $ 0.32 $ 0.52 $ 0.51 Same-store sales increase (decrease) 4.2 % 4.2 % (2.7 %) (2.7 %) (5.1 %) (5.1 %) 0.7 % 0.7 % (1) Amounts have been adjusted for the change in inventory accounting method from LIFO to average cost.

References to fiscal year mean the year in which that fiscal year ended. The fiscal years ended December 25, 2010, December 26, 2009 and December 27, 2008 contain 52 weeks. All amounts have been adjusted to reflect the Company election to change its method of accounting for inventories from the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method to the average cost method. The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain items in our Consolidated Statements of Income expressed as a percentage of net sales. 2010 2009 2008 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of merchandise sold (a) 66.9 67.5 68.2 Gross margin (a) 33.1 32.5 31.8 Selling, general and administrative expenses (a) 23.9 24.4 23.8 Depreciation and amortization 1.9 2.1 2.0 Operating income 7.3 6.0 6.0 Interest expense, net -- 0.1 0.1 Income before income taxes 7.3 5.9 5.9 Income tax provision 2.7 2.2 2.3 Net income 4.6 % 3.7 % 3.6 % (a) Our gross margin amounts may not be comparable to those of other retailers since some retailers include all of the costs related to their distribution network in cost of merchandise sold and others like us exclude a portion of these distribution network costs from gross margin and instead include them in selling, general and administrative ( SG&A ) expenses; refer to Note 1 Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009 Net sales increased 13.5% to $3.64 billion in fiscal 2010 from $3.21 billion in fiscal 2009. This increase resulted from the opening of new stores and a 7.0% increase in same-store sales. The same-store average daily transaction count increased 7.4%, while same-store transaction value decreased 0.3% for fiscal 2010. Same-store sales increased 7.0% compared with a same-store sales decrease of 1.1% in the prior year. This same-store sales increase was broad-based and driven by strong results in core consumable categories, principally animal and pet-related products, as well as seasonal products, including heating, insulated outerwear and outdoor power equipment. In fiscal 2010, we opened 74 new stores (compared to 76 new stores in fiscal 2009), relocated no stores (compared to two in fiscal 2009) and closed three stores (compared to one store in fiscal 2009). Gross margin increased 15.5% to $1.20 billion compared to $1.04 billion in 2009. As a percent of sales, gross margin increased to 33.1% for fiscal 2010 compared to 32.5% for fiscal 2009. The improvement in gross margin is primarily due to expanded direct product margin and a decrease in shrink, partially offset by increased transportation costs. The direct product margin improvement resulted from continued progress on margin driving initiatives which include strategic sourcing, inventory management, and more effective pricing. As a percent of sales, SG&A expenses including depreciation and amortization improved 70 basis points to 25.8% in fiscal 2010 from 26.5% in fiscal 2009. The improvement as a percent to sales was primarily attributable to the leverage of strong same-store sales and expense management, partially offset by an increase in incentive compensation expense. Net interest expense decreased 21.9% to $1.3 million in fiscal 2010 from $1.6 million in fiscal 2009. This decrease is directly related to lower average borrowings and a decline in interest charges associated with sales tax audits. Our effective tax rate decreased to 36.6% for fiscal 2010 compared to 36.9% in fiscal 2009. This reduction in the tax resulted from a greater tax benefit received on the disqualified disposition of incentive stock options during fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009. As a result of the foregoing factors, net income for fiscal 2010 increased 40.3% to $168.0 million, or $2.25 per diluted share, as compared to net income of $119.7 million, or $1.63 per diluted share, in fiscal 2009. During 2010, we repurchased approximately 0.8 million shares of stock for $38.2 million as part of our previously announced $400 million share repurchase program. In 2009, we repurchased approximately 0.4 million shares at a total cost of $15.3 million. As mentioned in Note 1 Significant Accounting Policies in Part II of this Form 10-K, the shares added to treasury were not adjusted for the stock split. Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008 Net sales increased 6.6% to $3.21 billion in fiscal 2009 from $3.01 billion in fiscal 2008. This increase resulted from the opening of new stores partially offset by a 1.1% decrease in same-store sales. The same-store average daily transaction count increased 5.3%, while same-store transaction value decreased 6.0% for fiscal 2009. Same-store sales decreased 1.1% compared with a same-store sales increase of 1.4% in the prior year. This same-store sales decline was primarily driven by softness in sales of seasonal big ticket (merchandise priced $350 or greater) and discretionary merchandise, partially offset by continued strong results in core consumable categories, including animal and pet-related products. 20 Table of Contents In fiscal 2009, we opened 76 new stores (compared to 91 new stores in fiscal 2008), relocated two stores (compared to one in fiscal 2008) and closed one store (compared to no stores in fiscal 2008). Gross margin increased 9.1% to $1,041.9 million compared to $955.1 million in 2008. As a percent of sales, gross margin increased to 32.5% for fiscal 2009 compared to 31.8% for fiscal 2008. The increase in gross margin resulted primarily from lower transportation costs. As a percent of sales, SG&A expenses increased 60 basis points to 24.4% in fiscal 2009 from 23.8% in fiscal 2008. This increase as a percent of sales was primarily attributable to the deleveraging related to the same-store sales decrease and higher incentive compensation and occupancy costs, partially offset by reduced marketing costs. Depreciation and amortization expense increased 10 basis points as a percent of sales in fiscal 2009 over fiscal 2008 due mainly to costs associated with new stores. Net interest expense decreased 22.9% to $1.6 million in fiscal 2009 from $2.1 million in fiscal 2008; however, net interest expense remained consistent as a percent of sales. This decrease is directly related to lower average borrowings partially offset by higher interest charges associated with sales tax audits. Our effective tax rate decreased to 36.9% for fiscal 2009 compared to 38.7% in fiscal 2008. This reduction in the tax resulted from the favorable impact of certain federal tax credits and a lower percentage of unfavorable permanent tax differences relative to income before taxes. As a result of the foregoing factors, net income for fiscal 2009 increased 10.9% to $119.7 million, or $1.63 per diluted share, as compared to net income of $108.0 million, or $1.44 per diluted share, in fiscal 2008. During 2009, we repurchased approximately 0.4 million shares of stock for $15.3 million as part of our previously announced $400 million share repurchase program. In 2008, we repurchased approximately 1.6 million shares at a total cost of $53.9 million. As mentioned in Note 1 Significant Accounting Policies in Part II of this Form 10-K, the shares added to treasury were not adjusted for the stock split. Liquidity and Capital Resources In addition to normal operating expenses, our primary ongoing cash requirements are for expansion, remodeling and relocation programs, including inventory purchases and capital expenditures. Our primary ongoing sources of liquidity are existing cash balances, funds provided from operations, commitments available under our revolving credit agreement, capital and operating leases and normal trade credit. Our inventory and accounts payable levels typically build in the first and third fiscal quarters in anticipation of the spring and winter selling seasons, respectively. Financial markets experienced volatility in the past few years, resulting in disruptions in credit and lending activities. Further, disruptions in the capital and credit markets could adversely affect the ability of the banks to meet their commitments. Our access to funds under the credit facility is dependent on the ability of the banks that are parties to the facility to meet their funding commitments. Those banks may not be able to meet their funding commitments to us if they experience shortages of capital and liquidity or if they experience excessive volumes of borrowing requests within a short period of time. We have a diversified banking group which we believe should help mitigate any potential disruptions, if one occurs. Working Capital At December 25, 2010, we had working capital of $617.1 million, a $141.2 million increase from December 26, 2009. This increase was primarily attributable to changes in the following components of current assets and current liabilities (in millions): 2010 2009 Variance Current assets: Cash and cash equivalents $ 257.3 $ 172.9 $ 84.4 Short-term investments 15.9 -- 15.9 Inventories 736.5 676.5 60.0 Prepaid expenses and other current assets 34.0 30.7 3.3 1,043.7 880.1 163.6 Current liabilities: Accounts payable $ 247.4 $ 261.6 $ (14.2 ) Accrued employee compensation 34.6 22.7 11.9 Other accrued expenses 127.4 100.7 26.7 Current portion of capital lease obligation 0.1 0.4 (0.3 ) Income taxes payable 8.3 7.3 1.0 Deferred income taxes 8.8 11.5 (2.7 ) 426.6 404.2 22.4 Working capital $ 617.1 $ 475.9 $ 141.2 In comparison to prior year end, working capital increased primarily as a result of an increase in cash and inventory. The increase in cash resulted principally from stronger earnings. The increase in inventory was primarily due to new store growth. Average inventory per store remained nearly flat at $709,000 for fiscal 2010 compared to $707,000 for fiscal 2009. This was partially offset by an increase in accrued expenses principally as a result of timing of payments and higher incentive compensation accruals over the prior year. Accounts payable has declined as a result of an increase in cash held in our bank concentration account, which nets against accounts payable, as well as more timely payments in order to capture payment discounts offered by our vendors. Trade credit arises from our vendors granting payment terms for inventory purchases. Payment terms generally vary from 30 days to 180 days depending on the inventory product. Certain vendors offer payment discounts for payments made within a shorter period, typically within 10 to 15 days. 21 Table of Contents Borrowings and Credit Facilities We are party to a Senior Credit Facility with Bank of America, N.A., as agent for a lender group (the Credit Agreement ), which provides for borrowings up to $350 million (with sublimits of $75 million and $20 million for letters of credit and swingline loans, respectively). The Credit Agreement has an Increase Option for $150 million (subject to additional lender group commitments). The Credit Agreement is unsecured and matures in February 2012, with proceeds expected to be used for working capital, capital expenditures and share repurchases. At December 25, 2010 and December 26, 2009, there were no outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement. There were $27.4 million and $35.2 million outstanding letters of credit as of December 25, 2010 and December 26, 2009, respectively. Borrowings bear interest at either the bank base rate (3.25% at December 25, 2010) or the London Inter-Bank Offer Rate ( LIBOR ) (0.26% at December 25, 2010) plus an additional amount ranging from 0.35% to 0.90% per annum, adjusted quarterly based on our performance (0.40% at December 25, 2010). We are also required to pay, quarterly in arrears, a commitment fee ranging from 0.06% to 0.18% per annum and adjusted quarterly based on our performance, for unused capacity (0.075% at December 25, 2010). There are no com pensating balance requirements associated with the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement requires quarterly compliance with respect to two material covenants: a fixed charge coverage ratio and a leverage ratio. The fixed charge coverage ratio principally compares earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, stock compensation and rent expense ( consolidated EBITDAR ) to the sum of interest paid and rental expense (excluding straight-line rent). The leverage ratio principally compares total debt plus rental expense (excluding straight-line rent) multiplied by a factor of six to consolidated EBITDAR. The Credit Agreement also contains certain other restrictions regarding additional indebtedness, capital expenditures, business operations, guarantees, investments, mergers, consolidations and sales of assets, transactions with subsidiar ies or affiliates, and liens. We were in compliance with all covenants at December 25, 2010. Sources and Uses of Cash Our primary source of liquidity is cash provided by operations. Principal uses of cash for investing activities are capital expenditures and financing activities are payments on debt, repurchase of the Company common stock, and payment of common stock dividends. The following table presents a summary of cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the last three fiscal years (in millions): 2010 2009 2008 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 222.6 $ 215.3 $ 217.7 Net cash used in investing activities (112.1 ) (73.8 ) (88.4 ) Net cash used in financing activities (26.0 ) (5.6 ) (105.5 ) Net increase in cash and cash equivalents $ 84.5 $ 135.9 $ 23.8 Operating Activities The $7.3 million increase in net cash provided by operations in fiscal 2010 over fiscal 2009 is primarily due to changes in the following operating activities (in millions): 2010 2009 Variance Net income $ 168.0 $ 119.7 $ 48.3 Depreciation and amortization 69.8 66.3 3.5 Stock compensation expense 11.8 12.1 (0.3 ) Deferred income taxes 2.7 (11.1 ) 13.8 Inventories and accounts payable (74.3 ) (29.9 ) (44.4 ) Prepaid expenses and other current assets (3.2 ) 11.2 (14.4 ) Accrued expenses 38.5 22.3 16.2 Income taxes payable 1.0 7.8 (6.8 ) Other, net 8.3 16.9 (8.6 ) Net cash provided by operations $ 222.6 $ 215.3 $ 7.3 Cash flow from operating activities continues to provide the primary source of our liquidity. The increase in net cash provided by operations in fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009 was primarily due to stronger net income and an increase in accrued expenses partially offset by an increase in inventory, net of accounts payable, and an increase in prepaids and other current assets. Continued store growth has resulted in increased inventory balances. Accounts payable levels have decreased as a result of more timely payments in order to capture payment discounts offered by vendors and also as a result of an increase in cash held in our bank concentration account. The bank concentration account nets against the related book overdraft included in accounts payable. Accrued expenses increased as a result of timing of pa yments as well as incentive compensation earned in fiscal 2010 but not paid until fiscal 2011. The $2.4 million decrease in net cash provided by operations in fiscal 2009 over fiscal 2008 is primarily due to changes in the following operating activities (in millions): 2009 2008 Variance Net income $ 119.7 $ 108.0 $ 11.7 Depreciation and amortization 66.3 60.7 5.6 Stock compensation expense 12.1 12.3 (0.2 ) Deferred income taxes (11.1 ) 18.5 (29.6 ) Inventories and accounts payable (29.9 ) 18.2 (48.1 ) Prepaid expenses and other current assets 11.2 1.0 10.2 Accrued expenses 22.3 (1.8 ) 24.1 Income taxes payable 7.8 (6.3 ) 14.1 Other, net 16.9 7.1 9.8 Net cash provided by operations $ 215.3 $ 217.7 $ (2.4 ) 22 Table of Contents The decrease in net cash provided by operations in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008 was due to changes in inventory levels and the timing of payments, partially offset by higher net income and an increase in accrued expenses. Inventory levels remained nearly flat in 2009 compared to 2008 due to a continued focus on inventory management in 2009. Accounts payable levels have decreased substantially as a result of more timely payments to capture payment discounts offered by vendors. Accrued expenses increased as a result of timing of payments as well as incentive compensation earned in fiscal 2009 but not paid until fiscal 2010. Investing Activities Investing activities used $112.1 million, $73.8 million and $88.4 million in fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The majority of this cash requirement relates to our capital expenditures. Our significant store expansion, coupled with required investment in infrastructure, resulted in the following capital expenditures, including capital leases (in millions): 2010 2009 2008 New and relocated stores and stores not yet opened $ 28.6 $ 31.7 $ 39.8 Distribution center capacity and improvements 18.1 4.3 16.2 Existing stores 17.6 18.4 10.0 Information technology 14.9 17.6 17.2 Purchase of previously leased stores 11.6 -- 8.5 Corporate and other 5.7 2.0 0.1 $ 96.5 $ 74.0 $ 91.8 Our long-term growth strategy anticipates continued geographic market expansion and further concentration within existing markets. This growth will also require continuing investment in information technology. The costs reflected above are typically building improvements, as we lease the majority of our facilities. We currently estimate that capital expenditures will range between $150 million and $160 million in fiscal 2011. While we plan to open only a few more stores in 2011 compared to 2010, we expect to have additional capital expenditures next year as we construct a new distribution center and implement a comprehensive warehouse management system designed to improve throughput and efficiencies in the distribution center network, along with other efficiency-driving system enhancements in 2011. Financing Activities Financing activities used $26.0 million, $5.6 million, and $105.5 million in fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The cash used by financing activities in fiscal 2010 is mainly the result of quarterly cash dividends paid to stockholders and repurchases of common stock, partially offset by increased net proceeds from issuance of common stock related to share-based compensation. We have a Board-approved share repurchase program which provides for repurchase of up to $400 million of common stock, exclusive of any fees, commissions, or other expenses related to such repurchases, through December 2011. The repurchases may be made from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. The timing and amount of any shares repurchased under the program will depend on a variety of factors, including price, corporate and regulatory requirements, capital availability, and other market conditions. Repurchased shares will be held in treasury. The program may be limited or terminated at any time without prior notice. We repurchased approximately 0.8 million, 0.4 million and 1.6 million shares under the share repurchase program for a total cost of $38.2 million, $15.3 million and $53.9 million in fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. As mentioned in Note 1 Significant Accounting Policies in Part II of this Form 10-K, the shares added to treasury were not adjusted for the stock split. Repurchased shares are accounted for at cost and will be held in treasury for future issuance. As of December 25, 2010, we had remaining authorization under the share repurchase program of $142.8 million exclusive of any fees, commissions, or other expenses. We believe that our existing cash balances, expected cash flow from future operations, borrowings available under the Credit Agreement, and normal trade credit will be sufficient to fund our operations and our capital expenditure needs, including store openings, relocations and renovations, over the next several years. Significant Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following table reflects our future obligations and commitments as of December 25, 2010 (in thousands): Payment Due by Period Total Contractual Obligations Less than 1 year 1-3 years 4-5 years More than 5 years Operating leases $ 1,545,028 $ 174,846 $ 335,140 $ 297,282 $ 737,760 Capital leases (1) 2,716 206 292 292 1,926 Purchase obligations (2) 32,242 32,242 -- -- -- $ 1,579,986 $ 207,294 $ 335,432 $ 297,574 $ 739,686 (1) Capital lease obligations include related interest. (2) The amounts for purchase obligations include commitments for construction of stores and a distribution center expected to be opened in fiscal 2011. The Company had outstanding letters of credit of $27.4 million as of December 25, 2010. 23 Table of Contents Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Our off-balance sheet arrangements consist of operating leases and outstanding letters of credit. The balances for these arrangements are discussed above. We typically lease buildings for retail stores and offices rather than acquiring these assets which allows us to utilize financial capital to operate the business rather than invest in fixed assets. Letters of credit allow us to purchase inventory, primarily sourced overseas, and support certain risk management programs in a timely manner. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 810 (originally issued as Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 167, Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. ( FIN ) 46(R) ). Among other items, ASC 810 responds to concerns about an enterprise application of certain key provisions of FIN 46(R), including those regarding the transparency of the enterprise involvement with variable interest entities. ASC 810 is effective for the first annual period that begins after November 15, 2009, and for interim periods within that first annual reporting period. The Company adopted the standard for the interim period ended March 27, 2010. There was no impact on the C ompany financial position, results of operations, cash flows, or disclosures. In February 2010, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2010-09 (ASU No. 2010-09), Subsequent Events (Topic 855): Amendments to Certain Recognition and Disclosure Requirements. The amendments remove the requirements for an SEC filer to disclose a date, in both issued and revised financial statements, through which subsequent events have been reviewed. Revised financial statements include financial statements revised as a result of either correction of an error or retrospective application of U.S. GAAP. ASU No. 2010-09 was effective upon issuance. The adoption of this guidance did not have an impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. I tem 7A . Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We may be exposed to changes in interest rates primarily from the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement bears interest at either the bank base rate (3.25% at both December 25, 2010 and December 26, 2009) or LIBOR (0.26% and 0.23% at December 25, 2010 and December 26, 2009, respectively) plus an additional amount ranging from 0.35% to 0.90% per annum, adjusted quarterly, based on our performance (0.40% and 0.50% at December 25, 2010 and December 26, 2009, respectively). We are also required to pay (quarterly in arrears) a commitment fee ranging from 0.06% to 0.18% based on the daily average unused portion of the credit line (0.075% at December 25, 2010 and 0.10% December 26, 2009). 24 Table of Contents
