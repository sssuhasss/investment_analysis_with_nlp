ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview of Our Business We are a diversified power generation and utility company organized into six market-oriented Strategic Business Units ( SBUs ): US (United States), Andes (Chile, Colombia, and Argentina), Brazil, MCAC (Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean), EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa), and Asia. For additional information regarding our business, see Item 1. Business of this Form 10-K. 75 Our Organization The segment reporting structure uses the Company management reporting structure as its foundation to reflect how the Company manages the business internally and is organized by geographic regions which provide better socio-political-economic understanding of our business. The management reporting structure is organized along six strategic business units ( SBUs ) led by our Chief Executive Officer ( CEO ). In 2012, the Company substantially completed its operational management and reporting restructuring. During the fourth quarter of 2013, the Company finalized its internal operational reporting and applied the accounting guidance for segment reporting. As a result, the Company has determined that its reportable segments are aligned with the six SBU's. Management discussion and analysis of Operating Margin, Adjusted Operating Margin and Adjusted Pre-Tax Contribution is organized according to the SBU structure as follows: US SBU Andes SBU Brazil SBU MCAC SBU EMEA SBU Asia SBU Corporate and Other The Company corporate operations are reported within Corporate and Other because they do not require separate disclosure under segment reporting accounting guidance. Key Topics in the Management Discussion and Analysis Our discussion covers the following: Overview of 2013 Results and Strategic Performance Review of Consolidated Results of Operations SBU Analysis and Non-GAAP Measures Key Trends and Uncertainties Capital Resources and Liquidity Overview of 2013 Results and Strategic Performance In 2013, our performance was driven by very dry hydrological conditions across key markets in Latin America, our cost reductions, capital allocation decisions, including debt repayment and share repurchases, and a lower effective tax rate. Earnings Per Share Results in 2013 Year Ended December 31, 2013 2012 2011 Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations $ 0.38 $ (1.27 ) $ 0.65 Adjusted earnings per share (a non-GAAP measure) (1) $ 1.29 $ 1.21 $ 1.11 _____________________________ (1) See reconciliation and definition under Non-GAAP Measure. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased $1.65 , to $0.38 , principally due to lower goodwill impairment expense, lower income tax expense, lower foreign currency losses, and lower interest expense, partially offset by lower operating margin, an increase in losses on early extinguishment of debt, lower gain on sale of investments, higher losses from disposal and impairment of discontinued businesses, and higher other than temporary impairments of our equity method investments. Adjusted earnings per share, a non-GAAP measure, increased by 7% to $1.29 primarily due to a lower effective tax rate, lower interest expense, and lower general and administrative expenses, partially offset by lower operating margin. Management Priorities Management is focused on the following priorities: Management of our portfolio of Generation and Utility businesses to create value for our stakeholders, including customers and shareholders, through safe, reliable, and sustainable operations and effective cost management; 76 Driving our business to manage capital more effectively and to increase the amount of discretionary cash available for deployment into debt repayment, growth investments, shareholder dividends and share buybacks; Realignment of our geographic focus. To this end, we will continue to exit markets where we do not have a competitive advantage or where we are unable to earn a fair risk-adjusted return relative to monetization alternatives. In addition, we will focus our growth investments on platform expansions or opportunities to expand our existing operations; and Reduce the cash flow and earnings volatility of our businesses by proactively managing our currency, commodity and political risk exposures, mostly through contractual and regulatory mechanisms, as well as commercial hedging activities. We also will continue to limit our risk by utilizing non-recourse project financing for the majority of our businesses. 2013 Strategic Performance We continued to execute on our strategic objectives of safe, reliable and sustainable operations, improvement of available capital and deployment of discretionary cash and realignment of our geographic focus. Key highlights of our progress during the year ended December 31, 2013 include: Safe, Reliable and Sustainable Operations Our 2013 operating performance for the year was driven by the strategic management of our assets and cost reductions across our portfolio, but we also faced dry hydrological conditions across many markets in Latin America and challenges at two of our utilities in Brazil and the US. We continue to focus on safety as our top priority. Our safety performance improved in 2013, as we lowered our lost-time incident case rates for both employees and operational contractors. AES' strategic initiatives have resulted in both better operational availability and reliability of our generation portfolio, as measured by our Key Performance Indicators ("KPIs"). For example, our asset management program works to optimize the timing of plant maintenance by focusing on market pricing trends to minimize the costs of outages. This is evidenced by our performance in the Commercial Availability ("CA") KPI, as defined below, which improved 4%. Another strategic initiative focuses on the techniques of coal blending and using a variety of coals to improve margin. Coal blending can reduce the efficiency of certain generating units, which unfavorably affects our heat rate; however, it is offset by the financial benefits from utilizing lower-cost coal. Our utility portfolio also recorded some improvements in KPIs for the year. Our dedication to providing reliable energy is evidenced by the improvement in our System Average Interruption Duration Index ("SAIDI") and System Average Interruption Frequency Index ("SAIFI"), which improved 15% and 24%, respectively, compared to 2012. SAIDI and SAIFI metrics benefited in 2013 from fewer significant weather events in the US and asset optimization in the US and Brazil, such as crew productivity improvement, tree-trimming, and pole replacement. Our key performance indicators for 2013 and 2012 are as follows: For the Years Ended December 31, 2013 2012 Variance 2012-2013 Safety: Employee Lost-Time Incident Case Rate .105 .108 3% Safety: Operational Contractor Lost-Time Incident Case Rate .114 .173 34% Generation Commercial Availability (%) 93.55 % 89.09 % 4.46 % Equivalent Forced Outage Factor (EFOF, %) 2.92 % 2.93 % % Heat Rate (BTU/kWh) 9,638 9,476 (162 ) Utility System Average Interruption Duration Index (SAIDI, hours) 5.96 7.01 1.05 System Average Interruption Frequency Index (SAIFI, number of interruptions) 2.97 3.93 0.96 Non-Technical Losses (%) 2.52 % 2.19 % (0.33 )% _________________________________________________ Definitions: Lost-Time Incident Case Rate: Number of lost-time cases per number of full-time employees or contractors. Commercial Availability: Actual variable margin, as a percentage of potential variable margin if the unit had been available at full capacity during outages. Equivalent Forced Outage Factor: The percentage of the time that a plant is not capable of producing energy, due to unplanned operational reductions in production. 77 Heat Rate: The amount of energy used by an electrical generator or power plant to generate one kilowatt-hour (kWh). System Average Interruption Duration Index: The total hours of interruption the average customer experiences annually. System Average Interruption Frequency Index: The average number of interruptions the average customer experiences annually. Non-Technical Losses: Delivered energy that was not billed due to measurement error, theft or other reasons. We achieved the improvement in our KPIs while also reducing costs across our portfolio. Since 2011, we have reduced our general and administrative and business development costs at our corporate offices and our SBUs by $143 million. While we made progress on our KPIs and cost cutting initiatives in 2013, generation in gigawatt-hours (GWh) decreased 4%, driven by dry hydrological conditions in many markets in Latin America. The impact of low water inflows on our generation was most significant in Panama, Colombia, and Brazil. Finally, two of our utility businesses in Brazil and Ohio faced some challenges. In Brazil, Eletropaulo received a ruling on customer refunds in December 2013, which resulted in a $269 million regulatory liability recognized in the fourth quarter. AES owns 16% of Eletropaulo. See Item 1. Brazil SBU Eletropaulo Eletropaulo Regulatory Asset Base Update for further discussion. In Ohio, DPL received a ruling on its ESP application to establish rates effective January 1, 2014. While the ruling allows for a non-bypassable charge through 2016, lower expectations for dark spreads and capacity prices present longer-term challenges for the business. As a result of these and other factors, DPL recorded a goodwill impairment of $307 million in the fourth quarter. See Item 1. US SBU DPL Regulatory Matters for further discussion of the ruling and Note 10. Goodwill and Other Intangibles for further discussion of the impairment. Improving Available Capital and Deployment of Discretionary Cash We continue to focus on improving cash generation and optimizing the use of our parent discretionary cash. During 2013, we generated $2.7 billion of cash flow from operating activities and closed multiple asset sales. In terms of uses, we deployed our discretionary cash to pay four quarterly dividends of $0.04 per share, allocated $322 million to repurchase 25 million shares (see Note 16. - Equity in Item 8. - Financial Statements of this Form 10-K for further information), allocated $464 million to reduce recourse debt and extend near-term maturities at the Parent Company, and invested $198 million in our subsidiaries for platform expansions and other purposes. The largest platform investments in 2013 included environmental upgrades at Indianapolis Power & Light facilities that will receive full recovery for qualifying costs, including a return on equity, and our expansion project at our Amman East facility in Jordan. Realigning Our Geographic Focus In 2013, we announced or closed 8 asset sale transactions, representing $497 million in equity proceeds to AES. With these transactions, we exited operations in Spain, China, Ukraine, and Trinidad, and we plan to exit Cameroon after the sale of our Cameroonian businesses closes in 2014. These asset sales are part of our strategy to drive shareholder value by exiting markets where we do not have a compelling competitive advantage and reinvesting capital into expanding our platforms. Throughout 2013, we added 522 MW of new capacity, through four platform expansion projects. Our planned future capacity growth will come from a combination of projects currently under construction and development. We have 2,762 MW of new capacity under construction, including the 531 MW Alto Maipo hydroelectric project in Chile, which broke ground late in 2013. In addition, we have environmental upgrades of approximately 2,400 MW under construction at Indianapolis Power & Light (IPL). These projects are scheduled to come on-line through 2018. 78 Review of Consolidated Results of Operations Years Ended December 31, Results of operations 2013 2012 2011 % change 2013 vs. 2012 % change 2012 vs. 2011 ($ in millions, except per share amounts) Revenue: US SBU $ 3,630 $ 3,736 $ 2,088 -3 % 79 % Andes SBU 2,639 3,020 2,989 -13 % 1 % Brazil SBU 5,015 5,788 6,640 -13 % -13 % MCAC SBU 2,713 2,573 2,327 5 % 11 % EMEA SBU 1,347 1,344 1,469 % -9 % Asia SBU 550 733 625 -25 % 17 % Corporate and Other 7 9 8 -22 % 13 % Intersegment eliminations (10 ) (39 ) (48 ) 74 % 19 % Total Revenue 15,891 17,164 16,098 -7 % 7 % Operating Margin: US SBU $ 668 $ 711 $ 395 -6 % 80 % Andes SBU 533 580 743 -8 % -22 % Brazil SBU 871 969 1,802 -10 % -46 % MCAC SBU 543 560 512 -3 % 9 % EMEA SBU 415 504 395 -18 % 28 % Asia SBU 169 236 167 -28 % 41 % Corporate and Other (16 ) (12 ) -33 % NA Intersegment eliminations 64 35 26 83 % 35 % Total Operating Margin 3,247 3,583 4,040 -9 % -11 % General and administrative expenses (220 ) (274 ) (346 ) 20 % 21 % Interest expense (1,482 ) (1,544 ) (1,530 ) 4 % -1 % Interest income 275 348 398 -21 % -13 % Loss on extinguishment of debt (229 ) (8 ) (62 ) NM 87 % Other expense (76 ) (82 ) (86 ) 7 % 5 % Other income 125 98 142 28 % -31 % Gain on sale of investments 26 219 8 -88 % NM Goodwill impairment expense (372 ) (1,817 ) (17 ) 80 % NM Asset impairment expense (95 ) (73 ) (173 ) -30 % 58 % Foreign currency transaction losses (22 ) (170 ) (32 ) 87 % -431 % Other non-operating expense (129 ) (50 ) (82 ) -158 % 39 % Income tax expense (343 ) (685 ) (656 ) 50 % -4 % Net equity in earnings (losses) of affiliates 25 35 (2 ) -29 % NM Income (loss) from continuing operations 730 (420 ) 1,602 274 % -126 % Income (loss) from operations of discontinued businesses (27 ) 47 (158 ) -157 % 130 % Net gain (loss) from disposal and impairments of discontinued businesses (152 ) 16 86 NM -81 % Net income (loss) 551 (357 ) 1,530 254 % -123 % Noncontrolling interests: Loss from continuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interests (446 ) (540 ) (1,096 ) 17 % 51 % Income (loss) from discontinued operations attributable to noncontrolling interests 9 (15 ) (376 ) 160 % 96 % Net income (loss) attributable to The AES Corporation $ 114 $ (912 ) $ 58 113 % NM AMOUNTS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE AES CORPORATION COMMON STOCKHOLDERS: Income (loss) from continuing operations, net of tax $ 284 $ (960 ) $ 506 130 % -290 % Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax (170 ) 48 (448 ) -454 % 111 % Net income (loss) $ 114 $ (912 ) $ 58 113 % NM Net cash provided by operating activities $ 2,715 $ 2,901 $ 2,884 -6 % 1 % Cash dividends per common share $ 0.17 $ 0.08 $ 113 % NA __ ___________________________ NM Not meaningful 79 Components of Revenue, Cost of Sales and Operating Margin Revenue includes revenue earned from the sale of energy from our utilities and the production of energy from our generation plants, which are classified as regulated and non-regulated on the Consolidated Statements of Operations, respectively. Revenue also includes the gains or losses on derivatives (including embedded derivatives other than foreign currency embedded derivatives) associated with the sale of electricity. Cost of sales includes costs incurred directly by the businesses in the ordinary course of business. Examples include electricity and fuel purchases, operations and maintenance costs, depreciation and amortization expense, bad debt expense and recoveries, general administrative and support costs (including employee-related costs directly associated with the operations of the business). Cost of sales also includes the gains or losses on derivatives (including embedded derivatives other than foreign currency embedded derivatives) associated with the purchase of electricity or fuel. Operating margin is defined as revenue less cost of sales. Year ended December 31, 2013 : Revenue decrease d $1.3 billion , or 7% , to $15.9 billion in 2013 compared with $17.2 billion in 2012 . The key operating drivers of the change at each of the SBUs are as follows: US Overall unfavorable impact of $106 million driven by the early termination of the PPA at Beaver Valley in early 2013, customer switching as well as lower capacity rates at DPL, and the short-term restart in 2012 of two Huntington Beach generating units at Southland in California, partially offset by higher wholesale volume and prices at IPL in Indiana. Andes Overall unfavorable impact of $381 million driven by unfavorable FX of $128 million, lower prices from the impact of Resolution 95 in Argentina, and lower contract and spot prices at Gener in Chile, partially offset by higher spot prices at Chivor in Colombia as a result of dry hydrology. Brazil Overall unfavorable impact of $773 million driven by unfavorable FX of $631 million, lower demand as well as lower pass-through costs and the tariff reset implemented in April 2013 at Sul, and a decrease at Eletropaulo related to the recognition of a regulatory liability for customer refunds (See Item 1. - Business - Brazil SBU - Eletropaulo Regulatory Asset Base Update ) somewhat offset by higher tariffs. Negative results above partially offset by higher prices and sales at Tiet and the temporary re-start of operations during February and March of 2013 at Uruguaiana. MCAC Overall favorable impact of $140 million driven by higher spot prices as well as higher spot and gas sales to third parties in the Dominican Republic, higher prices in Mexico and Puerto Rico, partially offset by lower generation net of higher prices due to lower hydrology in Panama. EMEA Overall favorable impact of $3 million driven by higher energy prices at Kilroot, pass-through costs at Maritza and Jordan, as well as higher dispatch and fewer outages at Ballylumford, partially offset by lower capacity prices. The favorable results above were largely offset by the sale of 80% of our ownership in Cartagena in February 2012 and a non-recurring favorable arbitration settlement in 2012. Asia Overall unfavorable impact of $183 million due to higher contract levels at lower prices to reduce spot exposure, the reversal of a contingency and unrealized derivative gains in 2012 at Masinloc in the Philippines as well as lower generation at Kelanitissa in Sri Lanka as a result of higher hydrology. Operating margin decrease d $336 million , or 9% , to $3.2 billion in 2013 compared with $3.6 billion in 2012 . The key operating drivers of the change at each of the SBUs are as follows: US Overall unfavorable impact of $43 million driven by the short-term restart of two Huntington Beach units at Southland in 2012, higher outages and related fixed costs at Hawaii, and higher maintenance costs at IPL in Indiana. The negative drivers above were partially offset by higher contributions for US Wind businesses and DPL with lower amortization expense largely offset by higher customer switching. Andes Overall unfavorable impact of $47 million driven by Chivor due to lower generation, somewhat offset by higher spot prices due to dry hydrology, and Chile due to lower generation, higher spot purchases, and lower contract prices, offset by the commencement of operations of Ventanas IV in March 2013. These negative drivers were partially offset by lower outages and higher volumes at Argentina, somewhat offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation and lower rates from the implementation of Resolution 95. Brazil Overall unfavorable impact of $98 million driven by unfavorable FX impact of $84 million, lower tariffs and demand at Sul, as well as lower volumes and higher energy purchases due to low hydrology at Tiet , partially offset by the favorable reversal of a liability and the temporary re-start of operations at Uruguaiana and 80 higher tariffs and lower fixed costs at Eletropaulo, somewhat offset by recognition of a regulatory liability as discussed above. MCAC Overall unfavorable impact of $17 million driven by Panama due to dry hydrological conditions, which resulted in lower generation and higher energy purchases at higher prices, somewhat offset by favorable net settlements. Negative drivers above were partially offset by the Dominican Republic with higher spot sales, higher international gas prices and volume of gas sales to third parties and higher availability in El Salvador due to the tariff increase at the beginning of 2013. EMEA Overall unfavorable impact of $89 million driven by Cartagena due to a non-recurring, favorable arbitration settlement in 2012 and the two-stage sale of the business as discussed above as well as Ballylumford due to lower capacity payments, somewhat offset by fewer outages. The negative results above were partially offset by favorable dark spreads from higher energy prices and lower coal costs at Kilroot and fewer outages and lower fixed costs at Maritza. Asia Overall unfavorable impact of $67 million driven by higher contracted volume at lower prices as discussed above as well as reversal of a contingency of $16 million and an unrealized derivative gain in 2012 at Masinloc. Year Ended December 31, 2012 Revenue increased $1.1 billion , or 7% , to $17.2 billion in 2012 compared with $16.1 billion in 2011 . The key operating drivers of the change at each of the SBUs are as follows: US Overall favorable impact of $1.6 billion driven by the impact of new businesses including $1.5 billion at DPL, acquired in November 2011. Additional drivers include IPL in Indiana with higher prices and Southland in California due to the short-term restart of two Huntington Beach generating units in 2012. Andes Overall favorable impact of $31 million driven by Chile due to the impact of new operations at Angamos in Chile which commenced operations in April 2011 as well as higher contract volume, partially offset by lower spot sales from Termoandes in Argentina to Chile and Chivor due to higher prices. Favorable drivers above partially offset by unfavorable FX of $66 million and Argentina due to lower prices and the impact of outages, despite higher volume. Brazil Overall unfavorable impact of $852 million driven by unfavorable FX of $1.1 billion as well as Eletropaulo due to lower tariffs as a result of the July 2012 tariff reset, which was delayed from July 2011, partially offset by higher pass-through costs at Sul and higher contract and spot prices at Tiet . MCAC Overall favorable impact of $246 million driven by new operations at Changuinola, which commenced operations in October 2011, and the re-start of operations at the Esti plant in Panama, as well as the Dominican Republic due to higher prices and volume from gas sales and higher ancillary services, slightly offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation impact of $17 million in Mexico. EMEA Overall unfavorable impact of $125 million driven by unfavorable FX of $39 million, a decrease at Cartagena due to the sale of 80% of our ownership in February 2012, somewhat offset by a non-recurring favorable arbitration settlement, and Ballylumford in the United Kingdom due to higher outages and lower demand. The lower results were partially offset by new operations at Maritza, which commenced operations in June 2011. Asia Overall favorable impact of $108 million driven by Masinloc in the Philippines due to higher demand net of lower prices, the reversal of a contingency and unrealized derivative gains in 2012, and favorable foreign currency translation of $14 million. Operating margin decreased $457 million, or 11%, to $3.6 billion in 2012 compared with $4.0 billion in 2011 . The key operating drivers of the change at each of the SBUs are as follows: US Overall favorable impact of $316 million driven by the first full year of operations at DPL, lower repair and maintenance costs at IPL, the short-term restart of two units at Southland, and fewer outages at Hawaii. Andes Overall unfavorable impact of $163 million driven by Chile due to higher replacement energy costs and lower spot sales at Termoandes, Argentina due to lower prices and higher fixed costs, partially offset by an increase at Chivor due to non-recurring equity tax in 2011 and a net favorable impact of higher spot prices and lower volumes. 81 Brazil Overall unfavorable impact of $833 million driven by unfavorable FX impact of $146 million, lower tariffs at Eletropaulo as discussed above and higher fixed costs, partially offset by higher contract prices from the annual PPA price adjustment at Tiet , and higher tariffs at Sul. MCAC Overall favorable impact of $48 million driven by Panama due to the first full year of operations at Changuinola as well as the re-start of operations at the Esti plant, somewhat offset by lower prices as well as Mexico due to fewer outages and higher volume and the Dominican Republic due to favorable prices, primarily higher spot and LNG prices, somewhat offset by lower availability. EMEA Overall favorable impact of $109 million driven by Maritza due to the first full year of operations, Kilroot with increased dispatch, and Cartagena due to a non-recurring favorable arbitration settlement, somewhat offset by the sale of 80% as discussed above. The favorable drivers above were partially offset by Ballylumford due to lower capacity prices, higher outages and related maintenance costs, and lower volume. Asia Overall favorable impact of $69 million driven by Masinloc due to higher market demand net of lower rates, the reversal of a contingency and higher unrealized derivative gains. General and administrative expenses General and administrative expenses includes expenses related to corporate staff functions and/or initiatives, executive management, finance, legal, human resources and information systems, as well as global development costs. General and administrative expenses decrease d $54 million , or 20% , to $220 million in 2013 from 2012 primarily due to Company restructuring efforts, resulting in a decrease in employee related costs, professional fees and business development costs. General and administrative expenses decrease d $72 million , or 21% , to $274 million in 2012 from 2011 primarily due to reductions in business development and systems administration costs. Interest expense Interest expense decrease d $62 million , or 4% , to $1.5 billion in 2013 from 2012 . The decrease was primarily due to reduced debt principal as well as the prior year prepayment of an interest rate cash flow hedge that resulted in a reclassification of deferred losses from other comprehensive income to earnings at the Parent Company, favorable foreign currency translation and lower interest rates in Brazil, as well as income resulting from ineffectiveness on interest rate swaps in Puerto Rico that continue to qualify for hedge accounting. These decreases were partially offset by a monetary correction on the adjustment to the regulatory liability related to the asset base at Eletropaulo as a result of a ruling by the regulator in December 2013. Interest expense increase d $ 14 million , or 1% , to $1.5 billion in 2012 from 2011 . This increase was primarily due to debt at DPL, acquired in November 2011, additional indebtedness at the Parent Company to finance the acquisition of DPL, and less interest capitalization due to the commencement of operations at various projects. The increase was partially offset by a reduction in interest expense in Brazil, due to lower short-term interest rates, lower debt principal and favorable foreign currency translation, as well as lower interest expense for Cartagena, which was deconsolidated following the sale of 80% of our interest in the first quarter of 2012 and higher capitalized interest at Gener in 2012. Interest income Interest income decrease d $73 million , or 21% , to $275 million in 2013 from 2012 . The decrease was primarily in Brazil, due to lower interest-bearing assets, lower investment balances, unfavorable foreign currency translation, and lower interest rates. The decrease was partially offset by interest income related to FONINVEMEM III receivables in Argentina which satisfied the criteria for recognition during 2013. Interest income decrease d $50 million , or 13% , to $348 million in 2012 from 2011 . The decrease was mainly in Brazil, due to a reduction in interest-bearing assets, unfavorable foreign currency translation and lower interest rates, partially offset by inflation adjustments on interest-bearing assets and interest earned on receivables for spot sales in the Dominican Republic. 82 Loss on extinguishment of debt Loss on extinguishment of debt was $229 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 . This loss was primarily related to the loss on the early retirement of recourse debt at the Parent Company and the loss on the early extinguishment of debt at Masinloc. See Note 12. Debt included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K for further information. Loss on extinguishment of debt was $8 million and $62 million for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 . The loss in 2012 was primarily related to early retirement of debt at the Parent Company and at Eletropaulo. The loss in 2011 was primarily related to a $36 million premium paid on early retirement of debt at Gener and $15 million related to the early retirement of senior notes due in 2011 at IPL. Other income and expense See discussion of the components of other income and expense in Note 20 Other Income and Expense included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K for further information. Gain on sale of investments Gain on sale of investments for the year ended December 31, 2013 was $26 million , which is primarily related to the sale of our remaining 20% interest in Cartagena as well as the sale of our 10% equity interest in Trinidad Generation Unlimited. See Note 24. - Acquisitions and Dispositions included in Item 8. - Financial Statements and Supplemental Data of this Form 10-K for further information. Gain on sale of investments for the year ended December 31, 2012 was $219 million , which was primarily related to the sale of 80% of our interest in Cartagena, as well as the sale of certain investments in China. Gain on sale of investments for the year ended December 31, 2011 was $8 million, which was primarily related to the sale of Wuhu, an equity method investment in China. Goodwill impairment The Company recognized goodwill impairment expense of $372 million , $1.8 billion , and $17 million for the years ended December 31, 2013 , 2012, and 2011 . See Note 10 Goodwill Impairment included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K for further information. Asset impairment expense The Company recognized asset impairment expense of $95 million , $73 million and $173 million , respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2013 , 2012 and 2011 . See Note 21 Asset Impairment Expense included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K for further information. Foreign currency transaction gains (losses) Foreign currency transaction gains (losses) were as follows: Years Ended December 31, 2013 2012 2011 (in millions) Chile $ (20 ) $ 9 $ (19 ) Brazil (12 ) (16 ) (12 ) Philippines (10 ) (159 ) 3 AES Corporation 5 5 (4 ) Argentina 2 (5 ) 16 Other 13 (4 ) (16 ) Total (1) $ (22 ) $ (170 ) $ (32 ) ___________________________________________ (1) Includes gains (losses) of $60 million, $(160) million and $44 million on foreign currency derivative contracts for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. 83 The Company recognized net foreign currency transaction losses of $22 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 primarily due to: losses of $20 million in Chile were primarily due to a 9% weakening of the Chilean Peso, resulting in losses at Gener (a U.S. Dollar functional currency subsidiary) associated with net working capital denominated in Chilean Pesos, mainly cash, accounts receivables and tax receivables, partially offset by gains related to foreign currency derivatives. losses of $12 million in Brazil were primarily due to a 15% weakening of the Brazilian Real resulting in losses mainly associated with U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities; and losses of $10 million in the Philippines (a U.S. Dollar functional currency subsidiary beginning in 2013) were primarily due to the 8% weakening of the Philippine Peso, resulting in revaluation of cash accounts, customer receivables and deferred tax asset; partially offset by Gains of $8 million at The AES Corporation were primarily due to increases in the valuation of intercompany notes receivable denominated in foreign currencies, resulting from the strengthening of the Euro and British Pound during the year, partially offset by losses related to foreign currency option purchases. The Company recognized foreign currency transaction losses of $170 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 primarily due to: losses of $159 million in the Philippines were primarily due to unrealized foreign exchange losses on embedded derivatives as a result of the forecasted strengthening of the Philippine Peso, partially offset by gains from the 7% appreciation of the Philippine Peso on U.S. Dollar denominated debt at Masinloc, which had been a Philippine Peso functional currency subsidiary; and losses of $16 million in Brazil were primarily due to a 9% devaluation of the Brazilian Real resulting in losses mainly associated with U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities; partially offset by gains of $10 million at The AES Corporation were primarily due to increases in the valuation of intercompany notes receivable denominated in foreign currencies, resulting from the strengthening of the Euro and British Pound during the year, partially offset by losses related to foreign currency option purchases. The Company recognized foreign currency transaction losses of $32 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 primarily due to: losses of $19 million in Chile were primarily due to an 11% devaluation of the Chilean Peso, resulting in losses at Gener (a U.S. Dollar functional currency subsidiary) associated with net working capital denominated in Chilean Pesos, mainly cash, accounts receivable, tax receivables and a $5 million loss on foreign currency derivatives; and losses of $12 million in Brazil were primarily due to a 13% devaluation of the Brazilian Real resulting in losses mainly associated with U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities; and losses of $8 million at The AES Corporation were primarily due to decreases in the valuation of intercompany notes receivable denominated in foreign currencies, resulting from the weakening of the Euro and British Pound during the year, partially offset by gains related to foreign currency option purchases; partially offset by gains of $16 million in Argentina were primarily due to an unrealized gain on a foreign currency embedded derivative related to government receivables, partially offset by losses due to the 8% devaluation of the Argentine Peso, resulting in losses at AES Argentina (an Argentine Peso functional currency subsidiary) associated with its U.S. Dollar denominated debt. Other non-operating expense Total other non-operating expense was $129 million , $50 million and $82 million for the years ended December 31, 2013 , 2012 and 2011 . See Note 9 Other Non-Operating Expense included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K for further information. Income tax expense Income tax expense decrease d $342 million , or 50% , to $343 million in 2013. The Company effective tax rates were 33% and 298% for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 , respectively. 84 The net decrease in the 2013 effective tax rate was principally due to a 2012 nondeductible impairment of goodwill at our U.S. utility, DPL, and in part to net favorable resolution of various uncertain tax positions in 2013. See Note 10 - Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets for additional information regarding goodwill impairment and Note 22 - Income Taxes included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K for additional information regarding uncertain tax positions. Income tax expense increase d $29 million , or 4% , to $685 million in 2012. The Company effective tax rates were 298% and 29% for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 , respectively. The net increase in the 2012 effective tax rate was principally due to a nondeductible impairment of goodwill at our U.S. utility, DPL. See Note 10 - Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K for additional information regarding goodwill impairment. Our effective tax rate reflects the tax effect of significant operations outside the United States, which are generally taxed at rates lower than the U.S. statutory rate of 35 percent. A future proportionate change in the composition of income before income taxes from foreign and domestic tax jurisdictions could impact our periodic effective tax rate. We recognized tax expense of $343 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, while our cash payments for income taxes, net of refunds, totaled $570 million. The difference resulted primarily from income tax benefit on current year U.S. losses and from the loss associated with the regulatory liability for customer refunds recognized at Eletropaulo which is not currently deductible for local tax purposes. The Company also benefits from reduced tax rates in certain countries as a result of satisfying specific commitments regarding employment and capital investment. One such benefit related to our operations in the Philippines will expire in the 4th quarter of 2014. Accordingly, the Company effective tax rate and cash tax payments may increase in future periods. See Note 22 - Income Taxes for additional information regarding these reduced rates. Net equity in earnings of affiliates Net equity in earnings of affiliates decrease d $10 million , or 29% , to $25 million in 2013 from $35 million in 2012. The decrease was primarily due to the sale of Yangcheng in China in the third quarter of 2012 as well as higher losses at Entek in Turkey resulting from a loss on an embedded foreign currency derivative, partially offset by increased earnings at Guacolda due to higher energy sales as a result of lower purchase costs. Net equity in earnings of affiliates increase d $37 million to $35 million in 2012 from a net loss of $2 million in 2011 . The increase was primarily related to increased tariff pricing, lower coal prices, and lower depreciation at Yangcheng in China in 2012. Additionally, there were impairment charges at AES Solar in 2011 of which our share was $36 million. This was partially offset by lower net income caused by higher electricity purchase costs at Guacolda. Income from continuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interests Income from continuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interests decrease d $94 million , or 17% , to $446 million in 2013. The decrease was primarily due to lower operating income at Tiete and Panama related to lower hydrology, the recognition of a regulatory liability related to customer refunds at Eletropaulo, and a reduction in income at Cartagena which was deconsolidated in February 2012 as a result of the sale of 80% of our interest. The loss from continuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interests decrease d $556 million , or 51% , from $1,096 to $540 million in 2012. This was primarily due to decreased operating margin at Eletropaulo as a result of the tariff reset and higher fixed costs. Discontinued operations Total discontinued operations was a net loss of $179 million , a net income of $63 million , and a net loss of $72 million for the years ended December 31, 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , respectively. See Note 23 Discontinued Operations and Held-for-Sale Businesses included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K for further information. 85 Net Income attributable to The AES Corporation Net income attributable to The AES Corporation increase d $1.0 billion to $114 million in 2013 compared to a net loss of $912 million in 2012 . The key drivers of the increase included: lower goodwill impairment expense; lower income tax expense; lower foreign currency losses; lower interest expense, primarily at the Parent Company, due to a reduction in debt principal as well as the prior year prepayment of an interest rate cash flow hedge that resulted in a reclassification of deferred losses from other comprehensive income to earnings; and lower general and administrative expense. These increase s were partially offset by: lower operating margin as described above; the loss on the early extinguishment of debt at the Parent Company and at Masinloc; lower gain on sale of investments recorded in 2013 on the sale of our remaining 20% interest in Cartagena as well as our 10% equity interest in Trinidad compared to the prior year gain recorded from the sale of 80% of our interest in Cartagena in the first quarter of 2012; an increase in losses from the disposal and impairment of the discontinued businesses; other non-operating expense associated with an impairment at our equity method investment at Elsta in the Netherlands. Net loss attributable to The AES Corporation was $912 million in 2012, which is a decrease of $1 billion compared to net income of $58 million in 2011. The key driver of the decrease was the goodwill impairment at DPL of $1.82 billion as described in Note 10 Goodwill Impairment and Other Intangible Assets included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K. Excluding the goodwill impairment at DPL, the Company would have reported net income attributable to AES of $905 million, which is an improvement of $847 million compared to 2011. The key drivers of this increase were: the favorable impact of operating margin earned by new businesses, mainly our wholly-owned subsidiaries: DPL, Maritza, and Changuinola, higher demand at Masinloc, a 92% owned subsidiary, partially offset by a reduced operating margin at Eletropaulo, in which we hold only a 16% economic interest and a lower operating margin earned by our generation businesses in Chile and Argentina; the gains related to the sale in 2012 of 80% of our interest in Cartagena and the sale of our investments in China, as well as the loss recorded in 2011 on the sale of our Argentina distribution businesses; a decrease in losses from the operation of discontinued businesses, primarily related to Eastern Energy in New York, which was deconsolidated in December 2011; the decrease in asset impairments related to Wind projects and Kelanitissa; lower general and administrative expenses in 2012 compared to 2011; and the 2011 premium paid on the early retirement of debt in Chile and at IPL. These increases were partially offset by: higher foreign currency transaction losses in 2012 compared to 2011; and an increase in interest expense primarily due to debt at DPL, which was acquired in November 2011, and additional debt at the Parent Company to finance the acquisition of DPL. Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities Consists of the operating cash flow of all consolidated subsidiaries, including noncontrolling interests. 86 The net decrease in cash flows from operating activities of $186 million , or 6% to $2.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to the year ended December 31, 2012 was primarily the result of the following: US an increase of $74 million primarily due to a bankruptcy settlement payment to the New York entities in 2012 and the proceeds from the PPA termination at Beaver Valley in January 2013; Andes a decrease of $276 million primarily driven by higher working capital requirements; Brazil a decrease of $106 million primarily related to lower collections and higher energy purchases at Sul, partially offset by the recovery of deferred costs from regulator, lower transmission costs and regulatory charges at Eletropaulo; MCAC an increase of $185 million primarily driven by a $90 million payment related to an amendment to a fuel contract and lower working capital requirements; Asia a decrease of $85 million primarily driven by higher working capital requirements and lower operating results at Masinloc. The net decrease in cash flows from operating activities of $17 million , or 1% to $2.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to the year ended December 31, 2011 was primarily the result of the following: US an increase of $320 million at our utility businesses primarily due to the operations, net of debt service costs, of DPL which was acquired in November 2011; Andes an increase of $57 million driven by cash provided by the operating activities of the new plant at Angamos, recovery of value added tax at Campiche and reduced working capital requirements at Gener, partially offset by reduced operating margin from Gener operations other than Angamos; Brazil a decrease of $503 million at our utility businesses primarily driven by higher priced energy purchases, regulatory charges and transmission costs payments, higher operating and maintenance expenses and lower accounts receivable collections due to the lower tariff starting in July 2012 at Eletropaulo, partially offset by a lower payment of income taxes; MCAC an increase of $25 million at our generation businesses primarily due to the operations of the Esti plant being back on line from June 2012 and higher volumes of PPA sales at Panama and lower coal volume and price in 2012 at Itabo, partially offset by lower collections and lower sales in the Dominican Republic and higher taxes paid at Panama; EMEA an increase of $42 million driven primarily by cash provided by the operating activities of the new plant at Maritza partially offset by a loss in revenue from a generator failure at Ballylumford in Northern Ireland; and Asia an increase of $88 million driven primarily by Masinloc in the Philippines due to higher demand and reduced working capital requirements. Non-GAAP Measures Adjusted Operating Margin, adjusted pre-tax contribution ( Adjusted PTC ) and adjusted earnings per share ( Adjusted EPS ) are non-GAAP supplemental measures that are used by management and external users of our consolidated financial statements such as investors, industry analysts and lenders. Adjusted Operating Margin Operating margin is defined as revenue less cost of sales. Cost of sales includes costs incurred directly by the businesses in the ordinary course of business, such as: Electricity and fuel purchases Operations and maintenance costs, Depreciation and amortization expense, Bad debt expense and recoveries, General administrative and support costs at the businesses, and Gains or losses on derivatives associated with the purchase of electricity or fuel. 87 We define Adjusted Operating Margin as operating margin, adjusted for the impact of noncontrolling interests, excluding unrealized gains or losses related to derivative transactions. The GAAP measure most comparable to Adjusted Operating Margin is operating margin. We believe that Adjusted Operating Margin better reflects the underlying business performance of the Company. Factors in this determination include the impact of noncontrolling interests, where AES consolidates the results of a subsidiary that is not wholly-owned by the Company, as well as the variability due to unrealized derivatives gains or losses. Adjusted Operating Margin should not be construed as an alternative to operating margin, which is determined in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted Pre-Tax Contribution and Adjusted Earnings Per Share We define adjusted pre-tax contribution ("Adjusted PTC") as pre-tax income from continuing operations attributable to AES excluding gains or losses of the consolidated entity due to (a) unrealized gains or losses related to derivative transactions, (b) unrealized foreign currency gains or losses, (c) gains or losses due to dispositions and acquisitions of business interests, (d) losses due to impairments, and (e) costs due to the early retirement of debt. Adjusted PTC also includes net equity in earnings of affiliates on an after-tax basis. Adjusted pre-tax contribution reflects the impact of noncontrolling interests and excludes the items specified in the definition above. In addition to the revenue and cost of sales reflected in operating margin, adjusted pre-tax contribution includes the other components of our income statement, such as: General and administrative expense in the corporate segment, as well as business development costs; Interest expense and interest income; Other expense and other income; Realized foreign currency transaction gains and losses; and Net equity in earnings of affiliates. We define Adjusted EPS as diluted earnings per share from continuing operations excluding gains or losses of the consolidated entity due to (a) unrealized gains or losses related to derivative transactions, (b) unrealized foreign currency gains or losses, (c) gains or losses due to dispositions and acquisitions of business interests, (d) losses due to impairments, and (e) costs due to the early retirement of debt. The GAAP measure most comparable to Adjusted PTC is income from continuing operations attributable to AES. The GAAP measure most comparable to Adjusted EPS is diluted earnings per share from continuing operations. We believe that Adjusted PTC and Adjusted EPS better reflect the underlying business performance of the Company and are considered in the Company internal evaluation of financial performance. Factors in this determination include the variability due to unrealized gains or losses related to derivative transactions, unrealized foreign currency gains or losses, losses due to impairments and strategic decisions to dispose of or acquire business interests or retire debt, which affect results in a given period or periods. In addition, for Adjusted PTC, earnings before tax represents the business performance of the Company before the application of statutory income tax rates and tax adjustments, including the effects of tax planning, corresponding to the various jurisdictions in which the Company operates. Adjusted PTC and Adjusted EPS should not be construed as alternatives to income from continuing operations attributable to AES and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, which are determined in accordance with GAAP. For the year ended December 31, 2013 , the Company changed the definition of Adjusted PTC and Adjusted EPS to exclude the gains or losses attributable to AES common stockholders at our equity method investments for these same types of items. Previously, these amounts were not excluded from the calculation of Adjusted EPS and Adjusted PTC because the Company did not have a controlled process for obtaining this information from our equity method investments. Accordingly, the Company has also reflected the change in the comparative years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011. 88 Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Measures Adjusted Operating Margin Reconciliation of Adjusted Operating Margin to Operating Margin Years Ended December 31, 2013 2012 2011 Adjusted Operating Margin ($'s in millions) US $ 684 $ 707 $ 406 Andes 402 431 564 Brazil 271 356 489 MCAC 472 489 419 EMEA 392 447 351 Asia 159 204 153 Corp/Other (16 ) (12 ) 2 Intersegment Eliminations 64 35 26 Total Adjusted Operating Margin 2,428 2,657 2,410 Noncontrolling Interests Adjustment 833 908 1,643 Derivatives Adjustment (14 ) 18 (13 ) Operating Margin 3,247 3,583 4,040 Adjusted Pre-Tax Contribution : For a reconciliation of Adjusted PTC to net income from continuing operations, see Note 17 Segment and Geographic Information included in Item 8.

The Company reported a loss from continuing operations of $1.27 per share in 2012. For purposes of measuring diluted loss per share under GAAP, common stock equivalents were excluded from weighted-average shares as their inclusion would be anti-dilutive. However, for purposes of computing Adjusted EPS, the Company has included the impact of dilutive common stock equivalents as the inclusion of the defined adjustments result in income for Adjusted EPS. The table below reconciles the weighted-average shares used in GAAP diluted earnings per share to the weighted-average shares used in calculating the non-GAAP measure of Adjusted EPS.

This performance was driven primarily by the following businesses and key operating drivers: US Generation decreased $26 million, driven by a $24 million decline from the short-term restart of two Huntington Beach units at Southland in 2012, and higher outages at Hawaii of $24 million, partially offset by higher contributions from the US Wind portfolio of $32 million. 90 IPL declined $23 million, as a result of $13 million in higher maintenance costs driven by the timing and duration of major generating unit overhauls, and higher depreciation expense of $6 million due to additional utility plant assets placed in service. These decreases were partially offset by: DPL increased $6 million, as lower amortization expense of $81 million offset: A $30 million decrease in sales margin, as customer switching drove retail price decreases partially offset by higher wholesale volumes; Lower PJM capacity margins of $12 million; and $19 million from unrealized gains on derivatives in 2012, which did not recur in 2013. Adjusted Operating Margin declined $23 million for the US SBU due to the drivers above, excluding the impact of unrealized derivative gains and losses. AES owns 100% of its businesses in the US, so there is no adjustment for noncontrolling interests. Adjusted PTC increased $37 million driven by net gains of $53 million recognized as a result of the early termination of the PPA and coal supply contract at Beaver Valley, partially offset by the decrease of $23 million in Adjusted Operating Margin described above. Fiscal year 2012 versus 2011 Operating margin increase d by $316 million , or 80% . This performance was driven primarily by the following businesses and key operating drivers: DPL increased $249 million from the first full year of operations, as the acquisition was completed in November 2011. IPL increased $15 million, due to $21 million in lower repairs and maintenance costs, as a result of fewer generating unit outages, partially offset by higher pension expenses of $5 million. US Generation increased $53 million, as a result of a $21 million increase from the short-term restart of two Huntington Beach generating units at Southland and fewer outages at Hawaii of $19 million. Adjusted Operating Margin increased $301 million due to the drivers above, excluding the impact of unrealized derivative gains and losses. Adjusted PTC increased $222 million driven by the increase of $301 million in Adjusted Operating Margin described above, partially offset by higher interest expense from the first full year of operations at DPL. Andes SBU The following table summarizes Operating Margin, Adjusted Operating Margin and Adjusted PTC for our Andes SBU for the periods indicated: For the Years Ended December 31, 2013 2012 2011 $ Change 2013 vs. 2012 $ Change 2012 vs. 211 % Change 2013 vs. 2012 % Change 2012 vs. 2011 ($ in millions) Operating Margin $ 533 $ 580 $ 743 $ (47 ) $ (163 ) -8 % -22 % Noncontrolling Interests Adjustment $ (131 ) (149 ) (179 ) Derivatives Adjustment Adjusted Operating Margin $ 402 $ 431 $ 564 $ (29 ) $ (133 ) -7 % -24 % Adjusted PTC $ 353 $ 369 $ 510 $ (16 ) $ (141 ) -4 % -28 % Fiscal year 2013 versus 2012 Including the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation and remeasurement of $18 million , operating margin decrease d $47 million , or 8% . This performance was driven primarily by the following businesses and key operating drivers: Chivor (Colombia) decreased $42 million, as dry hydrological conditions reduced generation output and spot volumes but increased spot prices in the market. Lower volumes had an unfavorable impact of $115 million, partially offset by the favorable impact of $84 million from higher prices. 91 Gener (Chile) declined $8 million, as a reduction of $30 million from lower contract prices and higher spot purchases was partially offset by higher generation of $24 million, as the commencement of operations at Ventanas IV in March 2013 was offset by lower gas availability and lower coal generation. These decreases were partially offset by: AES Argentina increased $4 million, as lower outages of $18 million and higher volumes of $15 million were partially offset by lower rates of $8 million from the implementation of Resolution 95 and unfavorable exchange rates of $9 million. Adjusted Operating Margin declined $29 million for the year due to the drivers above, adjusted for the impact of noncontrolling interests. AES owns 71% of Gener and Chivor and 100% of AES Argentina. Adjusted PTC decreased $16 million , driven by the decrease of $29 million in Adjusted Operating Margin described above, partially offset by higher interest income from the beginning of the accrual of interest on the FONINVEMEM III receivables in Argentina. Fiscal year 2012 versus 2011 Including the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation and remeasurement of $4 million , operating margin for 2012 decrease d $163 million , or 22% . This performance was driven primarily by the following businesses and key operating drivers: Gener decreased $122 million, driven by a decrease of $108 million from higher costs to supply energy contracts and lower spot sales from Termoandes in Argentina to Chile. AES Argentina declined $61 million, as a result of lower prices of $28 million and higher fixed costs of $25 million. These decreases were partially offset by: Chivor increased $26 million, due to a non-recurring equity tax of $11 million recognized in 2011 and a favorable impact of $9 million from higher spot prices. Adjusted Operating Margin declined $133 million due to the drivers above, excluding the impact of unrealized derivative losses. AES owns 71% of Gener and Chivor and 100% of AES Argentina. Adjusted PTC decreased $141 million driven by the decrease of $133 million in Adjusted Operating Margin described above and a decrease in equity earnings from Guacolda of $12 million.

This performance was driven primarily by the following businesses and key operating drivers: Panama decreased $75 million, driven by dry hydrological conditions, which resulted in lower generation and higher energy purchases at higher prices of $88 million, partially offset by favorable net settlements related to the Esti tunnel of $22 million. 93 This decrease was partially offset by: Dominican Republic increased $42 million, as a result of higher net energy transactions of $28 million, higher gas sales to third parties of $20 million, partially offset by $6 million due to other factors such as higher fixed costs. El Salvador increased $17 million, due to the tariff increase approved by the regulator at the beginning of 2013. Adjusted Operating Margin decreased $17 million due to the drivers above, adjusted for the impact of noncontrolling interests and excluding unrealized gains and losses on derivatives. AES owns 89.8% of Changuinola and 49% of its other generation facilities in Panama, 100% of Andres and Los Mina and 50% of Itabo in the Dominican Republic and a weighted average of 75% of its businesses in El Salvador. Adjusted PTC decreased $48 million , driven by the decrease in Adjusted Operating Margin of $17 million described above and lower interest income in the Dominican Republic and the receipt of property damage insurance proceeds in 2012 related to the Esti tunnel in Panama. Fiscal year 2012 versus 2011 Including the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $2 million , operating margin increase d $48 million , or 9% . This performance was driven primarily by the following businesses and key operating drivers: Panama, which increased $30 million, primarily driven by higher generation of $50 million from the re-start of operations at the Esti plant and the first full year of operations at Changuinola, which commenced operations in September 2011, partially offset by lower spot prices of $21 million; Dominican Republic, which increased $10 million, primarily as a result of favorable prices of $35 million, primarily higher spot and LNG prices, as well as lower coal costs, partially offset by lower availability of $19 million. Mexico, which increased by $12 million, driven by fewer outages at TEG and TEP of $8 million and higher volumes at Merida of $7 million. Adjusted Operating Margin increased $70 million due to the drivers above adjusted for the impact of noncontrolling interests and excluding unrealized gains and losses on derivatives. AES owned 100% of Changuinola, 49% of its other generation facilities in Panama, 100% of Andres and Los Mina and 50% of Itabo in the Dominican Republic, and 100% of TEG and TEP and 65% of Merida in Mexico. Adjusted PTC increased $80 million , driven by the increase in Adjusted Operating Margin of $70 million described above, realized foreign currency transaction gains in Mexico and higher equity in earnings from Trinidad. These favorable trends were partially offset by a one-time reimbursement of tax expense in the Dominican Republic in 2011.

Asia SBU Asia Generation The following table summarizes Operating Margin, Adjusted Operating Margin and Adjusted PTC for our Generation businesses in Asia for the periods indicated: For the Years Ended December 31, 2013 2012 2011 $ Change 2013 vs. 2012 $ Change 2012 vs. 2011 % Change 2013 vs. 2012 % Change 2012 vs. 2011 ($ in millions) Operating Margin $ 169 $ 236 $ 167 $ (67 ) $ 69 -28 % 41 % Noncontrolling Interests Adjustment (10 ) (17 ) (12 ) Derivatives Adjustment (15 ) (2 ) Adjusted Operating Margin $ 159 $ 204 $ 153 $ (45 ) $ 51 -22 % 33 % Adjusted PTC $ 142 $ 201 $ 100 $ (59 ) $ 101 -29 % 101 % 95 Fiscal year 2013 versus 2012 Operating margin decreased $67 million, or 28%. This performance was driven primarily by the following business and key operating drivers: Masinloc (Philippines) decreased $62 million, due to: The net impact of higher contracted volumes at lower prices, as a result of a new 7-year contract to reduce spot exposure, with an unfavorable impact of $31 million; A reversal of a contingency of $16 million in 2012; and An unrealized derivative gain of $15 million in 2012. Adjusted Operating Margin decreased $45 million due to the drivers above adjusted for the impact of non-controlling interests and excluding unrealized gains on derivatives. AES owns 92% of Masinloc. Adjusted PTC decreased $59 million , driven by the decrease of $45 million in Adjusted Operating Margin described above, as well as a reduction in equity earnings from the sale of our businesses in China in 2012, partially offset by lower interest expense at Masinloc. Fiscal year 2012 versus 2011 Including the favorable impact of foreign currency translation of $6 million , operating margin increase d $69 million , or 41% . This performance was driven primarily by the following business and key operating drivers: Masinloc increased by $73 million, due to higher market demand partially offset by lower rates of $36 million, a reversal of a contingency of $16 million, and a higher unrealized derivative gain of $13 million. Adjusted Operating Margin increased $51 million due to the drivers discussed above adjusted for the impact of noncontrolling interests and excluding unrealized gains on derivatives. AES owns 92% of Masinloc. Adjusted PTC increased $101 million , driven primarily by the increase of $51 million in Adjusted Operating Margin described above, as well as higher net equity in earnings from businesses in China, and lower business development costs. Key Trends and Uncertainties During 2014 and beyond, we expect to face the following challenges at certain of our businesses. Management expects that improved operating performance at certain businesses, growth from new businesses and global cost reduction initiatives may lessen or offset their impact. If these favorable effects do not occur, or if the challenges described below and elsewhere in this section impact us more significantly than we currently anticipate, or if volatile foreign currencies and commodities move more unfavorably, then these adverse factors (or other adverse factors unknown to us) may impact our operating margin, net income attributable to The AES Corporation and cash flows. We continue to monitor our operations and address challenges as they arise. For the risk factors related to our business, see Item 1. Business and Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Form 10-K. Operational Sensitivity to Dry Hydrological Conditions Our hydroelectric generation facilities are sensitive to changes in the weather, particularly the level of water inflows into generation facilities. In 2013, Brazil, Panama, Colombia and Chile experienced lower than expected rainfall, while Chile also recorded lower snowpack relative to historical levels. Low rainfall and water inflows caused reservoir levels to be below historical levels, reduced generation output, and increased prices for electricity. Through February 2014, hydrological conditions in Brazil, Panama, Chile and Colombia continue to be below historical averages. If our hydroelectric generation facilities cannot generate sufficient energy to meet contractual arrangements, we may need to purchase energy to fulfill our obligations, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. We expect hydrological volatility to continue for the remainder of 2014. In Brazil, the system operator controls all hydroelectric generation dispatch and reservoir levels and manages an Energy Reallocation Mechanism to share hydrological risk across all generators. The Energy Reallocation Mechanism helps to manage our exposure to spot market prices in below-average hydrology scenarios. We expect the system operator in Brazil to pursue a more conservative reservoir management strategy going forward, including the dispatch of 12 to 15 GW of thermal generation capacity, which could result in electricity prices higher than historical levels. 96 Macroeconomic and Political During the past few years, economic conditions in some countries where our subsidiaries conduct business have deteriorated. Global economic conditions remain volatile and could have an adverse impact on our businesses in the event these recent trends continue. Argentina In Argentina, economic conditions are deteriorating, as measured by indicators such as non-receding inflation, increased government deficits, diminished sovereign reserves, lack of foreign currency accessibility, the potential for continued devaluation of the local currency, and a decline in expectations for economic growth. Many of these economic conditions in conjunction with the restrictions to freely access the foreign exchange currency established by the Argentine Government since 2012, have contributed to the development of a limited parallel unofficial foreign exchange market that is less favorable than the official exchange. At December 31, 2013 , all transactions at our businesses in Argentina were translated using the official exchange rate published by the Argentine Central Bank. See Note 7 Long-Term Financing Receivables in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K for further information on the long-term receivables. In January 2014, the Argentine Peso devalued by approximately 20%, the most rapid depreciation since 2002. Further weakening of the Argentine Peso and local economic activity could cause significant volatility in our results of operations, cash flows, the ability to pay dividends to the Parent Company, and the value of our assets. Bulgaria Our investments in Bulgaria rely on offtaker contracts with NEK, the state-owned electricity public supplier and energy trading company. Maritza, a coal-fired generation facility, has experienced ongoing delays in the collection of outstanding receivables from its offtaker. In November 2013, Maritza and NEK signed a rescheduling agreement for the overdue receivables as of the agreement date. Under the terms of the agreement, NEK paid $70 million of the overdue receivables and agreed to pay the remaining receivables in 13 equal monthly installments beginning December 2013. NEK has made payments according to the schedule through January 2014. As of December 31, 2013 , Maritza had an outstanding receivables of $151 million representing $21 million of current receivables, $60 million of the rescheduled receivables not yet due and $70 million of receivables overdue by less than 90 days. Although Maritza continued to collect overdue receivables during the fourth quarter of 2013, there can be no assurance that the business will continue making collections, which could result in a write-off of the remaining receivables. In addition, depending on NEK ability to honor its obligations and other factors, the value of other assets could also be impaired, or the business may be in another default of its loan covenants. The Company has long-lived assets in Bulgaria of $1.7 billion and net equity of $639 million. See Note 12 Debt included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K for further information on current existing debt defaults. Further, Maritza is in litigation related to construction delays and related matters. For further information on the litigation see Item 3. Legal Proceedings . Furthermore, as noted in Item 1. Business Bulgaria , during the fourth quarter of 2013, NEK requested a consent from Maritza for a restructuring. In February 2014, the NEK restructuring was implemented after approval by the regulatory authorities. Maritza and its lenders are analyzing the NEK restructuring and its impact on NEK financial condition and liquidity. If Maritza and its lenders do not consent and if NEK credit rating falls below the rating NEK had upon the issuance of the Government Support Letter in 2005, NEK will have defaulted under the PPA, which will trigger an event of default under the project debt agreements. For further information on the importance of long-term contracts and our counterparty credit risk, see Item 1A. Risk Factors We may not be able to enter into long-term contracts, which reduce volatility in our results of operations. As a result of any of the foregoing events, we may face a loss of earnings and/or cash flows from the affected businesses (or be unable to exercise remedies for a breach of the PPA) and may have to provide loans or equity to support affected businesses or projects, restructure them, write down their value and/or face the possibility that these projects cannot continue operations or provide returns consistent with our expectations, any of which could have a material impact on the Company. If global economic conditions deteriorate further, it could also affect the prices we receive for the electricity we generate or transmit. Utility regulators or parties to our generation contracts may seek to lower our prices based on prevailing market conditions pursuant to PPAs, concession agreements or other contracts as they come up for renewal or reset. In addition, rising fuel and other costs coupled with contractual price or tariff decreases could restrict our ability to operate profitably in a given market. Each of these factors, as well as those discussed above, could result in a decline in the value of our assets including those at the businesses we operate, our equity investments and projects under development and could result in asset impairments that could be material to our operations. We continue to monitor our projects and businesses. 97 Impairments Goodwill In the fourth quarter of 2013 , the Company completed its annual October 1 goodwill impairment tests and recognized goodwill impairment expense of $314 million . The Company also identified three reporting units, DP&L, DPLER and Buffalo Gap, which were considered at risk. A reporting unit is considered at risk when its fair value is not higher than its carrying amount by more than 10%. The Company monitors its reporting units at risk of step 1 failure on an ongoing basis. During the nine months ended September 30, 2013, such evaluations continued at Ebute, considered at risk as of December 31, 2012, and culminated in the recognition of goodwill impairment expense of $58 million in the third quarter of 2013. Since 2012, the DP&L reporting unit remains at risk subsequent to its goodwill impairment of $1.82 billion recognized in 2012 and $307 million in the fourth quarter of 2013. During the nine months ended September 30, 2013, the Company continued to monitor the business environment and regulatory developments. In the fourth quarter of 2013, DP&L recognized goodwill impairment expense of $307 million as part of its annual goodwill impairment test. Buffalo Gap failed Step 1 of the annual goodwill impairment test, but no goodwill impairment was recognized. It is possible that the Company may incur goodwill impairment at DP&L, DPLER, Buffalo Gap or any of other reporting unit in future periods if adverse changes in their business or operating environments occur. As of December 31, 2013, DP&L, DPLER and Buffalo Gap had goodwill of $316 million , $136 million and $28 million, respectively. See Note 10 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K for further information. Capital Resources and Liquidity Overview As of December 31, 2013 , the Company had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $1.6 billion , of which approximately $132 million was held at the Parent Company and qualified holding companies, and approximately $668 million was held in short term investments primarily at subsidiaries. In addition, we had restricted cash and debt service reserves of $1.1 billion . The Company also had non-recourse and recourse aggregate principal amounts of debt outstanding of $15.4 billion and $5.7 billion , respectively. Of the approximately $2.1 billion of our current non-recourse debt, $1.0 billion was presented as such because it is due in the next twelve months and $1.1 billion relates to debt considered in default due to covenant violations. We expect such current maturities will be repaid from net cash provided by operating activities of the subsidiary to which the debt relates or through opportunistic refinancing activity or some combination thereof. Approximately $118 million of our recourse debt matures within the next twelve months, which we expect to repay using a combination of cash on hand at the Parent Company, net cash provided by operating activities and/or net proceeds from the issuance of new debt at the Parent Company. We rely mainly on long-term debt obligations to fund our construction activities. We have, to the extent available at acceptable terms, utilized non-recourse debt to fund a significant portion of the capital expenditures and investments required to construct and acquire our electric power plants, distribution companies and related assets. Our non-recourse financing is designed to limit cross default risk to the Parent Company or other subsidiaries and affiliates. Our non-recourse long-term debt is a combination of fixed and variable interest rate instruments. Generally, a portion or all of the variable rate debt is fixed through the use of interest rate swaps. In addition, the debt is typically denominated in the currency that matches the currency of the revenue expected to be generated from the benefiting project, thereby reducing currency risk. In certain cases, the currency is matched through the use of derivative instruments. The majority of our non-recourse debt is funded by international commercial banks, with debt capacity supplemented by multilaterals and local regional banks. Given our long-term debt obligations, the Company is subject to interest rate risk on debt balances that accrue interest at variable rates. When possible, the Company will borrow funds at fixed interest rates or hedge its variable rate debt to fix its interest costs on such obligations. In addition, the Company has historically tried to maintain at least 70% of its consolidated long-term obligations at fixed interest rates, including fixing the interest rate through the use of interest rate swaps. These efforts apply to the notional amount of the swaps compared to the amount of related underlying debt. Presently, the Parent Company only material un-hedged exposure to variable interest rate debt relates to indebtedness under its senior secured credit facility. On a consolidated basis, of the Company $15.4 billion of total non-recourse debt outstanding as of December 31, 2013 , approximately $3.8 billion bore interest at variable rates that were not subject to a derivative instrument which fixed the interest rate. In addition to utilizing non-recourse debt at a subsidiary level when available, the Parent Company provides a portion, or in certain instances all, of the remaining long-term financing or credit required to fund development, construction or acquisition of a particular project. These investments have generally taken the form of equity investments or intercompany loans, which are subordinated to the project non-recourse loans. We generally obtain the funds for these investments from our cash flows from operations, proceeds from the sales of assets and/or the proceeds from our issuances of debt, common stock and other securities. Similarly, in certain of our businesses, the Parent Company may provide financial guarantees or other credit support 98 for the benefit of counterparties who have entered into contracts for the purchase or sale of electricity, equipment or other services with our subsidiaries or lenders. In such circumstances, if a business defaults on its payment or supply obligation, the Parent Company will be responsible for the business obligations up to the amount provided for in the relevant guarantee or other credit support. At December 31, 2013 , the Parent Company had provided outstanding financial and performance-related guarantees or other credit support commitments to or for the benefit of our businesses, which were limited by the terms of the agreements, of approximately $661 million in aggregate (excluding those collateralized by letters of credit and other obligations discussed below). As a result of the Parent Company below investment grade rating, counterparties may be unwilling to accept our general unsecured commitments to provide credit support. Accordingly, with respect to both new and existing commitments, the Parent Company may be required to provide some other form of assurance, such as a letter of credit, to backstop or replace our credit support. The Parent Company may not be able to provide adequate assurances to such counterparties. To the extent we are required and able to provide letters of credit or other collateral to such counterparties, this will reduce the amount of credit available to us to meet our other liquidity needs. At December 31, 2013 , we had $1 million in letters of credit outstanding, provided under our senior secured credit facility, and $163 million in cash collateralized letters of credit outstanding outside of our senior secured credit facility. These letters of credit operate to guarantee performance relating to certain project development activities and business operations. During the year ended December 31, 2013 , the Company paid letter of credit fees ranging from 0.2% to 3.25% per annum on the outstanding amounts. We expect to continue to seek, where possible, non-recourse debt financing in connection with the assets or businesses that we or our affiliates may develop, construct or acquire. However, depending on local and global market conditions and the unique characteristics of individual businesses, non-recourse debt may not be available on economically attractive terms or at all. If we decide not to provide any additional funding or credit support to a subsidiary project that is under construction or has near-term debt payment obligations and that subsidiary is unable to obtain additional non-recourse debt, such subsidiary may become insolvent, and we may lose our investment in that subsidiary. Additionally, if any of our subsidiaries lose a significant customer, the subsidiary may need to withdraw from a project or restructure the non-recourse debt financing. If we or the subsidiary choose not to proceed with a project or are unable to successfully complete a restructuring of the non-recourse debt, we may lose our investment in that subsidiary. Many of our subsidiaries depend on timely and continued access to capital markets to manage their liquidity needs. The inability to raise capital on favorable terms, to refinance existing indebtedness or to fund operations and other commitments during times of political or economic uncertainty may have material adverse effects on the financial condition and results of operations of those subsidiaries. In addition, changes in the timing of tariff increases or delays in the regulatory determinations under the relevant concessions could affect the cash flows and results of operations of our businesses. As of December 31, 2013 , the Company had approximately $306 million and $24 million of accounts receivable related to certain of its generation businesses in Argentina and the Dominican Republic and its utility businesses in Brazil classified as Noncurrent assets other and Current assets Accounts receivable , respectively. The noncurrent portion primarily consists of accounts receivable in Argentina that, pursuant to amended agreements or government resolutions, have collection periods that extend beyond December 31, 2014 , or one year from the latest balance sheet date. The majority of Argentinian receivables have been converted into long-term financing for the construction of power plants. See Note 7 Long-Term Financing Receivables included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data and Item 1. Business Regulatory Matters Argentina of this Form 10-K for further information. Consolidated Cash Flows During the year ended December 31, 2013 , cash and cash equivalents decrease d $258 million to $1.6 billion . The decrease in cash and cash equivalents was due to $2.7 billion of cash provided by operating activities, $1.8 billion of cash used in investing activities, $1.1 billion of cash used in financing activities, an unfavorable effect of foreign currency exchange rates on cash of $59 million and a $4 million increase in cash of discontinued and held-for-sale businesses. $ Change 2013 2012 2011 2013 vs. 2012 2012 vs. 2011 (in millions) Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ 2,715 $ 2,901 $ 2,884 $ (186 ) $ 17 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities (1,774 ) (895 ) (4,906 ) (879 ) 4,011 Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities (1,136 ) (1,867 ) 1,412 731 (3,279 ) 99 Operating Activities Operating cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2013 resulted primarily from the net income adjusted for non-cash items, principally depreciation and amortization, gain from sale of investments and impairment expense, partially offset by a net use of cash for operating activities of $76 million in operating assets and liabilities. This was primarily due to the following: a decrease of $725 million in accounts payable and other current liabilities primarily at Eletropaulo and Sul due to lower costs and a decrease in regulatory liabilities and at Uruguaiana primarily related to the extinguishment of a liability as well as lower generation and higher payments to fuel supplier at Kelanitissa; an increase of $103 million in other assets primarily due to an increase in noncurrent regulatory assets at Eletropaulo and Sul, resulting from higher priced energy purchases which are recoverable through future tariffs and an increase at Alicura related to the recognition of interest associated to FONINVEMEM agreement, partially offset by a decrease in noncurrent regulatory assets at IPL related to the annual adjustment to pension benefits based on the actuarial valuation; partially offset by a decrease of $358 million in prepaid expenses and other current assets mainly due to a decrease in current regulatory assets, for the recovery of prior period tariff cycle energy purchases and regulatory charges at Eletropaulo; a decrease of $146 million in accounts receivable primarily related to lower tariffs at Eletropaulo combined with lower tariff and reduced consumption at Sul as well as lower revenue offset by higher collections at Kelanitissa, partially offset by lower collections at Maritza; and an increase of $137 million in other liabilities primarily due to an increase in noncurrent regulatory liabilities at Eletropaulo partially offset by a decrease in pension liability at IPL ; an increase of $95 million in net income tax and other tax payables primarily due to accruals for new current tax liabilities offset by payments of income taxes. Net cash provided by operating activities was $2.9 billion during the year ended December 31, 2012 . Operating cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2012 resulted primarily from net loss adjusted for non-cash items, principally gain and losses on sales and disposals and impairment charges, depreciation and amortization and deferred income taxes, partially offset by a net use of cash for operating activities of $68 million for operating assets and liabilities. This was primarily due to: an increase of $589 million in other assets primarily due to an increase in noncurrent regulatory assets at Eletropaulo, resulting from higher priced energy purchases, regulatory charges and transmission costs which are recoverable through future tariffs and the establishment of a noncurrent note receivable at Cartagena in Spain following the arbitration settlement, prior to its deconsolidation; an increase of $241 million in accounts receivable primarily due to lower collection Eletropaulo and Andres as well as an increase in revenue at Sul and Kelanitissa; a decrease of $47 million in net income tax and other tax payables primarily for the payment of income taxes in excess of the accrual of new tax liabilities; partially offset by an increase of $335 million in other liabilities primarily explained by an increase in noncurrent regulatory liabilities at Eletropaulo related to the tariff reset; an increase of $330 million in accounts payable and other current liabilities primarily at Eletropaulo due to an increase in current regulatory liabilities driven by the tariff reset, offset by a decrease in other current liabilities arising from value-added tax payables; and a decrease of $120 million in prepaid expenses and other current assets mainly due to the recovery of value-added taxes at our construction projects in Chile. Net cash provided by operating activities was $2.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2011 . Operating cash flow resulted primarily from net income adjusted for non-cash items, principally depreciation and amortization, contingencies, deferred income taxes, losses on the extinguishment of debt, gains and losses on sales and disposals and impairment charges as well as a net favorable change of $52 million in operating assets and liabilities. This was primarily due to: an increase of $351 million in other liabilities primarily due to an increase in noncurrent regulatory liabilities at Eletropaulo and Sul as the result of lower prices paid for energy purchases compared with the charges recovered through the tariff; 100 an increase of $322 million in accounts payable and other current liabilities primarily driven by an increase in current regulatory liabilities at Eletropaulo driven by the tariff reset, partially offset by the amount returned to consumers for regulatory liabilities and VAT on commercial losses reversal, as well as an increase in accrued interest on recourse debt at the Parent Company; an increase of $166 million net income tax payables and other tax payables primarily due to accruals for new current tax liabilities offset by payments of income taxes; partially offset by an increase of $403 million in other assets mainly explained by an increase in noncurrent regulatory assets at Eletropaulo, resulting from higher priced energy purchases, transmission costs and regulatory charges compared with charges recovered through the tariff; an increase of $236 million in accounts receivable primarily due to an increase in amounts billed at several businesses including Eletropaulo and new plants at Maritza and Angamos; and an increase of $141 million in inventory primarily driven by higher coal purchases at Gener as well as increased inventory at Angamos as it started operations in 2011. The net decrease in cash flows from operating activities of $186 million , or 6% to $2.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to the year ended December 31, 2012 was primarily the result of the following: US an increase of $74 million primarily due to bankruptcy settlement payment of the New York entities in 2012 and the proceeds from the PPA termination at Beaver Valley in January 2013; Andes a decrease of $276 million primarily driven by higher working capital requirements; Brazil a decrease of $106 million primarily related to lower collections and higher energy purchases at Sul, partially offset by the recovery of deferred costs from regulator, lower transmission costs and regulatory charges at Eletropaulo; MCAC an increase of $185 million primarily driven by a $90 million payment related to an amendment to a fuel contract and lower working capital requirements; Asia a decrease of $85 million primarily driven by higher working capital requirements and lower operating results at Masinloc. The net decrease in cash flows from operating activities of $17 million , or 1% to $2.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to the year ended December 31, 2011 was primarily the result of the following: US an increase of $320 million at our utility businesses primarily due to the operations, net of debt service costs, of DPL which was acquired in November 2011; Andes an increase of $57 million driven by cash provided by the operating activities of the new plant at Angamos, recovery of value added tax at Campiche and reduced working capital requirements at Gener, partially offset by reduced operating margin from Gener operations other than Angamos; Brazil a decrease of $503 million at our utility businesses primarily driven by higher priced energy purchases, regulatory charges and transmission costs payments, higher operating and maintenance expenses and lower accounts receivable collections due to the lower tariff starting in July 2012 at Eletropaulo, partially offset by a lower payment of income taxes; MCAC an increase of $25 million at our generation businesses primarily due to the operations of the Esti plant being back on line from June 2012 and higher volumes of PPA sales at Panama and lower coal volume and prices in 2012 at Itabo, partially offset by lower collections and lower sales in the Dominican Republic and higher taxes paid at Panama; EMEA an increase of $42 million driven primarily by cash provided by the operating activities of the new plant at Maritza partially offset by a loss in revenue from a generator failure at Ballylumford in Northern Ireland; and Asia an increase of $88 million driven primarily by Masinloc in the Philippines due to higher demand and reduced working capital requirements. 101 Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities was $1.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2013 primarily attributable to the following: Capital expenditures of $ 2.0 billion consisting of $1.1 billion of growth capital expenditures and $934 million of maintenance and environmental capital expenditures. Growth capital expenditures included amounts at Gener of $317 million, Eletropaulo of $223 million, Jordan of $200 million, Sul of $72 million, Mong Duong of $48 million, DPL of $40 million, Sixpenny Wood of $25 million, Altai of $21 million, Yelvertoft of $20 million and Kribi of $20 million.

Net cash used in investing activities was $895 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 primarily attributable to the following: Capital expenditures of $ 2.1 billion consisting of $1.1 billion of growth capital expenditures and $1 billion of maintenance and environmental capital expenditures. Growth capital expenditures included amounts at Gener of $258 million, Eletropaulo of $236 million, Sul of $111 million, Mong Duong of $83 million, DPL of $71 million, Kribi of $51, Maritza of $35 million, K2 YEL of $24 million, Drone Hill of $20 million and Mountain View 4 of $18 million. Maintenance and environmental capital expenditures included amounts at Eletropaulo of $215 million, IPL of $134 million, DPL of $117 million, Sul of $90 million, Gener of $77 million, Panama of $68 million, Tiet of $63 million, Altai of $26 million, Termo Andes of $24 million, Alicura of $22 million and Itabo of $22 million; partially offset by Proceeds from the sale of businesses, net of cash sold of $ 639 million including $228 million for the sale of Red Oak and Ironwood, $164 million for the sale of three wholly-owned hydropower plants previously owned by the IC Ictas joint venture to our Entek joint venture in which we hold a 50% interest, $131 million for the sale of Cili and several equity method investments in China, $63 million for the sale of 80% of our interest in Cartagena and $42 million for the sale of our investments in Innovent and St. Patrick; Sales of short-term investments, net of purchases of $ 530 million including amounts at Eletropaulo of $232 million, Gener of $126 million, Brasiliana of $102 million, Sul of $56 million and Tiet of $28 million; and Proceeds from government grants for asset construction of $ 122 million including amounts at Laurel Mountain of $82 million and Mountain View 4 of $30 million. Net cash used in investing activities increase d $879 million to $1.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to net cash used in investing activities of $895 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 . This net increase was primarily due to an increase in purchases of short-term investments, net of sales of $ 612 million and a decrease in proceeds from the sale of businesses, net of cash sold of $469 million , partially offset by a decrease in capital expenditures of $ 120 million . Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities was $1.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2013 primarily attributable to the following: Repayments of recourse and non-recourse debt of $4.6 billion including amounts at the Parent Company of $1.2 billion, DPL of $948 million, Masinloc of $560 million, Changuinola of $412 million, Tiet of $396 million, Caess of $301 million, IPL of $110 million, Warrior Run of $100 million, Puerto Rico of $73 million, Maritza of $57 million, Southland of $54 million, Sonel of $47 million and Sul of $44 million; Payments for financed capital expenditures were $591 million primarily at Mong Duong for payments to the contractors which took place more than three months after the associated equipment was purchased or work performed; Distributions to noncontrolling interests of $557 million including amounts at Tiet of $205 million, Brasiliana of $128 million, Gener of $62 million and Buffalo Gap of $54 million; 102 Purchase of treasury stock of $322 million at the Parent Company; Payments for financing fees of $176 million including amounts at Gener of $54 million including amounts at the Alto Maipo and Cochrane projects, Mong Duong of $28 million and Eletropaulo of $25 million; partially offset by Issuances of recourse and non-recourse debt of $5 billion including amounts of $750 million at the Parent Company, Gener of $707 million including amounts at the Cochrane and Alto Maipo projects, DPL of $645 million, Masinloc of $500 million, Tiet of $496 million, Mong Duong of $471 million, Changuinola of $420 million, Caess of $310 million, Jordan of $180 million, IPL of $170 million and Sul of $153 million; and Contributions from noncontrolling interests of $ 210 million including amounts at Gener of $109 million including amounts at the Cochrane and Alto Maipo projects and at Mong Duong of $77 million. Net cash used in financing activities was $1.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2012 primarily attributable to the following: Repayments of recourse and non-recourse debt of $1.6 billion including amounts at Eletropaulo of $510 million, the Parent Company of $236 million, Kribi of $181 million, Gener of $83 million, Southland of $48 million, Maritza of $47 million, Puerto Rico of $47 million, Sonel of $47 million, , Nigen of $40 million, Masinloc of $40 million, Warrior Run of $35 million and Hawaii of $30 million; Distributions to noncontrolling interests of $895 million including amounts at Brasiliana of $255 million, Tiet of $249 million, Eletropaulo of $203 million, Gener of $93 million and Panama of $23 million; Repayments under the revolving credit facilities of $321 million including amounts at the Parent Company of $295 million and Alicura of $33 million; The purchase of treasury stock at the Parent Company was $301 million ; Financed capital expenditures of $162 million primarily at Mong Duong for payments to the contractors which took place more than three months after the associated equipment was purchased or work performed; partially offset by Issuance of non-recourse debt of $ 1.4 billion including amounts at Eletropaulo of $715 million, Kribi of $245 million, Mong Duong of $185 million, K2 YEL of $48 million, Sul of $48 million, Alicura of $35 million and Panama of $25 million. Net cash used in financing activities decrease d $731 million to $1.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to net cash used in financing activities of $1.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2012 . This net decrease was primarily due to an increase in the issuance of recourse and non-recourse debt of $ 3.6 billion , decreases in distributions to noncontrolling interests of $ 338 million , net repayments under revolving credit facilities of $ 299 million and an increase in contributions from noncontrolling interests of $167 million . This was partially offset by an increase in the repayments of recourse and non-recourse debt of $ 3 billion , an increase in payments for financed capital expenditures of $ 429 million , an increase in payments for financings fees of $ 136 million and dividends paid of $89 million . Proportional Free Cash Flow (a non-GAAP measure) We define Proportional Free Cash Flow as cash flows from operating activities less maintenance capital expenditures (including non-recoverable environmental capital expenditures), adjusted for the estimated impact of noncontrolling interests. We exclude environmental capital expenditures that are expected to be recovered through regulatory, contractual or other mechanisms. An example of recoverable environmental capital expenditures is IPL's investment in MATS-related environmental upgrades that are recovered through a tracker. See Item 1. US SBU IPL Environmental Matters for details of these investments. The GAAP measure most comparable to proportional free cash flow is cash flows from operating activities. We believe that proportional free cash flow better reflects the underlying business performance of the Company, as it measures the cash generated by the business, after the funding of maintenance capital expenditures, that may be available for investing or repaying debt or other purposes. Factors in this determination include the impact of noncontrolling interests, where AES consolidates the results of a subsidiary that is not wholly-owned by the Company. The presentation of free cash flow has material limitations. Proportional free cash flow should not be construed as an alternative to cash from operating activities, which is determined in accordance with GAAP. Proportional free cash flow does not represent our cash flow available for discretionary payments because it excludes certain payments that are required or to 103 which we have committed, such as debt service requirements and dividend payments. Our definition of proportional free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. 2013 2012 2011 (in millions) Consolidated Net cash provided by operating activities $ 2,715 $ 2,901 $ 2,884 Less: Maintenance Capital Expenditures, net of reinsurance proceeds 760 923 878 Less: Non-recoverable Environmental Capital Expenditures 101 66 17 Free Cash Flow $ 1,854 $ 1,912 $ 1,989 Reconciliation of Proportional Operating Cash Flow Net cash provided by operating activities $ 2,715 $ 2,901 $ 2,884 Less: Proportional Adjustment Factor $ 834 $ 966 $ 1,312 Proportional Operating Cash Flow $ 1,881 $ 1,935 $ 1,572 Proportional Proportional Operating Cash Flow $ 1,881 $ 1,935 $ 1,572 Less: Proportional Maintenance Capital Expenditures, net of reinsurance proceeds 535 634 563 Less: Proportional Non-recoverable Environmental Capital Expenditures 75 51 12 Proportional Free Cash Flow $ 1,271 $ 1,250 $ 997 Proportional Free Cash Flow for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to the year ended December 31, 2012 increased $21 million , driven primarily by increases from the following SBUs and key operating drivers: MCAC, driven by higher operating cash flow, as a result of a $90 million payment related to an amendment to a fuel contract and lower working capital requirements, and US, as a result of higher operating cash flow from a bankruptcy settlement payment of the New York entities in 2012 and the proceeds from the PPA termination at Beaver Valley in January 2013, as well as lower capital expenditures. These increases were partially offset by: Andes, driven by lower operating cash flow from higher working capital requirements, and Asia, largely due to lower operating cash flow from higher working capital requirements and lower operating results at Masinloc. Proportional Free Cash Flow for the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to the year ended December 31, 2011 increased $253 million , driven primarily by increases from the following SBUs and key operating drivers: US, driven by higher operating cash flow at our utility businesses primarily due to the operations, net of debt service costs, of DPL which was acquired in November 2011. This increase was partially offset by: Brazil, driven by lower operating cash flow at Eletropaulo. Contractual Obligations A summary of our contractual obligations, commitments and other liabilities as of December 31, 2013 is presented in the table below, which excludes any businesses classified as discontinued operations or held-for-sale (in millions): Contractual Obligations Total Less than 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than 5 years Other Footnote Reference (5) Debt Obligations (1) $ 21,049 $ 2,180 $ 3,846 $ 4,158 $ 10,865 $ 12 Interest Payments on Long-Term Debt (2) 8,159 1,215 2,177 1,583 3,184 n/a Capital Lease Obligations (3) 195 13 25 21 136 13 Operating Lease Obligations (3) 602 41 82 80 399 13 Electricity Obligations (3) 41,165 2,793 5,600 4,941 27,831 13 Fuel Obligations (3) 6,746 1,274 1,155 866 3,451 13 Other Purchase Obligations (3) 10,496 1,526 2,301 1,250 5,419 13 Other Long-Term Liabilities Reflected on AES Consolidated Balance Sheet under GAAP (4) 869 255 93 381 140 n/a Total $ 89,281 $ 9,042 $ 15,441 $ 12,992 $ 51,666 $ 140 104 (1) Includes recourse and non-recourse debt presented on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. See Note 12 Debt to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K which provides additional disclosure regarding these obligations. These amounts exclude capital lease obligations which are included in the capital lease category, see (3) below. (2) Interest payments are estimated based on final maturity dates of debt securities outstanding at December 31, 2013 and do not reflect anticipated future refinancing, early redemptions or new debt issuances. Variable rate interest obligations are estimated based on rates as of December 31, 2013 . (3) See Note 13 Commitments to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information. (4) These amounts do not include current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet except for the current portion of uncertain tax obligations. Noncurrent uncertain tax obligations are reflected in the Other column of the table above as the Company is not able to reasonably estimate the timing of the future payments. In addition, the amounts do not include: (1) regulatory liabilities (See Note 11 Regulatory Assets and Liabilities ), (2) contingencies (See Note 14 Contingencies ), (3) pension and other post retirement employee benefit liabilities (see Note 15 Benefit Plans ) or (4) any taxes (See Note 22 Income Taxes ) except for uncertain tax obligations, as the Company is not able to reasonably estimate the timing of future payments. See the indicated notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information on the items excluded. Derivatives (See Note 6 Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities ) and incentive compensation are excluded as the Company is not able to reasonably estimate the timing or amount of the future payments. (5) For further information see the note referenced below in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this form 10-K . Parent Company Liquidity The following discussion of Parent Company Liquidity has been included because we believe it is a useful measure of the liquidity available to The AES Corporation, or the Parent Company, given the non-recourse nature of most of our indebtedness. Parent Company Liquidity as outlined below is a non-GAAP measure and should not be construed as an alternative to cash and cash equivalents which are determined in accordance with GAAP, as a measure of liquidity. Cash and cash equivalents are disclosed in the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. Parent Company Liquidity may differ from similarly titled measures used by other companies. The principal sources of liquidity at the Parent Company level are: dividends and other distributions from our subsidiaries, including refinancing proceeds; proceeds from debt and equity financings at the Parent Company level, including availability under our credit facilities; and proceeds from asset sales. Cash requirements at the Parent Company level are primarily to fund: interest; principal repayments of debt; acquisitions; construction commitments; other equity commitments; common stock repurchases; taxes; Parent Company overhead and development costs; and dividends on common stock. The Company defines Parent Company Liquidity as cash available to the Parent Company plus available borrowings under existing credit facilities. The cash held at qualified holding companies represents cash sent to subsidiaries of the Company domiciled outside of the U.S. Such subsidiaries have no contractual restrictions on their ability to send cash to the Parent Company. Parent Company Liquidity is reconciled to its most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure, cash and cash equivalents, at December 31, 2013 and 2012 as follows: 105 Parent Company Liquidity 2013 2012 (in millions) Consolidated cash and cash equivalents $ 1,642 $ 1,900 Less: Cash and cash equivalents at subsidiaries 1,510 1,589 Parent and qualified holding companies cash and cash equivalents 132 311 Commitments under Parent credit facilities 800 800 Less: Letters of credit under the credit facilities (1 ) (5 ) Borrowings available under Parent credit facilities 799 795 Total Parent Company Liquidity $ 931 $ 1,106 The Company paid dividends of $0.16 per share to its common stockholders during the year ended December 31, 2013 . While we intend to continue payment of dividends and believe we will have sufficient liquidity to do so, we can provide no assurance we will be able to continue the payment of dividends. In December 2013, the Company repurchased 20 million shares of its common stock from CIC for $258 million . See Note 16 Equity, Stock Repurchase Program for further information. Recourse Debt: Our recourse debt at year-end was approximately $5.7 billion and $6.0 billion in 2013 and 2012 , respectively. The following table sets forth our Parent Company contingent contractual obligations as of December 31, 2013: Contingent contractual obligations Amount Number of Agreements Maximum Exposure Range for Each Agreement (in millions) (in millions) Guarantees $ 661 <$1 - 280 Cash collateralized letters of credit 163 <$1 - 109 Letters of credit under the senior secured credit facility 1 <$1 Total $ 825 As of December 31, 2013 , the Company had no commitments to invest in subsidiaries under construction and to purchase related equipment that were not included in the letters of credit discussed above. We have a diverse portfolio of performance-related contingent contractual obligations. These obligations are designed to cover potential risks and only require payment if certain targets are not met or certain contingencies occur. The risks associated with these obligations include change of control, construction cost overruns, subsidiary default, political risk, tax indemnities, spot market power prices, sponsor support and liquidated damages under power sales agreements for projects in development, in operation and under construction. In addition, we have an asset sale program through which we may have customary indemnity obligations under certain assets sale agreements. While we do not expect that we will be required to fund any material amounts under these contingent contractual obligations beyond 2013, many of the events which would give rise to such obligations are beyond our control. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to fund our obligations under these contingent contractual obligations if we are required to make substantial payments thereunder. While we believe that our sources of liquidity will be adequate to meet our needs for the foreseeable future, this belief is based on a number of material assumptions, including, without limitation, assumptions about our ability to access the capital markets (see Key Trends and Uncertainties, Global Economic Conditions ), the operating and financial performance of our subsidiaries, currency exchange rates, power market pool prices, and the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends. In addition, our subsidiaries ability to declare and pay cash dividends to us (at the Parent Company level) is subject to certain limitations contained in loans, governmental provisions and other agreements. We can provide no assurance that these sources will be available when needed or that the actual cash requirements will not be greater than anticipated. See Item 1A. Risk Factors , The AES Corporation is a holding company and its ability to make payments on its outstanding indebtedness, including its public debt securities, is dependent upon the receipt of funds from its subsidiaries by way of dividends, fees, interest, loans or otherwise . of this Form 10-K. Various debt instruments at the Parent Company level, including our senior secured credit facility, contain certain restrictive covenants. The covenants provide for, among other items: limitations on other indebtedness, liens, investments and guarantees; limitations on dividends, stock repurchases and other equity transactions; restrictions and limitations on mergers and acquisitions, sales of assets, leases, transactions with affiliates and off-balance sheet and derivative arrangements; 106 maintenance of certain financial ratios; and financial and other reporting requirements. As of December 31, 2013, we were in compliance with these covenants at the Parent Company level. Non-Recourse Debt While the lenders under our non-recourse debt financings generally do not have direct recourse to the Parent Company, defaults thereunder can still have important consequences for our results of operations and liquidity, including, without limitation: reducing our cash flows as the subsidiary will typically be prohibited from distributing cash to the Parent Company during the time period of any default; triggering our obligation to make payments under any financial guarantee, letter of credit or other credit support we have provided to or on behalf of such subsidiary; causing us to record a loss in the event the lender forecloses on the assets; and triggering defaults in our outstanding debt at the Parent Company. For example, our senior secured credit facilities and outstanding debt securities at the Parent Company include events of default for certain bankruptcy related events involving material subsidiaries. In addition, our revolving credit agreement at the Parent Company includes events of default related to payment defaults and accelerations of outstanding debt of material subsidiaries. Some of our subsidiaries are currently in default with respect to all or a portion of their outstanding indebtedness. The total non-recourse debt classified as current in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet amounts to $2.1 billion . The portion of current debt related to such defaults was $1.1 billion at December 31, 2013 , all of which was non-recourse debt related to two subsidiaries Maritza and Kavarna. In addition, discontinued operations at Sonel and Kribi had debt in default of $257 million and $247 million , respectively; and discontinued operations at Saurashtra had debt of $21 million that is classified as current because a covenant violation is probable within the next twelve months. None of the subsidiaries that are currently in default are subsidiaries that met the applicable definition of materiality under AES corporate debt agreements as of December 31, 2013 in order for such defaults to trigger an event of default or permit acceleration under AES indebtedness. However, as a result of additional dispositions of assets, other significant reductions in asset carrying values or other matters in the future that may impact our financial position and results of operations or the financial position of the individual subsidiary, it is possible that one or more of these subsidiaries could fall within the definition of a material subsidiary and thereby upon an acceleration trigger an event of default and possible acceleration of the indebtedness under the Parent Company outstanding debt securities. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The Consolidated Financial Statements of AES are prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which requires the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented. AES significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 General and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. An accounting estimate is considered critical if: the estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the estimate was made; different estimates reasonably could have been used; or the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material. Management believes that the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and the resulting balances are reasonable; however, actual results could materially differ from the original estimates, requiring adjustments to these balances in future periods. Management has discussed these critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee, as appropriate. Listed below 107 are the Company most significant critical accounting estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Income Taxes We are subject to income taxes in both the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our worldwide income tax provision requires significant judgment and is based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service and other taxing authorities. The Company and certain of its subsidiaries are under examination by relevant taxing authorities for various tax years. The Company regularly assesses the potential outcome of these examinations in each tax jurisdiction when determining the adequacy of the provision for income taxes. Accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold. Tax reserves have been established, which the Company believes to be adequate in relation to the potential for additional assessments. Once established, reserves are adjusted only when there is more information available or when an event occurs necessitating a change to the reserves. While the Company believes that the amounts of the tax estimates are reasonable, it is possible that the ultimate outcome of current or future examinations may be materially different than the reserve amounts. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of the existing assets and liabilities, and their respective income tax bases. The Company establishes a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. The Company provision for income taxes could be adversely impacted by changes to the U.S. taxation of earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. Since 2006, the Company has benefited from the Controlled Foreign Corporation look-through rule, originally enacted for the 2006 through 2009 tax years in the Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act ( TIPRA ) of 2005 and retroactively reinstated for the 2010 and 2011 tax years via the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010. On January 3, 2013, the Controlled Foreign Corporation look-through rule was retroactively reinstated to January 1, 2012 for a period of two years through the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012. In determining the Company effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2012, the Company excluded the benefits of this provision since enactment of this reinstatement did not occur by December 31, 2012. However, the benefit was recorded in the first quarter of 2013 for the retroactive reinstatement of the provision. There can be no assurance that this provision will continue to be extended beyond the two year period that ended December 31, 2013. Accordingly, if this provision is not renewed, our expected effective tax rate could increase by amounts that may be material. Impairments Our accounting policies on goodwill and long-lived assets are described in detail in Note 1 General and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. The Company makes considerable judgments in its impairment evaluations of goodwill and long-lived assets; however, the fair value determination is typically the most judgmental part in an impairment evaluation. The Company determines the fair value of a reporting unit or a long-lived asset (asset group) by applying the approaches prescribed under the fair value measurement accounting framework. Generally, the market approach and income approach are most relevant in the fair value measurement of our reporting units and long-lived assets; however, due to the lack of available relevant observable market information in many circumstances, the Company often relies on the income approach. The Company may engage an independent valuation firm to assist management with the valuation. The decision to engage an independent valuation firm considers all relevant facts and circumstances, including a cost/benefit analysis and the Company internal valuation knowledge of the long-lived asset (asset group) or business. The Company develops the underlying assumptions consistent with its internal budgets and forecasts for such valuations. Additionally, the Company uses an internal discounted cash flow valuation model (the DCF model ), based on the principles of present value techniques, to estimate the fair value of its reporting units or long-lived assets under the income approach. The DCF model estimates fair value by discounting our internal budgets and cash flow forecasts, adjusted to reflect market participant assumptions, to the extent necessary, at an appropriate discount rate. Management applies considerable judgment in selecting several input assumptions during the development of our internal budgets and cash flow forecasts. Examples of the input assumptions that our budgets and forecasts are sensitive to include macroeconomic factors such as growth rates, industry demand, inflation, exchange rates, power prices and commodity prices. Whenever appropriate, management obtains these input assumptions from observable market data sources (e.g., Economic Intelligence Unit) and extrapolates the market information if an input assumption is not observable for the entire forecast period. Many of these input assumptions are dependent on other economic assumptions, which are often derived from statistical economic models with inherent limitations such as estimation differences. Further, several input assumptions are based on historical trends which often do not recur. The input assumptions most significant to our budgets and cash flows are based on expectations of macroeconomic factors which have been volatile recently. It is not uncommon that different market data 108 sources have different views of the macroeconomic factors expectations and related assumptions. As a result, macroeconomic factors and related assumptions are often available in a narrow range; however, in some situations these ranges become wide and the use of a different set of input assumptions could produce significantly different budgets and cash flow forecasts. A considerable amount of judgment is also applied in the estimation of the discount rate used in the DCF model. To the extent practical, inputs to the discount rate are obtained from market data sources (e.g., Bloomberg, Capital IQ, etc.). The Company selects and uses a set of publicly traded companies from the relevant industry to estimate the discount rate inputs. Management applies judgment in the selection of such companies based on its view of the most likely market participants. It is reasonably possible that the selection of a different set of likely market participants could produce different input assumptions and result in the use of a different discount rate. Fair value of a reporting unit or a long-lived asset (asset group) is sensitive to both input assumptions to our budgets and cash flow forecasts and the discount rate. Further, estimates of long-term growth and terminal value are often critical to the fair value determination. As part of the impairment evaluation process, management analyzes the sensitivity of fair value to various underlying assumptions. The level of scrutiny increases as the gap between fair value and carrying amount decreases. Changes in any of these assumptions could result in management reaching a different conclusion regarding the potential impairment, which could be material. Our impairment evaluations inherently involve uncertainties from uncontrollable events that could positively or negatively impact the anticipated future economic and operating conditions. Further discussion of the impairment charges recognized by the Company can be found within Note 10 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, Note 21 Asset Impairment Expense and Note 9 Other Non-Operating Expense to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Fair Value Fair Value Hierarchy The Company uses valuation techniques and methodologies that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Where available, fair value is based on observable market prices or parameters or derived from such prices or parameters. Where observable prices are not available, valuation models are applied to estimate the fair value using the available observable inputs. The valuation techniques involve some level of management estimation and judgment, the degree of which is dependent on the price transparency for the instruments or market and the instruments complexity. To increase consistency and enhance disclosure of the fair value of financial instruments, the fair value measurement standard includes a fair value hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used to measure fair value into three categories. An asset or liability level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input significant to the fair value measurement, where Level 1 is the highest and Level 3 is the lowest. For more information regarding the fair value hierarchy, see Note 1 General and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K. Fair Value of Financial Instruments A significant number of the Company financial instruments are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings or other comprehensive income each period. The Company makes estimates regarding the valuation of assets and liabilities measured at fair value in preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements. These assets and liabilities include short and long-term investments in debt and equity securities, included in the balance sheet line items Short-term investments and Other assets (Noncurrent) , derivative assets, included in Other current assets and Other assets (Noncurrent) and derivative liabilities, included in Accrued and other liabilities (current) and Other long-term liabilities . Investments are generally fair valued based on quoted market prices or other observable market data such as interest rate indices. The Company investments are primarily certificates of deposit, government debt securities and money market funds. Derivatives are valued using observable data as inputs into internal valuation models. The Company derivatives primarily consist of interest rate swaps, foreign currency instruments, and commodity and embedded derivatives. Additional discussion regarding the nature of these financial instruments and valuation techniques can be found in Note 4 Fair Value included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K. Fair Value of Nonfinancial Assets and Liabilities Significant estimates are made in determining the fair value of long-lived tangible and intangible assets (i.e., property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and goodwill) during the impairment evaluation process. In addition, the majority of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are required to be recognized at fair value under the relevant 109 accounting guidance. In determining the fair value of these items, management makes several assumptions discussed in the Impairments section. Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities We enter into various derivative transactions in order to hedge our exposure to certain market risks. We primarily use derivative instruments to manage our interest rate, commodity and foreign currency exposures. We do not enter into derivative transactions for trading purposes. In accordance with the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging, we recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value except where derivatives qualify and are designated as normal purchase/normal sale transactions. Changes in fair value of derivatives are recognized in earnings unless specific hedge criteria are met. Income and expense related to derivative instruments are recognized in the same category as that generated by the underlying asset or liability. See Note 6 Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information on the classification. The accounting standards for derivatives and hedging enable companies to designate qualifying derivatives as hedging instruments based on the exposure being hedged. These hedge designations include fair value hedges and cash flow hedges. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is highly effective and is designated and qualifies as a fair value hedge, are recognized in earnings as offsets to the changes in fair value of the exposure being hedged. The Company has no fair value hedges at this time. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is highly effective and is designated as and qualifies as a cash flow hedge, are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income and are recognized into earnings as the hedged transactions occur. Any ineffectiveness is recognized in earnings immediately. For all hedge contracts, the Company provides formal documentation of the hedge and effectiveness testing in accordance with the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging. The fair value measurement accounting standard provides additional guidance on the definition of fair value and defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, or exit price. The fair value measurement standard requires the Company to consider and reflect the assumptions of market participants in the fair value calculation. These factors include nonperformance risk (the risk that the obligation will not be fulfilled) and credit risk, both of the reporting entity (for liabilities) and of the counterparty (for assets). Due to the nature of the Company interest rate swaps, which are typically associated with non-recourse debt, credit risk for AES is evaluated at the subsidiary level rather than at the Parent Company level. Nonperformance risk on the Company derivative instruments is an adjustment to the initial asset/liability fair value position that is derived from internally developed valuation models that utilize observable market inputs. As a result of uncertainty, complexity and judgment, accounting estimates related to derivative accounting could result in material changes to our financial statements under different conditions or utilizing different assumptions. As a part of accounting for these derivatives, we make estimates concerning nonperformance, volatilities, market liquidity, future commodity prices, interest rates, credit ratings (both ours and our counterparty s) and exchange rates. The fair value of our derivative portfolio is generally determined using internal valuation models, most of which are based on observable market inputs including interest rate curves and forward and spot prices for currencies and commodities. The Company derives most of its financial instrument market assumptions from market efficient data sources (e.g., Bloomberg, Reuters and Platt s). In some cases, where market data is not readily available, management uses comparable market sources and empirical evidence to derive market assumptions to determine a financial instrument fair value. In certain instances, the published curve may not extend through the remaining term of the contract and management must make assumptions to extrapolate the curve. Additionally, in the absence of quoted prices, we may rely on indicative pricing quotes from financial institutions to input into our valuation model for certain of our foreign currency swaps. These indicative pricing quotes do not constitute either a bid or ask price and therefore are not considered observable market data. For individual contracts, the use of different valuation models or assumptions could have a material effect on the calculated fair value. Regulatory Assets and Liabilities Management continually assesses whether the regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by considering factors such as applicable regulatory changes, recent rate orders applicable to other regulated entities and the status of any pending or potential deregulation legislation. If future recovery of costs ceases to be probable, any asset write-offs would be required to be recognized in operating income. New Accounting Pronouncements 110 The Company did not adopt any new accounting pronouncements during the year that had a material impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations. See Note 1 - General and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information about accounting pronouncements issued but not yet effective.
