ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with the Company consolidated financial statements. OVERVIEW Our Business We develop, manufacture, market and sell a broad range of household, personal care and specialty products. We sell our consumer products under a variety of brands through a broad distribution platform that includes supermarkets, mass merchandisers, wholesale clubs, drugstores, convenience stores, dollar, pet and other specialty stores, and websites, all of which sell the products to consumers. We also sell specialty products to industrial customers and distributors. The Company focuses its consumer products marketing efforts principally on its eight power brands. These well-recognized brand names include ARM & HAMMER (used in multiple product categories such as baking soda, cat litter, carpet deodorization and laundry detergent), TROJAN condoms, XTRA laundry detergent, OXICLEAN stain removers and cleaning solutions, NAIR depilatories, FIRST RESPONSE home pregnancy and ovulation test kits, ORAJEL oral analgesics and SPINBRUSH battery-operated toothbrushes. We operate our business in three primary segments: Consumer Domestic, Consumer International and Specialty Products Division ( SPD ). The Consumer Domestic segment includes the eight power brands and other household and personal care products such as SCRUB FREE, KABOOM and ORANGE GLO cleaning products, L IL CRITTERS and VITAFUSION dietary supplements, FELINE PINE cat litter, ANSWER home pregnancy and ovulation test kits, ARRID antiperspirant, CLOSE-UP and AIM toothpastes and SIMPLY SALINE nasal saline moisturizer. The Consumer International segment primarily sells a variety of personal care products, some of which use the same brand names as our domestic product lines, in international markets, including Canada, France, Australia, the United Kingdom, Mexico, Brazil and China. The SPD segment is the largest U.S. producer of sodium bicarbonate, which it sells together with other specialty inorganic chemicals for a variety of industrial, institutional, medical and food applications. This segment also sells a range of animal nutrition and specialty cleaning products. In 2012, the Consumer Domestic, Consumer International and SPD segments represented approximately 74%, 17% and 9%, respectively, of our consolidated net sales. Industry Trends, Uncertainties and Our Strategic Response Our ability to generate sales depends on consumer demand for our products, which is affected by general economic conditions in our markets. In 2012, many of the markets in which we operate continued to experience general economic softness and weak or choppy consumer demand. Although our consumer products generally are consumer staples and less vulnerable to decreases in discretionary spending than other products, the continued economic downturn has reduced demand in many of our categories, particularly those in personal care, and affected our sales in recent periods. We expect challenging conditions of the last several years may persist in 2013 primarily due to continued weak consumer demand in many of our categories, and continuing pricing pressures. To continue to deliver attractive results for our shareholders in this environment, we intend to remain aggressive in our pursuit of several key strategic initiatives, and specifically to maintain competitive marketing and trade spending, manage our cost structure, continue to develop and launch new and differentiated products and pursue strategic acquisitions. We also intend to continue to balance our product sales both geographically (in an attempt to mitigate the impact of weakness in any one area), and between premium and value brand offerings (to appeal to a wide range of consumers). Over the past 12 years, we have diversified from an almost exclusively U.S. business to a global company with approximately 21% of our sales derived from foreign countries. We have operations in seven countries (Canada, Mexico, U.K., France, Australia, Brazil and China) and export to over 80 other countries. In 2012 we 34 Table of Contents benefited from our concentration in North America in light of the economic downturn in Europe and the strengthening U.S. dollar; however, we have continued and will continue to focus on expanding our global business. Generally weak economic conditions have caused slow growth or declines in most of our consumer product categories, especially in personal care. Some customers have responded to economic conditions by increasing their private label offerings (primarily in the dietary supplements, diagnostic kits and oral analgesics categories), and consolidating the product selections they offer to the top few leading brands in each category. In addition, an increasing portion of our product categories are being sold by club stores and mass merchandisers. All of these customer responses have placed downward pressure on our sales and gross margins. Our strategy in response to these customer actions is to continue to focus on strengthening our key brands, including our power brands and certain other important brands, such as L IL CRITTERS and VITAFUSION dietary supplements, with market leading positions in their categories, through the launch of innovative new products, increased marketing spending and strong sales execution. Despite challenging economic conditions and customer responses to these conditions, we were able to grow market share in six of eight of our power brands in 2012, including laundry detergent. Our product portfolio consists of both premium (60%) and value (40%) brands, which we believe enables us to succeed in a range of economic environments. Our value brands have performed strongly during economic downturns, and we intend to continue to develop a portfolio of appealing new products to build loyalty among cost-conscious consumers. In 2012, we launched innovative new products in both existing and new categories, including ARM & HAMMER ULTRA LAST, a longer lasting clumping cat litter, OXICLEAN Dishwashing Booster, which removes cloudy film and food particles on glasses and dishes, a line of toothpaste for sensitive teeth under the ARM & HAMMER brand and ARM & HAMMER TOOTH TUNES battery operated toothbrushes with proprietary technology that delivers music while brushing. In 2013, we also plan to increase marketing spending focused behind the launch of innovative new premium products in our power brands (including ARM & HAMMER ULTRA POWER 4X, a concentrated form of liquid laundry detergent, and a line of lubrication products under our TROJAN brand), which we expect will continue to drive market share gains. We also continued to experience high raw material and energy costs throughout 2012. Historically, we have been able to mitigate the effects of cost increases primarily by implementing cost reduction programs and, to a lesser extent, by passing along some of these cost increases to our customers. We have also entered into pre-buying arrangements with certain suppliers and hedge agreements for diesel fuel costs. However, the increased price competition that we have experienced in recent periods has diminished the impact of some of these measures and affected our gross margins. Maintaining tight controls on our overhead costs has been a hallmark of our Company and has enabled us to effectively navigate recent challenging economic conditions. The identification and integration of strategic acquisitions are an important component of our overall strategy. Our failure to effectively implement this initiative, including a failure to integrate any acquisition or achieve expected synergies, may cause us to incur material asset write-downs. We actively seek acquisitions that fit our guidelines and our strong financial position provides us with flexibility to take advantage of acquisition opportunities. In addition, our ability to quickly integrate acquisitions and leverage our existing infrastructure have enabled us to establish a strong track record in making accretive acquisitions. Since 2001, we have acquired seven of our eight current power brands . In 2012, we completed the acquisition of our L IL CRITTERS and VITAFUSION dietary supplements. For information regarding risks and uncertainties that could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, see Risk Factors in Item 1A of this Annual Report. 35 Table of Contents Recent Developments Avid Acquisition On October 1, 2012, the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Avid Health, Inc. ( Avid Health ). Avid Health is a leader in the dietary supplement category that includes vitamins and minerals. Its products, among others, include L IL CRITTERS children gummy form dietary supplements and VITAFUSION adult gummy form dietary supplements. The total purchase price was approximately $650 million, which is subject to adjustment based on the closing working capital of Avid Health and its subsidiaries. The Company financed the acquisition with a combination of proceeds from an underwritten public offering of $400 million aggregate principal amount of 2.875% Senior Notes due 2022, the issuance of commercial paper and cash. Avid Health annual sales for the twelve months ended June 2012 were approximately $230 million. These dietary supplement brands will be managed principally within the Consumer Domestic segment. New Corporate Office Building On July 20, 2011, the Company entered into a 20 year lease for a new corporate headquarters building constructed in Ewing, New Jersey (approximately 10 miles from the Company former corporate headquarters in Princeton, New Jersey) to meet office space needs for the foreseeable future. The Company began occupancy in late 2012 and as a result, the lease will expire in 2032. The Company lease commitment is approximately $116 million over the lease term. Based on certain clauses in the lease, the Company is considered the owner for financial statement reporting purposes, and recorded approximately $50 million as of December 31, 2012 in building assets and a corresponding amount in other long-term liabilities. 2.875% Senior notes On September 26, 2012, the Company closed an underwritten public offering of $400 million aggregate principal amount of 2.875% Senior Notes (the Notes ). The Notes were issued under the second supplemental indenture (the Second Supplemental Indenture ), dated September 26, 2012, to the indenture dated December 15, 2010, between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee. Interest on the 2.875% Notes is payable semi-annually, beginning April 1, 2013. The Notes will mature on October 1, 2022, unless earlier retired or redeemed pursuant to the terms of the Second Supplemental Indenture. Share Repurchase Authorization On October 31, 2012, the Company Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program, under which the Company may purchase up to an additional $300 million of the Company common stock. Under the new program, shares may be repurchased from time to time in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise, subject to market conditions, and corporate and legal requirements. There is no expiration date on the stock repurchase authorization and the Company is not obligated to acquire any specific number of shares. The previous share repurchase program announced in August 2011 had an authorization of $300 million, $20 million of which remained available on October 31, 2012. In 2012, the Company purchased approximately 5 million shares at an aggregate cost of approximately $250 million under both programs. As of December 31, 2012, the Company had used the full $300 million authorized under the August 2011 program, and had $270 million remaining available for use under the October 2012 program. In January 2013, the Company purchased an additional 0.9 million shares at an aggregate cost of approximately $50 million. As of the filing date of this Annual Report, the Company has made no additional purchases in 2013 and has approximately $220 million remaining for use in the repurchase of the Company shares. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The Company Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. of America (GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements 36 Table of Contents requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. By their nature, these judgments are subject to uncertainty. They are based on the Company historical experience, its observation of trends in industry, information provided by its customers and information available from other outside sources, as appropriate. The Company significant accounting policies and estimates are described below. Revenue Recognition and Promotional and Sales Return Reserves Virtually all of the Company revenue represents sales of finished goods inventory and is recognized when delivered or picked up by our customers. The reserves for consumer and trade promotion liabilities and sales returns are established based on our best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date. Promotional reserves are provided for sales incentives, such as coupons to consumers, and sales incentives provided to customers (such as slotting, cooperative advertising, incentive discounts based on volume of sales and other arrangements made directly with customers). All such costs are netted against sales. Slotting costs are recorded when the product is delivered to the customer. Cooperative advertising costs are recorded when the customer places the advertisement for the Company products. Discounts relating to price reduction arrangements are recorded when the related sale takes place. Costs associated with end-aisle or other in-store displays are recorded when product that is subject to the promotion is sold. The Company relies on historical experience and forecasted data to determine the required reserves. For example, the Company uses historical experience to project coupon redemption rates to determine reserve requirements. Based on the total face value of Consumer Domestic coupons redeemed over the past several years, if the actual rate of redemptions were to deviate by 0.1% from the rate for which reserves are accrued in the financial statements, an approximately $2.1 million difference in the reserve required for coupons would result. With regard to other promotional reserves and sales returns, the Company uses experience-based estimates, customer and sales organization inputs and historical trend analysis in arriving at the reserves required. If the Company estimates for promotional activities and sales returns were to change by 10% the impact to promotional spending and sales return accruals would be approximately $6.7 million. While management believes that its promotional and sales returns reserves are reasonable and that appropriate judgments have been made, estimated amounts could differ materially from actual future obligations. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, the Company reduced promotion liabilities by approximately $4.0 million, $8.2 million and $6.8 million, respectively, based on a change in estimate as a result of actual experience and updated information. These adjustments are immaterial relative to the amount of trade promotion expense incurred annually by the Company. Impairment of goodwill, trademarks and other intangible assets and property, plant and equipment Carrying values of goodwill, trademarks and other indefinite lived intangible assets are reviewed periodically for possible impairment . For finite intangible assets, the Company assesses business triggering events. The Company impairment analysis is based on a discounted cash flow approach that requires significant judgment with respect to unit volume, revenue and expense growth rates, and the selection of an appropriate discount rate. Management uses estimates based on expected trends in making these assumptions. With respect to goodwill, impairment occurs when the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the discounted present value of cash flows for that reporting unit. For trademarks and other intangible assets, an impairment charge is recorded for the difference between the carrying value and the net present value of estimated future cash flows, which represents the estimated fair value of the asset. Judgment is required in assessing whether assets may have become impaired between annual valuations. Indicators such as unexpected adverse economic factors, unanticipated technological change, distribution losses, or competitive activities and acts by governments and courts may indicate that an asset has become impaired. The result of the Company annual goodwill impairment test determined that the estimated fair value substantially exceeded the carrying values of all reporting units. In addition, there were no intangible impairment charges for the three year period ended December 31, 2012. It is possible that the Company conclusions regarding impairment or recoverability of goodwill or other intangible assets could change in future periods if, for example, (i) the businesses or brands do not perform as 37 Table of Contents projected, (ii) overall economic conditions in 2013 or future years vary from current assumptions (including changes in discount rates), (iii) business conditions or strategies change from current assumptions, (iv) investors require higher rates of return on equity investments in the marketplace or (v) enterprise values of comparable publicly traded companies, or actual sales transactions of comparable companies, were to decline, resulting in lower multiples of revenues and EBITDA. A future impairment charge for goodwill or intangible assets could have a material effect on the Company consolidated financial position or results of operations. Property, plant and equipment and other long-lived assets are reviewed whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate possible impairment . The Company impairment review is based on an undiscounted cash flow analysis at the lowest level at which cash flows of the long-lived assets are largely independent of other groups of Company assets and liabilities. The analysis requires management judgment with respect to changes in technology, the continued success of product lines, and future volume, revenue and expense growth rates. The Company conducts annual reviews to identify idle and underutilized equipment, and reviews business plans for possible impairment implications. Impairment occurs when the carrying value of the asset exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows. When an impairment is indicated, the estimated future cash flows are then discounted to determine the estimated fair value of the asset and an impairment charge is recorded for the difference between the carrying value and fair value. The Company recognized charges related to plant impairment and equipment obsolescence, which occurs in the ordinary course of business during the three year period, ended December 31, 2012 as follows: For the Year Ended December 31, (In millions) 2012 2011 2010 Segments: Consumer Domestic $ 1.6 $ 1.9 $ 0.6 Consumer International 0.4 0.2 0.0 Specialty Products 0.1 1.0 3.1 Total $ 2.1 $ 3.1 $ 3.7 The 2012 Consumer Domestic and SPD charges are due to the idling of equipment and the Consumer International charge is due to the cancelation of a software project. The 2011 Consumer Domestic charge is a result of the idling of equipment. The 2011 SPD charge is associated with the Company decision to explore strategic options for the specialty chemical business in Brazil. In 2010, the Company recorded a plant asset impairment charge of approximately $3.1 million, representing the carrying value of certain assets associated with its Brazil subsidiary. The charge is a result of a reduction in forecasted sales volume which has negatively impacted projected profitability. The charge is included in cost of sales in the SPD segment. The other charges in 2010 are due to the idling of certain equipment. The estimates and assumptions used in connection with impairment analyses are consistent with the business plans and estimates that the Company uses to manage its business operations. Nevertheless, future outcomes may differ materially from management estimates. If the Company products fail to achieve estimated volume and pricing targets, market conditions unfavorably change or other significant estimates are not realized, then the Company revenue and cost forecasts may not be achieved, and the Company may be required to recognize additional impairment charges. Inventory valuation When appropriate, the Company writes down the carrying value of its inventory to the lower of cost or market (net realizable value, which reflects any costs to sell or dispose). The Company identifies any slow moving, obsolete or excess inventory to determine whether an adjustment is required to establish a new carrying value. The determination of whether inventory items are slow moving, obsolete or in excess of needs requires estimates and assumptions about the future demand for the Company products, technological changes, and new product introductions. In addition, the Company allowance for obsolescence may be impacted by the reduction 38 Table of Contents of the number of stock keeping units (SKUs). The Company evaluates its inventory levels and expected usage on a periodic basis and records adjustments as required. Adjustments to inventory to reflect a reduction in net realizable value were $5.7 million at December 31, 2012, and $4.7 million at December 31, 2011. Valuation of pension and postretirement benefit costs The Company pension costs relate solely to its international operations. Both pension and postretirement benefit costs are developed from actuarial valuations. Inherent in benefit cost valuations are key assumptions provided by the Company to its actuaries, including the discount rate and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Material changes in the Company international pension and domestic/international postretirement benefit costs may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions as well as fluctuations in plan assets. The discount rate is subject to change each year, consistent with changes in applicable high-quality, long-term corporate bond indices. Based on the expected duration of the benefit payments for the Company pension plans and postretirement plans, the Company refers to an applicable index and expected term of benefit payments to select a discount rate at which it believes the plan benefits could be effectively settled. The Company weighted average discount rate for its international pension plans as of December 31, 2012 is 4.16% as compared to 4.73% used at December 31, 2011. Based on the published rate as of December 31, 2012 that matched estimated cash flows for the plans, the Company used a weighted average discount rate of 3.89% for its postretirement plans as compared to 4.32% used at December 31, 2011. The expected long-term rate of return on international pension plan assets is selected by taking into account the historical trend, the expected duration of the projected benefit obligation for the plans, the asset mix of the plans and known economic and market conditions at the time of valuation. Based on these factors, the Company weighted average expected long-term rate of return for assets of its pension plans for 2012 was 5.35%, compared to 5.87% used in 2011. A 50 basis point change in the expected long-term rate of return would result in an approximate $0.4 million change in pension expense for 2013. As noted above, changes in assumptions used by management may result in material changes in the Company pension and postretirement benefit costs. In 2012, other comprehensive income reflected a $5.9 million increase in its remaining pension plan obligations and a $1.9 million increase for postretirement benefit plans. The changes are primarily related to the change in discount rates for all plans. The Company made cash contributions of approximately $4.4 million to its pension plans in 2012. The Company estimates it will be required to make cash contributions to its pension plans of approximately $4.4 million in 2013 to offset 2013 benefit payments and administrative costs in excess of investment returns. Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized to reflect the future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Management provides a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets for amounts which are not considered more likely than not to be realized. The Company records liabilities for potential assessments in various tax jurisdictions under ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes. The liabilities relate to tax return positions that, although supportable by the Company, may be challenged by the tax authorities and do not meet the minimum recognition threshold required under applicable accounting guidance for the related tax benefit to be recognized in the income statement. The Company adjusts this liability as a result of changes in tax legislation, interpretations of laws by courts, rulings by tax authorities, changes in estimates and the expiration of the statute of limitations. Many of the judgments involved in adjusting the liability involve assumptions and estimates that are highly uncertain and 39 Table of Contents subject to change. In this regard, settlement of any issue, or an adverse determination in litigation, with a taxing authority could require the use of cash and result in an increase in our annual tax rate. Conversely, favorable resolution of an issue with a taxing authority would be recognized as a reduction to our annual tax rate. New Accounting Pronouncements During the second quarter of 2012, the Company adopted new guidance on reporting and presentation of comprehensive income. The new guidance requires an entity to report comprehensive income either in a single continuous financial statement (together with components of net income) or in a separate financial statement immediately following the income statement. The Company elected to provide consolidated statements of income and consolidated statements of comprehensive income in two separate but consecutive statements. See the Consolidated Statements of Income, Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income and related Note 15 for additional information. The new requirements did not have an impact on the Company financial position, results of operations or cash flows. On July 27, 2012, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued new guidance to simplify how entities test indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment. The new guidance allows an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment test. The new pronouncement did not have any impact on the Company financial position, results of operations or cash flows. There have been no other accounting pronouncements issued but not yet adopted by the Company which are expected to have a material impact on the Company financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Accounting pronouncements that became effective during the twelve months ended December 31, 2012 did not require the Company to include additional financial statement disclosures and had no impact on the Company financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 40 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2012, 2011 AND 2010 The discussion of results of operations at the consolidated level presented below is followed by a more detailed discussion of results of operations by segment. The discussion of the Company consolidated results of operations and segment operating results is presented on a historical basis for the years ending December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010. The segment discussion also addresses certain product line information. The Company operating units are consistent with its reportable segments. Consolidated results 2012 compared to 2011 Net Sales Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2012 were $2,921.9 million, $172.6 million or approximately 6.3% above 2011 net sales. The components of the net sales increase are the following: Net Sales Consolidated December 31, 2012 Product volumes sold 6.3 % Pricing/Product mix (1.1 %) Foreign exchange rate fluctuations (0.8 %) Acquired product lines (1) 3.1 % Change in fiscal calendar (0.6 %) Sales in anticipation of information systems upgrade (0.6 %) Net Sales increase 6.3 % (1) On October 1, 2012, the Company acquired Avid Health. On June 28, 2011, the Company acquired BATISTE dry shampoo. Net sales of the acquired product lines subsequent to the acquisition are included in the Company results. (See Note 6 to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for further information.) The volume change primarily reflects increased sales of products in both Consumer Domestic and Consumer International, partially offset by unfavorable product mix and pricing primarily in Consumer Domestic. Sales in the first quarter of 2012 were negatively impacted due to a timing shift in customer orders from the first quarter of 2012 to the fourth quarter of 2011 in anticipation of the January 1, 2012 information systems upgrade in the U.S. Operating Costs The Company gross profit for 2012 was $1,291.4 million, a $76.9 million increase as compared to 2011. The gross profit increase was primarily attributable to higher sales volumes and contributions from the acquired product lines, in-house production of unit dose detergent and the Company new manufacturing and distribution facility in Victorville, California (the Victorville Facility ), partially offset by unfavorable pricing and mix, higher commodity costs that were partially offset by productivity improvement programs and the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange rates. Gross margin was 44.2% in 2012 as well as in 2011. Gross margin was favorably impacted by manufacturing cost reduction projects partially offset by higher commodity costs and an inventory step-up charge related to the Avid Health acquisition. Marketing expenses for 2012 were $357.3 million, an increase of $3.2 million as compared to 2011 due primarily to the effect of the acquired businesses, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange rates. Marketing expenses as a percentage of net sales were 12.2% in 2012 as compared to 12.9% in 2011. This reduction is due to a shift toward higher trade promotion spending, which is included in net sales, and partly due to the lower spending rate of the acquired Avid Health dietary supplements business. 41 Table of Contents Selling, general and administrative expenses ( SG&A ) expenses for 2012 were $389.0 million, an increase of $21.2 million as compared to 2011 due to costs associated with the Avid Health acquisition, higher costs for salaries and fringe benefits, costs associated with the Company new headquarter facility and unfavorable foreign exchange rates partially offset by lower legal expenses. Other Income and Expenses Equity in earnings of affiliates was $8.9 million as compared to $10.0 million in 2011. The decrease is primarily due to costs related to the start-up of the Natronx Technologies LLC ( Natronx ) joint venture. Interest expense in 2012 increased $5.3 million compared to 2011 primarily due to the debt incurred to purchase Avid Health. The Company issued $400 million of 2.875% Senior Notes and $250 million of commercial paper at the end of the third quarter of 2012. (See the Liquidity and capital resources below in this Management Discussion and Analysis for further information.) Taxation The 2012 tax rate was 35.5% as compared to 37.4% in 2011. The tax rate in 2012 was favorably affected by the settlement of a U.S Internal Revenue Service audit for the years 2008 and 2009 in the first quarter. The effective tax rate for 2011 included a charge for the establishment of a valuation allowance of approximately $13 million against the deferred tax assets of the Company Brazilian subsidiary, offset by a deferred income tax benefit of approximately $6 million relating to New Jersey corporate tax reform legislation enacted in April 2011. Consolidated results 2011 compared to 2010 Net Sales Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2011 were $2,749.3 million, $160.1 million or approximately 6.2% above 2010 net sales. The components of the net sales increase are the following: Net Sales Consolidated December 31, 2011 Product volumes sold 3.9 % Pricing/Product mix 0.2 % Foreign exchange rate fluctuations 1.0 % Change in customer delivery arrangements (0.2 %) Acquired product lines (1) 1.3 % Divested product lines (2) (0.1 %) Discontinued product line (0.8 %) Change in fiscal calendar 0.6 % Sales in anticipation of information systems upgrade 0.3 % Net Sales increase 6.2 % (1) On June 28, 2011, the Company acquired the BATISTE dry shampoo product line. The Company acquired the SIMPLY SALINE product line on June 4, 2010, and the FELINE PINE product line on December 21, 2010. Net sales of the acquired product lines subsequent to the acquisition are included in the Company results. (2) Product lines divested include the BRILLO and certain LAMBERT KAY product lines, which were divested in the first quarter of 2010. 42 Table of Contents The volume change reflects increased sales of consumer products sold in the Consumer Domestic and Consumer International segments. SPD volumes were unchanged. Pricing had minimal impact on total net sales, as favorable pricing for SPD was offset by the unfavorable pricing for Consumer Domestic and Consumer International. Sales in the fourth quarter of 2011 benefited from a timing shift in customer buying patterns from the first quarter of 2012 to the fourth quarter of 2011 in advance of the January 1, 2012 information system implementation in the U.S. The impact on Income before Income Taxes on these sales was not material. The discontinued product line reflects the Company decision in late 2010 to cease a foreign subsidiary sale of a certain chemical product line. The impact of the discontinued product line on Income before Income Taxes was not material. Other components of the net sales increase reflect the Company change in delivery arrangements with certain customers at the beginning of the second quarter of 2010, which resulted in a reduction in net sales due to a transportation allowance for a customer pick-up program. Previously, the cost to ship product was included in cost of sales. Operating Costs The Company gross profit was $1,214.5 million in 2011, a $56.7 million increase as compared to 2010. The gross profit increase was primarily attributable to higher sales volumes, contributions from the acquired product lines, slightly favorable pricing, the effect of cost reduction programs and favorable foreign exchange rates, partially offset by higher commodity costs and $3 million of charges associated with the decision to explore strategic alternatives for the chemical business in Brazil. Price increases for detergent and condoms mitigated a portion of the significant increases in the cost of resins, surfactants and latex. The 2010 gross profit includes charges for environmental remediation, asset impairment and plant shutdown costs of $7.6 million at the Company Brazil subsidiary. Gross margin decreased 50 basis points to 44.2% as compared to 44.7% in 2010. This decrease is principally due to higher commodity costs, an unfavorable product mix and higher trade promotion spending, partially offset by manufacturing cost reduction projects. Marketing expense for 2011 was $354.1 million, an increase of $16.1 million as compared to 2010. Marketing spending primarily was in support of the Company eight power brands, as well as expenses of the recently acquired product lines, BATISTE and FELINE PINE, and the effect of exchange rates. Marketing expenses as a percentage of sales was 12.9% in 2011 as compared to 13.1% in 2010. This reduction is due to a shift toward higher trade promotion spending, which is included in net sales. SG&A expenses were $367.8 million in 2011, a decrease of $7.0 million as compared to 2010. SG&A in 2010 included a $24 million charge related to the transfer and settlement of the Company U.S. pension plan obligations. Several components of the Company SG&A were higher in 2011 than in 2010, including higher legal expenses in 2011 related in part to the Company response to an FTC subpoena and defense of a related lawsuit, higher research and development expenses, transition and amortization expense related to the product lines acquired in 2010 and 2011 and the effect of foreign exchange rates, partially offset by lower incentive compensation costs and a gain on the sale of certain LAMBERT KAY product lines in 2010. Other Income and Expenses In 2011, equity in earnings of affiliates was $10.0 million as compared to $5.0 million in 2010. The increase is due to higher equity income from the Company Armand Products Company joint venture primarily as a result of lower costs of a key raw material. Other expense was approximately $1.2 million in 2011 as compared to other expense of $4.6 million in 2010, which reflects the 2010 write-off of approximately $4.5 million of unamortized deferred financing costs associated with the Company prepayment of variable and subordinated debt. (See the Liquidity and capital resources below in this Management Discussion and Analysis for further information.) Interest expense for 2011 decreased $19.1 million compared to 2010. The decline was due to lower average debt outstanding as a result of the Company repayment of debt at the end of 2010, refinancing of its bond debt 43 Table of Contents and the reversal of interest accruals following the settlement of a state tax audit. The 2010 amount includes a $3.0 million reversal of interest accruals associated with certain tax reserves following the settlement of a U.S. Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) audit and the lapse of applicable statues of limitations, which was offset by a $4.3 million charge associated with the termination of the Company interest rate collar and interest swap agreements. Investment earnings of $1.9 million were higher than in 2010 due to interest received on a federal tax refund and higher investment returns primarily at the Company international subsidiaries. Taxation The 2011 tax rate was 37.4% as compared to 35.3% in 2010. The effective tax rate for 2011 included a charge for the establishment of a valuation allowance of approximately $13 million against the deferred tax assets of the Company Brazilian subsidiary, offset by a deferred income tax benefit of approximately $6 million relating to New Jersey corporate tax reform legislation enacted in April 2011. The effective tax rate for 2010 included a benefit from an increase in the U.S. manufacturing tax deduction and the reversal of approximately $4.1 million associated with certain tax liabilities following the settlement of an IRS audit and the lapse of applicable statutes of limitations. Segment results for 2012, 2011 and 2010 The Company operates three reportable segments: Consumer Domestic, Consumer International and SPD. These segments are determined based on differences in the nature of products and organizational and ownership structures. The results of the Avid Health acquisition are reflected in the Consumer Domestic segment. The Company also has a Corporate segment. Segment Products Consumer Domestic Household and personal care products Consumer International Primarily personal care products SPD Specialty chemical products The Corporate segment income consists of equity in earnings (losses) of affiliates. The Company had 50% ownership interests in Armand Products Company ( Armand ), The ArmaKleen Company ( ArmaKleen ), and a one-third ownership interest in Natronx Technologies, LLC ( Natronx ) as of December 31, 2012. The Company equity in earnings or losses of Armand, ArmaKleen and Natronx for the twelve months ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, are included in the Corporate segment. Some of the subsidiaries that are included in the Consumer International segment manufacture and sell personal care products to the Consumer Domestic segment. These sales are eliminated from the Consumer International segment results set forth below. Segment Net Sales and Income Before Income Taxes for each of the three years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 were as follows: (In millions) Consumer Domestic Consumer International SPD Corporate (3) Total Net Sales (1) 2012 $ 2,156.9 $ 510.1 $ 254.9 $ 0.0 $ 2,921.9 2011 1,979.1 509.1 261.1 0.0 2,749.3 2010 1,886.1 444.0 259.1 0.0 2,589.2 Income Before Income Taxes (2) 2012 $ 428.8 $ 71.0 $ 33.8 $ 8.9 $ 542.5 2011 386.0 68.9 29.7 10.0 494.6 2010 341.9 52.6 18.8 5.0 418.3 44 Table of Contents (1) Intersegment sales from Consumer International to Consumer Domestic, which are not reflected in the table, were $3.4 million, $5.2 million and $3.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. (2) In determining Income Before Income Taxes, interest expense, investment earnings, and other income (expense) were allocated among the segments based upon each segment relative Income from Operations. (3) Corporate segment consists of equity in earnings (loss) of affiliates from Armand, Armakleen and Natronx. Product line revenues for external customers for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 were as follows: (In millions) 2012 2011 2010 Household Products $ 1,411.3 $ 1,295.0 $ 1,207.4 Personal Care Products 745.6 684.1 678.7 Total Consumer Domestic 2,156.9 1,979.1 1,886.1 Total Consumer International 510.1 509.1 444.0 Total SPD 254.9 261.1 259.1 Total Consolidated Net Sales $ 2,921.9 $ 2,749.3 $ 2,589.2 Consumer Domestic 2012 compared to 2011 Consumer Domestic net sales in 2012 were $2,156.9 million, an increase of $177.8 million or 9.0 % compared to net sales of $1,979.1 million in 2011. The components of the net sales change are the following: Net Sales Consumer Domestic December 31, 2012 Product volumes sold 8.2 % Pricing/Product mix (1.9 %) Acquired product lines (1) 3.5 % Sales in anticipation of information systems upgrade (0.8 %) Net Sales increase 9.0 % (1) On October 1, 2012, the Company acquired Avid Health. Net sales of acquired product lines subsequent to the acquisition are included in the Company segment results. (See Note 6 to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for further information.) The increase in net sales reflects sales from the Avid Health acquisition and higher sales of ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry detergent, XTRA liquid laundry detergent, ARM & HAMMER cat litter, OXICLEAN laundry additives and the recently introduced ARM & HAMMER CRYSTAL BURST unit dose laundry detergent. These increases were partially offset by lower sales of ARM & HAMMER powder laundry detergent, SPINBRUSH battery-operated toothbrushes, ANSWER diagnostic kits and ARRID deodorant. Sales in the first quarter of 2012 were negatively impacted due to a timing shift in customer orders from the first quarter of 2012 to the fourth quarter of 2011 in anticipation of the January 1, 2012 information systems upgrade in the U.S. Consumer Domestic income before income taxes for 2012 was $428.8 million, a $42.8 million increase as compared to 2011. The increase is due primarily to the impact of higher sales volumes, partially offset by the effect of unfavorable product mix and pricing and higher SG&A costs. Higher commodity and manufacturing costs were largely offset by productivity gains. The Avid Health acquisition did not impact income before income taxes due to an inventory step-up charge and interest expense offsetting the operating income of the business. 45 Table of Contents 2011 compared to 2010 Consumer Domestic net sales in 2011 were $1,979.1 million, an increase of $93.0 million or 4.9% compared to net sales of $1,886.1 million in 2010. The components of the net sales change are the following: Net Sales Consumer Domestic December 31, 2011 Product volumes sold 4.4 % Pricing/Product mix (0.7 %) Change in customer delivery arrangements (0.3 %) Acquired product lines (1) 1.3 % Divested product lines (2) (0.2 %) Sales in anticipation of information systems upgrade 0.4 % Net Sales increase 4.9 % (1) On June 4, 2010, the Company acquired the SIMPLY SALINE product line, and in late December 2010, acquired the FELINE PINE product line. Net sales of acquired product lines subsequent to the acquisition are included in the Company segment results. (See Note 6 to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for further information.) (2) Product lines divested included the BRILLO and certain LAMBERT KAY product lines, which were divested in the first quarter of 2010. Higher sales of ARM & HAMMER liquid and powder laundry detergent, XTRA liquid laundry detergent, ARM & HAMMER SUPER SCOOP cat litter, and sales of acquired product lines were offset by lower sales of OXICLEAN laundry additives, ARM & HAMMER DENTAL CARE and other toothpaste products. Consumer Domestic income before income taxes for 2011 was $386.0 million, a $44.2 million increase as compared to 2010. The 2011 increase is due to the impact of higher product volumes sold, the net effect of acquisitions and divestitures, and lower allocated interest expense, partially offset by higher commodity costs and higher trade promotion expenses. In addition, the 2011 increase reflects lower SG&A, primarily because 2010 SG&A included a charge related to the settlement of the Company U.S. pension plan obligations. Consumer International 2012 compared to 2011 Consumer International net sales in 2012 were $510.1 million, an increase of $1.0 million or 0.2% as compared to 2011. The components of the net sales change are the following: Net Sales Consumer International December 31, 2012 Product volumes sold 3.9 % Pricing/Product mix (0.6 %) Foreign exchange rate fluctuations (3.3 %) Acquired product lines (1) 3.1 % Change in fiscal calendar (2) (2.9 %) Net Sales increase 0.2 % (1) On June 28, 2011, the Company acquired BATISTE dry shampoo. Net sales of this product line subsequent to the acquisition are included in the Company segment results. (See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for further information.) (2) Beginning in 2012, the Company changed to a calendar year reporting basis. To facilitate this change, the fourth quarter of 2011 included an additional period of reporting for those three subsidiaries outside of North America that previously reported one month prior to period presented. This change increased 2011 net sales by $14.3 million and had a nominal impact on net income for 2011. 46 Table of Contents Higher sales volumes in 2012 occurred principally in Canada, United Kingdom and France. Higher U.S. exports also contributed to the sales increase. The Batiste acquisition contributed a full year of sales as compared to six months in 2011. Consumer International income before income taxes was $71.0 million in 2012, an increase of $2.1 million compared to 2011. Higher profits are attributable to higher sales volume and contribution from the Batiste acquisition, partially offset by higher commodity costs, unfavorable pricing and product mix and unfavorable foreign exchange rates. 2011 compared to 2010 Consumer International net sales in 2011 were $509.1 million, an increase of $65.1 million or 14.7% as compared to 2010. The components of the net sales change are the following: Net Sales Consumer International December 31, 2011 Product volumes sold 4.3 % Pricing/Product mix (0.2 %) Foreign exchange rate fluctuations 5.4 % Acquired product lines (1) 2.0 % Divested products (2) (0.1 %) Change in fiscal calendar (3) 3.3 % Sales in anticipation of information systems upgrade 0.0 % Net Sales increase 14.7 % (1) On June 28, 2011, the Company acquired the BATISTE dry shampoo product line Net sales of this product line subsequent to the acquisition are included in the Company segment results. (See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for further information.) (2) Product lines divested included the BRILLO and certain LAMBERT KAY product lines, which were divested in the first quarter of 2010. (3) Beginning in 2012, the Company quarterly periods changed to a calendar year reporting basis. To facilitate this change, the fourth quarter of 2011 included an additional period of reporting for those three subsidiaries outside of North America that used to report one month prior to period presented. This change resulted in increasing 2011 net sales by $14.3 million or 3.3% and had a nominal impact on net income for the year. Higher sales volumes in Canada, Australia, and Mexico, as well as higher U.S. exports, contributed to the sales increase. Consumer International income before income taxes was $68.9 million in 2011, an increase of $16.3 million compared to 2010. Higher profits are attributable to the higher sales volume, the effect of foreign exchange rates and lower allocated interest expense, partially offset by unfavorable pricing and sales mix and higher shipping costs. The additional fiscal period did not have a material effect on income before taxes. 47 Table of Contents Specialty Products 2012 compared to 2011 SPD net sales were $254.9 million for 2012, a decrease of $6.2 million, or 2.4% as compared to 2011. The components of the net sales change are the following: Net Sales SPD December 31, 2012 Product volumes sold (3.1 %) Pricing/Product mix 3.9 % Foreign exchange rate fluctuations (2.4 %) Sales in anticipation of information systems upgrade (0.8 %) Net Sales increase (2.4 %) The sales volume decrease in 2012 reflects reduced product sales of certain animal nutrition products, partially offset by higher pricing. The reduction in net sales is also due to unfavorable foreign exchange rates and the adverse impact in the first quarter of 2012 of a timing shift in customer orders from the first quarter of 2012 to the fourth quarter of 2011 in anticipation of the January 1, 2012 information systems upgrade in the U.S. SPD income before income taxes was $33.8 million in 2012, an increase of $4.2 million as compared to 2011. The increase in the income before income taxes for 2012 primarily reflects higher selling prices partially offset by lower sales volume, higher raw material costs of certain animal nutrition and performance products and foreign exchange rates. 2011 compared to 2010 SPD net sales were $261.1 million for 2011, an increase of $2.0 million, or 0.8% as compared to 2010. The components of the net sales change are the following: Net Sales SPD December 31, 2011 Product volumes sold (0.3 %) Pricing/Product mix 7.7 % Foreign exchange rate fluctuations 0.8 % Divested product lines (1) (0.1 %) Discontinued product line (7.7 %) Sales in anticipation of information systems upgrade 0.4 % Net Sales increase 0.8 % (1) Product lines divested include the BRILLO product line, which was divested in the first quarter of 2010. The pricing increase in 2011 reflects higher sales prices in response to raw material increases primarily in the animal nutrition and performance products businesses. The sales volume decrease reflects lower U.S. exports. The discontinued product line reflects the Company decision in late 2010 to cease a foreign subsidiary sale of a certain chemical product line. SPD income before income taxes for 2011 was $29.7 million, an increase of $10.9 million as compared to 2010. The increase in income in 2011 reflects the profits on higher net sales and lower allocated interest expense partially offset by higher raw material costs. Income before taxes in 2011 also includes $3.0 million in charges associated with the Company decision to exit the chemical business in Brazil. Income before Taxes in 2010 includes expenses of $9.7 million associated with an increase in environmental reserves of $4.9 million and an impairment and plant shutdown charge of $4.8 million, both related to the Company Brazilian subsidiary. Cost of sales in 2010 includes $7.6 million of these charges and SG&A includes the remaining $2.1 million. 48 Table of Contents Liquidity and capital resources As of December 31, 2012, the Company had $343.0 million in cash, approximately $250 million available through its revolving credit facility under its principal credit agreement (the Credit Agreement ) and its commercial paper program, and a commitment increase feature under the Credit Agreement that enables the Company to borrow up to an additional $500 million, subject to lending commitments of the participating lenders and certain conditions as described in the Credit Agreement. To preserve its liquidity, the Company invests its cash primarily in prime money market funds. As of December 31, 2012, the amount of cash and cash equivalents, included in the Company consolidated cash, that was held by foreign subsidiaries was approximately $168.2 million. If these funds are needed for operations in the U.S. the Company will be required to accrue and pay taxes in the U.S. to repatriate these funds. However, the Company intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside the U.S., and the Company does not currently expect to repatriate them to fund operations in the U.S. On September 26, 2012, the Company closed an underwritten public offering of $400 million aggregate principal amount of 2.875% Senior Notes (the 2022 Notes ). The 2022 Notes were issued under the second supplemental indenture (the Second Supplemental Indenture ), dated September 26, 2012, to the indenture dated December 15, 2010, between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee. Interest on the 2022 Notes is payable semi-annually, beginning April 1, 2013. The 2022 Notes will mature on October 1, 2022, unless earlier retired or redeemed pursuant to the terms of the Second Supplemental Indenture. The Company used $250 million from commercial paper issuances, along with the $400 million of 2022 Notes and cash, to purchase Avid Health on October 1, 2012. These amounts remain outstanding as of December 31, 2012. On December 15, 2010, the Company completed an underwritten public offering of $250 million aggregate principal amount of 3.35% senior notes due 2015 (the 2015 Notes ). The 2015 Notes were issued under (the Base Indenture ), and a first supplemental indenture (the First Supplemental Indenture ), dated December 15, 2010, between the Company and BNY Mellon, as trustee. On December 30, 2010, the proceeds of the offering were utilized to retire the outstanding $250 million principal amount of the Company 6% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2012. Interest on the 2015 Notes is payable on June 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning June 15, 2011. The 2015 Notes will mature on December 15, 2015, unless earlier retired or redeemed as described below. The current economic environment presents risks that could have adverse consequences for the Company liquidity. (See Unfavorable economic conditions could adversely affect demand for our products under Risk Factors in Item 1A of this Annual Report.) The Company does not anticipate that current economic conditions will adversely affect its ability to comply with the financial covenants in its principal credit facility because the Company currently is, and anticipates that it will continue to be, in compliance with the minimum interest coverage ratio requirement and the maximum leverage ratio requirement under the Credit Agreement. These financial ratios are discussed in more detail in this section under Certain Financial Covenants. On February 1, 2012, the Board of Directors increased the Company regular quarterly dividend from $0.17 per share to $0.24 per share, equivalent to an annual dividend rate of $0.96 per share. The higher dividend raised the Company annualized dividend payout from approximately $97 million to approximately $135 million. On January 30, 2013, the Board of Directors again increased the Company regular quarterly dividend from $0.24 per share to $0.28 per share, equivalent to an annual dividend rate of $1.12 per share, commencing with the dividend payable on March 1, 2013 to stockholders of record at the close of business on February 15, 2013. The higher dividend raises the Company annualized dividend payout from approximately $135 million to approximately $156 million. On October 31, 2012, the Company Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program, under which the Company may purchase up to an additional $300 million of the Company common stock. Under the 49 Table of Contents new program, shares may be repurchased from time to time in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise, subject to market conditions, and corporate and legal requirements. There is no expiration date on the stock repurchase authorization and the Company is not obligated to acquire any specific number of shares. The previous share repurchase program announced in August 2011 had an authorization of $300 million, $20 million of which remained available on October 31, 2012. In 2012, the Company purchased approximately 5 million shares at an aggregate cost of approximately $250 million under both programs. As of December 31, 2012, the Company had used the full $300 million authorized under the August 2011 program, and had $270 million remaining available for use under the October 2012 program. In January 2013, the Company purchased an additional 0.9 million shares at an aggregate cost of approximately $50 million. As of the filing date of this Annual Report, the Company has made no additional purchases in 2013 and has approximately $220 million remaining for use in the repurchase of the Company shares. The Company anticipates that its cash from operations, together with its current borrowing capacity, will be sufficient to meet its capital expenditure program costs, which are expected to be approximately $85 million in 2013, fund its stock repurchase program to the extent implemented by management and pay dividends at the latest approved rate. The Company did not have any mandatory fixed rate debt principal payments in 2012 and will not have any in 2013. Cash may be used for acquisitions that would complement the Company existing product lines or geographic markets. Net Debt The Company had outstanding total debt of $903.2 million and cash of $343.0 million at December 31, 2012, resulting in net debt of $560.2 million at December 31, 2012. This compares to total debt of $252.3 million and cash of $251.4 million, resulting in net debt of $0.9 million at December 31, 2011. Net debt is defined as cash less total debt. Cash Flow Analysis Year Ending December 31, (In millions) 2012 2011 2010 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 523.6 $ 437.8 $ 428.5 Net cash used in investing activities $ (741.3 ) $ (147.8 ) $ (180.4 ) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities $ 305.2 $ (226.5 ) $ (503.7 ) Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities The Company net cash provided by operating activities in 2012 increased $85.8 million to $523.6 million as compared to 2011. The increase was primarily due to an improvement in working capital. Working capital was favorably impacted due to the deferral of the Company fourth quarter 2012 federal tax payment of approximately $36.0 million as allowed by the IRS due to the impact of Hurricane Sandy, contributions from the Avid Health acquisition and smaller increases in accounts receivable due to the timing of cash collections. Net Cash Used in Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities during 2012 was $741.3 million, reflecting the $652.3 million acquisition of Avid Health, $74.5 million of property, plant and equipment expenditures, relating in part to the Victorville Facility, and a $13.7 million investment in Natronx. Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities during 2012 was $305.2 million, principally reflecting $399.6 million of 2022 Notes (net of discount), and $250.0 million of commercial paper issued in connection with the acquisition of Avid Health, $42.6 million of proceeds and tax benefits from stock option exercises, partially offset by $250.4 million of common stock repurchases, $134.5 million of cash dividends and deferred financing costs of $3.4 million. 50 Table of Contents Certain Financial Covenants Consolidated EBITDA (referred to below as Adjusted EBITDA ) is a component of the financial covenants contained in, and is defined in, the Company Credit Agreement. Financial covenants include a leverage ratio (total debt to Adjusted EBITDA) and an interest coverage ratio (Adjusted EBITDA to total interest expense), which if not met, could result in an event of default and trigger the early termination of the Credit Agreement. Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities, which is determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The Company leverage ratio for the twelve months ended December 31, 2012 was 1.4, which is below the maximum of 3.5 permitted under the Credit Agreement, and the interest coverage ratio for the twelve months ending December 31, 2012 was 72.0, which is above the minimum of 3.0 permitted under the Credit Agreement. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for further information relating to the Credit Agreement. The reconciliation of Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities (the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure) to Adjusted EBITDA for 2012 is as follows: (In millions) Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities $ 523.6 Interest paid 9.7 Current Income Tax Provision 179.5 Excess Tax Benefit on Stock Options Exercised 14.6 Change in Working Capital and Other Liabilities (75.4 ) Adjustments for Significant Acquisitions 46.8 Adjusted EBITDA (per Credit Agreement) $ 698.8 Commitments as of December 31, 2012 The table below summarizes the Company material contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2012.

(2) Letters of credit with several banks guarantee payment for items such as insurance claims in the event of the Company sinsolvency and one year of rent on a warehouse. Performance bonds are principally for required municipal property improvements. 51 Table of Contents (3) Pension contributions are based on actuarial assessments of government regulated employer funding requirements. These requirements are not projected beyond one year since they fluctuate with the change in plan assets, assumptions and demographics. (4) The Company has outstanding purchase obligations with suppliers at the end of 2012 for raw, packaging and other materials and services in the normal course of business. These purchase obligation amounts represent only those items which are based on agreements that are enforceable and legally binding, and do not represent total anticipated purchases. (5) Other includes stadium naming rights for a period of 20 years until December 2032. The Company has excluded from the table above uncertain tax liabilities due to the uncertainty of the amount per period of payment. As of December 31, 2012, the Company has gross uncertain tax liabilities, including interest, of $9.6 million. (See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report). Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company does not have off-balance sheet financing or unconsolidated special purpose entities. OTHER ITEMS Market risk Concentration of Risk A group of three customers accounted for approximately 34%, 33% and 33% of consolidated net sales in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, of which a single customer (Wal-Mart Stores, Inc and its affiliates) accounted for approximately 24%, 23% and 23% in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Interest Rate Risk The Company had outstanding total debt at December 31, 2012 of $903.2 million, of which 72% has a fixed weighted average interest rate of 3.06% and the remaining 28% constituted principally commercial paper issued by the Company that currently has an interest rate of less than 0.5%. The Company periodically considers entering into hedge agreements to mitigate the interest rate risk. Diesel Fuel Hedge The Company uses independent freight carriers to deliver its products. These carriers charge the Company a basic rate per mile that is subject to a mileage surcharge for diesel fuel price increases. During 2012, the Company entered into hedge agreements with financial counterparties to mitigate the volatility of diesel fuel prices and related fuel surcharges, and not to speculate in the future price of diesel fuel. Under the hedge agreements, the Company agreed to pay a fixed price per gallon of diesel fuel determined at the time the agreements were executed and to receive a floating rate payment reflecting the variable common carriers mileage surcharge. The floating rate payment is determined on a monthly basis based on the average price of the Department of Energy Diesel Fuel Index price during the applicable month and is designed to offset any increase or decrease in fuel surcharge payments that the Company pays to it common carriers. The agreements are expected to cover approximately 45% of the Company estimated diesel fuel requirements for 2013 and approximately 17% of the Company estimated diesel fuel requirements for 2014. These agreements qualify for hedge accounting. Therefore, changes in the fair value of diesel fuel hedge agreements are recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income on the balance sheet. 52 Table of Contents Foreign Currency The Company is subject to exposure from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily U.S. Dollar/Euro, U.S. Dollar/British Pound, U.S. Dollar/Canadian Dollar, U.S. Dollar/Mexican Peso, U.S. Dollar/Australian Dollar, U.S. Dollar/Brazilian Real and U.S. Dollar/Chinese Yuan. The Company, from time to time, enters into forward exchange contracts to reduce the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations related to anticipated but not yet committed intercompany sales or purchases denominated in the U.S. Dollar, Canadian Dollar, British Pound and Euro. The Company entered into forward exchange contracts to protect it from the risk that, due to changes in currency exchange rates, it would be adversely affected by net cash outflows. The face value of the unexpired contracts as of December 31, 2012 totaled $34.7 million. The contracts qualified as foreign currency cash flow hedges, and, therefore, changes in the fair value of the contracts were recorded in Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) and reclassified to earnings when the hedged transaction affected earnings. Equity Derivatives The Company has entered into equity derivative contracts covering its own stock in order to minimize its liability, resulting from changes in quoted fair values of Company stock, to participants in its Executive Deferred Compensation Plan who have investments under that plan in a notional Company stock fund. The contracts are settled in cash. Since the equity derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting, the Company is required to mark the agreements to market throughout the life of the agreements and record changes in fair value in the consolidated statement of income.
