Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A ) is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our audited consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes presented in Item 8, Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Note references are to the notes to consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. All references to net earnings per share are to diluted net earnings per share. Amounts and percentages may not total due to rounding. BUSINESS OVERVIEW General CarMax is the nation largest retailer of used vehicles. We operate in two reportable segments: CarMax Sales Operations and CarMax Auto Finance ( CAF ). Our CarMax Sales Operations segment consists of all aspects of our auto merchandising and service operations, excluding financing provided by CAF. Our CAF segment consists solely of our own finance operation that provides vehicle financing through CarMax superstores. We pioneered the used car superstore concept, opening our first store in 1993. Our strategy is to revolutionize the auto retailing market by addressing the major sources of customer dissatisfaction with traditional auto retailers and to maximize operating efficiencies through the use of standardized operating procedures and store formats enhanced by sophisticated, proprietary management information systems. As of February 28, 2014, we operated 131 used car superstores in 64 markets, comprising 46 mid-sized markets, 1 5 large markets and 3 small markets. We define mid-sized markets as those with television viewing populations generally between 600,000 and 2.5 million people. We also operated four new car franchises. During fiscal 2014, we sold 526,929 used cars, representing 9 9 % of the total 534,690 v ehicles we sold at retail. We believe the CarMax consumer offer is distinctive within the auto retailing marketplace. Our offer provides customers the opportunity to shop for vehicles the same way they shop for items at other big box retailers. Our consumer offer features low, no-haggle prices; a broad selection of CarMax Quality Certified used vehicles; and superior customer service. Our website, carmax.com, and related mobile apps are valuable tools for communicating the CarMax consumer offer, as well as sophisticated search engines and efficient channels for customers who prefer to start their shopping online. Our financial results are driven by retailing used vehicles and associated items including vehicle financing, extended service plans ( ESPs ), a guaranteed asset protection ( GAP ) product and vehicle repair service . GAP is designed to cover the unpaid balance on an auto loan in the event of a total loss of the vehicle or unrecovered theft. We seek to build customer satisfaction by offering high-quality vehicles. Fewer than half of the vehicles acquired from consumers through the appraisal purchase process meet our standards for reconditioning and subsequent retail sale. Those vehicles that do not meet our standards are sold through on-site wholesale auctions. Vehicles repossessed and liquidated by CAF are also generally sold through our wholesale auctions. Wholesale auctions are generally held on a weekly or bi-weekly basis, and as of February 28, 2014, we conducted auctions at 60 used car superstores. During fiscal 2014, we sold 342,576 wholesale vehicles. On average, the vehicles we wholesale are approximately 10 years old and have more than 100,000 miles. Participation in our wholesale auctions is restricted to licensed automobile dealers, the majority of whom are independent dealers and licensed wholesalers. We sell ESPs and GAP on behalf of unrelated third parties who are the primary obligors. As of February 28, 201 4 , the used vehicle third-party ESP providers were CNA National Warranty Corporation and The Warranty Group, and the third-party GAP provider was Safe-Guard Products International, LLC. ESP revenue represents commissions earned on the sale of ESPs and GAP from the unrelated third parties. We provide financing to qualified retail customers through CAF and our arrangements with several industry-leading financial institutions. As of February 28, 2014, these third parties included Santander Consumer USA, Wells Fargo Dealer Services, Capital One Auto Finance, American Credit Acceptance, Westlake Financial Services and Exeter Finance Corp . Depending on the credit profile of the customer, the third-party finance providers generally either pay us or are paid a fixed, pre-negotiated fee per contract. The fee amount is independent of any finance term offered to the customer; it does not vary based on the amount financed, the term of the loan, the interest rate or the loan-to-value ratio. We refer to the third-party providers who pay us a fee as prime and nonprime providers, and we refer to the providers to whom we pay a fee as subprime providers. We have no recourse liability for credit losses on retail installment contracts arranged with third-party providers . 24 We offer financing through CAF to qualified customers purchasing vehicles at CarMax. CAF utilizes proprietary customized scoring models based upon the credit history of the customer, along with CAF historical experience, to predict the likelihood of customer repayment. CAF offers customers an array of competitive rates and terms, allowing them to choose the ones that best fit their needs. In addition, customers are permitted to refinance or pay off their contract with CAF or a third-party provider within three business days of a purchase without incurring any finance or related charges. We randomly test different credit offers and closely monitor acceptance rates, 3-day payoffs and the effect on sales to assess market competitiveness. After the effect of 3-day payoffs and vehicle returns, CAF financed 41% of our retail vehicle unit sales in fiscal 2014. As of February 28, 2014, CAF serviced approximately 532,000 customer accounts in its $7.18 billion portfolio of managed receivables. Over the long term, we believe the primary driver for earnings growth will be vehicle unit sales growth from both new stores and stores included in our comparable store base. We also believe that increased used vehicle unit sales will drive increased sales of wholesale vehicles and ancillary products and, over time, increased CAF income. We target a dollar range of gross profit per used unit sold. The gross profit dollar target for an individual vehicle is based on a variety of factors, including its probability of sale and its mileage relative to its age; however, it is not primarily based on the vehicle selling price . In December 2008, we temporarily suspended store growth due to the weak economic and sales environment. We resumed store growth in fiscal 2011, opening 3 superstores in that year, 5 superstores in fiscal 2012, 10 superstores in fiscal 2013 and 13 superstores in fiscal 2014. We currently plan to open 13 superstores in fiscal 2015 and between 10 and 15 superstores in each of the following two fiscal years . While we currently have more than 130 superstores, we are still in the midst of the national rollout of our retail concept, and as of February 2 8 , 201 4 , we had used car superstores located in markets that comprised approximately 57% of the U.S. population. The principal challenges we face in expanding our store base include our ability to hire qualified associates and build our management bench strength to support our store growth, and our ability to procure suitable real estate at favorable terms. We staff each newly opened store with associates who have extensive CarMax training . Therefore, w e must recruit, train and develop managers and associates to fill the pipeline necessary to support future store openings. Fiscal 2014 Highlights Net sales and operating revenues increased 1 5 % to $1 2.57 billion from $10. 96 billion in fiscal 201 3 . Net earnings grew 13 % to $ 492.6 million from $ 434.3 million in fiscal 2013, while net earnings per diluted share grew 16% to $2.16, compared with $1. 87 in the prior year . Used vehicle revenues increased 18 % to $ 10.31 billion versus $ 8 . 75 billion in fiscal 201 3 . U sed vehicle unit sales rose 1 8 %, reflecting the combination of a 12 % increase in comparable store used unit sales and sales from newer stores not yet included in the comparable store base. W holesale vehicle revenues increased 4 % to $1. 82 billion versus $1.7 6 billion in fiscal 201 3 . Wholesale vehicle unit sales increased 5 %, primarily due to the growth in our store base . Other sales and revenues declined 6% to $232.6 million from $248.6 million in fiscal 2013, reflecting a reduction in net third-party finance fees and only modest growth in ESP revenue. During fiscal 2014, we corrected our accounting related to cancellation reserves for ESP and GAP, with resulting increases in reserves related to activity for fiscal 2014, fiscal 2013, and fiscal 2012. The increase in the cancellation reserve s largely offset the growth in ESP revenues resulting from our increase in used unit sales and a higher ESP penetration rate. Total gross profit increased 13 % to $1. 65 billion compared with $1. 46 billion in fiscal 201 3 , primarily reflecting the increase d sales of used vehicles . Selling, general and administrative ( SG&A ) expenses rose 1 2 % to $1. 16 billion from $ 1.03 b illion in fiscal 201 3 . The increase reflected the 11 % increase in our store base during fiscal 201 4 (representing the addition of 1 3 stores) and higher variable selling costs resulting from the 12 % increase in comparable store used unit sales . SG&A per retail unit declined $102 to $2,161 versus $2,263 in fiscal 2013, as our comparable store used unit sales growth generated overhead leverage . CAF income increased 12 % to $ 336.2 million compared with $2 99.3 million in fiscal 201 3 . The improvement resulted from a 23% increase in average managed receivables, partially offset by a lower total interest margin rate, which declined to 6.9% of average managed receivables from 7.4% in fiscal 2013. The allowance for loan losses as a percent of ending managed receivables remained consistent at 0.97% as of the end of both fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013. Net cash used in operating activities totaled $6 13.2 million in fiscal 201 4 compared with $ 778.4 million in fiscal 201 3 . These amounts include d increases in auto loan receivables of $ 1.32 b illion and $ 992.2 million, 25 respectively. The majority of the increases in auto loan receivables are accompanied by increases in non-recourse notes payable, which are reflected as cash provided by financing activities. Excluding the increases in auto loan receivables, net cash provided by operating activities would have been $711.0 million in fiscal 2014 versus $213.8 million in fiscal 2013, with the increase primarily driven by changes in inventory, accounts payable and net income. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Our results of operations and financial condition as reflected in the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We use our historical experience and other relevant factors when developing our estimates and assumptions. We regularly evaluate these estimates and assumptions. Note 2 includes a discussion of significant accounting policies. The accounting policies discussed below are the ones we consider critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on our judgment. Our financial results might have been different if different assumptions had been used or other conditions had prevailed. Financing and Securitization Transactions We maintain a revolving securitization program composed of two warehouse facilities ( warehouse facilities ) that we use to fund auto loan receivables originated by CAF until we elect to fund them through a term securitization or alternative funding arrangement. We recognize transfers of auto loan receivables into the warehouse facilities and term securitizations as secured borrowings, which result in recording the auto loan receivables and the related non-recourse notes payable on our consolidated balance sheets. CAF income included in the consolidated statements of earnings primarily reflects the interest and fee income generated by the auto loan receivables less the interest expense associated with the debt issued to fund these receivables, a provision for estimated loan losses and direct CAF expenses . Auto loan receivables include amounts due from customers related to retail vehicle sales financed through CAF. The receivables are presented net of an allowance for estimated loan losses. The allowance for loan losses represents an estimate of the amount of net losses inherent in our portfolio of managed receivables as of the applicable reporting date and anticipated to occur during the following 12 months. The allowance is primarily based on the credit quality of the underlying receivables, historical loss trends and forecasted forward loss curves. We also take into account recent trends in delinquencies and losses, recovery rates and the economic environment. The provision for loan losses is the periodic expense of maintaining an adequate allowance. Se e Notes 2(F), 2(I) and 4 for additional inf ormation on securitizations and auto loan receivables. Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue when the earnings process is complete, generally either at the time of sale to a customer or upon delivery to a customer. As part of our customer service strategy, we guarantee the retail vehicles we sell with a 5 day, money-back guarantee. We record a reserve for estimated returns based on historical experience and trends , and results could be affected if future vehicle returns differ from historical averages. We also sell ESPs and GAP on behalf of unrelated third parties , who are the primary obligors, to customers who purchase a vehicle. The ESPs we offer on all used vehicles provide coverage up to 72 months (subject to mileage limitations), while GAP covers the customer for the term of their finance contract. We recognize commission revenue at the time of sale, net of a reserve for estimated customer cancellations. Periodically, we may receive additional commissions based upon the level of underwriting profits of the third parties who administer the products. These additional commissions are recognized as revenue when received. The reserve for cancellations is evaluated for each product, and is based on forecasted forward cancellation curves utilizing historical experience, recent trends and credit mix of the customer base. Our risk related to customer cancellations is limited to the commissions that we receive. Cancellations fluctuate depending on the volume of ESP and GAP sales, customer financing default or prepayment rates, and shifts in customer behavior related to changes in the coverage or term of the product. Results could be affected if actual events differ from our estimates. A 10% change in the estimated cancellation rates would have changed cancellation reserves by approximately $ 7.2 million as of February 28, 2014. See Note 8 for additional information on cancellation reserves. Customers applying for financing who are not approved by CAF may be evaluated by other financial institutions. Depending on the credit profile of the customer, third-party finance providers generally either pay us or are paid a fixed, pre-negotiated fee per contract. We recognize these fees at the time of sale. 26 We collect sales taxes and other taxes from customers on behalf of governmental authorities at the time of sale. These taxes are accounted for on a net basis and are not included in net sales and operating revenues or cost of sales. Income Taxes Estimates and judgments are used in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets. In the ordinary course of business, transactions occur for which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain at the time of the transactions. We adjust our income tax provision in the period in which we determine that it is probable that our actual results will differ from our estimates. Tax law and rate changes are reflected in the income tax provision in the period in which such changes are enacted . See Note 9 for additional information on income taxes. We evaluate the need to record valuation allowances that would reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that will more likely than not be realized. When assessing the need for valuation allowances, we consider available carrybacks, future reversals of existing temporary differences and future taxable income. Except for a valuation allowance recorded for capital loss carryforwards that may not be utilized before their expiration, we believe that our recorded deferred tax assets as of February 28, 2014, will more likely than not be realized. However, if a change in circumstances results in a change in our ability to realize our deferred tax assets, our tax provision would be affected in the period when the change in circumstances occurs. In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. If payments of these amounts ultimately prove to be unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. If our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, a further charge to expense would result in the period of determination.

Comparable Store Used Vehicle Sales Changes Years Ended February 28 or 29 2014 2013 2012 Used vehicle units 12 % 5 % 1 % Used vehicle dollars 12 % 7 % 7 % Wholesale Vehicle Sales Changes Years Ended February 28 or 29 2014 2013 2012 Wholesale vehicle units 5 % 3 % 20 % Wholesale vehicle dollars 4 % 2 % 32 % Change in Used Car Superstore Base Years Ended February 28 or 29 2014 2013 2012 Used car superstores, beginning of period 118 108 103 Superstore openings 13 10 5 Used car superstores, end of period 131 118 108 Used Vehicle Sales Fiscal 2014 Versus Fiscal 2013. The 18% increase in used vehicle revenues in fiscal 2014 resulted from a corresponding increase in used unit sales. The increase in unit sales included a 12% increase in comparable store used unit sales and sales from newer stores not yet included in the comparable store base. The comparable store used unit growth was primarily driven by improved conversion, as well as a modest increase in store traffic. We believe the strong conversion reflected continued improvements in execution in our stores and the attractive credit environment experienced during fiscal 2014. Our data indicates that in our markets, we increased our share of the 0- to 10-year old used vehicle market by approximately 1 6 % in fiscal 2014. We believe our ability to grow market share year after year is a reflection of the strength of our consumer offer, the skill of our associates and the preference for our brand . Fiscal 2013 Versus Fiscal 2012. The 12% increase in used vehicle revenues in fiscal 2013 resulted from a 10% increase in used unit sales and a 2% increase in average retail selling price. The increase in used unit sales included a 5% increase in comparable store used unit sales and sales from newer stores not yet included in the comparable store base. The comparable store unit growth was driven by improved conversion, which we believe benefited from a variety of factors, including more compelling credit offers from third-party finance providers and CAF, increased inventory selection and continued strong in-store execution. The increase in average retail selling price primarily reflected changes in our sales mix by vehicle age, with an increased mix of ages 0-2 vehicles and a reduced mix of ages 3-4 vehicles, which corresponds to the model years in shortest supply. The overall supply of late-model used vehicles being remarketed has been constrained following four years of new car industry sales at rates significantly below pre-recession levels. During much of the period from 2009 through 2011, wholesale vehicle industry values rose, which increased our vehicle acquisition costs and average selling prices compared with pre-recession periods. We believe the constrained supply of late-model used vehicles and the resulting increase in 28 selling prices had an adverse effect on our used vehicle sales in recent years. As new car industry sales return to historical levels, the supply of late-model used vehicles should gradually improve, which we believe will benefit our business. Our data indicated that in our markets, we increased our share of the 0- to 10-year old used vehicle market by approximately 7% in fiscal 2013. Wholesale Vehicle Sales Our wholesale auction prices usually reflect the trends in the general wholesale market for the types of vehicles we sell, although they can also be affected by changes in vehicle mix or the average age, mileage or condition of the vehicles bought through our appraisal process and sold in our auctions. Fiscal 2014 Versus Fiscal 2013. The 4% increase in wholesale vehicle revenues in fiscal 2014 resulted from a 5% increase in wholesale unit sales, partially offset by a 2% reduction in average wholesale vehicle selling price. The wholesale unit growth primarily reflected the growth in our store base, as well as an increase in the appraisal buy rate. However, we experienced a reduced mix of wholesale vehicles in our appraisal traffic that partially offset the benefit of our store growth and increased buy rate. Fiscal 2013 Versus Fiscal 2012. The 2% increase in wholesale vehicle revenues in fiscal 2013 resulted from a 3% increase in wholesale unit sales offset by a slight reduction in average wholesale vehicle selling price. The wholesale unit growth included the combined effects of the growth in our store base and higher appraisal traffic, offset by a lower appraisal buy rate. The modest growth in wholesale unit sales also reflected the challenging comparisons with fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011, when wholesale unit sales grew 20% and 33%, respectively. Other Sales and Revenues Other sales and revenues include commissions on the sale of ESPs and GAP (collectively reported in ESP revenues, net of a reserve for estimated customer cancellations), service department sales and net third-party finance fees. The fixed, per-vehicle fees paid to us by prime and nonprime third-party finance providers may vary , reflecting the providers differing levels of credit risk exposure. The fixed, per-vehicle fees that we pay to the subprime providers are reflected as an offset to finance fee revenues received from prime and nonprime providers . In previous years, the percentage of our retail unit sales financed by subprime providers excluded sales associated with a third-party referral program. These sales are now included in this percentage for current and prior periods. Fiscal 2014 Versus Fiscal 2013. Other sales and revenues declined 6% in fiscal 2014, reflecting a reduction in net third-party finance fees and only modest growth in ESP revenue. The decrease in net third-party finance fees was driven by a mix shift among providers, including an increase in the percentage of our retail unit sales financed by the subprime providers to 19% in fiscal 2014 versus 16% in fiscal 2013. Throughout fiscal 2013 and for most of fiscal 2014, the volume and share of financing originated by the third-party subprime providers increased on a year-over-year basis, as these providers made more attractive offers to customers. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, however, the subprime providers moderated their credit offerings, and as a result, their share of financings for the fourth quarter was flat with fiscal 2013. During fiscal 2014, we corrected our accounting related to cancellation reserves for ESP and GAP, with resulting increases in reserves related to activity for fiscal 2014, fiscal 2013, and fiscal 2012. The portion of the increase in reserves related to prior fiscal years totaled $19.5 million. The effect of the increase in the cancellation reserve s largely offset the growth in ESP revenues resulting from our increase in used unit sales and a higher ESP penetration rate. Fiscal 2013 Versus Fiscal 2012. Other sales and revenues declined 2% in fiscal 2013, as an increase in ESP revenues was more than offset by a decrease in net third-party finance fees. ESP revenues increased 13%, primarily reflecting the growth in our retail vehicle unit sales and an increase in ESP penetration. The decrease in net third-party finance fees was driven by a mix shift among providers, including an increase in the percentage of our retail unit sales financed by the subprime providers to 16% in fiscal 2013 versus 10% in fiscal 2012. The growth in the subprime sales mix primarily resulted from more compelling credit offers being made by the subprime providers. 29 Gross Profit Years Ended February 28 or 29 (In millions) 2014 Change 2013 Change 2012 Used vehicle gross profit $ 1,143.9 17.7 % $ 971.5 9.3 % $ 888.6 New vehicle gross profit 4.5 (9.5) % 5.0 (23.8) % 6.5 Wholesale vehicle gross profit 313.9 1.9 % 308.1 2.1 % 301.8 Other gross profit 186.5 3.7 % 179.8 (1.2) % 181.9 Total $ 1,648.7 12.6 % $ 1,464.4 6.2 % $ 1,378.8 Gross Profit per Unit Years Ended February 28 or 29 2014 2013 2012 $ per unit (1) % (2) $ per unit (1) % (2) $ per unit (1) % (2) Used vehicle gross profit $ 2,171 11.1 $ 2,170 11.1 $ 2,177 11.4 New vehicle gross profit $ 577 2.1 $ 630 2.4 $ 847 3.2 Wholesale vehicle gross profit $ 916 17.2 $ 949 17.5 $ 953 17.5 Other gross profit $ 349 80.2 $ 395 72.3 $ 438 71.5 Total gross profit $ 3,083 13.1 $ 3,214 13.4 $ 3,316 13.8 (1) Calculated as category gross profit divided by its respective units sold, except the other and total categories, which are divided by total retail units sold. (2) Calculated as a percentage of its respective sales or revenue. Used Vehicle Gross Profit We target a dollar range of gross profit per used unit sold. The gross profit dollar target for an individual vehicle is based on a variety of factors, including its anticipated probability of sale and its mileage relative to its age; however, it is not primarily based on the vehicle selling price. Our ability to quickly adjust appraisal offers to be consistent with the broader market trade-in trends and our frequent inventory turns reduce our exposure to the inherent continual fluctuation in used vehicle values and contribute to our ability to manage gross profit dollars per unit. We employ a volume-based strategy, and we systematically mark down individual vehicle prices based on proprietary pricing algorithms in order to appropriately balance sales trends, inventory turns and gross profit achievement. Other factors that may influence gross profit include changes in our vehicle reconditioning costs, changes in the percentage of vehicles sourced directly from consumers through our appraisal process and changes in the wholesale pricing environment. Vehicles purchased directly from consumers typically generate more gross profit per unit compared with vehicles purchased at auction. Over the past several years, we have been able to manage to a relatively consistent used vehicle gross profit per unit. Fiscal 2014 Versus Fiscal 2013. Used vehicle gross profit increased 18% in fiscal 2014, driven by the corresponding increase in used unit sales. Used vehicle gross profit per unit remained consistent at $2,171 in fiscal 2014 versus $2,170 in fiscal 2013. Fiscal 2013 Versus Fiscal 2012. Used vehicle gross profit increased 9% in fiscal 2013, driven primarily by the 10% increase in used unit sales. Used vehicles gross profit per unit was only marginally lower, averaging $2,170 in fiscal 2013 versus $2,177 in fiscal 2012. Wholesale Vehicle Gross Profit O ur wholesale gross profit per unit reflects the demand for older, higher mileage vehicles, which are the mainstay of our auctions, as well as the continued strong dealer attendance and resulting high dealer-to-car ratios at our auctions. The frequency of our auctions, which are generally held weekly or bi-weekly, minimizes the depreciation risk on these vehicles. Fiscal 2014 Versus Fiscal 2013. Wholesale vehicle gross profit increased 2% in fiscal 2014, with the 5% increase in wholesale unit sales partially offset by a 3% reduction in wholesale gross profit per unit, which moderated to $916 in fiscal 2014 compared with $949 in fiscal 2013. 30 Fiscal 2013 Versus Fiscal 2012. Wholesale vehicle gross profit increased 2% in fiscal 2013, driven by the 3% increase in wholesale unit sales. Wholesale gross profit per unit was relatively stable, declining only $4 per unit. Other Gross Profit Other gross profit includes profits related to ESP and GAP revenues, net third-party finance fees and service department operations, including used vehicle reconditioning. We have no cost of sales related to ESP and GAP revenues or net third-party finance fees, as these represent commissions paid to us by certain third-party providers . Third-party finance fees are reported net of the fees we pay to third-party subprime finance providers. Accordingly, changes in the relative mix of the other gross profit components can affect the composition and amount of other gross profit. Fiscal 2014 Versus Fiscal 2013. Other gross profit increased 4% in fiscal 2014, as higher service department gross profits and a modest increase in ESP gross profit , was largely offset by the reduction in net third-party finance fees. ESP gross profit was reduced by our correction in accounting related to cancellation reserves for ESP and GAP. Service department gross profit rose $27.3 million in fiscal 2014, primarily due to increases in gross profit associated with used vehicle reconditioning, which benefited from strong used unit sales growth and the resulting leverage of service overhead costs . Fiscal 2013 Versus Fiscal 2012. Other gross profit declined 1% in fiscal 2013, as improved service department and ESP profits were more than offset by the lower net third-party finance fees. Impact of Inflation Historically, inflation has not had a significant impact on results. Profitability is primarily affected by our ability to achieve targeted unit sales and gross profit dollars per vehicle rather than by changes in average retail prices. However, increases in average vehicle selling prices benefit CAF income, to the extent the average amount financed also increases. In the years following the recession, we experienced a period of appreciation in used vehicle wholesale pricing. We believe the appreciation resulted, in part, from a reduced supply of late-model used vehicles in the market . This reduced supply was caused by the dramatic decline in new car industry sales and the associated slow down in used vehicle trade-in activity, compared with pre-recession periods. The higher wholesale values increased both our vehicle acquisition costs and our used vehicle average selling prices , which climbed from $16,291 in fiscal 2009 to $19,408 in fiscal 2014. In fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012, we also experienced inflationary increases in key reconditioning costs. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Components of SG&A Expense Years Ended February 28 or 29 (In millions except per unit data) 2014 Change 2013 Change 2012 Compensation and benefits (1) $ 656.7 12.9 % $ 581.9 11.7 % $ 521.0 Store occupancy costs 216.8 8.5 % 199.9 6.5 % 187.6 Advertising expense 112.2 5.6 % 106.3 7.2 % 99.1 Other overhead costs (2) 169.5 18.6 % 142.9 7.5 % 133.1 Total SG&A expenses $ 1,155.2 12.0 % $ 1,031.0 9.6 % $ 940.8 SG&A per retail unit $ 2,161 $ (102) $ 2,263 $ $ 2,263 (1) Excludes compensation and benefits related to reconditioning and vehicle repair service, which is included in cost of sales. (2) Includes IT expenses, insurance, bad debt, travel, preopening and relocation costs, charitable contributions and other administrative expenses. Fiscal 2014 Versus Fiscal 2013. SG&A expenses increased 12% in fiscal 2 01 4. The increase reflected the 11 % increase in our store base during fiscal 201 4 (representing the addition of 1 3 stores) and higher variable selling costs resulting from the 12 % increase in comparable store used unit sales. SG&A per retail unit declined $102 to $2,161 versus $2,263 in fiscal 2013, as our comparable store used unit sales growth generated overhead leverage . 31 Fiscal 2013 Versus Fiscal 2012. SG&A expenses increased 10% in fiscal 2013. The increase primarily reflected the combination of the 9% expansion in our store base during fiscal 2013 (representing the addition of 10 stores), higher variable selling costs resulting from the 5% increase in comparable store used unit sales, and higher growth-related costs. Growth-related costs include store pre-opening expenses, relocation expenses, and the costs of maintaining store management bench strength to support future growth. Growth-related costs were affected by the increase in the rate of our store openings, from 5 stores in fiscal 2012 to 10 stores in fiscal 2013. SG&A per retail unit was consistent at $2,263 in both fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012. Income Taxes The effective income tax rate was 38.2 % in fiscal 2014, 38.1% in fiscal 2013 and 38.0% in fiscal 2012. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS CARMAX AUTO FINANCE CAF provides financing to qualified customers purchasing vehicles at CarMax. Because the purchase of a vehicle is generally reliant on the consumer ability to obtain on-the-spot financing, it is important to our business that financing be available to creditworthy customers. While financing can also be obtained from third-party sources, we believe that total reliance on third parties can create unacceptable volatility and business risk . Furthermore, we believe the company processes and systems, transparency of pricing, vehicle quality and the integrity of the information collected at the time the customer applies for credit provide a unique and ideal environment in which to procure high quality auto loans, bot h for CAF and for the third-party finance providers. We believe CAF enables us to capture additional sales, profits and cash flows while managing our reliance on third- party finance sources. Management regularly analyzes CAF's operating results by assessing the competitiveness of our consumer offer, profitability, the performance of the auto loan receivables including trends in credit losses and delinquencies, and CAF direct expenses. CAF income primarily reflects the interest and fee income generated by the auto loan receivables less the interest expense associated with the debt issued to fund these receivables, a provision for estimated loan losses and direct CAF expense s. CAF income does not include any allocation of indirect costs. While CAF benefits from certain indirect overhead expenditures, we have elected to present this information on a direct basis to avoid making arbitrary decisions regarding the indirect benefits or costs that could be attributed to CAF. Examples of indirect costs not allocated to CAF include retail store expenses and corporate expenses such as human resources, administrative services, marketing, information systems, accounting, legal, treasury and executive payroll.

(2) Vehicle units financed as a percentage of total retail units sold. Fiscal 2014 Versus Fiscal 2013. CAF income increas ed 12% to $336.2 million from $ 299.3 million in fiscal 2013. The improvement resulted from the growth in CAF managed receivables, partially offset by a lower total interest margin rate. CAF average managed receivables increased 23% to $6.63 billion in fiscal 2014, driven by the growth in CAF net loan originations , which rose 21% to $4.18 billion . Origination volumes benefited from an increase in CAF loan penetration rate, which grew steadily from its recent low of 30% in fiscal 2011 to 41% in fiscal 2014 , and the growth in the company retail unit sales. The improvement in the loan penetration rate over this period reflected a combination of factors , including a transition back to CAF pre-recession origination strategy during fiscal 2012 and favorable responses to changes in our credit offers. The transition back to CAF pre-recession origination strategy reduced the volume of finance contracts we had been selling to third-party providers. In mid-fiscal 2013, we began strategically providing more competitive offers. See Note 4 for additional information on the credit quality of CAF auto loan receivables. Total interest margin, which reflects the spread between interest and fees charged to consumers and our funding costs, declined to 6.9% of average managed receivables in fiscal 2014 compared with 7.4% in fiscal 2013. Strategically p roviding more competitive offers contributed to a decline in the weighted average contract rate on loan originations to 7.0% in fiscal 2014 from 7.9% in fiscal 2013. Changes in the interest margin on new originations affect CAF income over time as these loans come to represent an increasing percentage of managed receivables. Rising interest rates, which affect CAF funding costs, or further competitive pressures on consumer rates could result in further compression in the interest margin on new originations. The provision for loan losses is the periodic expense of maintaining an adequate allowance. In fiscal 2014, the provision for loan losses as a percentage of average managed receivables increased slightly to 1.09% from 1.04% in fiscal 2013. Allowance for Loan Losses Years Ended February 28 or 29 (In millions) 2014 % (1) 2013 % (1) Balance as of beginning of year $ 57.3 0.97 $ 43.3 0.87 Charge-offs (134.3) (103.1) Recoveries 74.7 60.9 Provision for loan losses 72.2 56.2 Balance as of end of year $ 69.9 0.97 $ 57.3 0.97 (1) Percent of total ending managed receivables as of the corresponding reporting date. The allowance for loan losses represents an estimate of the amount of net losses inherent in our portfolio of managed receivables as of the applicable reporting date and anticipated to occur during the following 12 months. The allowance is primarily based on the credit quality of the underlying receivables, historical loss trends and forecasted forward loss curves. We consider recent trends in delinquencies and losses, recovery rates and the economic environment in determining the adequacy of the allowance. The increase in the dollar amount of the allowance largely reflected the growth in managed receivables. The allowance for loan losses as a percent of managed receivables was flat at 0.97% as of both February 28, 2014, and February 28, 2013. 33 Past Due Account Information As of February 28 or 29 (In millions) 2014 2013 2012 Accounts 31+ days past due $ 185.2 $ 154.2 $ 116.5 Ending managed receivables $ 7,184.4 $ 5,933.3 $ 4,981.8 Past due accounts as a percentage of ending managed receivables 2.58 % 2.60 % 2.34 % Credit Loss Information Years Ended February 28 or 29 (In millions) 2014 2013 2012 Net credit losses on managed receivables $ 59.6 $ 42.2 $ 32.0 Total average managed receivables $ 6,629.5 $ 5,385.5 $ 4,662.4 Net credit losses as a percentage of total average managed receivables 0.90 % 0.78 % 0.69 % Average recovery rate 55.2 % 58.4 % 59.7 % As of February 28, 2014, past due accounts were 2.58% of ending managed receivables, consistent with the 2.60% delinquency rate as of February 28, 2013. Net credit losses increased to 0.90% of average managed receivables in fiscal 2014 from 0.78% in fiscal 2013. The average recovery rate represents the average percentage of the outstanding principal balance we receive when a vehicle is repossessed and liquidated, generally at our wholesale auctions. The annual recovery rate has ranged from a low of 42% to a high of 60%, and it is primarily affected by changes in the wholesale market pricing environment. Loan Origination Test . In January 2014, CAF launched a test originating loans for customers who typically would be financed by our subprime providers. We plan to originate approximately $70 million of loans in this test, of which $9.1 million was originated in fiscal 2014. We expect the loans originated in this test will have higher loss and delinquency rates than the aggregate of the current CAF portfolio. The test will be funded separately from our current portfolio and not included in our current securitization program. Fiscal 2013 Versus Fiscal 2012. CAF income increased 14% to $299.3 million from $262.2 million in fiscal 2012, primarily reflecting the growth in managed receivables. Despite the growth in our receivables, direct expenses decreased modestly as we benefited from operating efficiencies. CAF average managed receivables increased 16% to $5.39 billion in fiscal 2013, driven by the growth in CAF origination volume throughout fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2013. Origination volumes benefited from an increase in CAF loan penetration rate; increased ave rage retail selling prices, which translated into an increase in the average amount financed; and the growth in retail unit sales. Additionally, historically low funding costs allowed CAF to begin offering more compelling credit offers in the second half of fiscal 2013. Positive customer response to these credit offers further bolstered CAF origination volumes. Total interest margin was 7.4% of average managed receivables in fiscal 2013, similar to the 7.3% interest margin in fiscal 2012. In fiscal 2013, the provision for loan losses as a percentage of average managed receivables increased moderately to 1.04% compared with 0.78% in fiscal 2012. Low unit charge-offs and strong recovery rates continued to partially offset the effect of the change in credit mix resulting from the transition in our origination strategy. The allowance for loan losses increased to 0.97% of ending managed receivables as of February 28, 2013, versus 0.87% as of February 29, 2012. 34 PLANNED FUTURE ACTIVITIES We plan to open a total of 13 superstores in fiscal 2015 and between 10 and 15 superstores in each of the following two fiscal years. We currently estimate capital expenditures will total approximately $325 million in fiscal 2015.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 2( Y ) f or information on recent accounting pronouncements applicable to CarMax . FINANCIAL CONDITION Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary ongoing cash requirements are to fund our existing operations, new store expansion (including capital expenditures and inventory purchas es) and CAF . Our p rimary ongoing sources of liquidity include existing cash balances, funds provided by operations, proceeds from securitization transactions or other funding arrangements, and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Operating Activities . Net cash used in operating activities totaled $613.2 million in fiscal 2014, $778.4 million in fiscal 2013 and $62.2 million in fiscal 2012. These amounts included increases in auto loan receivables of $1.32 billion, $992.2 million and $675.7 million, respectively. The majority of the increases in auto loan receivables are accompanied by increases in non-recourse notes payable, which are separately reflected as cash provided by financing activities. Excluding the increases in auto loan receivables, net cash provided by operating activities would have been $711.0 million in fiscal 2014, $213.8 million in fiscal 2013 and $613.5 million i n fiscal 2012. As of February 28, 2014, total inventory was $1.64 billion, representing an increase of $123.6 million, or 8%, compared with the balance as of the start of the fiscal year. We had 7% more used vehicles in inventory as of February 28, 2014, compared with the start of the fiscal year, reflecting the addition of inventory associated with the 13 stores opened during fiscal 2014, as well as added inventories to support our comparable store sales growth. Inventory levels were somewhat below target levels as of the end of fiscal 2014, however, largely due to disruptions in reconditioning activities caused by unusually severe weather experienced during the fourth quarter of the year. As of February 28, 2013, total inventory was $1.52 billion, representing an increase of $425.2 million, or 39% compared with the balance as of the start of the fiscal year. We had 35% more used vehicles in inventory as of February 28, 2013, compared with the start of the fiscal year. The additional used vehicle units supported the ten stores opened during fiscal 2013 and our comparable store sales growth. In addition, during the second half of fiscal 35 2013 we built inventories at a higher rate than in recent years to better position ourselves for seasonal sales opportunities. Investing Activities. Net cash used in investing activities totaled $336.7 million in fiscal 2014, $255.3 million in fiscal 2013 and $219.4 million in fiscal 2012. Investing activities primarily consist of capital expenditures, which totaled $310.3 million in fiscal 2014, $235.7 million in fiscal 2013 and $172.6 million in fiscal 2012. Capital expenditures primarily include real estate acquisitions for planned future store openings and store construction costs. We maintain a multi-year pipeline of sites to support our superstore growth, so portions of capital spending in one year may relate to stores that we plan to open in subsequent fiscal years. The increases in capital expenditures over the last three fiscal years primarily related to the growth in our store opening pace, as we increased store openings from 5 in fiscal 2012, to 10 in fiscal 2013, and 13 in fiscal 2014. Historically, capital expenditures have been funded with internally-generated funds, debt and sale-leaseback transactions. No sale-leasebacks have been executed since fiscal 2009. As of February 28, 2014, we owned 74 and leased 5 7 of our 131 used car superstores. Restricted cash from collections on auto loan receivables increased $35.0 million in fiscal 2014, $20.0 million in fiscal 2013 and $43.3 million in fiscal 2012. These collections vary depending on the timing of the receipt of principal and interest payments on securitized auto loan receivables, the change in average managed receivables and the funding vehicle utilized. Financing Activities. Net cash provided by financing activities totaled $1.13 billion in fiscal 2014, $1.04 billion in fiscal 2013 and $683.1 million in fiscal 2012. Included in these amounts were net increases in total non-recourse notes payable of $1.39 billion, $1.17 billion and $670.4 million, respectively, which were used to provide the financing for the majority of the increases of $1.32 billion, $992.2 million and $675.7 million, respectively, in auto loan receivables. During fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013, net cash provided by financing activities was reduced by stock repurchases of $307.2 million, and $203.4 million, respectively. Total Debt and Cash and Cash Equivalents As of February 28 (In thousands) 2014 2013 Borrowings under revolving credit facility $ 582 $ 355 Finance and capital lease obligations 334,384 353,591 Non-recourse notes payable 7,248,444 5,855,090 Total debt $ 7,583,410 $ 6,209,036 Cash and cash equivalents $ 627,901 $ 449,364 We have a $700 million unsecured revolving credit facility, which expires in August 201 6. Borrowings under this credit facility are available for working capital and general corporate purposes, and the unused portion is fully available to us. See Note 11 for additional information on the revolving credit facility. The credit facility agreement contains representations and warranties, conditions and covenants. If these requirements were not met, all amounts outstanding or otherwise owed could become due and payable immediately and other limitations could be placed on our ability to use any available borrowing capacity. CAF auto loan receivables are primarily funded through securitization transactions. Our securitizations are structured to legally isolate the auto loan receivables, and we would not expect to be able to access the assets of our securitization vehicles , even in insolvency, receivership or conservatorship proceedings. Similarly, the investors in the non-recourse notes payable have no recourse to our assets beyond the securitized receivables, the amounts on deposit in reserve accounts and the restricted cash from collections on auto loan receivables . We do, however, continue to have the rights associated with the interest we retain in these securitization vehicles . The timing of principal payments on the non-recourse notes payable is based on principal collections, net of losses, on the securitized auto loan receivables. The current portion of non-recourse notes payable represents principal payments that are due to be distributed in the following period. 36 As of February 28, 2014, $ 6.37 billion of non-recourse notes payable was outstanding related to term securitizations. Thes e notes payable accrue interest at fixed rates and have scheduled maturities through August 2020 , but may mature earlier or later, depending on the repayment rate of the underlying auto loan receivables. During fiscal 2014, we completed four term securitizations, funding a total of $3.86 billion of auto loan receivables. Our term securitizations typically contain an option to repurchase the securitized receivables when the outstanding balance in the pool of auto loan receivables falls below 10% of the original pool balance. During fiscal 2014, we exercised this option on four term securitizations that had originally been issued in 2009 and 2010, including one securitization for which CarMax had provided $140.0 million of capital, or 14% of the transaction, in the form of subordinated bonds. Upon the exercise of this option, we funded substantially all of the remaining receivables through our warehouse facilities. As of February 28, 2014 , $ 879. 0 million of non-recourse notes payable was outstanding related to our warehouse facilities. The combined warehouse facility limit is $1. 8 billion, and the unused warehouse capacity totaled $9 21 .0 m illion. During the third quarter of fiscal 2014, we increased the limit of our $ 900 million warehouse facility that was scheduled to expire in February 201 4 to $ 1 billion, and during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, we renewed the facility for an additional 36 4 day term. Of the combined warehouse facility limit, $ 800 million will expire in August 2014 and $ 1 b illion will expire in February 2015 . The return requirements of the warehouse facility investors could fluctuate significantly depending on market conditions. At renewal, the cost, structure and capacity of the facilities could change. These changes could have a significant effect on our funding costs. See Notes 2(F) and 11 for additional information on the warehouse facilities. The securitization agreements related to the warehouse facilities include various representations and warranties, covenants and performance triggers. If these requirements are not met, we could be unable to continue to securitize receivables through the warehouse facilities. In addition, warehouse facility investors could charge us a higher rate of interest and could have us replaced as servicer. Further, we could be required to deposit collections on the securitized receivables with the warehouse facility agents on a daily basis and deliver executed lockbox agreements to the warehouse facility agents. We expect that cash generated by operations and proceeds from securitization transactions or other funding arrangements, sale-leaseback transactions and borrowings under existing, new or expanded credit facilities will be sufficient to fund CAF, capital expenditures and working capital for the foreseeable future. We anticipate that we will be able to enter into new, or renew or expand existing , funding arrangements to meet our future funding needs. However, based on conditions in the credit markets, the cost for these arrangements could be materially higher than historical levels and the timing and capacity of these transactions could be dictated by market availability rather than our requirements. In fiscal 2013, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $800 million of our common stock. Purchases may be made in open market or privately negotiated transactions at management discretion, and the timing and amount of repurchases are determined based on share price, market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. Shares repurchased are deemed authorized but unissued shares of common stock. During fiscal 2014, we repurchased 6.9 million shares of common stock for $306.0 million, or an average purchase price of $44.61 per share. As of February 28, 2014, $282.1 million was available for repurchase under the authorization, expiring on December 31, 2014. Amounts reported as the repurchase and retirement of common stock on our statement of cash flows may reflect timing differences in trade and settlement dates on stock repurchase transactions occurring at the end of a reporting period. Subsequent to the end of fiscal 2014, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $1.0 billion of CarMax common stock through December 31, 2015. Fair Value Measurements.

The securitized receivables can only be used as collateral to settle obligations of these securitization vehicles. In addition, the investors in the non-recourse notes payable have no recourse to our assets beyond the securitized receivables, the amounts on deposit in reserve accounts and the restricted cash from collections on auto loan receivables. See Note 2(F). (2) Due to the uncertainty of forecasting expected variable interest rate payments, those amounts are not included in the table. See Note 11 .
