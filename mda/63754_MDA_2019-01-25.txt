ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview The following Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is intended to help the reader understand McCormick & Company, Incorporated, our operations and our present business environment. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto contained in Item 8 of this report. We use certain non-GAAP information that we believe is important for purposes of comparison to prior periods and development of future projections and earnings growth prospects. This information is also used by management to measure the profitability of our ongoing operations and analyze our business performance and trends. The dollar and share information in the charts and tables in the MD&A are in millions, except per share data. McCormick is a global leader in flavor. The company manufactures, markets and distributes spices, seasoning mixes, condiments and other flavorful products to the entire food industry retailers, food manufacturers and foodservice businesses. We manage our business in two operating segments, consumer and flavor solutions, as described in Item 1 of this report. Our long-term annual growth objectives in constant currency are to increase sales 4% to 6%, increase adjusted operating income 7% to 9% and increase adjusted earnings per share 9% to 11%. Sales growth : Over time, we expect to grow sales with similar contributions from: 1) our base business driven by brand marketing support, customer intimacy, expanded distribution and category growth; 2) new products; and 3) acquisitions. Base business In 2018, we increased our investment in brand marketing by 18% as compared to 2017. We measure the return on our brand marketing investment and have identified digital marketing as one of our highest return investments in brand marketing support. Through digital marketing, we are connecting with consumers in a personalized way to deliver recipes, provide cooking advice and discover new products. New Products For our consumer segment, we believe that scalable and differentiated innovation continues to be one of the best ways to distinguish our brands from our competition, including private label. We are introducing products for every type of cooking occasion, from gourmet, premium items to convenient and value-priced flavors. For flavor solutions customers, we are developing seasonings for snacks and other food products, as well as flavors for new menu items. We have a solid pipeline of flavor solutions aligned with our customers new product launch plans, many of which include better-for-you innovation. With over 20 product innovation centers around the world, we are supporting the growth of our brands and those of our flavor solutions customers with products that appeal to local consumers. Acquisitions Acquisitions are expected to approximate one-third of our sales growth over time. Since the beginning of 2015, we have completed seven acquisitions, which are driving sales in both our consumer and flavor solutions segments. We focus on acquisition opportunities that meet the growing demand for flavor and health. Geographically, our focus is on acquisitions that build scale where we currently have presence in both developed and emerging markets. Our acquisitions have included bolt-on opportunities and the August 17, 2017 acquisition of Reckitt Benckiser's Food Division ("RB Foods") from Reckitt Benckiser Group plc. for approximately $4.2 billion, net of acquired cash. The acquired market-leading brands of RB Foods include French , Frank RedHot and Cattlemen , which are a natural strategic fit with our robust global branded flavor portfolio. We believe that these additions move us to a leading position in the attractive U.S. condiments category and provide significant international growth opportunities for our consumer and flavor solutions segments. The RB Foods acquisition resulted in acquisitions contributing more than one-third of our sales growth in 2018 and 2017. Cost savings : We are fueling our investment in growth with cost savings from our CCI program, an ongoing initiative to improve productivity and reduce costs throughout the organization, that also includes savings from the organization and streamlining actions described in note 3 of the accompanying financial statements. In addition to funding brand marketing support, product innovation and other growth initiatives, our CCI program helps offset higher material costs and is contributing to higher operating income and earnings per share. Cash flow : We continue to generate strong cash flow. Net cash provided by operating activities reached $821.2 million in 2018, an increase from $815.3 million in 2017. In 2018, we continued to have a balanced use of cash for debt repayment, capital expenditures and the return of cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We are using our cash to fund shareholder dividends, with annual increases in each of the past 33 years, and to fund capital expenditures, acquisitions and share repurchases. In 2018, the return of cash to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchase was $335.7 million. Due to our increased level of indebtedness because of the RB Foods acquisition, we have curtailed our acquisition and share repurchase activity for a period in order to enable a return to our pre-acquisition credit profile. Although we have curtailed our share repurchase activity, we repurchased shares in 2018 to mitigate the effect of shares issued upon the exercise of stock options and expect to continue this practice in 2019. On a long-term basis, we expect a combination of acquisitions and share repurchases to add about 2% to earnings per share growth. In 2018, we achieved further growth of our business with net sales rising 11.9% over the 2017 level due to the following factors: We grew volume and product mix, with increases in both our consumer and flavor solutions segments. This added 2.2% of sales growth. The increases were driven by new products as well as growth in the base business. Pricing actions contributed 0.5% of the increase in net sales. The incremental impact of the RB Foods acquisition contributed 8.0% of the increase in net sales. Net sales growth was favorably impacted by fluctuations in currency rates that contributed 1.2% to sales growth. Excluding this impact, we grew sales 10.7% on a constant currency basis. Operating income was $903.3 million in 2018 and $702.4 million in 2017. We recorded $16.3 million and $22.2 million of special charges in 2018 and 2017, respectively, related to organization and streamlining actions. In 2018 and 2017, we also recorded $22.5 million and $61.7 million of transaction and integration expenses, respectively, related to our acquisition of RB Foods that reduced operating income. In 2018, compared to the year-ago period, the favorable impact of higher sales, including the effects of the RB Foods acquisition, and $117.9 million of cost savings from our CCI program, including organization and streamlining actions, more than offset higher special charges, transaction and integration expenses, material costs and a $48.5 million increase in brand marketing. Excluding special charges together with transaction and integration expenses related to our acquisition of RB Foods, adjusted operating income was $942.1 million, an increase of 19.8%, compared to $786.3 million in the year-ago period. In constant currency, adjusted operating income rose 19.1%. For further details and a reconciliation of non-GAAP to reported amounts, see Non-GAAP Financial Measures. Diluted earnings per share was $7.00 in 2018 and $3.72 in 2017. The year-on-year increase in earnings per share was driven mainly by a lower effective tax rate, coupled with benefits of the U.S. Tax Act, along with higher operating income, as described above, which was offset by higher interest expense and higher shares outstanding. Special charges lowered earnings per share by $0.10 and $0.12 in 2018 and 2017, respectively. Transaction and integration expenses lowered earnings per share by $0.13 and $0.42 in 2018 and 2017, respectively. In 2018, a non-recurring benefit from the U.S. Tax Act increased diluted earnings per share by $2.26. Excluding the effects of special charges, transaction and integration expenses, and the non-recurring benefit of the U.S. Tax Act, adjusted diluted earnings per share was $4.97 in 2018 and $4.26 in 2017, or an increase of 16.7%. 2019 Outlook In connection with our pending adoption of two new accounting standards relating to revenue recognition and income statement classification of pension expense, we will, at the beginning of fiscal 2019, recast our historical income statements for 2018, 2017 and 2016 to retrospectively reflect the adoption of those standards. As more fully described in note 2 of the accompanying financial statements, while there will be no impact to net income or basic or diluted earnings per share in those years (or in interim periods within those years), we currently estimate that the adoption of those new accounting standards will result in the following aggregate income statement reclassifications to our historical results: (i) a reduction in annual sales by approximately $100 million to $110 million for each of the years ended November 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016: (ii) an increase in cost of goods sold by $176.4 million, $112.4 million, and $90.0 million for the years ended November 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. (iii) a decrease in selling, general and administrative expense by an amount ranging from $264.2 million to $274.2 million for the year ended November 30, 2018, from $209.8 million to $219.8 million for the year ended November 30, 2017, and from $198.4 million to $208.4 million for the year ended November 30, 2016; (iv) an increase (decrease) in operating income by $(12.2) million, $(2.6) million and $8.4 million for the years ended November 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016; and (v) an increase (decrease) in non-operating income, net (or the line captioned "Other income (expense), net" in our consolidated income statements), by $12.2 million, $2.6 million, and $(8.4) million for the years ended November 30, 2018, 2017, and 2016. The adoption of these standards and related estimated reclassifications, which will be reflected retrospectively, are not anticipated to have a material impact on the growth rates for sales, adjusted operating income or adjusted earnings per share or other expectations provided with respect to our 2019 outlook included in the following paragraphs. We project another year of strong financial performance in 2019. In 2019, we expect to grow sales 1% to 3%, including an estimated 2% unfavorable impact from currency rates, or 3% to 5% on a constant currency basis. That anticipated 2019 sales growth is primarily driven by higher volume and product mix, with some impact of pricing to offset anticipated cost increases, and consists entirely of organic growth as we do not anticipate an incremental sales impact from acquisitions in 2019. We expect our 2019 gross profit margin to be 25 to 75 basis points higher in 2019 than in 2018, in part driven by our CCI-led cost savings. In 2019, we expect an increase in operating income of 10% to 12%, which includes an estimated 2% unfavorable impact from currency rates. That increase in operating income reflects the impact of lower special charges, estimated at $15 million in 2019 compared to $16.3 million in 2018, and the absence of $22.5 million of transaction and integration expenses incurred in 2018. Excluding special charges and, in 2018, transaction and integration expenses, we expect 2019 adjusted operating income to increase 7% to 9%, which includes an estimated 2% unfavorable impact from currency rates, or 9% to 11% on a constant currency basis. Our CCI-led cost savings target in 2019 is approximately $110 million. In 2019, we expect to support our sales growth with a brand marketing investment comparable with the 2018 level, after consideration of the impact on both years of the adoption of the new accounting standards previously described. Our underlying effective tax rate is projected to be higher in 2019 than in 2018 as the U.S. Tax Act was not fully effective for us, as a non-calendar year end company, in 2018. Absent the impact of discrete tax items, we estimate our underlying tax rate to be approximately 24% in 2019. Including the impact of a discrete tax item that occurred in December 2018, we estimate that our consolidated effective tax rate will approximate 22% in fiscal 2019. In 2018, we recognized a net non-recurring tax benefit of $301.5 million upon the enactment of the U.S. Tax Act. Excluding that benefit and taxes associated with special charges and transaction and integration expenses, our adjusted effective tax rate was approximately 19.6% in 2018. We expect our adjusted effective tax rate in 2018 to approximate our effective tax rate under U.S. GAAP of 22%. Diluted earnings per share was $7.00 in 2018. Diluted earnings per share for 2019 are projected to range from $5.09 to $5.19. Excluding the per share impact of the non-recurring benefit from the U.S. Tax Act of $2.26, special charges of $0.10 and transaction and integration expenses of $0.13 in 2018, adjusted diluted earnings per share was $4.97 in 2018. Adjusted diluted earnings per share (excluding an estimated $0.08 per share impact from special charges) are projected to be $5.17 to $5.27 in 2019. We expect adjusted diluted earnings per share in 2019 to grow 4% to 6%, which includes a 2% unfavorable impact from currency rates, or to grow 6% to 8% in constant currency over adjusted diluted earnings per share of $4.97 in 2018. We expect this growth rate to be mainly driven by increased adjusted operating income which we expect to be partially offset by a higher adjusted effective tax rate in 2019. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 2018 COMPARED TO 2017 2018 2017 Net sales $ 5,408.9 $ 4,834.1 Percent growth 11.9 % 9.6 % Components of percent growth in net sales increase (decrease): Volume and product mix 2.2 % 1.7 % Pricing actions 0.5 % 2.1 % Acquisitions 8.0 % 6.5 % Foreign exchange 1.2 % (0.7 )% Sales for 2018 increased by 11.9% from 2017 and by 10.7% on a constant currency basis (that is, excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange as more fully described under the caption, Non-GAAP Financial Measures). Both the consumer and flavor solutions segments drove higher volume and product mix that added 2.2% to sales. This was driven by new products as well as growth in the base business. The incremental impact of pricing actions added 0.5% to sales, as compared to 2017. The incremental impact of the RB Foods acquisition added 8.0% to sales during 2018. A favorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates increased sales by 1.2% compared to 2017 and is excluded from our measure of sales growth of 10.7% on a constant currency basis. 2018 2017 Gross profit $ 2,371.6 $ 2,010.2 Gross profit margin 43.8 % 41.6 % In 2018, our gross profit margin rose 220 basis points to 43.8% from 41.6% in 2017. While this expansion in 2018 includes the accretive impact from our acquisition of the RB Foods business, together with the absence of related transaction and integration expenses of $20.9 million that depressed our 2017 gross profit margin by 40 basis points, our core business was also a driver of that expansion. In 2018, CCI-led cost savings and the shift in our core product portfolio to more value-added products continued to drive profit expansion across both of our segments. Excluding the effect of those transaction and integration expenses in 2017, adjusted gross profit margin rose 180 basis points from 42.0% in 2017 to 43.8% in 2018. 2018 2017 Selling, general & administrative expense $ 1,429.5 $ 1,244.8 Percent of net sales 26.4 % 25.8 % Selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expense was $1,429.5 million in 2018 compared to $1,244.8 million in 2017, an increase of $184.7 million. That increase in SG&A expense was driven by the incremental impact of the RB Foods acquisition, together with increased brand marketing and higher distribution costs, including freight, which was offset in part by CCI-led cost savings, including the benefits from the organization and streamlining actions described in note 3 of the accompanying financial statements. As a result, SG&A expense as a percentage of net sales was 26.4%, a 60-basis point increase from 2017. 2018 2017 Total special charges $ 16.3 $ 22.2 We regularly evaluate whether to implement changes to our organization structure to reduce fixed costs, simplify or improve processes, and improve our competitiveness, and we expect to continue to evaluate such actions in the future. From time to time, those changes are of such significance in terms of both up-front costs and organizational/ structural impact that we obtain advance approval from our Management Committee and classify expenses related to those changes as special charges in our financial statements. Special charges of $16.3 million were recorded in 2018 and $22.2 million in 2017 to enable us to implement these changes. During 2018, we recorded $16.3 million of special charges, consisting primarily of: (i) $11.5 million related to our multi-year GE initiative, consisting of $7.5 million of third party expenses, $1.0 million of employee severance charges and a non-cash asset impairment charge of $3.0 million (that non-cash asset impairment charge was related to the write-off of certain software assets that are incompatible with our future move, approved in the second quarter of 2018, to a new global enterprise resource planning platform to facilitate planned actions under our GE initiative to align and simplify our end-to-end processes to support our future growth); (ii) a one-time payment, in the aggregate amount of $2.2 million, made to eligible U.S. hourly employees to distribute a portion of the non-recurring net income tax benefit recognized in connection with the enactment of the U.S. Tax Act; (iii) $1.0 million related to employee severance benefits and other costs directly associated with the relocation of one of our Chinese manufacturing facilities; and (iv) $1.6 million related to employee severance benefits and other costs related to the transfer of certain manufacturing operations in our Asia/Pacific region to a newly constructed facility in Thailand. During 2017, we recorded $22.2 million of special charges, consisting primarily of $12.7 million related to third party expenses incurred as part of our evaluation of changes relating to our GE initiative, $2.8 million related to employee severance benefits and other costs associated with the relocation of one of our Chinese manufacturing facilities, $2.5 million for severance and other exit costs associated with the closure of our manufacturing plant in Portugal, and $1.7 million related to employee severance benefits and other costs associated with actions related to the transfer of certain manufacturing operations to a new facility under construction in Thailand. See note 3 of the accompanying financial statements for more details on these charges and our basis for classifying amounts as special charges. 2018 2017 Transaction expenses included in cost of goods sold $ $ 20.9 Transaction expenses included in other debt costs 15.4 Other transaction and integration expenses 22.5 40.8 Total $ 22.5 $ 77.1 Transaction and integration expenses related to our RB Foods acquisition totaled $22.5 million and $77.1 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively. In 2018, these costs primarily consisted of outside advisory, service and consulting costs; employee-related costs; and other costs related to the acquisition. In 2017, these expenses consisted of amortization of the acquisition-date fair value adjustment of inventories of $20.9 million that was included in cost of goods sold; outside advisory, service and consulting costs; employee-related costs; and other costs related to the acquisition, including the costs related to the bridge financing commitment of $15.4 million that was included in other debt costs. 2018 2017 Interest expense $ 174.6 $ 95.7 Other income, net 12.6 3.5 Interest expense for 2018 of $174.6 million was sharply higher than the prior year level, primarily due to higher average borrowings in 2018 related to our incurrence of $3.7 billion in debt in August 2017 to finance the acquisition of RB Foods (see note 6 of the accompanying financial statements). Other income, net, for 2018 of $12.6 million was significantly higher than the 2017 level principally due to a gain of $6.3 million recognized on the sale in 2018 of a building vacated as part of our move to a new global headquarters in Maryland; higher interest income and lower non-operating foreign currency transaction losses recognized in 2018 as compared to 2017 also contributed to this increase. 2018 2017 Income from consolidated operations before income taxes $ 741.3 $ 594.8 Income taxes (benefit) (157.3 ) 151.3 Effective tax rate (21.2 )% 25.4 % The provision for income taxes is based on the then-current estimate of the annual effective tax rate adjusted to reflect the tax impact of items discrete to the fiscal period. We record tax expense or tax benefits that do not relate to ordinary income in the current fiscal year discretely in the period in which such items occur pursuant to the requirements of U.S. GAAP. Examples of such types of discrete items not related to ordinary income of the current fiscal year include, but are not limited to, excess tax benefits associated with share-based payments to employees, changes in estimates of the outcome of tax matters related to prior years (including reversals of reserves upon the lapsing of statutes of limitations), provision-to-return adjustments, and the settlement of tax audits. As more fully described in note 12 of the accompanying financial statements, the U.S. Tax Act was enacted in December 2017. The U.S. Tax Act significantly changed U.S. corporate income tax laws by, among other things, reducing the U.S. corporate income tax rate to 21% beginning on January 1, 2018 and creating a territorial tax system with a one-time transition tax on previously deferred post-1986 foreign earnings of U.S. subsidiaries. Under GAAP (specifically, ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes ), the effects of changes in tax rates and laws on deferred tax balances are recognized in the period in which the new legislation is enacted. We recorded a net benefit of $301.5 million associated with the U.S. Tax Act during 2018. This amount includes a $380.0 million benefit from the revaluation of our net U.S. deferred tax liabilities as of January 1, 2018, based on the new lower corporate income tax rate offset, in part, by an estimated net transition tax impact of $78.5 million. That net transition tax impact is comprised of the mandated one-time transition tax on previously deferred post-1986 foreign earnings of U.S. subsidiaries estimated at $75.3 million, together with additional foreign withholding taxes of $7.9 million associated with previously unremitted prior year earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were no longer considered indefinitely reinvested as of the effective date of the U.S. Tax Act and that were subsequently repatriated in 2018, less a $4.7 million reduction in our fiscal 2018 income taxes directly resulting from the transition tax. The effective tax rate was a benefit of 21.2% in 2018 as compared to an effective tax rate expense of 25.4% in 2017. The effective tax rate benefit of 21.2% in 2018 includes the net tax benefit of $301.5 million associated with the U.S. Tax Act, as more fully described above, that had a (40.7)% impact on 2018 effective tax rate. Our 2018 effective tax rate also reflects the effects of the lower U.S. federal corporate income tax rate under the U.S. Tax Act and higher other net discrete tax benefits. Net discrete tax benefits, excluding the effects of the U.S. Tax Act in 2018, increased by $3.9 million from $24.2 million in 2017 to $28.1 million in 2018. Discrete tax benefits in both periods include excess tax benefits associated with share-based payments to employees ($21.7 million and $10.7 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively), reversal of reserves for unrecognized tax benefits for the expiration of the statues of limitations and settlements with taxing authorities in several jurisdictions, and other discrete items, including, in 2017, the establishment of valuation allowances on non-U.S. deferred tax assets due to a change in our assessment of the recoverability of those deferred taxes. See note 12 of the accompanying financial statements for a more detailed reconciliation of the U.S. federal tax rate with the effective tax rate. 2018 2017 Income from unconsolidated operations $ 34.8 $ 33.9 Income from unconsolidated operations increased $0.9 million in 2018 from the prior year. This increase was mainly attributable to higher earnings from our largest joint venture, McCormick de Mexico, partially offset by the impact of a higher elimination of earnings associated with our minority interests in 2018 than in 2017. We own 50% of most of our unconsolidated joint ventures, including McCormick de Mexico, which represented 58% of the sales and 76% of the income of our unconsolidated operations in 2018. We reported diluted earnings per share of $7.00 in 2018, compared to $3.72 in 2017. The table below outlines the major components of the change in diluted earnings per share from 2017 to 2018. The increase in operating income in the table below includes the impact from favorable currency exchange rates in 2018. 2017 Earnings per share diluted $ 3.72 Increase in operating income 0.90 Impact of net discrete tax benefit recognized as a result of the U.S. Tax Act 2.26 Decrease in special charges 0.02 Decrease in transaction and integration expenses attributable to RB Foods acquisition 0.29 Increase in interest expense (0.46 ) Other impact of income taxes 0.40 Increase in other income 0.05 Increase in unconsolidated income 0.01 Impact of higher shares outstanding (0.19 ) 2018 Earnings per share diluted $ 7.00 We measure the performance of our business segments based on operating income, excluding special charges and transaction and integration expenses related to our RB Foods acquisition. See note 15 of the accompanying financial statements for additional information on our segment measures as well as for a reconciliation by segment of operating income, excluding special charges as well as transaction and integration expenses related to our RB Foods acquisition, to consolidated operating income. In the following discussion, we refer to our previously described measure of segment profit as segment operating income. Consumer Segment 2018 2017 Net sales $ 3,318.0 $ 2,970.1 Percent growth 11.7 % 7.9 % Components of percent growth in net sales increase (decrease): Volume and product mix 1.7 % 0.3 % Pricing actions 0.6 % 2.2 % Acquisitions 8.0 % 5.5 % Foreign exchange 1.4 % (0.1 )% Segment operating income $ 644.9 $ 564.2 Segment operating income margin 19.4 % 19.0 % Sales of our consumer segment grew by 11.7% as compared to 2017 and grew by 10.3% on a constant currency basis. Higher volume and product mix added 1.7% to sales, while the impact of 2018 pricing actions added 0.6%. The incremental impact of the RB Foods acquisition added 8.0% to sales. The favorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates increased consumer segment sales by 1.4% compared to 2017 and is excluded from our measure of sales growth of 10.3% on a constant currency basis. In the Americas, consumer sales rose 13.5% in 2018 as compared to 2017 and rose by 13.4% on a constant currency basis. Higher volume and product mix added 0.9% to sales, pricing actions added 1.0% to sales, and the incremental impact of acquisitions added 11.5% to sales. The favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates increased sales by 0.1% compared to 2017 and is excluded from our measure of sales growth of 13.4% on a constant currency basis. In the EMEA region, consumer sales increased 6.5% in 2018 as compared to 2017 and rose 1.1% on a constant currency basis. Volume and product mix increased sales by 1.3%, led by growth in France and export sales to developing markets. This growth was partially offset by sales weakness in Poland driven by competitive conditions. The incremental impact of the RB Foods acquisition added 0.8% to sales, while the impact of pricing actions reduced sales by 1.0%. The favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates increased sales by 5.4% compared to 2017 and is excluded from our measure of sales increase of 1.1% on a constant currency basis. In the Asia/Pacific region, consumer sales increased 10.2% as compared to 2017 and increased 7.7% on a constant currency basis. Higher volume and product mix added 6.4% to sales. Growth was led by China through product innovation and increased distribution, partially offset by lower private label sales in Australia. Pricing actions added 1.3% to sales. The favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates increased sales by 2.5% compared to 2017 and is excluded from our measure of sales decline of 7.7% on a constant currency basis. We grew segment operating income for our consumer segment by $80.7 million, or 14.3%, in 2018 compared to 2017. The favorable impact of greater sales and higher CCI-led cost savings more than offset the unfavorable impact of higher costs and brand marketing expense. On a constant currency basis, segment operating income for our consumer segment rose 13.4%. Segment operating income margin for our consumer segment rose by 40 basis points to 19.4% in 2018 from 19.0% in 2017. The increase in segment operating income margin was driven by a higher gross profit margin and the leverage of fixed and semi-fixed elements of SG&A over the higher sales base in 2018 as compared to 2017. Those factors were partially offset by an increase in SG&A as a percentage of sales, driven by increased investment in brand marketing and higher distribution costs, including freight. The previously described gross profit margin improvement includes the incremental accretive impact attributable to the RB Foods acquisition as well as expansion in our core business, in part, from CCI-led cost savings and favorable product mix. Flavor Solutions Segment 2018 2017 Net sales $ 2,090.9 $ 1,864.0 Percent growth 12.2 % 12.4 % Components of percent growth in net sales increase (decrease): Volume and product mix 3.1 % 4.0 % Pricing actions 0.3 % 2.0 % Acquisitions 8.0 % 8.0 % Foreign exchange 0.8 % (1.6 )% Segment operating income $ 297.2 $ 222.1 Segment operating income margin 14.2 % 11.9 % Sales of our flavor solutions segment increased 12.2% as compared to 2017 and increased by 11.4% on a constant currency basis. Higher volume and product mix added 3.1% to sales and pricing actions added 0.3%. Flavor solutions segment sales rose in 2018 due to the incremental impact of acquisitions, primarily the RB Foods acquisition, which added 8.0% to sales. The favorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates increased flavor solutions segment sales by 0.8% compared to 2017 and is excluded from our measure of sales growth of 11.4% on a constant currency basis. In the Americas, flavor solutions sales rose 14.8% in 2018 as compared to 2017 and rose 14.7% on a constant currency basis. Higher volume and product mix added 3.0% to sales led by increased sales to several large custom flavor solutions customers partially offset by the impact from a global realignment of a major customer's sales to EMEA, together with the exit of certain lower margin business. Pricing actions added 0.3% to sales and the incremental impact of our RB Foods acquisition added 11.4% to sales. The favorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates increased sales by 0.1% compared to 2017 and is excluded from our measure of sales growth of 14.7% on a constant currency basis. In the EMEA region, flavor solutions sales increased 8.6% in 2018 as compared to 2017 and increased 6.3% on a constant currency basis. Higher volume and product mix added 4.1% to sales, driven by increased sales to quick service restaurants, broad based growth in Turkey, and the previously described global realignment of a major customer's sales from the Americas to EMEA. Pricing actions added 1.0% to sales and the incremental impact of the Giotti and RB Foods acquisitions added 1.2% to sales. The favorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates increased sales by 2.3% compared to 2017 and is excluded from our measure of sales growth of 6.3% on a constant currency basis. In the Asia/Pacific region, flavor solutions sales increased 3.2% in 2018 as compared to 2017 and increased 0.9% on a constant currency basis. Higher volume and product mix added 1.4% to sales, while pricing actions reduced sales by 0.5% as compared to 2017. Sales growth was led by new products and limited time offers in China, partially offset by net sales declines in Australia, which were partially attributable to the exit of certain lower margin business. The favorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates increased sales by 2.3% compared to 2017 and is excluded from our measure of sales growth of 0.9% on a constant currency basis. We grew segment operating income for our flavor solutions segment by $75.1 million, or 33.8%, in 2018 compared to 2017. The increase in segment operating income was due to the incremental impact of the RB Foods acquisition, coupled with CCI-led cost savings. On a constant currency basis, segment operating income for our flavor solutions segment rose 33.8%. Segment operating income margin for our flavor solutions segment rose by 230 basis points to 14.2% in 2018 from 11.9% in 2017 and was driven by a higher gross profit margin offset, in part, by higher SG&A as a percentage of net sales, which reflects higher distribution costs, including freight. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 2017 COMPARED TO 2016 2017 2016 Net sales $ 4,834.1 $ 4,411.5 Percent growth 9.6 % 2.7 % Components of percent growth in net sales increase (decrease): Volume and product mix 1.7 % 1.7 % Pricing actions 2.1 % 1.5 % Acquisitions 6.5 % 2.3 % Foreign exchange (0.7 )% (2.8 )% Sales for 2017 increased by 9.6% from 2016 and by 10.3% on a constant currency basis. Both the consumer and flavor solutions segments drove higher volume and product mix that added 1.7% to sales. This was driven by product innovation, brand marketing and expanded distribution. Pricing actions, taken in response to increased material costs, added 2.1% to sales. The incremental impact of acquisitions completed in 2017 (both RB Foods and Giotti) and in 2016 (principally, Gourmet Garden) added 6.5% to sales. These factors offset an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates that reduced sales by 0.7% compared to 2016 and is excluded from our measure of sales growth of 10.3% on a constant currency basis. 2017 2016 Gross profit $ 2,010.2 $ 1,831.7 Gross profit margin 41.6 % 41.5 % In 2017, our gross profit margin rose 10 basis points to 41.6% from 41.5% in 2016, as the favorable impact of pricing actions, CCI-led cost savings and more favorable business mix more than offset unfavorable material cost inflation, including unfavorable foreign currency effects. In addition, our gross profit for 2017 was burdened by $20.9 million of transaction and integration expenses, representing the amortization of the fair value adjustment to the acquired inventories of RB Foods, that depressed our fiscal 2017 gross profit margin of 41.6% by 40 basis points. Excluding those transaction and integration expenses, adjusted gross profit margin rose 50 basis points from 41.5% in 2016 to 42.0% in 2017. 2017 2016 Selling, general & administrative expense $ 1,244.8 $ 1,175.0 Percent of net sales 25.8 % 26.6 % Selling, general and administrative expense was $1,244.8 million in 2017 compared to $1,175.0 million in 2016, an increase of $69.8 million. That increase in SG&A expense was driven by the impact of acquisitions, together with increased brand marketing and higher freight costs, partially offset by lower acquisition-related costs related to both completed and uncompleted acquisitions, all as compared to the 2016 levels. The lower acquisition-related costs in the 2017 period were primarily the result of costs associated with our investigation in 2016 of a large potential acquisition in the U.K. that we ultimately declined to pursue. In addition, acquisition-related costs attributable to RB Foods in 2017 are not included in SG&A expense but are instead included in transaction and integration expenses in our income statement (and are further discussed below). SG&A expense as a percentage of net sales was 25.8%, an 80-basis point improvement from 2016. Driving this reduction in SG&A expense as a percentage of net sales, in addition to the items described above, were lower employee benefit expense, including lower pension and other postretirement benefit expense, together with benefits from the organization and streamlining actions described in note 3 of the accompanying financial statements. 2017 2016 Special charges included in cost of goods sold $ $ 0.3 Other special charges in the income statement 22.2 15.7 Total $ 22.2 $ 16.0 During 2017, we recorded $22.2 million of special charges, consisting primarily of $12.7 million related to third party expenses incurred as part of our evaluation of changes relating to our GE initiative, $2.8 million related to employee severance benefits and other costs associated with the relocation of one of our Chinese manufacturing facilities, $2.5 million for severance and other exit costs associated with the closure of our manufacturing plant in Portugal, and $1.7 million related to employee severance benefits and other costs associated with actions related to the transfer of certain manufacturing operations to a new facility then under construction in Thailand. Of the $16.0 million of special charges recorded in 2016, $0.3 million were recorded in cost of goods sold. The 2016 special charges principally consist of $5.7 million related to our EMEA reorganization, which began in 2015, $2.8 million related to our exit from a consolidated joint venture in South Africa, $1.9 million for other exit costs related to the discontinuance of non-profitable product lines of our Kohinoor business in India initiated in 2015, $1.8 million associated with actions in connection with our planned exit of two leased manufacturing facilities in Singapore and Thailand, and $1.7 million for employee severance actions related to our North American effectiveness initiative begun in 2015. 2017 2016 Transaction expenses included in cost of goods sold $ 20.9 $ Transaction expenses included in other debt costs 15.4 Other transaction and integration expenses 40.8 Total $ 77.1 $ Total transaction and integration expenses related to the RB Foods acquisition of $77.1 million primarily consist of amortization of the acquisition-date fair value adjustment of inventories of $20.9 million that is included in cost of goods sold; outside advisory, service and consulting costs; employee-related costs; and other costs related to the acquisition, including the costs related to the bridge financing commitment of $15.4 million that is included in other debt costs. 2017 2016 Interest expense $ 95.7 $ 56.0 Other income, net 3.5 4.2 Interest expense for 2017 was sharply higher than the prior year, primarily due to higher average borrowings related to our incurrence of $3.7 billion in debt in August 2017 to finance our acquisition of RB Foods (see note 6 of the accompanying financial statements). Other income, net, for 2017 was $0.7 million lower than the 2016 level, primarily due to a gain on the 2016 sale of a non-operating asset. 2017 2016 Income from consolidated operations before income taxes $ 594.8 $ 589.2 Income taxes 151.3 153.0 Effective tax rate 25.4 % 26.0 % The effective tax rate decreased 60 basis points to 25.4% in 2017, from 26.0% in 2016, primarily because of an increase in net discrete tax benefits. Net discrete tax benefits increased by $3.1 million, from $21.1 million in 2016 to $24.2 million in 2017. In 2017, discrete items include $10.7 million of excess tax benefits associated with share-based payments to employees due to our adoption of ASU No. 2016-09 Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting on a prospective basis as of the beginning of our 2017 fiscal year. Both 2017 and 2016 included discrete tax benefits for the reversal of reserves for unrecognized tax benefits, net of additional taxes provided, for the expiration of statutes of limitation and, in 2017, settlements with taxing authorities in several tax jurisdictions. Discrete tax expense in 2017 included expense associated with the establishment of valuation allowances on non-U.S. deferred tax assets due to a change in our assessment of the recoverability of those deferred tax assets. Discrete tax items in 2016 included benefits associated with the reversal of valuation allowances on non-U.S. deferred tax assets due to a change in our assessment of the recoverability of those deferred tax assets. 2017 2016 Income from unconsolidated operations $ 33.9 $ 36.1 Income from unconsolidated operations decreased $2.2 million in 2017 from the prior year. This decrease was mainly attributable to the impact of eliminating earnings associated with our minority interests in 2017 as compared to a loss in 2016 and to lower earnings from our largest joint venture, McCormick de Mexico, for which the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates more than offset the favorable impact, in local currency, of higher sales and net income. We own 50% of most of our unconsolidated joint ventures, including McCormick de Mexico which represented 57% of the sales and 74% of the income of our unconsolidated operations in 2017. We reported diluted earnings per share of $3.72 in 2017, compared to $3.69 in 2016. The table below outlines the major components of the change in diluted earnings per share from 2016 to 2017. The increase in adjusted operating income in the table below includes the impact from unfavorable currency exchange rates in 2017. 2016 Earnings per share diluted $ 3.69 Increase in operating income 0.75 Increase in special charges (0.02 ) Transaction and integration expenses (including other debt costs) attributable to RB Foods acquisition (0.42 ) Increase in interest expense (0.23 ) Impact of income taxes (0.02 ) Decrease in income from unconsolidated operations (0.02 ) Impact of higher shares (0.01 ) 2017 Earnings per share diluted $ 3.72 Consumer Segment 2017 2016 Net sales $ 2,970.1 $ 2,753.2 Percent growth 7.9 % 4.5 % Components of percent growth in net sales increase (decrease): Volume and product mix 0.3 % 1.7 % Pricing actions 2.2 % 1.2 % Acquisitions 5.5 % 3.5 % Foreign exchange (0.1 )% (1.9 )% Segment operating income $ 564.2 $ 490.8 Segment operating income margin 19.0 % 17.8 % Sales of our consumer segment grew by 7.9% as compared to 2016 and grew by 8.0% on a constant currency basis. Higher volume and product mix added 0.3% to sales, and pricing actions, taken in response to increased material costs, added 2.2%. The incremental impact of acquisitions mainly, RB Foods and Gourmet Garden, completed in 2017 and 2016, respectively added 5.5% to sales. These factors offset an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates that reduced consumer segment sales by 0.1% compared to 2016 and is excluded from our measure of sales growth of 8.0% on a constant currency basis. In the Americas, consumer sales rose 11.2% in 2017 as compared to 2016 and rose by 11.1% on a constant currency basis. Higher volume and product mix added 0.5% to sales, pricing actions added 2.8% to sales, and the incremental impact of acquisitions mainly, RB Foods and Gourmet Garden added 7.8% to sales. The favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates increased sales by 0.1% compared to 2016 and is excluded from our measure of sales growth of 11.1% on a constant currency basis. In the EMEA region, consumer sales declined 1.6% in 2017 as compared to 2016 and declined 2.3% on a constant currency basis. Volume and product mix lowered sales by 3.3%, with weakness in Poland, the U.K. and France. The sales weakness in Poland was driven by competitive conditions, while weakness in the U.K. related to a difficult retail environment, including the effects of a reduction of Schwartz brand products by a large U.K. retailer. Pricing actions added 0.5% to sales and the incremental impact of the RB Foods and Gourmet Garden acquisitions added 0.5% to sales. The favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates increased sales by 0.7% compared to 2016 and is excluded from our measure of sales decline of 2.3% on a constant currency basis. In the Asia/Pacific region, consumer sales increased 6.4% as compared to 2016 and increased 8.9% on a constant currency basis. Higher volume and product mix added 5.1% to sales, with strong results in China that offset a volume and product mix decline in India in 2017, due in part to India's discontinuation of lower-margin product lines that occurred in 2016. Pricing actions added 1.7% to sales and the incremental impact of the Gourmet Garden acquisition added 2.1% to sales. These factors offset an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates that decreased sales by 2.5% compared to 2016 and is excluded from our measure of sales growth of 8.9% on a constant currency basis. We grew segment operating income for our consumer segment by $73.4 million, or 15.0%, in 2017 compared to 2016. The favorable impact of greater sales and cost savings more than offset the unfavorable impact of higher material costs and an increase in brand marketing. On a constant currency basis, segment operating income for our consumer segment rose 14.9%. Segment operating income margin for our consumer segment rose by 120 basis points to 19.0% in 2017 from 17.8% in 2016. Flavor Solutions Segment 2017 2016 Net sales $ 1,864.0 $ 1,658.3 Percent growth (decline) 12.4 % (0.2 )% Components of percent change in net sales increase (decrease): Volume and product mix 4.0 % 1.5 % Pricing actions 2.0 % 2.0 % Acquisitions 8.0 % 0.4 % Foreign exchange (1.6 )% (4.1 )% Segment operating income $ 222.1 $ 166.2 Segment operating income margin 11.9 % 10.0 % Sales of our flavor solutions segment increased 12.4% as compared to 2016 and increased by 14.0% on a constant currency basis. Higher volume and product mix added 4.0% to sales and pricing actions, taken in response to increased material costs, added 2.0%. The incremental impact on 2017 flavor solutions sales of the RB Foods and Giotti acquisitions completed in 2017 added 8.0% to sales. These factors partially offset an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates that reduced flavor solutions segment sales by 1.6% compared to 2016 and is excluded from our measure of sales growth of 14.0% on a constant currency basis. In the Americas, flavor solutions sales rose 10.8% in 2017 as compared to 2016 and rose 11.2% on a constant currency basis. Higher volume and product mix added 3.4% to sales and included growth in sales of branded foodservice products in the U.S. and snack seasonings in the U.S. and Mexico. Pricing actions added 2.1% to sales and the incremental impact of the RB Foods and Gourmet Garden acquisitions added 5.7% to sales. These factors offset an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates that reduced sales by 0.4% compared to 2016 and is excluded from our measure of sales growth of 11.2% on a constant currency basis. In the EMEA region, flavor solutions sales increased 20.5% in 2017 as compared to 2016 and increased 26.9% on a constant currency basis. Higher volume and product mix added 2.7% to sales and included growth in sales to leading quick service restaurants in this region. Pricing actions added 3.1% to sales and the incremental impact of the Giotti and, to a lesser extent, RB Foods acquisitions added 21.1% to sales. These factors partially offset an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates that decreased sales by 6.4% compared to 2016 and is excluded from our measure of sales growth of 26.9% on a constant currency basis. In the Asia/Pacific region, flavor solutions sales increased 9.0% in 2017 as compared to 2016 and increased 10.1% on a constant currency basis. Higher volume and product mix added 9.6% to sales and included growth in sales to leading quick service restaurants supplied from our facilities in both China and Southeast Asia. Pricing actions added 0.1% to sales and the incremental impact of the Gourmet Garden acquisition added 0.4% to sales. These factors partially offset an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates that reduced sales by 1.1% compared to 2016 and is excluded from our measure of sales growth of 10.1% on a constant currency basis. We grew segment operating income for our flavor solutions segment by $55.9 million, or 33.6%, in 2017 compared to 2016. The favorable impact of greater sales and cost savings more than offset the unfavorable impact of higher material costs. On a constant currency basis, segment operating income for our flavor solutions segment rose 37.1%. Segment operating income margin for our flavor solutions segment rose by 190 basis points to 11.9% in 2017 from 10.0% in 2016 and reflected the impact of our efforts to shift our business mix to more value-added products through innovation and acquisitions. NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES The following tables include financial measures of adjusted gross profit, adjusted gross profit margin, adjusted operating income, adjusted operating income margin, adjusted income from unconsolidated operations, adjusted income tax expense, adjusted income tax rate, adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share. These financial measures also exclude, for 2018, the net non-recurring income tax benefit of $301.5 million related to the U.S. Tax Act as these items significantly impact comparability between years. These represent non-GAAP financial measures which are prepared as a complement to our financial results prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles. These financial measures exclude the impact, as applicable, of the following: Special charges Special charges consist of expenses associated with certain actions undertaken by the company to reduce fixed costs, simplify or improve processes, and improve our competitiveness and are of such significance in terms of both up-front costs and organizational/structural impact to require advance approval by our Management Committee, comprised of our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; President, Global Flavor Solutions Segment and McCormick International; President, Global Consumer Segment and Americas; Senior Vice President, Human Relations; and Senior Vice President, Strategy and Global Enablement. Upon presentation of any such proposed action (including details with respect to estimated costs, which generally consist principally of employee severance and related benefits, together with ancillary costs associated with the action that may include a non-cash component or a component which relates to inventory adjustments that are included in cost of goods sold; impacted employees or operations; expected timing; and expected savings) to the Management Committee and the Committee advance approval, expenses associated with the approved action are classified as special charges upon recognition and monitored on an ongoing basis through completion. Transaction and integration expenses associated with the RB Foods acquisition Beginning in 2017, we revised our non-GAAP measures to exclude certain costs associated with our acquisition of RB Foods in August of 2017 and its subsequent integration into the company. We made this change because of the significance of the RB Foods acquisition and, therefore, the impact on the comparability of our results of the costs associated with the acquisition and subsequent integration. Such costs, which we refer to as transaction and integration expenses include the impact of the acquisition-date fair value adjustment for inventory, transaction costs associated with the acquisition, integration costs following the acquisition, and the bridge financing costs. In our income statement, we include the impact of the fair value adjustment for inventory in cost of goods sold, the bridge financing cost in other debt costs, and present all other transaction and integration costs associated with the RB Foods acquisition in our income statement on the line, "Transaction and integration expenses (related to RB Foods acquisition)." The size of this acquisition and related costs distinguishes it from our past, recent and smaller acquisitions, the costs of which have not been excluded from our non-GAAP financial measures. Income taxes associated with the U.S. Tax Act In connection with the enactment of the U.S. Tax Act in December 2017, we recorded a net income tax benefit of $301.5 million during the year ended November 30, 2018, which includes the impact of the tax benefit from revaluation of net U.S. deferred tax liabilities based on the new lower corporate income tax rate and the tax expense associated with the one-time transition tax on previously unremitted earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries. Details with respect to the composition of special charges, transaction and integration expenses (including other debt costs) and income taxes associated with the U.S. Tax Act recorded for the periods and in the amounts set forth below are included in notes 2, 3 and 12, respectively, of the accompanying financial statements. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures are important. The exclusion of the items noted above provides additional information that enables enhanced comparisons to prior periods and, accordingly, facilitates the development of future projections and earnings growth prospects. This information is also used by management to measure the profitability of our ongoing operations and analyze our business performance and trends. These non-GAAP financial measures may be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but they should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies because other companies may not calculate them in the same manner that we do. We intend to continue to provide these non-GAAP financial measures as part of our future earnings discussions and, therefore, the inclusion of these non-GAAP financial measures will provide consistency in our financial reporting. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to GAAP financial results is provided below (in millions, except per share data): 2018 2017 2016 Gross profit $ 2,371.6 $ 2,010.2 $ 1,831.7 Impact of special charges, transaction and integration expenses included in cost of goods sold (1) 20.9 0.3 Adjusted gross profit $ 2,371.6 $ 2,031.1 $ 1,832.0 Adjusted gross profit margin (2) 43.8 % 42.0 % 41.5 % Operating income $ 903.3 $ 702.4 $ 641.0 Impact of special charges, transaction and integration expenses included in cost of goods sold (1) 20.9 0.3 Impact of other transaction and integration expenses (1) 22.5 40.8 Impact of other special charges 16.3 22.2 15.7 Adjusted operating income $ 942.1 $ 786.3 $ 657.0 % increase versus prior year 19.8 % 19.7 % 7.0 % Adjusted operating income margin (2) 17.4 % 16.3 % 14.9 % Income from unconsolidated operations $ 34.8 $ 33.9 $ 36.1 Impact of special charges attributable to non-controlling interests (3) (1.9 ) Adjusted income from unconsolidated operations $ 34.8 $ 33.9 $ 34.2 % increase (decrease) versus prior year 2.7 % (0.9 )% (1.4 )% Income tax (benefit) expense $ (157.3 ) $ 151.3 $ 153.0 Non-recurring benefit, net, of the U.S. Tax Act (4) 301.5 Impact of transaction and integration expenses 4.9 23.6 Impact of special charges 3.8 6.4 2.7 Adjusted income tax expense $ 152.9 $ 181.3 $ 155.7 Adjusted income tax rate (5) 19.6 % 26.1 % 25.7 % Net income $ 933.4 $ 477.4 $ 472.3 Impact of total transaction and integration expenses (1) 17.6 53.5 Impact of total special charges 12.5 15.8 13.0 Impact of special charges attributable to non-controlling interests (3) (1.9 ) Non-recurring benefit, net, of the U.S. Tax Act (4) (301.5 ) Adjusted net income $ 662.0 $ 546.7 $ 483.4 % increase versus prior year 21.1 % 13.1 % 7.5 % Earnings per share diluted $ 7.00 $ 3.72 $ 3.69 Impact of total transaction and integration expenses (1) 0.13 0.42 Impact of total special charges 0.10 0.12 0.10 Impact of special charges attributable to non-controlling interests (3) (0.01 ) Non-recurring benefit, net, of the U.S. Tax Act (4) (2.26 ) Adjusted earnings per share diluted $ 4.97 $ 4.26 $ 3.78 % increase versus prior year 16.7 % 12.7 % 8.6 % (1) As more fully described in note 2 of the accompanying financial statements, transaction and integration expenses related to the acquisition of RB Foods are recorded in our consolidated income statement as follows for the years ended November 30, 2018 and 2017 (in millions, except per share amounts): 2018 2017 Transaction and integration expenses included in cost of goods sold $ $ 20.9 Reflected in transaction and integration expenses 22.5 40.8 Transaction and integration expenses included in operating income 22.5 61.7 Transaction and integration expenses included in other debt costs 15.4 Total pre-tax transaction and integration expenses 22.5 77.1 Less: Tax effect (4.9 ) (23.6 ) Total after-tax transaction and integration expenses $ 17.6 $ 53.5 (2) Adjusted gross profit margin is calculated as adjusted gross profit as a percentage of net sales for each period presented. Adjusted operating income margin is calculated as adjusted operating income as a percentage of net sales for each period presented. (3) Represents the portion of the total special charge of $2.8 million, net of tax of $0.9 million, associated with our exit of a consolidated joint venture in South Africa, attributable to our former joint venture partner. (4) The non-recurring income tax benefit, net, associated with enactment of the U.S. Tax Act of $301.5 million for the year ended November 30, 2018 is more fully described in note 12 of the accompanying financial statements. (5) Adjusted income tax rate is calculated as adjusted income tax expense as a percentage of income from consolidated operations before income taxes, excluding transaction and integration expenses and special charges, or $780.1 million, $694.1 million, and $605.2 million for the years ended November 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Estimate for the year ending November 30, 2019 Earnings per share diluted $5.09 to $5.19 Impact of special charges 0.08 Adjusted earnings per share diluted $5.17 to $5.27 Because we are a multi-national company, we are subject to variability of our reported U.S. dollar results due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Those changes have been volatile over the past several years. The exclusion of the effects of foreign currency exchange, or what we refer to as amounts expressed on a constant currency basis, is a non-GAAP measure. We believe that this non-GAAP measure provides additional information that enables enhanced comparison to prior periods excluding the translation effects of changes in rates of foreign currency exchange and provides additional insight into the underlying performance of our operations located outside of the U.S. It should be noted that our presentation herein of amounts and percentage changes on a constant currency basis does not exclude the impact of foreign currency transaction gains and losses (that is, the impact of transactions denominated in other than the local currency of any of our subsidiaries in their local currency reported results). Percentage changes in sales and adjusted operating income expressed on a constant currency basis are presented excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange. To present this information for historical periods, current year results for entities reporting in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at the average exchange rates in effect during the prior fiscal year, rather than at the actual average exchange rates in effect during the current fiscal year. As a result, the foreign currency impact is equal to the current year results in local currencies multiplied by the change in the average foreign currency exchange rate between the current year and the prior fiscal year. The tables set forth below present our growth in net sales and adjusted operating income on a constant currency basis as follows: (1) to present our growth in net sales and adjusted operating income for 2018 on a constant currency basis, net sales and adjusted operating income for 2018 for entities reporting in currencies other than the U.S. dollar have been translated using the average foreign exchange rates in effect for 2017 and compared to the reported results for 2017; and (2) to present our growth in net sales and adjusted operating income for 2017 on a constant currency basis, net sales and operating income for 2017 for entities reporting in currencies other than the U.S. dollar have been translated using the average foreign exchange rates in effect for 2016 and compared to the reported results for 2016.

A leverage ratio is a widely-used measure of ability to repay outstanding debt obligations and is a meaningful metric to investors in evaluating financial leverage. We believe that our leverage ratio is a meaningful metric to investors in evaluating our financial leverage and may be different than the method used by other companies to calculate such a leverage ratio. We determine our leverage ratio as net debt (which we define as total debt, net of cash in excess of $75.0 million) to adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (Adjusted EBITDA). We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income plus expenses for interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, less interest income and as further adjusted for cash and non-cash acquisition-related transaction and integration expenses (which may include the effect of the fair value adjustment of acquired inventory on cost of goods sold), special charges and stock-based compensation expenses. Adjusted EBITDA and our leverage ratio are both non-GAAP financial measures. Our determination of the leverage ratio is consistent with the terms of our $1.0 billion revolving credit facility and our term loans which require us to maintain our leverage ratio below certain levels. Under those agreements, the applicable leverage ratio is reduced annually. As of November 30, 2018, our capacity under the revolving credit facility is not affected by these covenants. We do not expect that these covenants would limit our access to our revolving credit facility for the foreseeable future; however, the leverage ratio could restrict our ability to utilize this facility. We expect to comply with this financial covenant for the foreseeable future. The following table reconciles our net income to Adjusted EBITDA for the years ended November 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016: 2018 2017 2016 Net income $ 933.4 $ 477.4 $ 472.3 Depreciation and amortization 150.7 125.2 108.7 Interest expense 174.6 95.7 56.0 Income tax expense (benefit) (157.3 ) 151.3 153.0 EBITDA 1,101.4 849.6 790.0 Adjustments to EBITDA (1) 57.3 117.4 36.1 Adjusted EBITDA $ 1,158.7 $ 967.0 $ 826.1 Net debt (2) $ 4,674.8 $ 4,915.3 $ 1,403.8 Leverage ratio (Net debt/Adjusted EBITDA) (3) 4.0 5.1 1.7 (1) Adjustments to EBITDA are determined under the leverage ratio covenant in our $1.0 billion revolving credit facility and term loan agreements and includes special charges, stock-based compensation expense and, for the trailing twelve-month periods ended November 30, 2018 and 2017, transaction and integration expenses (related to RB Foods acquisition), including other debt costs. (2) The leverage ratio covenant in our $1.0 billion revolving credit facility and the term loan agreements define net debt as the sum of short-term borrowings, current portion of long-term debt, and long-term debt, less the amount of cash and cash equivalents that exceeds $75.0 million. (3) The leverage ratio covenant in our $1.0 billion revolving credit facility and the term loan agreements provide that Adjusted EBITDA also includes the pro forma impact of acquisitions. As of November 30, 2017, our leverage ratio under the terms of those agreements, including the pro forma impact of acquisitions was 4.5. Our long-term target for our leverage ratio is 1.5 to 1.8. Our leverage ratio can be temporarily impacted by our acquisition activity. LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL CONDITION 2018 2017 2016 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 821.2 $ 815.3 $ 658.1 Net cash used in investing activities (158.5 ) (4,508.3 ) (267.1 ) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities (751.1 ) 3,756.0 (371.5 ) We generate strong cash flow from operations which enables us to fund operating projects and investments that are designed to meet our growth objectives, service our debt, increase our dividend, fund capital projects and make share repurchases when appropriate. Due to the cyclical nature of a portion of our business, we generate much of our cash flow in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year. In the cash flow statement, the changes in operating assets and liabilities are presented excluding the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, as these do not reflect actual cash flows. Accordingly, the amounts in the cash flow statement do not agree with changes in the operating assets and liabilities that are presented in the balance sheet. The reported values of our assets and liabilities held in our non-U.S. subsidiaries and affiliates can be significantly affected by fluctuations in foreign exchange rates between periods. At November 30, 2018, the exchange rates for the Euro, the British pound sterling, Canadian dollar, Australian dollar, Polish zloty and Chinese renminbi were lower versus the U.S. dollar than at November 30, 2017. Operating Cash Flow Operating cash flow was $821.2 million in 2018, $815.3 million in 2017 and $658.1 million in 2016. The increase in cash flow from operations in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to higher net income, exclusive of the non-cash non-recurring net income tax benefit of $309.4 million related to the U.S. Tax Act. As more fully described below, our working capital management favorably impacted operating cash flow in both 2018 and 2017. In 2018, those increases were partially offset by a higher use of cash from other operating assets and liabilities partially related to the timing of our payment of transaction and integration expenses as well as of interest on indebtedness related to our acquisition of RB Foods, as compared to the source of cash in 2017. The improvement in cash flow from operations in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily attributable to improvements in cash flow generated from inventories and accounts payable and the favorable timing of our payment of transaction and integration expenses as well as of interest on indebtedness related to our acquisition of RB Foods, which was partially offset by the timing of employee benefit payments. Our working capital management principally related to inventory, trade accounts receivable, and accounts payable impacts our operating cash flow. The change in inventory had a significant impact on the variability in cash flow from operations. It was a use of cash in 2018, a significant source of cash in 2017 and a significant use of cash in 2016. The change in trade accounts receivable has varied in the last three years, as it was a source of cash in 2018 and a use of cash in 2017 and 2016. The change in accounts payable was a significant source of cash in all three years, but more so in 2017 compared to 2018 and 2016. Dividends received from unconsolidated affiliates, which were higher in 2018 as compared to 2017 and lower in 2017 as compared to 2016, also impacted our cash flow from operations. In addition to operating cash flow, we also use cash conversion cycle ("CCC") to measure our working capital management. This metric is different than operating cash flow in that it uses average balances instead of specific point in time measures. CCC is a calculation of the number of days, on average, that it takes us to convert a cash outlay for resources, such as raw materials, to a cash inflow from collection of accounts receivable. Our goal is to lower our CCC over time. We calculate CCC as follows: Days sales outstanding (average trade accounts receivable divided by average daily net sales) plus days in inventory (average inventory divided by average daily cost of goods sold) less days payable outstanding (average trade accounts payable divided by average daily cost of goods sold plus the average daily change in inventory). The following table outlines our cash conversion cycle (in days) over the last three years: 2018 2017 2016 Cash Conversion Cycle 55.5 76.6 88.5 The decreases in CCC in 2018 from 2017 and in 2017 from 2016 were due, in both instances, to an increase in our days payable outstanding as a result of extending our payment terms to suppliers and, to a lesser extent, a decrease in our days in inventory. Investing Cash Flow Net cash used in investing activities was $158.5 million in 2018, $4,508.3 million in 2017 and $267.1 million in 2016. The variability between years is principally a result of cash usage related to our acquisitions of businesses, which amounted to $4.2 million in 2018, $4,327.4 million in 2017 and $120.6 million in 2016. See note 2 of the accompanying financial statements for further details related to these acquisitions. Capital expenditures were $169.1 million in 2018, $182.4 million in 2017 and $153.8 million in 2016. We expect 2019 capital expenditures to approximate $210 million to support our planned growth and other initiatives. Financing Cash Flow Net cash used in financing activities was $751.1 million in 2018, as compared to cash provided of $3,756.0 million in 2017 and cash used of $371.5 million in 2016. The variability between years is principally a result of changes in our net borrowings, share repurchase activity and dividends, all as described below. In 2018, our net borrowing activity used cash of $466.5 million. In 2017 and 2016, our net borrowing activity provided cash of $3,574.6 million and $55.7 million, respectively. In 2018, we increased our short-term borrowings, on a net basis, by $305.5 million and borrowed $25.9 million under long-term borrowing arrangements. In 2018, we repaid $797.9 million of long-term debt, including the $250 million 5.75% notes that matured on December 15, 2017 and $545.0 million of our $1,500.0 million term loans issued in August 2017. In 2017, we received $3,977.6 million of net proceeds on the issuance of $4,000.0 million of long-term debt, including $2,500.0 million of notes and $1,500.0 million of term loans (see note 6 of the accompanying financial statements for additional information with respect to this long-term debt). We also paid $7.7 million of costs associated with the issuance of debt and our $1.0 billion revolving credit facility. In 2017, we repaid $272.7 million of long-term debt, including $268.8 million of our $1,500.0 million term loans issued in August 2017. In 2017, we repaid $134.6 million of short-term borrowings. In 2016, net proceeds from short-term borrowings of $251.7 million were used to pay off $200 million of 5.20% notes that matured in December 2015 and for general corporate purposes. The following table outlines the activity in our share repurchase programs: 2018 2017 2016 Number of shares of common stock 0.5 1.4 2.6 Dollar amount $ 62.3 $ 137.8 $ 242.7 As of November 30, 2018, $127 million remained of a $600 million share repurchase program that was authorized by our Board of Directors in March 2015. The timing and amount of any shares repurchased is determined by our management based on its evaluation of market conditions and other factors. Due to our increased level of indebtedness related to our acquisition of RB Foods in August 2017, we have curtailed our acquisition and share repurchase activity for a period in order to enable a return to our pre-acquisition credit profile. Although we have curtailed our share repurchase activity, we repurchased shares in 2018 to mitigate the effect of shares issued upon the exercise of stock options and expect to continue this practice in 2019. During 2017, we issued approximately 6.35 million shares of our Common Stock Non-Voting to fund our acquisition of RB Foods (see notes 2 and 13 of the accompanying financial statements), which included approximately 0.8 million shares from the exercise of the underwriters' option to purchase additional shares. The net proceeds from this issuance, after the underwriting discount and related expenses, was $554.0 million. In addition, we also issued $29.5 million of common stock related to our stock compensation plans in 2017. All of the common stock issued in 2018 and 2016 related to our stock compensation plans, including the effects of the related excess tax benefits. Our dividend history over the past three years is as follows: 2018 2017 2016 Total dividends paid $ 273.4 $ 237.6 $ 217.8 Dividends paid per share 2.08 1.88 1.72 Percentage increase per share 10.6 % 9.3 % 7.5 % In November 2018, the Board of Directors approved a 9.6% increase in the quarterly dividend from $0.52 to $0.57 per share. The following table presents our leverage ratios for the trailing twelve-month periods ended November 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016: 2018 2017 2016 Leverage ratio 4.0 5.1 (1) 1.7 (1) The leverage ratio covenant in our $1.0 billion revolving credit facility and the term loan agreements, both outstanding at November 30, 2018 and 2017, provide that Adjusted EBITDA under that covenant also include the pro forma impact of acquisitions, as applicable. As of November 30, 2017, our leverage ratio under the terms of those agreements, including the pro forma impact of acquisitions, was 4.5. Our leverage ratio was 4.0 as of November 30, 2018, as compared to the ratios of 5.1 and 1.7 as of November 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The decrease in the ratio from 5.1 as of November 30, 2017 to 4.0 as of November 30, 2018 is principally due to an increase in our adjusted EBITDA, which was driven by the previously described improvement in operating income as compared to 2017. In addition, the ratio was favorably impacted by our lower level of net debt at November 30, 2018. The increase in the ratio from 1.7 as of November 30, 2016 to 5.1 as of November 30, 2017 is principally due to an increase in total debt associated with the funding, net of cash flow from operations for 2017, of our acquisitions of RB Foods and Giotti, repurchases of common stock and payment of dividends. Most of our cash is in our foreign subsidiaries. We manage our worldwide cash requirements by considering available funds among the many subsidiaries through which we conduct our business and the cost effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed. Prior to the enactment of the U.S. Tax Act on December 22, 2017, the permanent repatriation of cash balances from certain of our subsidiaries could have had adverse tax consequences; however, those balances are generally available without legal restrictions to fund ordinary business operations, capital projects and future acquisitions. Currently, the repatriation of cash balances from certain of our subsidiaries could still have adverse tax consequences related to the effects of withholding and other taxes. At November 30, 2018, we temporarily used $181.2 million of cash from our foreign subsidiaries to pay down short-term debt in the U.S. The average short-term borrowings outstanding for the years ended November 30, 2018 and 2017 were $700.0 million and $630.6 million, respectively. The total average debt outstanding for the years ended November 30, 2018 and 2017 was $5,081.6 million and $2,996.6 million, respectively. See notes 6 and 7 of the accompanying financial statements for further details of these transactions. Credit and Capital Markets The following summarizes the more significant impacts of credit and capital markets on our business: CREDIT FACILITIES Cash flows from operating activities are our primary source of liquidity for funding growth, share repurchases, dividends and capital expenditures. We also rely on our revolving credit facility, or borrowings backed by this facility, to fund seasonal working capital needs and other general corporate requirements. In August 2017, we entered into a five-year $1.0 billion revolving credit facility, which will expire in August 2022. The current pricing for the credit facility, on a fully drawn basis, is LIBOR plus 1.25%. The pricing of the credit facility is based on a credit rating grid that contains a fully drawn maximum pricing of the credit facility equal to LIBOR plus 1.75%. This facility replaces our prior facilities: (i) a five-year $750 million revolving credit facility that was due to expire in June 2020 and (ii) a 364-day $250 million revolving facility, which we entered into in the second quarter of 2017 and that was due to expire in March 2018. We generally use this facility to support our issuance of commercial paper. If the commercial paper market is not available or viable, we could borrow directly under our revolving credit facility. The facility is made available by a syndicate of banks, with various commitments per bank. If any of the banks in this syndicate are unable to perform on their commitments, our liquidity could be impacted, which could reduce our ability to grow through funding of seasonal working capital. In addition to our committed revolving credit facility, we have uncommitted credit facilities for $237.3 million as of November 30, 2018, that can be withdrawn based upon the lenders' discretion. We engage in regular communication with all banks participating in our credit facilities. During these communications, none of the banks have indicated that they may be unable to perform on their commitments. In addition, we periodically review our banking and financing relationships, considering the stability of the institutions and other aspects of the relationships. Based on these communications and our monitoring activities, we believe our banks will perform on their commitments. See note 6 of the accompanying financial statements for more details on our financing arrangements. We believe that our internally generated funds and the existing sources of liquidity under our credit facilities are sufficient to fund ongoing operations. PENSION ASSETS AND OTHER INVESTMENTS We hold investments in equity and debt securities in both our qualified defined benefit pension plans and through a rabbi trust for our nonqualified defined benefit pension plan. Cash contributions to pension plans, including unfunded plans, were $13.5 million in 2018, $18.7 million in 2017 and $25.1 million in 2016. It is expected that the 2019 total pension plan contributions will be approximately $12.0 million. Future increases or decreases in pension liabilities and required cash contributions are highly dependent on changes in interest rates and the actual return on plan assets. We base our investment of plan assets, in part, on the duration of each plan liabilities. Across all of our qualified defined benefit pension plans, approximately 61% of assets are invested in equities, 29% in fixed income investments and 10% in other investments. Assets in the rabbi trust are primarily invested in corporate-owned life insurance, the value of which approximates an investment mix of 60% in equities and 40% in fixed income investments. See note 10 of the accompanying financial statements, which provides details on our pension funding. CUSTOMERS AND COUNTERPARTIES See the subsequent section of this discussion under Market Risk Sensitivity Credit Risk. ACQUISITIONS Acquisitions are part of our strategy to increase sales and profits. In fiscal 2018 we purchased the remaining 10% minority ownership interest in our Shanghai subsidiary for a cash payment of $12.7 million. In fiscal 2017, we made the following acquisitions: On December 15, 2016, we purchased 100% of the shares of Enrico Giotti SpA (Giotti), a leading European flavor manufacturer located in Italy, for a cash payment of $123.8 million, net of cash acquired of $1.2 million. The acquisition was funded with cash and short-term borrowings. Giotti is well known in the industry for its innovative beverage, sweet, savory and dairy flavor applications. Our acquisition of Giotti in fiscal 2017 expanded the breadth of value-added products for McCormick's flavor solutions segment, including additional expertise in flavoring health and nutrition products. On August 17, 2017, we completed the acquisition of RB Foods. The purchase price was approximately $4.21 billion, net of acquired cash of $24.3 million, and included a preliminary working capital adjustment of $11.2 million. In December 2017, we paid $4.2 million associated with the final working capital adjustment. The acquisition was funded through our issuance of approximately 6.35 million shares of common stock non-voting (see note 13 of the accompanying financial statements) and through new borrowings comprised of senior unsecured notes and pre-payable term loans (see note 6 of the accompanying financial statements). The acquired market-leading brands of RB Foods include French s, Frank RedHot and Cattlemen s, which are a natural strategic fit with our robust global branded flavor portfolio. We believe that these additions move us to a leading position in the attractive U.S. condiments category and provide significant international growth opportunities for our consumer and flavor solutions segments. The operations of RB Foods have been included as a component of our consumer and flavor solutions segments from the date of acquisition. In fiscal 2016, we made the following acquisitions: On April 19, 2016, we completed the purchase of 100% of the shares of Botanical Food Company, Pty Ltd, owner of the Gourmet Garden brand of packaged herbs ("Gourmet Garden"), a privately held company based in Australia. Gourmet Garden is a global market leader in chilled convenient packaged herbs. Gourmet Garden's products complement our existing branded herb portfolio with the addition of chilled convenient herbs located in the perimeter of the grocery store. We plan to drive sales of the Gourmet Garden brand by continuing to expand global distribution and to build awareness with increased brand investment. The purchase price was $116.2 million, net of cash acquired of $3.3 million, and was financed with a combination of cash and short-term borrowings. Gourmet Garden has been included in our consumer segment since its acquisition. The flavor solutions component of this business, which was not material in 2016, has been included in our flavor solutions segment since 2017. See note 2 of the accompanying financial statements for further details regarding these acquisitions. PERFORMANCE GRAPH SHAREHOLDER RETURN The following line graph compares the yearly change in McCormick cumulative total shareholder return (stock price appreciation plus reinvestment of dividends) on McCormick Non-Voting Common Stock with (1) the cumulative total return of the Standard & Poor 500 Stock Price Index, assuming reinvestment of dividends, and (2) the cumulative total return of the Standard & Poor Packaged Foods & Meats Index, assuming reinvestment of dividends. MARKET RISK SENSITIVITY We utilize derivative financial instruments to enhance our ability to manage risk, including foreign exchange and interest rate exposures, which exist as part of our ongoing business operations. We do not enter into contracts for trading purposes, nor are we a party to any leveraged derivative instrument. The use of derivative financial instruments is monitored through regular communication with senior management and the utilization of written guidelines. The information presented below should be read in conjunction with notes 6 and 7 of the accompanying financial statements. Foreign Exchange Risk We are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency in the following main areas: cash flows related to raw material purchases; the translation of foreign currency earnings to U.S. dollars; the effects of foreign currency on loans between subsidiaries and unconsolidated affiliates and on cash flows related to repatriation of earnings of unconsolidated affiliates. Primary exposures include the U.S. dollar versus the Euro, British pound sterling, Canadian dollar, Polish zloty, Australian dollar, Mexican peso, Chinese renminbi, Indian rupee and Thai baht, as well as the Euro versus the British pound sterling, Australian dollar and Swiss franc. We routinely enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to manage certain of these foreign currency risks. During 2018, the foreign currency translation component in other comprehensive income was principally related to the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on our net investments in our subsidiaries with a functional currency of the British pound sterling, Euro, Polish zloty, Chinese yuan, Canadian dollar and Mexican peso. We did not hedge our net investments in subsidiaries and unconsolidated affiliates during 2018. The following table summarizes the foreign currency exchange contracts held at November 30, 2018. All contracts are valued in U.S. dollars using year-end 2018 exchange rates and have been designated as hedges of foreign currency transactional exposures, firm commitments or anticipated transactions. FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE CONTRACTS AT NOVEMBER 30, 2018 Currency sold Currency received Notional value Average contractual exchange rate Fair value British pound sterling U.S. dollar $ 22.1 1.33 $ 0.7 Canadian dollar U.S. dollar 126.8 0.77 3.2 Australian dollar U.S. dollar 18.2 0.73 Polish zloty U.S. dollar 10.8 3.67 0.3 Australian dollar Euro 44.7 1.63 (1.8 ) Swiss franc Euro 66.2 1.19 (3.7 ) Canadian dollar British pound sterling 29.5 1.71 0.1 U.S. dollar British pound sterling 121.0 1.28 (0.5 ) U.S. dollar Euro 39.6 1.13 (0.1 ) We had a number of smaller contracts at November 30, 2018 with an aggregate notional value of $16.0 million to purchase or sell other currencies, such as the Swiss franc, the Romanian leu and Russian ruble. The aggregate fair value of these contracts was $(0.2) million at November 30, 2018. At November 30, 2017, we had foreign currency exchange contracts for the Euro, British pound sterling, Canadian dollar, Australian dollar, Polish zloty, Swiss franc and others, with a notional value of $405.9 million, all of which matured in 2018. The aggregate fair value of these contracts was $8.0 million at November 30, 2017. Interest Rate Risk Our policy is to manage interest rate risk by entering into both fixed and variable rate debt arrangements. We also use interest rate swaps to minimize worldwide financing costs and to achieve a desired mix of fixed and variable rate debt. The table that follows provides principal cash flows and related interest rates, excluding the effect of interest rate swaps and the amortization of any discounts or fees, by fiscal year of maturity at November 30, 2018. For foreign currency-denominated debt, the information is presented in U.S. dollar equivalents. Variable interest rates are based on the weighted-average rates of the portfolio at the end of the year presented. YEARS OF MATURITY AT NOVEMBER 30, 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 Thereafter Total Fair value Debt Fixed rate $ 0.4 $ 6.8 $ 257.3 $ 757.5 $ 2,426.3 $ 3,448.3 $ 3,315.9 Average interest rate 7.65 % 3.45 % 3.89 % 2.71 % 3.88 % Variable rate $ 643.1 $ 213.1 $ 83.1 $ 344.2 $ $ 1,283.5 $ 1,283.5 Average interest rate 2.99 % 3.45 % 3.47 % 3.58 % % The table above displays the debt, including capital leases, by the terms of the original debt instrument without consideration of fair value, interest rate swaps and any loan discounts or origination fees. Interest rate swaps have the following effects: We issued $250 million of 3.90% notes due in 2021 in July 2011. Forward treasury lock agreements settled upon issuance of these notes effectively set the interest rate on these notes at a weighted-average fixed rate of 4.01%. We issued $250 million of 3.50% notes due in 2023 in August 2013. Forward treasury lock agreements settled upon issuance of these notes effectively set the interest rate on these notes at a weighted-average fixed rate of 3.30%. We issued $250 million of 3.25% notes due in 2025 in November 2015. Forward treasury lock agreements settled upon issuance of these notes effectively set the interest rate on these notes at a weighted-average fixed rate of 3.45%. The fixed interest rate on $100 million of the 3.25% notes due in December 2025 was effectively converted to a variable rate by interest rate swaps through 2025. Net interest payments are based on 3-month LIBOR plus 1.22% during this period. We issued an aggregate amount of $2.5 billion of senior unsecured notes in August 2017. These notes are due as follows: $750 million due August 15, 2022, $700 million due August 15, 2024, $750 million due August 15, 2027 and $300 million due August 15, 2047 with stated fixed interest rates of 2.70%, 3.15%, 3.40% and 4.20%, respectively. Forward treasury lock agreements settled upon issuance of the $750 million notes due August 15, 2027 effectively set the interest rate on these $750 million notes at a weighted-average fixed rate of 3.44%. Commodity Risk We purchase certain raw materials which are subject to price volatility caused by weather, market conditions, growing and harvesting conditions, governmental actions and other factors beyond our control. In 2018, our most significant raw materials were dairy products, pepper, vanilla, garlic, capsicums (red peppers and paprika), onion, rice and wheat flour. While future movements of raw material costs are uncertain, we respond to this volatility in a number of ways, including strategic raw material purchases, purchases of raw material for future delivery and customer price adjustments. We generally have not used derivatives to manage the volatility related to this risk. To the extent that we have used derivatives for this purpose, it has not been material to our business. Credit Risk The customers of our consumer segment are predominantly food retailers and food wholesalers. Consolidations in these industries have created larger customers. In addition, competition has increased with the growth in alternative channels including mass merchandisers, dollar stores, warehouse clubs, discount chains and e-commerce. This has caused some customers to be less profitable and increased our exposure to credit risk. Some of our customers and counterparties are highly leveraged. We continue to closely monitor the credit worthiness of our customers and counterparties. We feel that the allowance for doubtful accounts properly recognizes trade receivables at realizable value. We consider nonperformance credit risk for other financial instruments to be insignificant. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS The following table reflects a summary of our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of November 30, 2018: CONTRACTUAL CASH OBLIGATIONS DUE BY YEAR Total Less than 1 year 1 3 years 3 5 years More than 5 years Short-term borrowings $ 560.0 $ 560.0 $ $ $ Long-term debt, including capital leases 4,171.8 83.5 560.3 1,359.4 2,168.6 Operating leases 153.8 42.9 57.1 31.4 22.4 Interest payments 1,010.0 139.1 236.7 184.5 449.7 Raw material purchase obligations (a) 575.5 531.5 44.0 Other purchase obligations (b) 41.1 26.4 6.6 8.1 Total contractual cash obligations $ 6,512.2 $ 1,383.4 $ 904.7 $ 1,583.4 $ 2,640.7 (a) Raw material purchase obligations outstanding as of year end may not be indicative of outstanding obligations throughout the year due to our response to varying raw material cycles. (b) Other purchase obligations consist of services agreements, advertising media commitments and utility contracts. Pension and postretirement funding can vary significantly each year due to changes in legislation, our significant assumptions and investment return on plan assets. As a result, we have not presented pension and postretirement funding in the table above. COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS EXPIRATION BY YEAR Total Less than 1 year 1 3 years 3 5 years More than 5 years Guarantees $ 0.6 $ 0.6 $ $ $ Standby letters of credit 7.3 7.3 Total commercial commitments $ 7.9 $ 7.9 $ $ $ OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS We had no off-balance sheet arrangements as of November 30, 2018 and 2017. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS New accounting pronouncements are issued periodically that affect our current and future operations. See note 1 of the accompanying financial statements for further details of these impacts. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS In preparing the financial statements, we are required to make estimates and assumptions that have an impact on the assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses reported. These estimates can also affect supplemental information disclosed by us, including information about contingencies, risk and financial condition. We believe, given current facts and circumstances, our estimates and assumptions are reasonable, adhere to U.S. GAAP and are consistently applied. Inherent in the nature of an estimate or assumption is the fact that actual results may differ from estimates, and estimates may vary as new facts and circumstances arise. In preparing the financial statements, we make routine estimates and judgments in determining the net realizable value of accounts receivable, inventory, fixed assets and prepaid allowances. Our most critical accounting estimates and assumptions are in the following areas: Customer Contracts In several of our major geographic markets, the consumer segment sells our products by entering into annual or multi-year customer contracts. These contracts include provisions for items such as sales discounts, marketing allowances and performance incentives. These items are recognized based on certain estimated criteria, such as sales volume of indirect customers, customers reaching anticipated volume thresholds and marketing spending. We routinely review these criteria and make adjustments as facts and circumstances change. Goodwill and Intangible Asset Valuation We review the carrying value of goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets and conduct tests of impairment on an annual basis as described below. We also test for impairment if events or circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount. We test indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinite-lived purchased intangible asset is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates, assumed royalty rates, future economic and market conditions, and determination of appropriate market comparables. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are inherently uncertain. Actual future results may differ from those estimates. Goodwill Impairment Our reporting units are the same as our operating segments. We estimate the fair value of a reporting unit by using a discounted cash flow model. Our discounted cash flow model calculates fair value by present valuing future expected cash flows of our reporting units using our internal cost of capital as the discount rate. We then compare this fair value to the carrying amount of the reporting unit, including intangible assets and goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the estimated fair value, then we would determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill. An impairment charge would be recognized to the extent the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value. As of November 30, 2018, we had $4,527.9 million of goodwill recorded in our balance sheet ($3,398.9 million in the consumer segment and $1,129.0 million in the flavor solutions segment). Our fiscal year 2018 testing indicated that the estimated fair values of our reporting units were significantly in excess of their carrying values. Accordingly, we believe that only significant changes in the cash flow assumptions would result in an impairment of goodwill. Indefinite-lived Intangible Asset Impairment Our indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of brand names and trademarks. We estimate fair value by using a relief-from-royalty method or discounted cash flow model and then compare that to the carrying amount of the indefinite-lived intangible asset. As of November 30, 2018, we had $2,646.9 million of brand name assets and trademarks recorded in our balance sheet, and none of the balances exceeded their estimated fair values at that date. Excluding the brand names associated with the 2017 RB Foods acquisition, and those brand names discussed below, the percentage excess of estimated fair value over book values for our major brand names and trademarks was 25% or more as of November 30, 2018. The following table outlines the book value of our major brand names and trademarks as of November 30, 2018: RB Foods (French's, Frank's RedHot, and Cattlemen's) $ 2,320.0 Zatarain's 106.4 Lawry 48.0 Kamis 33.2 Stubb's 27.1 DaQiao/ChuShiLe 25.1 Gourmet Garden 26.3 Simply Asia/Thai Kitchen 18.5 Drogheria & Alimentari 12.9 Kohinoor 8.0 Giotti 5.2 Brand Aromatics 4.2 Other 12.0 Total $ 2,646.9 The percentage excess of estimated fair value over book value for the Kamis and Stubb's brand names as of November 30, 2018, was approximately 19% and 11%, respectively. A change in assumptions with respect to future performance of either the Kamis or Stubb's businesses could result in impairment losses in the future. The brand names and trademarks related to recent acquisitions (in particular, our most recent and most significant acquisition, RB Foods) may be more susceptible to future impairment as their carrying values represent recently determined fair values. A change in assumptions with respect to future performance of these recently acquired businesses, or a change in other assumptions, including those effected by rising interest rates, could result in non-cash impairment losses in the future. Income Taxes We estimate income taxes and file tax returns in each of the taxing jurisdictions in which we operate and are required to file a tax return. At the end of each year, an estimate for income taxes is recorded in the financial statements. Tax returns are generally filed in the third or fourth quarter of the subsequent year. A reconciliation of the estimate to the final tax return is done at that time which will result in changes to the original estimate. We believe that our tax return positions are appropriately supported, but tax authorities may challenge certain positions. We evaluate our uncertain tax positions in accordance with the GAAP guidance for uncertainty in income taxes. We believe that our reserve for uncertain tax positions, including related interest, is adequate. The amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of audits could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax expense and, therefore, could have a material impact on our tax provision, net income and cash flows. We have recorded valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. In doing so, we have considered future taxable income and tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. Both future taxable income and tax planning strategies include a number of estimates. In addition, interpretative guidance continues to be issued in connection with the U.S. Tax Act enacted in December 2017. While we have considered available guidance, there is no assurance that future guidance may not cause us to revise amounts currently recorded. Pension and Postretirement Benefits Pension and other postretirement plans costs require the use of assumptions for discount rates, investment returns, projected salary increases, mortality rates and health care cost trend rates. The actuarial assumptions used in our pension and postretirement benefit reporting are reviewed annually and compared with external benchmarks to ensure that they appropriately account for our future pension and postretirement benefit obligations. While we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate, differences between assumed and actual experience may affect our operating results. A 1% increase or decrease in the actuarial assumption for the discount rate would impact 2019 pension and postretirement benefit expense by approximately $2 million. A 1% increase or decrease in the expected return on plan assets would impact 2019 pension expense by approximately $9 million. We will continue to evaluate the appropriateness of mortality and other assumptions used in the measurement of our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations. In addition, see note 10 of the accompanying financial statements for a discussion of these assumptions and the effects on the financial statements.
