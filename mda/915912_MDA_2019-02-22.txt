ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A ) is intended to help provide an understanding of our business, financial condition and results of operations. This MD&A should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report. This report, including the following MD&A, contains forward-looking statements regarding future events or trends that should be read in conjunction with the factors described under Forward-Looking Statements included in this report. Actual results or developments could differ materially from those projected in such statements as a result of the factors described under Forward-Looking Statements as well as the risk factors described in Item 1A. Risk Factors of this report. Capitalized terms used without definition have the meanings provided elsewhere in this Form 10-K. Executive Overview Business Description Our strategic vision is to be the leading apartment company in select U.S. markets, providing a range of distinctive living experiences that customers value. We pursue this vision by targeting what we believe are among the best markets and submarkets, leveraging our strategic capabilities in market research and consumer insight and being disciplined in our capital allocation and balance sheet management. Our communities are predominately upscale and generally command among the highest rents in their markets. However, we also pursue the ownership and operation of apartment communities that target a variety of customer segments and price points, consistent with our goal of offering a broad range of products and services. We regularly evaluate the allocation of our investments by the amount of invested capital and by product type within our individual markets. We develop, redevelop, acquire, own and operate multifamily apartment communities primarily in New England, the New York/New Jersey metro area, the Mid-Atlantic, the Pacific Northwest, and Northern and Southern California. We focus on leading metropolitan areas that we believe are characterized by growing employment in high wage sectors of the economy, higher cost of home ownership and a diverse and vibrant quality of life. We believe these market characteristics offer the opportunity for superior risk-adjusted returns over the long-term on apartment community investments relative to other markets that do not have these characteristics. We believe that the Denver, Colorado, and Southeast Florida markets share these characteristics, and in 2017 we began to invest in these markets through acquisitions and developments. We seek to create long-term shareholder value by accessing capital on cost effective terms; deploying that capital to develop, redevelop and acquire apartment communities in our selected markets; operating apartment communities; and selling communities when they no longer meet our long-term investment strategy or when pricing is attractive. 2018 Financial Highlights Net income attributable to common stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $974,525,000 , an increase of $97,604,000 , or 11.1% , over the prior year. The increase is primarily attributable to increases in real estate sales and related gains and NOI from newly developed, acquired and existing operating communities, as well as decreases in loss on extinguishment of debt, net and casualty and impairment loss. These amounts were partially offset by a decrease in gains on the sale of unconsolidated communities in various joint ventures and related promote income, coupled with increases in depreciation and interest expense. Established Communities NOI for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased by $26,248,000 , or 2.3% , over the prior year. The increase was driven by an increase in rental revenue of 2.5% , partially offset by an increase in operating expenses of 3.2% over 2017 . During 2018 , we raised approximately $1,572,833,000 of gross capital through the issuance of unsecured notes, sale of common shares under CEP IV and the sale of consolidated operating communities and other real estate. This amount does not include proceeds from joint venture dispositions. The funds raised from the sale of real estate consist of the proceeds from the sale of eight operating communities, as well as the five communities contributed to the NYC Joint Venture and one ancillary land parcel. We believe that our current capital structure will continue to provide financial flexibility to access capital on attractive terms. 36 Table of Contents We believe our development activity will continue to create long-term value. During 2018 , we completed the construction of seven communities containing an aggregate of 1,915 apartment homes and 10,000 square feet of retail space, for an aggregate total capitalized cost of $742,000,000 , or $693,000,000 when including only our 55.0% interest in one community developed through an unconsolidated joint venture. We also started the construction of eight communities containing an aggregate of 2,154 apartment homes, which are expected to be completed for an estimated total capitalized cost of $718,000,000 . In addition, during 2018 we completed the redevelopment of eight communities containing an aggregate of 3,368 apartment homes for a total investment of $217,000,000 , excluding costs incurred prior to the redevelopment. We also achieved portfolio growth through acquisitions, acquiring four communities containing an aggregate of 1,096 apartment homes for an aggregate purchase price of $334,450,000 . We believe that our balance sheet strength, as measured by our current level of indebtedness, our current ability to service interest and other fixed charges, and our current moderate use of financial encumbrances (such as secured financing) provide us with adequate access to liquidity from the capital markets. We expect to be able to meet our reasonably foreseeable liquidity needs, as they arise, through a combination of one or more of the following sources: existing cash on hand; operating cash flows; borrowings under our Credit Facility; secured debt; the issuance of corporate securities (which could include unsecured debt, preferred equity and/or common equity); the sale of apartment communities; or through the formation of joint ventures. See the discussion under "Liquidity and Capital Resources." Communities Overview As of December 31, 2018 we owned or held a direct or indirect ownership interest in 291 apartment communities containing 85,158 apartment homes in 12 states and the District of Columbia, of which 21 communities were under development and nine communities were under redevelopment. Of these communities, 15 were owned by entities that were not consolidated for financial reporting purposes, including five owned by the U.S. Fund, five owned by the NYC Joint Venture and two owned by the AC JV. In addition, we held a direct or indirect ownership interest in Development Rights to develop an additional 28 wholly-owned communities that, if developed as expected, will contain an estimated 9,769 apartment homes. Our real estate investments consist primarily of Current Communities, Development Communities and Development Rights. Our Current Communities are further distinguished as Established Communities, Other Stabilized Communities, Lease-Up Communities, Redevelopment Communities and Unconsolidated Communities. Established Communities are generally consolidated communities in markets where we have a significant presence that were owned and had stabilized occupancy as of the beginning of the prior year, allowing for a meaningful comparison of operating results between years. Other Stabilized Communities are generally all other completed consolidated communities that have stabilized occupancy during the fiscal year. Lease-Up Communities are consolidated communities where construction has been complete for less than one year and stabilized occupancy has not been achieved. Redevelopment Communities are consolidated communities where substantial redevelopment is in progress or is planned to begin during the fiscal year. Unconsolidated Communities are communities that we have an indirect ownership interest in through our investment interest in an unconsolidated joint venture. A more detailed description of our reportable segments and other related operating information can be found in Note 8, Segment Reporting, of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Although each of these categories is important to our business, we generally evaluate overall operating, industry and market trends based on the operating results of Established Communities, for which a detailed discussion can be found in Results of Operations as part of our discussion of overall operating results. We evaluate our current and future cash needs and future operating potential based on acquisition, disposition, development, redevelopment and financing activities within Other Stabilized, Redevelopment and Development Communities. Discussions related to current and future cash needs and financing activities can be found under "Liquidity and Capital Resources." NOI of our current operating communities is one of the financial measures that we use to evaluate the performance of our communities. NOI is affected by the demand and supply dynamics within our markets, our rental rates and occupancy levels and our ability to control operating costs. Our overall financial performance is also impacted by the general availability and cost of capital and the performance of newly developed, redeveloped and acquired apartment communities. 37 Table of Contents Results of Operations Our year-over-year operating performance is primarily affected by both overall and individual geographic market conditions and apartment fundamentals and is reflected in changes in NOI of our Established Communities; NOI derived from acquisitions and development completions; the loss of NOI related to disposed communities; and capital market and financing activity. A comparison of our operating results for 2018 , 2017 and 2016 follows (dollars in thousands): For the year ended 2018 vs. 2017 2017 vs. 2016 2018 2017 2016 $ Change % Change $ Change % Change Revenue: Rental and other income $ 2,280,963 $ 2,154,481 $ 2,039,656 $ 126,482 5.9 % $ 114,825 5.6 % Management, development and other fees 3,572 4,147 5,599 (575 ) (13.9 )% (1,452 ) (25.9 )% Total revenue 2,284,535 2,158,628 2,045,255 125,907 5.8 % 113,373 5.5 % Expenses: Direct property operating expenses, excluding property taxes 441,155 428,451 406,577 12,704 3.0 % 21,874 5.4 % Property taxes 241,563 221,375 204,837 20,188 9.1 % 16,538 8.1 % Total community operating expenses 682,718 649,826 611,414 32,892 5.1 % 38,412 6.3 % Corporate-level property management and other indirect operating expenses 80,133 69,559 67,038 10,574 15.2 % 2,521 3.8 % Investments and investment management expense 7,709 5,936 4,822 1,773 29.9 % 1,114 23.1 % Expensed acquisition, development and other pursuit costs, net of recoveries 4,309 2,736 9,922 1,573 57.5 % (7,186 ) (72.4 )% Interest expense, net 220,974 199,661 187,510 21,313 10.7 % 12,151 6.5 % Loss on extinguishment of debt, net 17,492 25,472 7,075 (7,980 ) (31.3 )% 18,397 260.0 % Depreciation expense 631,196 584,150 531,434 47,046 8.1 % 52,716 9.9 % General and administrative expense 56,365 50,673 45,771 5,692 11.2 % 4,902 10.7 % Casualty and impairment loss (gain), net 215 6,250 (3,935 ) (6,035 ) (96.6 )% 10,185 N/A (1) Total other expenses 1,018,393 944,437 849,637 73,956 7.8 % 94,800 11.2 % Equity in income of unconsolidated real estate entities 15,270 70,744 64,962 (55,474 ) (78.4 )% 5,782 8.9 % Gain on sale of communities 374,976 252,599 374,623 122,377 48.4 % (122,024 ) (32.6 )% Gain (loss) on other real estate transactions 345 (10,907 ) 10,224 11,252 N/A (1) (21,131 ) N/A (1) Income before income taxes 974,015 876,801 1,034,013 97,214 11.1 % (157,212 ) (15.2 )% Income tax (benefit) expense (160 ) 141 305 (301 ) N/A (1) (164 ) (53.8 )% Net income 974,175 876,660 1,033,708 97,515 11.1 % (157,048 ) (15.2 )% Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests 350 261 294 89 34.1 % (33 ) (11.2 )% Net income attributable to common stockholders $ 974,525 $ 876,921 $ 1,034,002 $ 97,604 11.1 % $ (157,081 ) (15.2 )% _________________________________ (1) Percent change is not meaningful. 38 Table of Contents Net income attributable to common stockholders increased $97,604,000 , or 11.1% , to $974,525,000 in 2018 from 2017 , primarily attributable to increases in real estate sales and related gains and NOI from newly developed, acquired and existing operating communities, as well as decreases in loss on extinguishment of debt, net and casualty and impairment loss. These amounts were partially offset by a decrease in gains on the sale of unconsolidated communities in various joint ventures and related promote income, coupled with increases in depreciation and interest expense. Net income attributable to common stockholders decreased $157,081,000 , or 15.2% , to $876,921,000 in 2017 from 2016 , primarily due to a decrease in real estate sales and related gains, coupled with increases in depreciation, loss on extinguishment of debt and interest expense, and a net casualty and impairment loss in the current year compared to a gain in the prior year. These amounts were partially offset by an increase in NOI from newly developed, acquired and existing operating communities. NOI is considered by management to be an important and appropriate supplemental performance measure to net income because it helps both investors and management to understand the core operations of a community or communities prior to the allocation of any corporate-level or financing-related costs. NOI reflects the operating performance of a community and allows for an easier comparison of the operating performance of individual assets or groups of assets. In addition, because prospective buyers of real estate have different financing and overhead structures, with varying marginal impact to overhead as a result of acquiring real estate, NOI is considered by many in the real estate industry to be a useful measure for determining the value of a real estate asset or group of assets. We define NOI as total property revenue less direct property operating expenses (including property taxes), and excluding corporate-level income (including management, development and other fees), corporate-level property management and other indirect operating expenses, investments and investment management expenses, expensed acquisition, development and other pursuit costs, net of recoveries, interest expense, net, loss (gain) on extinguishment of debt, net, general and administrative expense, equity in income of unconsolidated real estate entities, depreciation expense, corporate income tax (benefit) expense, casualty and impairment loss (gain), net, gain on sale of communities, loss (gain) on other real estate transactions and net operating income from real estate assets sold or held for sale. NOI does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP, and NOI should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance. NOI should also not be considered an alternative to net cash flow from operating activities, as determined by GAAP, as a measure of liquidity, nor is NOI indicative of cash available to fund cash needs. Reconciliations of NOI for the years ended December 31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 to net income for each year are as follows (dollars in thousands): For the year ended 12/31/18 12/31/17 12/31/16 Net income $ 974,175 $ 876,660 $ 1,033,708 Indirect operating expenses, net of corporate income 76,522 65,398 61,403 Investments and investment management expense 7,709 5,936 4,822 Expensed transaction, development and other pursuit costs, net of recoveries 4,309 2,736 9,922 Interest expense, net 220,974 199,661 187,510 Loss on extinguishment of debt, net 17,492 25,472 7,075 General and administrative expense 56,365 50,673 45,771 Equity in income of unconsolidated real estate entities (15,270 ) (70,744 ) (64,962 ) Depreciation expense 631,196 584,150 531,434 Income tax (benefit) expense (160 ) 141 305 Casualty and impairment (gain) loss, net 215 6,250 (3,935 ) Gain on sale of real estate assets (374,976 ) (252,599 ) (374,623 ) Gain on other real estate transactions, net (345 ) 10,907 (10,224 ) Net operating income from real estate assets sold or held for sale (58,620 ) (84,650 ) (114,219 ) Net operating income $ 1,539,586 $ 1,419,991 $ 1,313,987 39 Table of Contents The NOI increases for both 2018 and 2017 , as compared to the prior years, consist of changes in the following categories (dollars in thousands): Full Year 2018 2017 Established Communities $ 26,248 $ 61,143 Other Stabilized Communities 50,494 53,841 Development and Redevelopment Communities (1) 42,853 (8,980 ) Total $ 119,595 $ 106,004 _________________________________ (1) NOI for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 include business interruption insurance proceeds of $3,495 related to the Maplewood casualty loss and $20,306 related to the Edgewater casualty loss, respectively. The increase in our Established Communities' NOI in 2018 and 2017 is due to increased rental rates, partially offset by increased operating expenses. Rental and other income increased in both 2018 and 2017 compared to the prior years due to additional rental income generated from newly developed, acquired and existing operating communities and an increase in rental rates at our Established Communities. The changes between years are also impacted by business interruption insurance proceeds received due to the final settlement of the Edgewater and Maplewood casualty losses, as described above. Consolidated Communities The weighted average number of occupied apartment homes for consolidated communities increased to 73,385 apartment homes for 2018 , as compared to 70,081 homes for 2017 and 67,849 homes for 2016 . The weighted average monthly rental revenue per occupied apartment home increased to $2,588 for 2018 as compared to $2,556 in 2017 and $2,476 in 2016 . Established Communities Rental revenue increased $40,526,000 , or 2.5% , to $1,631,633,000 for 2018 from $1,591,107,000 in the prior year. The increase is due to an increase in average rental rates of 2.5% to $2,576 per apartment home and maintaining economic occupancy consistent at 96.1% . Rental revenue increased $38,648,000 , or 2.5% , for 2017 , as compared to the prior year. Economic occupancy takes into account the fact that apartment homes of different sizes and locations within a community have different economic impacts on a community's gross revenue. Economic occupancy is defined as gross potential revenue less vacancy loss, as a percentage of gross potential revenue. Gross potential revenue is determined by valuing occupied homes at leased rates and vacant homes at market rents. We experienced increases in rental revenue for all of our Established Communities' regions in 2018 as compared to the prior year, as discussed in more detail below. The Northern California region accounted for 22.5% of the Established Community rental revenue for 2018 and experienced a rental revenue increase of 2.7% for 2018 over the prior year. Average rental rates increased 2.7% to $2,936 per apartment home, and economic occupancy remained consistent at 96.4% for 2018 as compared to 2017 . We believe improving income growth will support stronger rental revenue growth in Northern California in 2019. The Metro New York/New Jersey region accounted for 22.1% of the Established Community rental revenue for 2018 and experienced a rental revenue increase of 1.7% for 2018 over the prior year. Average rental rates increased 1.8% to $3,002 per apartment home, and were partially offset by a 0.1% decrease in economic occupancy to 96.2% for 2018 as compared to 2017 . We expect operating conditions in the Metro New York/New Jersey region to improve modestly in 2019, driven primarily by a stronger income growth forecast than 2018. The Southern California region accounted for 20.9% of the Established Community rental revenue for 2018 and experienced a rental revenue increase of 3.6% for 2018 over the prior year. Average rental rates increased 3.5% to $2,300 per apartment home, and economic occupancy increased 0.1% to 96.1% for 2018 as compared to 2017 . We believe relatively stable job and income growth in Southern California will continue to support favorable operating conditions in the region in 2019. 40 Table of Contents The New England region accounted for 14.7% of the Established Community rental revenue for 2018 and experienced a rental revenue increase of 3.0% for 2018 over the prior year. Average rental rates increased 2.9% to $2,510 per apartment home, and economic occupancy increased 0.1% to 96.0% for 2018 as compared to 2017 . We expect the operating environment in New England to improve in 2019, driven by strengthening income growth and a decrease in the volume of new apartment deliveries relative to 2018. The Mid-Atlantic region accounted for 14.5% of the Established Community rental revenue for 2018 and experienced a rental revenue increase of 1.8% for 2018 over the prior year. Average rental rates increased 1.7% to $2,218 per apartment home, and economic occupancy increased 0.1% to 96.0% for 2018 as compared to 2017 . We believe elevated levels of new apartment deliveries in the Mid-Atlantic region will continue to limit our ability to increase rental rates in 2019. The Pacific Northwest region accounted for 5.3% of the Established Community rental revenue for 2018 and experienced a rental revenue increase of 2.5% for 2018 over the prior year. Average rental rates increased 2.5% to $2,301 per apartment home, and economic occupancy remained consistent at 96.0% for 2018 as compared to 2017 . We expect operating conditions in the Pacific Northwest to remain relatively stable in 2019. Management, development and other fees decreased $575,000 or 13.9% , and $1,452,000 , or 25.9% , in 2018 and 2017 , respectively, as compared to the prior years. The decreases in 2018 and 2017 were primarily due to lower property and asset management fees earned as a result of dispositions from Fund II, the U.S. Fund and the AC JV. Direct property operating expenses, excluding property taxes increased $12,704,000 , or 3.0% , and $21,874,000 , or 5.4% , in 2018 and 2017 , respectively, as compared to the prior years. The increases in 2018 and 2017 were primarily due to the addition of newly developed and acquired apartment communities. For Established Communities, direct property operating expenses, excluding property taxes, increased $5,993,000 , or 2.0% , and $6,067,000 , or 2.0% , in 2018 and 2017 , respectively, as compared to the prior years. The increase in 2018 was primarily due to increased compensation expense as well as maintenance and utilities costs, partially offset by decreased marketing and property insurance costs. The increase in 2017 was primarily due to increased compensation expense, bad debt and turnover and maintenance costs, partially offset by decreased property insurance costs. Property taxes increased $20,188,000 , or 9.1% , and $16,538,000 , or 8.1% , in 2018 and 2017 , respectively, as compared to the prior years. The increases in 2018 and 2017 were primarily due to the addition of newly developed and acquired apartment communities, increased assessments across our portfolio, as well as successful appeals in the prior years in excess of those recognized in the then current year. For Established Communities, property taxes increased $8,520,000 , or 5.3% , and $5,300,000 , or 3.5% , in 2018 and 2017 , respectively, as compared to the prior years. The increases in 2018 and 2017 were primarily due to increased assessments and rates in the current year periods, as well as successful appeals in the prior year periods in the Company's West Coast markets. For communities in California, property tax changes are determined by the change in the California Consumer Price Index, with increases limited by law (Proposition 13). We evaluate property tax increases internally and also engage third-party consultants to assist in our evaluations. We appeal property tax increases when appropriate. Corporate-level property management and other indirect operating expenses increased $10,574,000 , or 15.2% , and $2,521,000 , or 3.8% , in 2018 and 2017 , respectively, as compared to the prior year. The increase in 2018 was primarily due to advocacy contributions not present in the prior year, increased compensation related costs and spending on corporate initiatives in the current year. The increase in 2017 was primarily due to increased compensation related costs, partially offset by severance costs in 2016 not present in 2017. Investments and investment management expense increased by $1,773,000 , or 29.9% , and $1,114,000 , or 23.1% , in 2018 and 2017 , respectively, as compared to the prior years. The increase in 2018 was primarily due to severance costs, which were not present in the prior year, and an increase in compensation expense. The increase in 2017 was primarily due to an increase in compensation expense. 41 Table of Contents Expensed acquisition, development and other pursuit costs, net of recoveries primarily reflect abandoned pursuit costs as well as acquisition costs related to business acquisitions that occurred prior to the adoption of ASU 2017-01 as of October 1, 2016. Subsequent to the adoption of ASU 2017-01, we expect that acquisitions of individual operating communities will generally be viewed as asset acquisitions, and result in acquisition costs being capitalized instead of expensed. Abandoned pursuit costs include costs incurred for development pursuits not yet considered probable for development, as well as the abandonment of Development Rights and costs related to abandoned acquisition and disposition pursuits. These costs can be volatile, particularly in periods of increased acquisition pursuit activity, periods of economic downturn or when there is limited access to capital, and the costs may vary significantly from period to period. These aggregate costs increased $1,573,000 , or 57.5% , in 2018 , and decreased $7,186,000 , or 72.4% , in 2017 , as compared to the prior years. The increase in 2018 was primarily due to increased abandoned development pursuit costs and the non-cash write-off of asset management fee intangibles associated with the disposition of communities in the U.S. Fund and the AC JV. The decrease in 2017 was due to a decrease in acquisition costs related to communities acquired during the prior year periods that were expensed prior to the adoption of ASU 2017-01, decreased development pursuit costs, as well as the non-cash write-off of asset management fee intangibles associated with the disposition of communities in the U.S. Fund in the prior year period in excess of amounts recognized in the current year period. Interest expense, net increased $21,313,000 , or 10.7% , and $12,151,000 , or 6.5% , in 2018 and 2017 , respectively, as compared to the prior years. This category includes interest costs offset by capitalized interest pertaining to development and redevelopment activity, amortization of premium/discount on debt, and interest income. The increase in 2018 was primarily due to a decrease in amounts of interest capitalized resulting from a decrease in development and redevelopment activity, as well as an increase in outstanding unsecured indebtedness, partially offset by a decrease in secured indebtedness. The increase in 2017 was primarily due to a decrease in amounts of interest capitalized resulting from a decrease in development activity, as well as an increase in outstanding unsecured indebtedness. Loss on the extinguishment of debt, net reflects prepayment penalties, the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs and premiums from our debt repurchase and retirement activity, or payments to acquire our outstanding debt at amounts above or below the carrying basis of the debt acquired. The loss of $17,492,000 for 2018 was due to: a prepayment penalty of $8,579,000 and the non-cash write-off of deferred financing costs of $347,000 associated with the early repayment of $250,000,000 principal amount of 6.10% unsecured notes; and the aggregate prepayment penalty of $3,308,000 and the non-cash write-off of deferred financing costs of $5,258,000 on the repayment or refinancing of $244,546,000 principal amount of mortgage notes secured by six wholly-owned operating communities. The loss of $25,472,000 for 2017 was primarily due to: prepayment penalties of $33,515,000 and the non-cash write-off of deferred financing costs of $1,450,000 associated with the repayment of $556,313,000 aggregate principal amount of fixed rate mortgage notes secured by 12 wholly-owned operating communities in advance of their May 2019 maturity dates; partially offset by a gain of $10,839,000, primarily composed of the write-off of unamortized premium on the repayment of $670,590,000 principal amount of fixed rate mortgage notes secured by 11 wholly-owned operating communities in advance of their November 2017 maturity dates. Depreciation expense increased $47,046,000 , or 8.1% , and $52,716,000 , or 9.9% , in 2018 and 2017 , respectively, as compared to the prior years. The increases in 2018 and 2017 were primarily due to the addition of newly developed and acquired apartment communities. General and administrative expense ( G&A ) increased $5,692,000 , or 11.2% , and $4,902,000 , or 10.7% , in 2018 and 2017 , respectively, as compared to the prior years. The increase in 2018 was primarily due to an increase in compensation related expenses and a decrease in legal recoveries. The increase in 2017 was primarily due to an increase in compensation related expenses, professional fees, and sales and use tax expense. 42 Table of Contents Casualty and impairment loss (gain), net of $215,000 for 2018 primarily consists of an impairment charge of $826,000 recognized for a land parcel we had acquired for development and no longer intend to develop, partially offset by $554,000 of legal settlement proceeds relating to construction defects at a community acquired as part of the Archstone Acquisition. The loss of $6,250,000 for 2017 consists of a $9,350,000 impairment charge recognized for a land parcel we had acquired for development in 2004 and sold in July 2017, and the net impact of the Maplewood casualty loss, net of associated insurance receivables, of $2,338,000 , partially offset by $5,438,000 of legal settlement proceeds relating to construction defects at a community acquired as part of the Archstone Acquisition. Equity in income of unconsolidated real estate entities decreased $55,474,000 , or 78.4% , and increased $5,782,000 , or 8.9% , in 2018 and 2017 , respectively, as compared to the prior years. The decrease in 2018 was primarily due to gains on the sale of communities in various ventures and the recognition of income for the Company's promoted interest from Fund II in the prior year period, coupled with the resulting decreased NOI from the ventures in the current year period, due to disposition activity in 2017 and 2018. The increase in 2017 was primarily due to the recognition of income for the Company's promoted interest, partially offset by decreased gains on the sale of communities in various ventures in the current year, and decreased NOI from the ventures due to disposition activity in 2016 and 2017. Gain on sale of communities increased in 2018 and decreased in 2017 as compared to the prior years. The amount of gain realized in a given period depends on many factors, including the number of communities sold, the size and carrying value of the communities sold and the market conditions in the local area. The gain of $374,976,000 in 2018 was primarily due to the sale of eight wholly-owned operating communities and the recognition of the gain associated with the contribution of five wholly-owned operating communities to the NYC Joint Venture, a venture in which we retained a 20.0% interest. The gain of $252,599,000 in 2017 was primarily due to the sale of six wholly-owned operating communities. Gain (loss) on other real estate transactions of $345,000 in 2018 was primarily composed of gains on ancillary real estate. The loss of $10,907,000 in 2017 was primarily composed of the non-cash write-off of prepaid rent associated with the purchase of land previously subject to a ground lease. Liquidity and Capital Resources We employ a disciplined approach to our liquidity and capital management. When we source capital, we take into account both our view of the most cost effective alternative then available and our desire to maintain a balance sheet that provides us with flexibility. Our principal short-term liquidity needs are to fund: development and redevelopment activity in which we are currently engaged; the minimum dividend payments on our common stock required to maintain our REIT qualification under the Code; debt service and principal payments either at maturity or opportunistically before maturity; and normal recurring operating expenses and corporate overhead expenses. Factors affecting our liquidity and capital resources are our cash flows from operations, financing activities and investing activities (including dispositions) as well as general economic and market conditions. Operating cash flow has historically been determined by: (i) the number of apartment homes currently owned, (ii) rental rates, (iii) occupancy levels and (iv) operating expenses with respect to apartment homes. The timing and type of capital markets activity in which we engage, as well as our plans for development, redevelopment, acquisition and disposition activity, are affected by changes in the capital markets environment, such as changes in interest rates or the availability of cost-effective capital. We regularly review our liquidity needs, the adequacy of cash flows from operations and other expected liquidity sources to meet these needs. We had cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash of $217,864,000 at December 31, 2018 , an increase of $15,958,000 from $201,906,000 at December 31, 2017 . The following discussion relates to changes in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash due to operating, investing and financing activities, which are presented in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows included elsewhere in this report. Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities increased to $1,301,111,000 in 2018 from $1,256,257,000 in 2017 . The change was driven primarily by increased NOI from existing, acquired and newly developed communities. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities totaled $596,651,000 in 2018 . The net cash used was primarily due to: investment of $1,139,954,000 in the development and redevelopment of communities; acquisition of four operating communities for $338,620,000 ; and 43 Table of Contents capital expenditures of $86,932,000 for our operating communities and non-real estate assets. These amounts are partially offset by: proceeds from the sale of real estate, including the contribution of five communities to the NYC Joint Venture, of $883,313,000 ; and net distributions from unconsolidated real estate entities of $24,499,000 . Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities totaled $688,502,000 in 2018 . The net cash used was primarily due to: payment of cash dividends in the amount of $805,239,000 ; the repayment of unsecured notes in the amount of $258,579,000 ; and the repayment of secured notes in the amount of $255,452,000 . These amounts are partially offset by: proceeds from the issuance of unsecured notes in the amount of $299,442,000 , less deferred financing costs of $16,258,000 ; the issuance of secured notes in the amount of $295,939,000 ; and the issuance of common stock in the amount of $52,261,000 , primarily through CEP IV. Variable Rate Unsecured Credit Facility We have a $1,500,000,000 revolving variable rate unsecured credit facility with a syndicate of banks (the "Credit Facility") which matures in April 2020. We may extend the maturity for up to nine months, provided we are not in default and upon payment of a $1,500,000 extension fee. The Credit Facility bears interest at varying levels based on the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR"), rating levels achieved on our unsecured notes and on a maturity schedule selected by us. The current stated pricing is LIBOR plus 0.825% per annum ( 3.34% at January 31, 2019 assuming a one month borrowing rate). The annual facility fee is 0.125% (or approximately $1,875,000 annually based on the $1,500,000,000 facility size and based on our current credit rating). We had $106,000,000 outstanding under the Credit Facility and had $40,010,000 outstanding in letters of credit that reduced our borrowing capacity as of January 31, 2019 . Financial Covenants We are subject to financial and other covenants contained in the Credit Facility, the Term Loan and the indenture under which our unsecured notes were issued. The principal financial covenants include the following: limitations on the amount of total and secured debt in relation to our overall capital structure; limitations on the amount of our unsecured debt relative to the undepreciated basis of real estate assets that are not encumbered by property-specific financing; and minimum levels of debt service coverage. We were in compliance with these covenants at December 31, 2018 . In addition, our secured borrowings may include yield maintenance, defeasance, or prepayment penalty provisions, which would result in us incurring an additional charge in the event of a full or partial prepayment of outstanding principal before the scheduled maturity. These provisions in our secured borrowings are generally consistent with other similar types of debt instruments issued during the same time period in which our borrowings were secured. 44 Table of Contents Continuous Equity Offering Program In December 2015, we commenced a fourth continuous equity program ( CEP IV ) under which we may sell up to $1,000,000,000 of our common stock from time to time. Actual sales will depend on a variety of factors to be determined, including market conditions, the trading price of our common stock and determinations of the appropriate sources of funding. In conjunction with CEP IV, we engaged sales agents who will receive compensation of up to 2.0% of the gross sales price for shares sold. CEP IV also allows us to enter into forward sale agreements up to $1,000,000,000 in aggregate sales price of our common stock. We expect that we will physically settle each forward sale agreement on one or more dates prior to the maturity date of that particular forward sale agreement, in which case we will expect to receive aggregate net cash proceeds at settlement equal to the number of shares underlying the particular forward agreement multiplied by the relevant forward sale price. However, we may also elect to cash settle or net share settle a forward sale agreement. In connection with each forward sale agreement, we will pay the relevant forward seller, in the form of a reduced initial forward sale price, commission of up to 2.0% of the sales prices of all borrowed shares of common stock sold. In 2018 , we sold 244,924 shares at an average sales price of $189.14 per share, for net proceeds of $45,629,000 . As of January 31, 2019 , we had $846,591,000 of shares remaining authorized for issuance under this program and no forward sales agreements outstanding. Forward Interest Rate Swap Agreements In 2018 , we entered into $250,000,000 of forward interest rate swap agreements executed to reduce the impact of variability in interest rates on a portion of our expected debt issuance activity in 2019, which are outstanding as of December 31, 2018 . At maturity of the outstanding swap agreements, we expect to cash settle the contracts and either pay or receive cash for the then current fair value. Assuming that we issue the debt as expected, the hedging impact from these positions will then be recognized over the life of the issued debt as a yield adjustment. In conjunction with our March 2018 unsecured note issuance, we settled $300,000,000 of forward interest rate swap agreements entered into in 2017 and designated as cash flow hedges of interest variability on the forecasted issuance of the unsecured notes, receiving a payment of $12,598,000 . Future Financing and Capital Needs Debt Maturities One of our principal long-term liquidity needs is the repayment of long-term debt at maturity. For both our unsecured and secured notes, a portion of the principal of these notes may be repaid prior to maturity. Early retirement of our unsecured or secured notes could result in gains or losses on extinguishment. If we do not have funds on hand sufficient to repay our indebtedness as it becomes due, it will be necessary for us to refinance or otherwise provide liquidity to satisfy the debt at maturity. This refinancing may be accomplished by uncollateralized private or public debt offerings, equity issuances, additional debt financing that is secured by mortgages on individual communities or groups of communities or borrowings under our Credit Facility. Although we believe we will have the capacity to meet our currently anticipated liquidity needs, we cannot assure you that additional debt financing or debt or equity offerings will be available or, if available, that they will be on terms we consider satisfactory. The following debt activity occurred during 2018 : In February 2018, we repaid $15,174,000 principal amount of 6.60% fixed rate debt secured by Avalon Oaks West in advance of its scheduled maturity date, incurring a charge of $426,000 , consisting of a prepayment penalty of $152,000 and the non-cash write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs of $274,000 . In February 2018, we repaid $11,038,000 principal amount of 4.61% fixed rate debt secured by AVA Pasadena at par in advance of its scheduled maturity date. In March 2018, we issued $300,000,000 principal amount of unsecured notes in a public offering under our existing shelf registration statement for net proceeds of approximately $296,210,000 . The notes mature in April 2048 and were issued at a 4.35% interest rate. The effective interest rate of the notes for the first 10 years is 3.97% , including the impact of an interest rate hedge and offering costs, and for the remainder of the term the effective interest rate is 4.39% . In April 2018, we repaid $13,380,000 principal amount of 3.06% fixed rate debt secured by Avalon Andover at par at its scheduled maturity date. In June 2018, we repaid $15,295,000 principal amount of 6.90% fixed rate debt secured by Avalon Orchards in advance of its scheduled maturity date, incurring a charge of $635,000 , consisting of a prepayment penalty of $282,000 and the non-cash write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs of $353,000 . 45 Table of Contents In August 2018, we repaid $95,859,000 aggregate principal amount of variable rate debt secured by Avalon Calabasas, of which $51,449,000 was repaid at par at its scheduled maturity date, and $44,410,000 was repaid at par in advance of its April 2028 maturity date. We recognized a non-cash charge of $1,690,000 for the write-off of unamortized debt discount. In December 2018, we repaid $250,000,000 principal amount of 6.10% unsecured notes in advance of its March 2020 scheduled maturity, recognizing a charge of $8,926,000 , consisting of a prepayment penalty of $8,579,000 and a non-cash write-off of deferred financing costs of $347,000 . In December 2018, in conjunction with the formation of the NYC Joint Venture as discussed in Note 5, "Investments in Real Estate Entities" of our Consolidated Financial Statements, the following financing activities took place: We repaid $93,800,000 of variable rate debt secured by Avalon Bowery Place I in advance of its November 2037 maturity date. In conjunction with the repayment, we recognized a charge of $5,837,000 , consisting of a prepayment penalty of $2,874,000 and the non-cash write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs of $2,963,000 . We entered into a $93,800,000 fixed rate note secured by Avalon Bowery Place I, with a contractual interest rate of 4.01% , maturing in January 2029 . We entered into a $39,639,000 fixed rate note secured by Avalon Bowery Place II, with a contractual interest rate of 4.01% , maturing in January 2029 . We entered into a $12,500,000 fixed rate note secured by Avalon Morningside Park, with a contractual interest rate of 3.95% , maturing in January 2029 . We entered into a $150,000,000 fixed rate note secured by Avalon West Chelsea and AVA High Line, a dual-branded community, with contractual interest rate of 4.01% , maturing in January 2029 . The NYC Joint Venture then assumed the aggregate $295,939,000 of new borrowings discussed above, as well as the previously outstanding $100,000,000 fixed rate note secured by Avalon Morningside Park with a contractual interest rate of 3.50%. The following table details our consolidated debt maturities for the next five years, excluding our Credit Facility and amounts outstanding related to communities classified as held for sale, for debt outstanding at December 31, 2018 and 2017 (dollars in thousands). We are not directly or indirectly (as borrower or guarantor) obligated in any material respect to pay principal or interest on the indebtedness of any unconsolidated entities in which we have an equity or other interest. 46 Table of Contents All-In interest rate (1) Principal maturity date Balance Outstanding (2) Scheduled Maturities Community 12/31/2017 12/31/2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Thereafter Tax-exempt bonds Fixed rate Avalon Oaks West 7.55 % Apr-2043 (3) $ 15,213 $ $ $ $ $ $ $ Avalon at Chestnut Hill 6.16 % Oct-2047 38,097 37,561 566 596 629 663 699 34,408 Avalon Westbury 3.86 % Nov-2036 (4) 62,200 62,200 62,200 115,510 99,761 566 596 629 663 699 96,608 Variable rate Eaves Mission Viejo 2.58 % Jun-2025 (5) 7,635 7,635 7,635 AVA Nob Hill 2.83 % Jun-2025 (5) 20,800 20,800 20,800 Avalon Campbell 3.14 % Jun-2025 (5) 38,800 38,800 38,800 Eaves Pacifica 3.18 % Jun-2025 (5) 17,600 17,600 17,600 Avalon Bowery Place I 4.24 % Nov-2037 (6) 93,800 Avalon Acton 2.74 % Jul-2040 (5) 45,000 45,000 45,000 Avalon Morningside Park 3.36 % May-2046 (7) 100,000 Avalon Clinton North 3.40 % Nov-2038 (5) 147,000 147,000 147,000 Avalon Clinton South 3.40 % Nov-2038 (5) 121,500 121,500 121,500 Avalon Midtown West 3.31 % May-2029 (5) 100,500 100,500 100,500 Avalon San Bruno I 3.29 % Dec-2037 (5) 64,450 64,450 64,450 Avalon Calabasas 2.68 % Apr-2028 (3) 44,410 801,495 563,285 563,285 Conventional loans Fixed rate $250 million unsecured notes 6.19 % Mar-2020 (3) 250,000 $250 million unsecured notes 4.04 % Jan-2021 250,000 250,000 250,000 $450 million unsecured notes 4.30 % Sep-2022 450,000 450,000 450,000 $250 million unsecured notes 3.00 % Mar-2023 250,000 250,000 250,000 $400 million unsecured notes 3.78 % Oct-2020 400,000 400,000 400,000 $350 million unsecured notes 4.30 % Dec-2023 350,000 350,000 350,000 $300 million unsecured notes 3.66 % Nov-2024 300,000 300,000 300,000 $525 million unsecured notes 3.55 % Jun-2025 525,000 525,000 525,000 $300 million unsecured notes 3.62 % Nov-2025 300,000 300,000 300,000 $475 million unsecured notes 3.35 % May-2026 475,000 475,000 475,000 $300 million unsecured notes 3.01 % Oct-2026 300,000 300,000 300,000 $350 million unsecured notes 3.95 % Oct-2046 350,000 350,000 350,000 $400 million unsecured notes 3.50 % May-2027 400,000 400,000 400,000 $300 million unsecured notes 4.09 % Jul-2047 300,000 300,000 300,000 $450 million unsecured notes 3.32 % Jan-2028 450,000 450,000 450,000 $300 million unsecured notes 3.97 % Apr-2048 300,000 300,000 Avalon Orchards 7.80 % Jul-2033 (3) 15,579 Avalon Walnut Creek 4.00 % Jul-2066 3,557 3,699 3,699 AVA Pasadena 4.06 % Jun-2018 (3) 11,073 Eaves Los Feliz 3.68 % Jun-2027 41,400 41,400 41,400 Eaves Woodland Hills 3.67 % Jun-2027 111,500 111,500 111,500 Avalon Russett 3.77 % Jun-2027 32,200 32,200 32,200 Avalon San Bruno II 3.85 % Apr-2021 29,533 28,999 564 591 27,844 Avalon Westbury 4.88 % Nov-2036 (4) 16,450 15,095 1,430 1,495 1,575 1,655 1,740 7,200 Avalon San Bruno III 3.18 % Jun-2020 53,315 52,090 1,264 50,826 Avalon Andover 3.28 % Apr-2018 13,498 Avalon Natick 3.15 % Apr-2019 13,831 13,482 13,482 Avalon Hoboken 3.55 % Dec-2020 67,904 67,904 67,904 Avalon Columbia Pike 3.24 % Nov-2019 68,637 67,085 67,085 5,828,477 5,833,454 83,825 520,816 279,419 451,655 601,740 3,895,999 47 Table of Contents All-In interest rate (1) Principal maturity date Balance Outstanding (2) Scheduled Maturities Community 12/31/2017 12/31/2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Thereafter Variable rate Avalon Calabasas 2.40 % Aug-2018 52,092 Avalon Natick 4.51 % Apr-2019 (5) 35,039 34,155 34,155 Archstone Lexington 4.18 % Oct-2020 21,700 21,700 21,700 Term Loan - $100 million 3.44 % Feb-2022 100,000 100,000 100,000 Term Loan - $150 million 3.98 % Feb-2024 150,000 150,000 150,000 $300 million unsecured notes 3.05 % Jan-2021 300,000 300,000 300,000 658,831 605,855 34,155 21,700 300,000 100,000 150,000 Total indebtedness - excluding Credit Facility $ 7,404,313 $ 7,102,355 $ 118,546 $ 543,112 $ 580,048 $ 552,318 $ 602,439 $ 4,705,892 _________________________________ (1) Includes credit enhancement fees, facility fees, trustees fees, the impact of interest rate hedges, offering costs, mark to market amortization and other fees.

(3) During 2018, we repaid this borrowing in advance of its scheduled maturity date. (4) Maturity date reflects the contractual maturity of the underlying bond. There is also an associated earlier credit enhancement maturity date. (5) Financed by variable rate debt, but interest rate is capped through an interest rate protection agreement. (6) During 2018, we refinanced this borrowing in advance of its scheduled maturity date and it was subsequently assumed by the NYC Joint Venture, in which we own a 20.0% interest, as discussed above. (7) During 2018, this borrowing was assumed by the NYC Joint Venture, in which we own a 20.0% interest, as discussed above. Future Financing and Capital Needs Portfolio and Capital Markets Activity In 2019 , we expect to meet our liquidity needs from a variety of internal and external sources, including (i) real estate dispositions, (ii) cash balances on hand as well as cash generated from our operating activities, (iii) borrowing capacity under our Credit Facility and (iv) secured and unsecured debt financings. Additional sources of liquidity in 2019 may include the issuance of common and preferred equity. Our ability to obtain additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions, the general availability of credit, the overall availability of credit to the real estate industry, our credit ratings and credit capacity, as well as the perception of lenders regarding our long or short-term financial prospects. Before beginning new construction or reconstruction activity, including activity related to communities owned by unconsolidated joint ventures, we intend to plan adequate financing to complete these undertakings, although we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such financing. In the event that financing cannot be obtained, we may have to abandon Development Rights, write off associated pre-development costs that were capitalized and/or forego reconstruction activity. In such instances, we will not realize the increased revenues and earnings that we expected from such Development Rights or reconstruction activity and significant losses could be incurred. From time to time we use joint ventures to hold or develop individual real estate assets. We generally employ joint ventures primarily to mitigate asset concentration or market risk and secondarily as a source of liquidity. We may also use joint ventures related to mixed-use land development opportunities where our partners bring development and operational expertise to the venture. Each joint venture or partnership agreement has been individually negotiated, and our ability to operate and/or dispose of a community in our sole discretion may be limited to varying degrees depending on the terms of the joint venture or partnership agreement. We cannot assure you that we will achieve our objectives through joint ventures. In evaluating our allocation of capital within our markets, we sell assets that do not meet our long-term investment criteria or when capital and real estate markets allow us to realize a portion of the value created over our ownership periods and redeploy the proceeds from those sales to develop and redevelop communities. Because the proceeds from the sale of communities may not be immediately redeployed into revenue generating assets that we develop, redevelop or acquire, the immediate effect of a sale of a community for a gain is to increase net income, but reduce future total revenues, total expenses and NOI until such time as the proceeds have been redeployed into revenue generating assets. We believe that the temporary absence of future cash flows from communities sold will not have a material impact on our ability to fund future liquidity and capital resource needs. 48 Table of Contents Unconsolidated Real Estate Investments and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Unconsolidated Investments During 2018, we contributed five wholly-owned operating communities located in New York, NY to a newly formed joint venture (the "NYC Joint Venture"), for net cash proceeds of $276,799,000 and the assumption of $395,939,000 of secured indebtedness by the venture, recognizing a gain on sale of $179,861,000 . We retained a 20.0% interest in the venture and are acting as the managing member of the venture as well as the property manager for the communities. The five communities contain an aggregate of 1,301 apartment homes and 58,000 square feet of retail space. In conjunction with the formation of the venture, we entered into the refinancing and borrowing activities discussed in "Liquidity and Capital Resources, Future Financing and Capital Needs Debt Maturities" and the venture assumed all outstanding indebtedness. The U.S. Fund has six institutional investors, including us. We are the general partner of the U.S. Fund and, excluding costs incurred in excess of our equity in the underlying net assets of the U.S. Fund, we have an equity investment of $31,194,000 (net of distributions), representing a 28.6% combined equity interest. The U.S. Fund was formed in July 2011 and is fully invested. The U.S. Fund has a term that expires in July 2023, assuming the exercise of two, one-year extension options. During 2018 , the U.S. Fund sold one community containing 131 apartment homes for a sales price of $85,500,000 . Our share of the gain was $8,636,000 . In conjunction with the disposition of this community, the U.S. Fund repaid $27,928,000 of related secured indebtedness in advance of the scheduled maturity date. The AC JV has four institutional investors, including us. Excluding costs incurred in excess of our equity in the underlying net assets of the AC JV, we have an equity investment of $34,799,000 (net of distributions), representing a 20.0% equity interest. The AC JV was formed in 2011. During 2018 , the AC JV sold one community containing 392 apartment homes for a sales price of $94,250,000 . Our proportionate share of the gain in accordance with GAAP was $2,019,000 . In conjunction with the disposition of this community, the AC JV repaid a $50,647,000 loan to the equity investors in the venture at par. During 2016, we entered into a joint venture to develop, own, and operate AVA North Point, an apartment community located in Cambridge, MA, which completed construction during 2018 and contains 265 apartment homes. We own a 55.0% interest in the venture, and the venture partner owns the remaining 45.0% interest. AVA North Point is the third phase of a master planned development, the other phases of which are owned through the AC JV. During 2016, we provided the partners of the AC JV the opportunity to acquire the AVA North Point land parcel we owned as required in the right of first offer ( ROFO ) provisions for the AC JV. After certain partners of the AC JV declined to participate, we entered into the new joint venture and sold the land parcel to the venture in exchange for a cash payment and a capital account credit, and managed the development of AVA North Point in exchange for a developer fee. Upon sale of the land parcel, we recognized a gain of $10,621,000 . At December 31, 2018 , excluding costs incurred in excess of our equity in the underlying net assets of AVA North Point, we have an equity investment of $45,162,000 . During 2015, we entered into a joint venture agreement to purchase land and pursue entitlements and pre-development activity for a mixed-use development project in Sudbury, MA, including multifamily apartment homes, retail, senior housing and age-restricted housing. We have a 60.0% ownership interest in the venture. During 2017, we and our joint venture partner each acquired our respective portions of the real estate held by the venture, with our portion consisting of a parcel of land on which we are developing an apartment community, acquired for an investment of $19,200,000 . Along with our joint venture partner, we retained continuing involvement with the venture to fund the completion of the planned infrastructure and site work which is substantially complete as of December 31, 2018 . As part of the Archstone Acquisition we entered into a limited liability company agreement with Equity Residential, through which we assumed obligations of Archstone in the form of preferred interests, some of which are governed by tax protection arrangements (the Legacy JV ). We have a 40.0% interest in the Legacy JV. During the years ended December 31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , the Legacy JV redeemed certain of the preferred interests and paid accrued dividends, of which our portion was $1,120,000 , $2,000,000 and $1,960,000 , respectively. At December 31, 2018 , the remaining preferred interests had an aggregate liquidation value of $36,806,000 , our 40.0% share of which was included in accrued expenses and other liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets presented elsewhere in this report. 49 Table of Contents In conjunction with the Archstone Acquisition, through subsidiaries, we entered into three limited liability company agreements with Equity Residential (collectively, the Residual JV ) through which we and Equity Residential acquired (i) certain assets of Archstone that we and Equity Residential have divested (the Residual Assets ), and (ii) various liabilities of Archstone that we and Equity Residential agreed to assume (the Residual Liabilities ). The Residual Assets included various licenses, insurance policies, contracts, office leases and other miscellaneous assets. The Residual Liabilities include most existing or future litigation and claims related to Archstone operations for periods before the close of the Archstone Acquisition, except for (i) claims that principally relate to the physical condition of the assets acquired directly by us or Equity Residential, which generally remain the sole responsibility of us or Equity Residential, as applicable, and (ii) certain tax and other litigation between Archstone and various equity holders in Archstone related to periods before the close of the Archstone Acquisition, and claims which may arise due to changes in the capital structure of Archstone that occurred prior to closing, for which the seller has agreed to indemnify us and Equity Residential. We jointly control the Residual JV with Equity Residential and we hold a 40.0% economic interest in the Residual JV. We believe our remaining potential obligations under the Residual JV will not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. In addition, during 2018, we held an investment in, and received the final distributions for Fund II. Fund II was established to engage in a real estate acquisition program through a discretionary investment fund. We believe this investment format provides the following attributes: (i) third-party joint venture equity as an additional source of financing to expand and diversify our portfolio; (ii) additional sources of income in the form of property management and asset management fees and, potentially, incentive distributions if the performance exceeds certain thresholds; and (iii) additional visibility into the transactions occurring in multifamily assets that helps us with other investment decisions related to our wholly-owned portfolio. Fund II had six institutional investors, including us. One of our wholly-owned subsidiaries was the general partner of Fund II and we had an equity interest of 31.3% combined general partner and limited partner equity interest. Upon achievement of a threshold return, we had a right to incentive distributions for our promoted interest which represented the first 40.0% of further Fund II distributions, which was in addition to our share of the remaining 60.0% of distributions. Fund II served as the exclusive vehicle for acquiring apartment communities from its formation in 2008 through the close of its investment period in August 2011. In 2017, Fund II sold its final apartment communities and we completed the dissolution of Fund II in 2018. As of December 31, 2018 , we had investments in the following unconsolidated real estate entities accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Refer to Note 5, Investments in Real Estate Entities, of the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report, which includes information on the aggregate assets, liabilities and equity, as well as operating results, and our proportionate share of their operating results. For ventures holding operating apartment communities as of December 31, 2018 , detail of the real estate and associated funding underlying our unconsolidated investments is presented in the following table (dollars in thousands). 50 Table of Contents Debt (2) Unconsolidated Real Estate Investments Company Ownership Percentage # of Apartment Homes Total Capitalized Cost (1) Principal Amount Type Interest Rate (3) Maturity Date NYTA MF Investors LLC 1.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements In addition to our investment interests in consolidated and unconsolidated real estate entities, we have certain off-balance sheet arrangements with the entities in which we invest. Additional discussion of these entities can be found in Note 5, Investments in Real Estate Entities, of our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report. 51 Table of Contents We have not guaranteed the debt of our unconsolidated real estate entities, as referenced in the table above, nor do we have any obligation to fund this debt should the unconsolidated real estate entities be unable to do so. In the future, in the event the unconsolidated real estate entities were unable to meet their obligations under a loan, we cannot predict at this time whether we would provide any voluntary support, or take any other action, as any such action would depend on a variety of factors, including the amount of support required and the possibility that such support could enhance the return of the unconsolidated real estate entities and/or our returns by providing time for performance to improve. There are no other material lines of credit, side agreements, financial guarantees or any other derivative financial instruments related to or between our unconsolidated real estate entities and us. In evaluating our capital structure and overall leverage, management takes into consideration our proportionate share of the indebtedness of unconsolidated entities in which we have an interest. Contractual Obligations Scheduled contractual obligations required for the next five years and thereafter are as follows as of December 31, 2018 (dollars in thousands): Payments due by period Total Less than 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More than 5 Years Debt Obligations $ 7,102,355 $ 118,546 $ 1,123,160 $ 1,154,757 $ 4,705,892 Interest on Debt Obligations (1) 2,578,835 257,366 465,374 386,854 1,469,241 Operating Lease Obligations (2) 504,865 14,166 25,062 25,656 439,981 Capital Lease Obligations (2)(3) 46,618 1,075 2,157 2,166 41,220 $ 10,232,673 $ 391,153 $ 1,615,753 $ 1,569,433 $ 6,656,334 _________________________________ (1) Interest payments on variable rate debt obligations are calculated based on the rate as of December 31, 2018 . (2) Includes land leases expiring between October 2026 and March 2142 . Amounts do not include any adjustment for purchase options available under the land leases. (3) Aggregate capital lease payments include $26,375 in interest costs. Inflation and Deflation Substantially all of our apartment leases are for a term of one year or less. In an inflationary environment, this may allow us to realize increased rents upon renewal of existing leases or the beginning of new leases. Short-term leases generally minimize our risk from the adverse effect of inflation, although these leases generally permit residents to leave at the end of the lease term and therefore expose us to the effect of a decline in market rents. Similarly, in a deflationary rent environment, we may be exposed to declining rents more quickly under these shorter-term leases. Recent U.S. Federal Income Tax Updates This summary is for general information purposes only and is not tax advice. This discussion does not address all aspects of taxation that may be relevant to particular holders of our securities in light of their personal investment or tax circumstances. The following discussion supplements and updates the disclosures under Federal Income Tax Considerations and Consequences of Your Investment in the prospectus dated February 23, 2018 contained in our Registration Statement on Form S-3 filed with the SEC on February 23, 2018. Consolidated Appropriations Act Updates On March 23, 2018, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 (the CAA ) was enacted. The CAA amended various provisions of the Code and implicate certain tax-related disclosures contained in the prospectus. As a result, the discussion under Federal Income Tax Considerations and Consequences of Your Investment-U.S. Taxation of Non-U.S. Stockholders-Special FIRPTA Rules of the prospectus is replaced with the following paragraphs: 52 Table of Contents Special FIRPTA Rules. To the extent our stock is held directly (or indirectly through one or more partnerships) by a qualified shareholder, it will not be treated as a U.S. real property interest for such qualified shareholder. Further, to the extent such treatment applies, any distribution to such shareholder will not be treated as gain recognized from the sale or exchange of a U.S. real property interest. For these purposes, a qualified shareholder is generally a non-U.S. stockholder that (i)(A) is eligible for treaty benefits under an income tax treaty with the United States that includes an exchange of information program, and the principal class of interests of which is listed and regularly traded on one or more stock exchanges as defined by the treaty, or (B) is a foreign limited partnership organized in a jurisdiction with an exchange of information agreement with the United States and that has a class of regularly traded limited partnership units (having a value greater than 50% of the value of all partnership units) on the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq, (ii) is a qualified collective investment vehicle (within the meaning of Section 897(k)(3)(B) of the Code) and (iii) maintains records of persons holding 5% or more of the class of interests described in clauses (i)(A) or (i)(B) above. However, in the case of a qualified shareholder having one or more applicable investors, the exception described in the first sentence of this paragraph will not apply to the applicable percentage of the qualified shareholder's stock (with applicable percentage generally meaning the percentage of the value of the interests in the qualified shareholder held by applicable investors after applying certain constructive ownership rules). The applicable percentage of the amount realized by a qualified shareholder on the disposition of our stock or with respect to a distribution from us attributable to gain from the sale or exchange of a U.S. real property interest will be treated as amounts realized from the disposition of U.S. real property interest. Such treatment shall also apply to applicable investors in respect of distributions treated as a sale or exchange of stock with respect to a qualified shareholder. For these purposes, an applicable investor is a person (other than a qualified shareholder) who generally holds an interest in the qualified shareholder and holds more than 10% of our stock applying certain constructive ownership rules. For FIRPTA purposes, a qualified foreign pension fund shall not be treated as a non-U.S. stockholder, and any entity all of the interests of which are held by an qualified foreign pension fund shall be treated as such a fund. A "qualified foreign pension fund" is an organization or arrangement (i) created or organized in a foreign country, (ii) established to provide retirement or pension benefits to current or former employees (including self-employed individuals) or their designees by either (A) a foreign country as a result of services rendered by such employees to their employers, or (B) one or more employers in consideration for services rendered by such employees to such employers, (iii) which does not have a single participant or beneficiary that has a right to more than 5% of its assets or income, (iv) which is subject to government regulation and with respect to which annual information about its beneficiaries is provided, or is otherwise available, to relevant local tax authorities and (v) with respect to which, under its local laws, (A) contributions that would otherwise be subject to tax are deductible or excluded from its gross income or taxed at a reduced rate, or (B) taxation of its investment income is deferred, or such income is excluded from its gross income or taxed at a reduced rate. In addition, the CAA clarified that for purposes of determining if a REIT is a domestically controlled qualified investment entity under FIRPTA, the presumption that generally a person holding less than 5% of a REIT class of stock that is regularly traded on an established securities market in the United States for five years has been, and will be, treated as a U.S. person applies for testing periods ending on or after December 18, 2015 (e.g., if a testing period ends on June 1, 2018, then the presumption applies for the entire five-year period starting on June 1, 2013). The CAA also amended numerous Code provisions relating to the new rules applicable to federal income tax audits of partnerships effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 to provide that a broader range of partnership-related items may be adjusted on audit or in other tax proceedings. Recent FATCA Regulations On December 18, 2018, the Internal Revenue Service promulgated proposed Treasury Regulations under Sections 1471-1474 of the Code (commonly referred to as FATCA), which proposed regulations eliminate FATCA withholding on gross proceeds of a disposition of property that can produce U.S. source interest or dividends and thus implicate certain tax-related disclosures contained in the prospectus. While these proposed Treasury Regulations have not yet been finalized, taxpayers are generally entitled to rely on the proposed Treasury Regulations (subject to certain limited exceptions). As a result, the following revisions are made to the prospectus: In the first sentence of the fourth paragraph under Federal Income Tax Considerations and Consequences of Your Investment - Taxation of Non-U.S. Holders of Debt Securities - Disposition of the Debt Securities, of the prospectus, the phrase subject to the discussion below regarding FATCA withholding is deleted; and 53 Table of Contents The paragraph under Federal Income Tax Considerations and Consequences of Your Investment - Other Tax Consequences for Avalon Bay, its Stockholders, and Holders of its Debt Securities - Other U.S. Federal Income Tax Withholding and Reporting Requirements; FATCA of the prospectus is replaced with the following: Other U.S. Federal Income Tax Withholding and Reporting Requirements; FATCA. The FATCA provisions of the Code, subject to administrative guidance and certain intergovernmental agreements entered into thereunder, impose a 30% withholding tax on certain types of payments made to foreign financial institutions and certain other non-U.S. entities unless (i) the foreign financial institution undertakes certain diligence and reporting obligations or (ii) the foreign non-financial entity either certifies it does not have any substantial United States owners or furnishes identifying information regarding each substantial United States owner. If the payee is a foreign financial institution that is not subject to special treatment under certain intergovernmental agreements, it must enter into an agreement with the United States Treasury Department requiring, among other things, that it undertakes to identify accounts held by certain United States persons or United States-owned foreign entities, annually report certain information about such accounts, and withhold 30% on payments to account holders whose actions prevent them from complying with these reporting and other requirements. Investors in jurisdictions that have entered into intergovernmental agreements may, in lieu of the foregoing requirements, be required to report such information to their home jurisdictions. The compliance requirements under FATCA are complex and special requirements may apply to certain categories of payees. Clarification Finally, the discussion under Federal Income Tax Considerations and Consequences of Your Investment-U.S. Taxation of Non-U.S. Stockholders-Distributions by AvalonBay of the prospectus is clarified to explain that the exception to FIPRTA for 10% or smaller holders may apply only if our common stock is regularly traded an established securities market located in the United States. Forward-Looking Statements This Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements as that term is defined under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You can identify forward-looking statements by our use of the words believe, expect, anticipate, intend, estimate, assume, project, plan, may, shall, will and other similar expressions in this Form 10-K, that predict or indicate future events and trends and that do not report historical matters. These statements include, among other things, statements regarding our intent, belief or expectations with respect to: our potential development, redevelopment, acquisition or disposition of communities; the timing and cost of completion of apartment communities under construction, reconstruction, development or redevelopment; the timing of lease-up, occupancy and stabilization of apartment communities; the pursuit of land on which we are considering future development; the anticipated operating performance of our communities; cost, yield, revenue, NOI and earnings estimates; our declaration or payment of dividends; our joint venture and discretionary fund activities; our policies regarding investments, indebtedness, acquisitions, dispositions, financings and other matters; our qualification as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code; the real estate markets in Northern and Southern California, Denver, Colorado, and Southeast Florida, and markets in selected states in the Mid-Atlantic, New England, Metro New York/New Jersey and Pacific Northwest regions of the United States and in general; the availability of debt and equity financing; interest rates; general economic conditions including the potential impacts from current economic conditions; trends affecting our financial condition or results of operations; and the impact of outstanding legal proceedings. We cannot assure the future results or outcome of the matters described in these statements; rather, these statements merely reflect our current expectations of the approximate outcomes of the matters discussed. We do not undertake a duty to update these forward-looking statements, and therefore they may not represent our estimates and assumptions after the date of this report. You should not rely on forward-looking statements because they involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. These risks, uncertainties and other factors may cause our actual results, performance or achievements 54 Table of Contents to differ materially from the anticipated future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. You should carefully review the discussion under Item 1A. Risk Factors in this report for further discussion of risks associated with forward-looking statements. Some of the factors that could cause our actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the following: we may fail to secure development opportunities due to an inability to reach agreements with third parties to obtain land at attractive prices or to obtain desired zoning and other local approvals; we may abandon or defer development opportunities for a number of reasons, including changes in local market conditions which make development less desirable, increases in costs of development, increases in the cost of capital or lack of capital availability, resulting in losses; construction costs of a community may exceed our original estimates; we may not complete construction and lease-up of communities under development or redevelopment on schedule, resulting in increased interest costs and construction costs and a decrease in our expected rental revenues; occupancy rates and market rents may be adversely affected by competition and local economic and market conditions which are beyond our control; financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all, and our cash flows from operations and access to cost effective capital may be insufficient for the development of our pipeline which could limit our pursuit of opportunities; our cash flows may be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest, and we may be unable to refinance existing indebtedness or the terms of such refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of existing indebtedness; we may be unsuccessful in our management of the U.S. Fund, the AC JV or the REIT vehicles that are used with each respective joint venture; we may be unsuccessful in managing changes in our portfolio composition; and our expectations, estimates and assumptions regarding outstanding legal proceedings are subject to change. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. If our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different, or different assumptions were made, it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied, resulting in different financial results or a different presentation of our financial statements. Below is a discussion of the accounting policies that we consider critical to an understanding of our financial condition and operating results that may require complex or significant judgment in their application or require estimates about matters which are inherently uncertain. A discussion of our significant accounting policies, including further discussion of the accounting policies described below, can be found in Note 1, Organization, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies, of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Principles of Consolidation We may enter into various joint venture agreements with unrelated third parties to hold or develop real estate assets. We must determine for each of these ventures whether to consolidate the entity or account for our investment under the equity or cost basis of accounting. We determine whether to consolidate certain entities based on our rights and obligations under the joint venture agreements, applying the applicable accounting guidance. For investment interests that we do not consolidate, we evaluate the guidance to determine the accounting framework to apply. The application of the rules in evaluating the accounting treatment for each joint venture is complex and requires substantial management judgment. Therefore, we believe the decision to choose an appropriate accounting framework is a critical accounting estimate. If we were to consolidate the joint ventures that we accounted for using the equity method at December 31, 2018 , our assets would have increased by $1,247,749,000 and our liabilities would have increased by $741,282,000 . We would be required to consolidate those joint ventures currently not consolidated for financial reporting purposes if the facts and circumstances changed, including but not limited to the following reasons, none of which are currently expected to occur: For entities not considered to be variable interest entities, the nature of the entity changed such that it would be considered a variable interest entity and we were considered the primary beneficiary. 55 Table of Contents For entities in which we do not hold a controlling voting and/or variable interest, the contractual arrangement changed resulting in our investment interest being either a controlling voting and/or variable interest. We evaluate our accounting for investments on a regular basis including when a significant change in the design of an entity occurs. Cost Capitalization We capitalize costs during the development of assets. Capitalization begins when we determine that development of a future asset is probable and continues until the asset, or a portion of the asset, is delivered and is ready for its intended use. For redevelopment efforts, we capitalize costs either (i) in advance of taking apartment homes out of service when significant renovation of the common area has begun and continue until the redevelopment is completed, or (ii) when an apartment home is taken out of service for redevelopment and continue until the redevelopment is completed and the apartment home is available for a new resident. Rental income and operating expenses incurred during the initial lease-up or post-redevelopment lease-up period are fully recognized in earnings as they accrue. During the development and redevelopment efforts we capitalize all direct costs and indirect costs which have been incurred as a result of the development and redevelopment activities. These costs include interest and related loan fees, property taxes as well as other direct and indirect costs. Interest is capitalized for any project-specific financing, as well as for general corporate financing to the extent of our aggregate investment in the projects. Indirect project costs, which include personnel and office and administrative costs that are clearly associated with our development and redevelopment efforts, are also capitalized. Capitalized indirect costs associated with our development and redevelopment activities are comprised primarily of compensation related costs for associates dedicated to our development and redevelopment efforts and total $46,857,000 , $47,063,000 and $45,201,000 for 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively. The estimation of the direct and indirect costs to capitalize as part of our development and redevelopment activities requires judgment and, as such, we believe cost capitalization to be a critical accounting estimate. There may be a change in our operating expenses in the event that there are changes in accounting guidance governing capitalization or changes to our levels of development or redevelopment activity. If changes in the accounting guidance limit our ability to capitalize costs or if we reduce our development and redevelopment activities without a corresponding decrease in indirect project costs, there may be an increase in our operating expenses. We capitalize pre-development costs incurred in pursuit of Development Rights. These costs include legal fees, design fees and related overhead costs. Future development of these pursuits is dependent upon various factors, including zoning and regulatory approval, rental market conditions, construction costs and availability of capital. Pre-development costs incurred for pursuits for which future development is not yet considered probable are expensed as incurred. In addition, if the status of a Development Right changes, making future development no longer probable, any capitalized pre-development costs are written off with a charge to expense. Due to the subjectivity in determining whether a pursuit will result in the development of an apartment community, and therefore should be capitalized, the accounting for pursuit costs is a critical accounting estimate. As of December 31, 2018 , capitalized pursuit costs associated with Development Rights totaled $47,443,000 . Abandoned Pursuit Costs & Asset Impairment We evaluate our real estate and other long-lived assets for impairment when potential indicators of impairment exist. If events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a property may not be recoverable, we assess its recoverability by comparing the carrying amount of the property to its estimated undiscounted future cash flows. If the carrying amount exceeds the aggregate undiscounted future cash flows, we recognize an impairment loss to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value of the property. We assess land held for development for impairment if our intent changes with respect to the development of the land. We evaluate our unconsolidated investments for impairment, considering both the carrying value of the investment, estimated to be the expected proceeds that it would receive if the entity were dissolved and the net assets were liquidated, as well as our proportionate share of any impairment of assets held by unconsolidated investments. We expense costs related to abandoned pursuits, which include the abandonment of Development Rights and disposition pursuits. These costs can vary greatly, and the costs incurred in any given period may be significantly different in future years. Our focus on value creation through real estate development presents an impairment risk in the event of a future deterioration of the real estate and/or capital markets or a decision by us to reduce or cease development. We cannot predict the occurrence of future events that may cause an impairment assessment to be performed, or the likelihood of any future impairment charges, if any. You should also review Item 1A. Risk Factors in this Form 10-K. 56 Table of Contents REIT Status We are a Maryland corporation that has elected to be treated, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, as a REIT. We elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Code for the year ended December 31, 1994 and have not revoked such election. A REIT is a corporate entity which holds real estate interests and must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that it currently distribute at least 90% of its adjusted taxable income to stockholders. As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to corporate level federal income tax on our taxable income if we annually distribute 100% of our taxable income to our stockholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to regular federal and state corporate income taxes and may not be able to elect to qualify as a REIT for four subsequent taxable years. For example, if we failed to qualify as a REIT in 2018 , our net income would have decreased by approximately $266,240,000 . Our qualification as a REIT requires management to exercise significant judgment and consideration with respect to operational matters and accounting treatment. Therefore, we believe our REIT status is a critical accounting estimate. Acquisition of Investments in Real Estate We assess each acquisition of an operating community to determine if it meets the definition of a business or if it qualifies as an asset acquisition. We expect that acquisitions of individual operating communities will generally be viewed as asset acquisitions, and result in the capitalization of acquisition costs, and the allocation of purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the relative fair value of the respective assets and liabilities. 57 Table of Contents
