ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS BUSINESS OVERVIEW We operate primarily through three business segments: the Companion Animal Group ( CAG ), Water testing business ( Water ) and the Food Diagnostics Group ( FDG ). CAG is comprised of the following product and service categories: rapid assays, instruments and consumables, laboratory and consulting services, pharmaceuticals, and information products and services and digital radiography systems. Water develops, designs, manufactures and distributes products to detect contaminants in water. FDG develops, designs, manufactures and distributes products to detect disease and contaminants in production animals and food. Other items that are not included in our reportable segments are comprised primarily of corporate research and development and interest income. We have conformed the financial information about segments for the year ended December 31, 2002 to our presentation of reportable segments for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003. Previously we reported two operating segments. Additionally, we have conformed the discussion of CAG results for 2002 and 2003 to the product and service categories we are using in 2004 as set forth in the table below. 12 For the three years ended December 31, 2004 revenues by product and service categories were as follows (in thousands ): December 31, 2004 2003 2002 CAG revenue: Instruments and consumables $ 197,939 $ 177,374 $ 143,610 Rapid assay products 93,506 82,978 70,466 Laboratory and consulting services 118,596 94,650 86,468 Information products and services and digital radiography 28,163 22,463 21,200 Pharmaceutical products 10,483 6,954 5,153 Net CAG revenue 448,687 384,419 326,897 Net water revenue 53,098 46,936 41,969 FDG revenue Production animal products and services 31,690 28,580 27,466 Dairy testing products 15,706 16,057 16,338 Net FDG revenue 47,396 44,637 43,804 Net revenue $ 549,181 $ 475,992 $ 412,670 The following is a discussion of the strategic and operating factors that we believe have the most significant effect on the performance of our business. Companion Animal Group In the CAG segment, we believe we have developed a strategic advantage over companies with more narrow product or service offerings. The breadth of our products and services gives us scale in sales and distribution, permits us to offer integrated disease-management solutions that leverage the advantages of both point-of-care and laboratory testing, and facilitates the flow of medical information in the clinic by integrating practice-management software systems with laboratory test results and in-clinic test results from our IDEXX VetLab analyzers. In the U.S., we sell instrument consumables, rapid assays and pharmaceuticals primarily through distributors, and, therefore, our reported sales of these products are sales made to distributors, rather than sales to veterinarians, the end-users. Because distributor inventory levels and purchasing patterns may fluctuate, sales of a particular product line in a particular period may not always be representative of the underlying customer demand for the product. Therefore, we closely track sales of these products by our U.S. distributors to the clinics ( clinic-level sales ), which we think provides a more accurate picture of the real growth rate for these products. In the discussion of results below, we note certain instances where we believe reported sales have been influenced, positively or negatively, by changes in distributor inventories. Instruments and Instrument Consumables . Our instrument strategy is to provide veterinarians with an integrated set of instruments that, individually and together, provide superior diagnostic information in the clinic, enabling veterinarians to practice better medicine and build more profitable practices. We derive substantial revenues from the sale of consumables that are used in these instruments. During the early stage of an instrument's life cycle, we derive relatively greater revenues from instrument placements, while consumable sales become relatively more significant in later stages as the installed base of instruments increases and instrument placements begin to decline. We have a large installed base of VetTest chemistry analyzers, and substantially all of our revenues from that product line are now derived from consumables sales, although we continue to place instruments through sales and through rental and other programs. Our long-term success in this area of our business is dependent upon new customer acquisition, customer retention and increased customer utilization of those instruments. To increase utilization, we seek to educate veterinarians about best medical practices that emphasize the importance of blood and urine chemistry testing for a variety of diagnostic purposes. 13 We purchase the consumables used in VetTest chemistry analyzers from Ortho under a supply agreement that continues through 2018. This supply agreement provides us with a long-term source of slides at costs that improve annually through 2010, and also improve over the term of the agreement as a result of increasing volume. Under this agreement, we are developing and expect to introduce a next-generation chemistry analyzer for the veterinary market based on the Ortho dry-slide technology, and Ortho would supply us with slide consumables used in both the new instrument and the VetTest chemistry analyzer. We do not expect this next-generation analyzer to be commercially available before 2006. Our declining cost of VetTest slides is expected to improve margins in our instruments and consumables product line beginning in 2006. In the fourth quarter of 2002, we introduced the LaserCyte hematology analyzer, which provides more extensive hematological diagnostic information than our original platform, the QBC VetAutoread system. A substantial portion of LaserCyte placements have been made at veterinary clinics that already own our QBC VetAutoread instruments. Although we have experienced growth in sales of hematology consumables, LaserCyte consumable sales have been partially offset by declines in sales of QBC VetAutoread consumables. Because the gross margin percentage of LaserCyte consumables exceeds the gross margin percentage of the QBC VetAutoread consumables, gross margin from hematology consumables is expected to increase with continued penetration of the LaserCyte system. Our gross margins on LaserCyte system sales have been low due to higher manufacturing, service and warranty costs associated with a new analyzer. As we have gained experience with the analyzer, we have improved manufacturing efficiency and reduced warranty and service costs, which has improved margins. While we expect that LaserCyte margins will continue to improve, they will continue to have a negative impact on overall CAG gross margins. With all of our instrument lines, we seek to differentiate our products based on superior system capability, quality of diagnostic information, reliability, integration with the IDEXX VetLab suite, and customer service. Our equipment and consumables typically are sold at a premium price to competitive offerings. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to maintain a premium price strategy. Laboratory and Consulting Services . We believe that more than half of all diagnostic testing by U.S. veterinarians is done at outside reference laboratories such as our IDEXX Reference Laboratories. We attempt to differentiate our laboratory testing services from those of our competitors primarily on the basis of quality, customer service and technology. Revenue growth in this business is achieved both through increased sales at existing laboratories and through the acquisition of new customers, including through laboratory acquisitions and opening new laboratories. In February 2004, we acquired a laboratory in Columbus, Ohio, in November 2004, we opened a laboratory in Seattle, Washington, and we acquired Vet Med Lab, which is based in Germany and is the largest European veterinary reference laboratory. Profitability of this business is largely the result of our ability to achieve efficiencies from both volume and operational improvements. New laboratories typically will operate at a loss until testing volumes reach a level that permits profitability. Acquired laboratories frequently operate less profitably than our existing laboratories and those laboratories may not achieve profitability comparable to our existing laboratories for a year or more while we implement operating improvements. Therefore, in the short term, new and acquired laboratories generally will have a negative effect on the operating margin of the laboratory and consulting services business. Rapid Assays . Our rapid assay business comprises single-use kits for in-clinic testing and microwell-based kits for large clinic and laboratory testing for canine and feline diseases and conditions. Our rapid assay strategy is to develop, manufacture, market and sell proprietary tests with superior performance that address important medical needs. As in our other lines of business, we also seek to differentiate our products through superior customer support. These products carry price premiums over competitive products that we believe do not offer equivalent performance and diagnostic capabilities, and which we believe do not include a similar level of support. We augment our product development and customer service efforts with marketing programs that enhance medical awareness and understanding regarding our target diseases and the importance of diagnostic testing. Water Our strategy in the water testing business is to develop, manufacture, market and sell proprietary products with superior performance, supported by exceptional customer service. Our customers are primarily water utilities to whom strong relationships and customer support are very important. Over the past several years, the rate of growth of this product line has slowed as a result of increased competition and market penetration. International sales of water-testing products represented 41% of total water product sales in 2004, and we expect that future growth in this business will be significantly dependent on our ability to increase international sales. Growth also will be dependent on our ability to enhance and broaden our product line. Most water microbiological testing is driven by regulation, and, in many countries, a test may not be used for regulatory testing unless it has been approved by the applicable regulatory body. As a result, we maintain an active regulatory program under which we are seeking regulatory approvals in a number of countries, primarily in Europe. 14 Food Diagnostics Group Production Animal Services . We develop, manufacture, market and sell a broad range of tests for various poultry, cattle and swine diseases and conditions, and have an active research and development and in-licensing program in this area. Our strategy is to offer proprietary tests with superior performance characteristics. Disease outbreaks are episodic and unpredictable, and certain diseases that are prevalent at one time may be substantially contained or eradicated. In response to outbreaks, testing initiatives may lead to exceptional demand for certain products in certain periods. Conversely, successful eradication programs may result in significantly decreased demand for certain products. The performance of this business, therefore, can be subject to fluctuation. In 2004, approximately 73% of our sales in this business was international. Because of the significant dependence of this business on international sales, the performance of the business is particularly subject to the various risks described below that are associated with doing business internationally. In 2004, we received USDA approval of our postmortem test for BSE (mad cow disease) and, in February 2005, we were informed that this test was approved by the European Commission for sale in EU member countries. While BSE testing is very limited in the U.S., a significant market for BSE testing exists in Europe, and marketing and sale of this product will be a major priority for our Production Animal Services business in 2005. Dairy Testing . Our strategy in the dairy testing business is to develop, manufacture and sell antibiotic residue-testing products that satisfy applicable regulatory requirements for testing of bulk milk by producers and provide reliable field performance. Sales of dairy-testing products have declined over the last several years largely as a result of increased competition in the domestic market. To increase sales of dairy-testing products, we will need to increase penetration in geographies outside the United States and in the farm segment of the dairy market. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to customer programs and incentives, product returns, bad debts, inventories, investments, intangible assets, income taxes, warranty obligations, restructuring and contingencies, and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. We believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Inventory Our inventories include material, labor and overhead, and are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market. We write down inventory for estimated obsolescence when warranted by our estimates of future demand and market conditions. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those estimated by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required, which would have a negative effect on our results of operations. As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, our net inventories included $11.9 million and $7.2 million, respectively, of component parts and finished goods associated with our LaserCyte hematology instrument. In addition, we had firm purchase commitments for an additional $1.9 million of component parts as of December 31, 2004. As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, $2.2 million and $3.7 million of this inventory, respectively, required rework before it could be used to manufacture finished goods. As of December 31, 2004, the inventory was net of a $0.3 million write-down for inventory estimated to be obsolete. There were no write-downs of this inventory as of December 31, 2003 for inventory estimated to be obsolete. We expect to fully realize our investment in inventory and purchase commitments. However, if we alter the design of this product, we may be required to write off some or all of the remaining associated inventory. 15 Navigator is our pharmaceutical product for the treatment of equine protozoal myeloencephalitis ( EPM ) that we launched during the fourth quarter of 2003. Our inventories as of December 31, 2004 included $8.7 million of inventory associated with Navigator , consisting of $0.4 million of finished goods and $8.3 million of active ingredient and other raw materials. In December 2004, we entered into an amendment to our agreement with our supplier of nitazoxanide, the active ingredient in Navigator , under which we paid the supplier $0.9 million in January 2005, and the supplier agreed until 2017 to replace any expiring inventory of nitazoxanide with longer-dated material. We believe that this agreement has substantially mitigated the risk that we would be required to write down nitazoxanide inventory due to its anticipated expiration prior to sale. Valuation of Long-Lived and Intangible Assets and Goodwill We assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles, long-lived assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include, but are not limited to, the following: Significant under-performance relative to historical or projected future operating results; Failure to obtain regulatory approval of certain products; Significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business; Significant increase in the discount rate assumed to calculate the present value of future cash flow; Significant negative industry or economic trends; and Significant advancements or changes in technology. When we determine that the carrying value of intangibles, long-lived assets and goodwill may not be recoverable based on a change in events and circumstances discussed above, we measure any impairment based on factors such as projected cash flows. Net intangible assets and goodwill totaled $124.5 million as of December 31, 2004, consisting of $69.2 million related to veterinary laboratories (of which $54.1 million represents goodwill), $19.3 million related to production animal services (of which $7.6 million represents goodwill), $19.2 million related to water-testing products (of which $16.9 million represents goodwill), $15.7 million related to pharmaceutical products (of which $13.7 million represents goodwill), and $1.1 million of other (of which $0.6 million represents goodwill). Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue when four criteria are met. These include (i) persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists, (ii) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, (iii) the sales price is fixed and determinable, and (iv) collectibility is reasonably assured. We recognize revenue at the time of shipment to distributors for substantially all products sold through distributors, as title and risk of loss pass to these customers on delivery to the common carrier. We recognize revenue for the remainder of our customers when the product is delivered, except as noted below. Our distributors do not have the right to return products. We recognize revenue on sales of instruments after the instrument is installed because installation is considered essential to the usability of the instrument, and the customer has accepted the instrument. We recognize service revenue at the time the service is performed. We recognize revenue associated with extended maintenance agreements ratably over the life of the contracts. Amounts collected in advance of revenue recognition are recorded as a current or long-term liability based on the time from the balance sheet date to the future date of revenue recognition. 16 We recognize revenue from noncancelable software licenses and hardware systems upon installation of the software (and completion of training if applicable) or hardware and customer acceptance because collection is probable and we have no significant further obligations. We recognize revenue on certain instrument systems under rental programs over the life of the rental agreement. Amounts collected in advance of revenue recognition are recorded as a current or long-term liability based on the time from the balance sheet date to the future date of revenue recognition. When instruments are sold together with extended maintenance agreements, we allocate revenue to the extended maintenance agreement under EITF 00-21, Accounting for Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables. Accordingly, the total consideration received is allocated to the elements based on their relative fair values, which is determined by amounts charged separately for the delivered and undelivered elements to other customers. The deferred revenue related to the extended maintenance agreements is recognized ratably over the maintenance period. The delivered elements are recognized as revenue when appropriate under the policies described above. Shipping costs reimbursed by the customer are included in revenue. We record estimated reductions to revenue in connection with customer programs and incentive offerings, which may give customers credits, award points, which may be applied to trade amounts owed us and/or toward future purchase of our products and services, or trade-in rights. We estimate these reductions based on our experience with similar customer programs in prior years. Revenue reductions are recorded on a quarterly basis based on issuance of credits, points actually awarded and estimates of points to be awarded in the future based on current revenue. For the SNAP-Up-the-Savings program, estimates of future points are revised quarterly and finalized annually in the third quarter of each year upon the issuance of points to customers. For our Practice Developer volume discount program, we have reduced revenue assuming all points granted will result in future credits because we do not have sufficient experience with this program to estimate customer point forfeitures. We may offer customers the right to trade in instruments for credit against the purchase price of other instruments acquired in the future. For these trade-in rights, we have reduced revenue using estimates regarding the percentage of qualifying instruments that will be traded in and the average trade-in value. In 2001, we began offering guaranteed trade-in values on current sales of our QBC VetAutoread instruments, when the customer subsequently trades in the QBC VetAutoread instrument for a LaserCyte system. To qualify for a guaranteed trade-in value, the customer must trade in their QBC VetAutoread instrument within five years of original purchase. The value of the trade-in depends on the amount of time from original purchase to trade-in. We have recorded a trade-in reserve of $0.5 million for these trade-ins. The maximum trade-in liability at December 31, 2004 was $3.4 million and we anticipate that we would receive equipment valued at $0.9 million if all customers were to exercise their trade-in rights. We recognize revenue only in those situations where collection from the customer is reasonably assured. We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. We base our estimates on detailed analysis of specific customer situations and the percentage of our accounts receivable by aging category. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances might be required. Income Taxes We account for income taxes under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ( SFAS ) No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes ( SFAS No. 109 ). This statement requires that we recognize a current tax liability or asset for current taxes payable or refundable, respectively; and a deferred tax liability or asset, as the case may be, for the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between book and tax treatment of assets and liabilities and carryforwards to the extent they are realizable. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. We have recorded a valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets that relate to state and international net operating loss carryforwards and certain other unrealizable international deferred tax assets. While we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made. Likewise, should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made. 17 We consider the operating earnings of non-United States subsidiaries to be indefinitely invested outside the United States, the cumulative amount of which was $85.5 million as of December 31, 2004. No provision has been made for United States federal and state, or international taxes that may result from future remittances of undistributed earnings of non-United States subsidiaries. Should we repatriate non-United States earnings, we would have to adjust the income tax provision in the period in which the decision to repatriate earnings is made. The recently enacted American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 allows for a reduced rate of United States tax on qualifying repatriations of earnings held outside the United States. We are currently studying the impact of this provision and we have not made a final determination as to the amounts, if any, that will be repatriated. As such, the income tax effect of any repatriation cannot be estimated. Warranty Reserves We provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized. Our actual warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates and service costs incurred in correcting a product failure. Should actual product failure rates or service costs differ from our estimates, which are based on historical data, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required. As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, we had accrued $3.7 million and $3.3 million for estimated warranty expense, respectively, including warranty reserves of $3.3 million and $3.1 million, respectively, for LaserCyte systems. Warranty expense was $3.6 million, $3.6 million and $0.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The increase in warranty liability during 2004 compared to 2003 was due to the impact of the growing installed base of LaserCyte systems, partially offset by a reduction of warranty cost resulting from our improved service experience for these instruments. We charge warranty expense to the cost of LaserCyte revenue at the time revenue is recognized on the system based on the estimated cost to repair the instrument over its two-year warranty period. Cost of revenue reflects not only estimated warranty expense for the systems sold in the current period, but also any changes in estimated warranty expense for the installed base that results from our quarterly evaluation of service experience. The reduction in estimated warranty costs per instrument resulted in a reduction of $0.6 million in cost of product revenue for the year ended December 31, 2004. We sell extended maintenance agreements covering our instruments. We anticipate that losses will be incurred for certain of these contracts and have recognized provisions for the estimated losses. The anticipated loss reserves were $0.1 million and $0.4 million as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Estimates for Certain Claims We purchase insurance policies annually for individual and aggregate amounts of employee health insurance claims. We are self-insured for up to $0.1 million per claim and up to an annual aggregate limit based on the number of employees enrolled in the plan per month, which was estimated to be $12.0 million as of December 31, 2004. We estimate our liability for employee health claims based on individual and aggregate coverage, our monthly claims experience, the number of employees enrolled in the program, and the average time from when a claim is incurred to the time it is reported. We purchase workers compensation insurance policies annually. Prior to January 1, 2003, we were fully insured for workers compensation claims. Beginning January 1, 2003, we purchased an insurance policy under which we are liable for the first $0.25 million in claims per occurrence and up to an aggregate limit based on payroll, which was approximately $3.0 million and $1.4 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. We entered into a similar policy effective January 1, 2005. We estimate our liability for workers compensation claims based on the insurance policy limits, claims incurred and the estimated ultimate cost to litigate and/or settle the claims. Based on this analysis, we have recognized cumulative expenses of $0.6 million and $0.9 million for claims incurred during the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Periodically we are notified that a claim is being made against us. We evaluate each claim based on the facts and circumstances of that claim. If warranted, we provide for our best estimate of the cost to settle or litigate the claim and evaluate the liability recorded quarterly. 18 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2004 Compared to Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2003 Revenue Total Company. Revenue for the total company increased $73.2 million, or 15%, to $549.2 million from $476.0 million in the same period of the prior year. The following table presents revenue for the Company and its operating segments: For the Twelve Months Ended December 31, Net Revenue (in thousands) 2004 2003 Dollar Change Percentage Change Percentage Change from Currency (1) Percentage Change Net of Currency Effect CAG $ 448,687 $ 384,419 $ 64,268 16 .7% 2 .7% 14 .0% Water 53,098 46,936 6,162 13 .1% 4 .0% 9 .1% FDG 47,396 44,637 2,759 6 .2% 5 .4% 0 .8% Total Company $ 549,181 $ 475,992 $ 73,189 15 .4% 3 .1% 12 .3% (1) Represents the percentage change in revenue attributed to the effect of changes in currency rates from 2003 to 2004. Companion Animal Group. Revenue for CAG increased $64.3 million, or 17%, to $448.7 million from $384.4 million in the same period of the prior year. This increase resulted primarily from increased sales of laboratory and consulting services, and instruments and consumables and, to a lesser degree, rapid assay products, information products and services, digital radiography systems, and pharmaceutical products. The favorable impact of currency exchange rates on sales outside the U.S. contributed an aggregate of $10.5 million, or 3%, to the increase in CAG revenue. The increase in sales of laboratory and consulting services (an increase of $23.9 million, or 25%) resulted primarily from higher testing volume at established laboratories, mainly in the U.S. and, to a lesser extent, in the U.K. and Australia; the inclusion of sales from laboratories acquired in late 2003 and in 2004; and, to a lesser extent, the favorable impact of currency exchange rates on sales at our laboratories outside the U.S. and higher pricing. Growth in sales of laboratory services in 2005 will continue to be positively affected by the inclusion of results from Vet Med Lab, a German veterinary reference laboratory that we acquired in November 2004. For 2005, we expect incremental sales from Vet Med Lab of $20.0 million to $25.0 million. The increase in sales of instruments and consumables (an increase of $20.6 million, or 12%) was due mainly to increased sales volume, including higher domestic clinic-level sales of VetTest slides and, to a lesser extent, tubes used with our hematology instruments, as well as higher volume outside the U.S.; the favorable impact of currency exchange rates on sales outside the U.S.; increased instrument sales, due primarily to increased sales of the LaserCyte hematology system; and the impact of changes in distributors inventory levels. Increased consumables sales volume was due primarily to an increase in our installed base of instruments during 2003 and 2004. Shipments to distributors during the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 were reduced as a result of the Company continuing efforts to improve efficiency in the distribution channel. The reduced shipments during 2003 had a positive impact on sales growth in the 2004 period. The collective impact of favorable currency exchange and favorable comparisons resulting from lower distributor purchases in 2003 caused reported growth for 2004 to be higher than our estimates of the underlying clinic-level growth of instruments and consumables. The increase in sales of rapid assay products (an increase of $10.5 million, or 13%) was due primarily to increased domestic clinic-level sales volume of canine and, to a lesser extent, feline products, as well as demand for our new SNAP test to screen dogs and cats for Giardia infection, which was launched during the first quarter of 2004; the impact of changes in distributors inventory levels; and the favorable impact of currency exchange rates on sales outside the U.S. Shipments to distributors during 2003 were reduced as a result of the Company efforts to improve efficiency in the distribution channel, which contributed to a reported sales growth in the 2004 period. The collective impact of changes in distributor inventory levels and favorable currency exchange caused reported growth for 2004 to be higher than our estimates of the underlying clinic-level growth of rapid assay products. 19 The increase in sales of information products and services and digital radiography systems (an increase of $5.7 million, or 25%), resulted primarily from higher volume of complete system sales and increased hardware sales and placements of digital radiography systems, partly offset by lower service sales. The increase in sales of pharmaceutical products (an increase of $3.5 million, or 51%) resulted in part from sales of new products launched in 2003 and 2004. For 2005, we expect slower growth in pharmaceutical sales since we will not benefit from the favorable comparisons created by the 2003 and 2004 product launches, and no new product launches are planned for 2005. Water. Revenue for Water increased $6.2 million, or 13%, to $53.1 million from $46.9 million for the same period of the prior year. The increase resulted primarily from higher sales volume and, to a lesser extent, the favorable impact of currency exchange rates on sales outside the U.S., partly offset by lower average unit prices due to price competition in certain foreign countries and higher relative sales in geographies where products are sold at lower unit prices. The favorable impact of currency exchange rates on sales outside the U.S. contributed an aggregate of $1.9 million, or 4%, to the increase in Water revenue. For 2005, we expect slower growth in Water sales due, in part, to increased competitive pressures. Food Diagnostics Group. Revenue for FDG increased $2.8 million, or 6%, to $47.4 million from $44.6 million for the same period of the prior year. The increase was due primarily to the favorable impact of currency exchange rates on sales outside the U.S. and higher sales volume of production animal diagnostics. These increases were partly offset by lower average unit prices of production animal diagnostics and dairy-testing products, and by decreased sales volume of dairy-testing products. The increase in production animal diagnostics sales was due to increased sales volume of livestock products outside the U.S. The lower average unit prices were attributable to greater price competition in certain geographies and, to a lesser extent, to higher relative sales in geographies where products are sold at lower unit prices. The favorable impact of currency exchange rates on sales outside the U.S. contributed an aggregate of $2.4 million, or 5%, to the increase in FDG revenue. For 2005, we anticipate increased FDG revenue growth led by the launch of our HerdChek BSE Antigen Test Kit, a rapid test for detection of bovine spongiform encephalopathy ( BSE ) in Europe and the full-year impact of our acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2004 of Dr. Bommeli AG ( Bommeli ), a Swiss manufacturer of production animal diagnostics. Gross Profit Total Company. Gross profit for the total company increased $48.7 million, or 21%, to $279.0 million from $230.3 million for the same period in the prior year. As a percentage of total company revenue, gross profit increased to 51% in 2004 from 48% in 2003. The following table presents gross profit and gross profit percentage for the Company and its operating segments: For the Twelve Months Ended December 31, Gross Profit (in thousands) 2004 Percent of Sales 2003 Percent of Sales Dollar Change Percentage Change CAG $ 214,927 47.9% $ 175,612 45.7% $ 39,315 22.4% Water 35,885 67.6% 31,483 67.1% 4,402 14% FDG 28,205 59.5% 23,209 52.0% 4,996 21.5% Total Company $ 279,017 50.8% $ 230,304 48.4% $ 48,713 21.2% As of July 1, 2005, we will be required to expense equity-related compensation, which will have a negative impact on our gross profit percentage and on operating margins for all of our segments.

Gross profit for CAG increased $39.3 million, or 22%, to $214.9 million from $175.6 million in the same period of the prior year due to increased sales volume across the CAG product lines and to an increase in the gross profit percentage. As a percentage of CAG revenue, gross profit increased to 48% from 46% for the same period in the prior year. The increase in gross profit percentage was attributable primarily to productivity improvements across CAG product lines and services; the favorable impact of foreign currency rates on sales denominated in those currencies, net of foreign exchange hedge contract losses; and, to a lesser extent, favorable pricing from our supplier of slide consumables compared to the same period of the prior year. The productivity improvements were partly due to manufacturing efficiencies and reductions in service costs related to our LaserCyte hematology instrument and, to a lesser extent, to fixed costs spread over a higher revenue base. The LaserCyte service cost improvements generated a favorable change in our accruals for cost of product warranties and extended maintenance agreements for all placed instruments for which we have such future obligations. Beginning in 2006, we expect CAG gross margin percentage to be favorably affected by improved consumable costs under our supply agreement with Ortho. 20 These increases in gross profit percentage were partially offset by a lower gross margin percentage recognized from laboratories acquired in 2004, including due to the purchase accounting impact of writing off supplies and, to a lesser extent, by other laboratory service expansion costs, including start-up costs of laboratories opened in the fourth quarters of 2003 and 2004. The greater proportion of laboratory sales, resulting largely from the 2004 acquisitions, relative to total CAG sales may negatively impact our CAG gross margin percentage as laboratory services generally have a lower gross margin than our product businesses. Water. Gross profit for Water increased $4.4 million, or 14%, to $35.9 million from $31.5 million for the same period in the prior year, primarily due to increased revenue. As a percentage of Water revenue, gross profit increased to 68% from 67% for the same period in the prior year. The increase in gross profit percentage was attributable primarily to the favorable impact of foreign currency rates on sales denominated in those currencies, net of foreign exchange hedge contract losses. Food Diagnostics Group. Gross profit for FDG increased $5.0 million, or 22%, to $28.2 million from $23.2 million for the same period in the prior year, primarily due to an increase in the gross profit percentage. As a percentage of FDG revenue, gross profit increased to 60% from 52% for the same period in the prior year. The increase in gross profit percentage was attributable primarily to reductions in an accrual related to a third-party claim resulting from the settlement of that claim and the favorable impact of foreign currency rates on sales denominated in those currencies, net of foreign exchange hedge contract losses, partly offset by unfavorable product costs. The reduction in the accrual for the third-party claim resulted in an aggregate benefit recognized in 2004 of $1.8 million or a four-percentage-point increase in the gross margin percentage. The unfavorable product costs were due to fixed costs spread over lower production volume in Europe and, to a lesser extent, the impact of expensing a portion of the purchase accounting fair market value adjustment of inventory obtained in connection with the 2004 acquisitions. We expect to incur integration costs in 2005 associated with the Bommeli acquisition that will negatively impact our FDG gross margin percentage. Operating Expenses Total Company. Total company operating expenses increased $21.1 million to $171.0 million from $149.9 million for the same period of the prior year. As a percentage of revenues, operating expenses remained relatively constant at 31%. The following tables present operating expenses and operating income for the Company and its operating segments: For the Twelve Months Ended December 31, Operating Expenses (in thousands) 2004 Percent of Sales 2003 Percent of Sales Dollar Change Percentage Change CAG $ 137,804 30.7% $ 120,396 31.3% $ 17,408 14.5% Water 11,626 21.9% 10,549 22.5% 1,077 10.2% FDG 18,374 38.8% 15,603 35.0% 2,771 17.8% Other 3,178 N/A 3,369 N/A (191 ) 5.7% Total Company $ 170,982 31.1% $ 149,917 31.5% $ 21,065 14.1% Operating Income (in thousands) 2004 Percent of Sales 2003 Percent of Sales Dollar Change Percentage Change CAG $ 77,123 17.2% $ 55,216 14.4% $ 21,907 39.7% Water 24,259 45.7% 20,934 44.6% 3,325 15.9% FDG 9,831 20.7% 7,606 17.0% 2,225 29.3% Other (3,178 ) N/A (3,369 ) N/A 191 (5.7% ) Total Company $ 108,035 19.7% $ 80,387 16.9% $ 27,648 34.4% 21 Companion Animal Group. Operating expenses for CAG increased $17.4 million, or 14%, to $137.8 million from $120.4 million in the same period of the prior year and were approximately constant at 31% from year to year as a percent of sales. The increase was attributable to a 23% ($13.4 million) increase in sales and marketing expense, a 10% ($2.4 million) increase in research and development expense, and a 4% ($1.6 million) increase in general and administrative expense. The increase in sales and marketing expense resulted primarily from increased sales and sales support personnel and marketing program costs; the unfavorable impact of foreign currency denominated expenses; and, to a lesser extent, expenses associated with the Vet Med Lab acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2004. The increase in research and development expense resulted primarily from increased staffing and higher spending to support instrument and pharmaceutical product development. The increase in general and administrative expense reflects higher spending on information technology and other corporate functions, partly due to expenses associated with Sarbanes-Oxley Act compliance efforts; expenses associated with laboratory acquisitions in the first and fourth quarters of 2004, including amortization of intangible assets; and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency denominated expenses, partly offset by the nonrecurrence in 2004 of expenses incurred in 2003 in connection with the write-down of fixed assets associated with the discontinuation of development of a clinical chemistry instrument. In October 2003, we extended our relationship with Ortho, the supplier of our VetTest slides. We committed to develop a next-generation clinical chemistry system based on Ortho dry-slide technology and discontinued efforts to develop the alternative system. For 2005, we expect CAG operating expenses to increase as a percent of sales due primarily to the full year impact of 2004 sales and customer support personnel additions in the U.S., as well as similar investments we plan to make in Europe, and to integration costs and intangible amortization expense associated with the Vet Med Lab acquisition during the fourth quarter of 2004, partly offset by a slight decline in research and development expense as a percent of sales as laboratory services, with its negligible research and development spending requirements, account for a greater proportion of total CAG sales. Water. Operating expenses for Water increased $1.1 million, or 10%, to $11.6 million from $10.5 million in the same period of the prior year and were approximately constant at 22% from year to year as a percent of sales. The increase was attributable to a 25% ($0.8 million) increase in general and administrative expense, a 7% ($0.1 million) increase in research and development expense, and a 2% ($0.1 million) increase in sales and marketing expense. The increase in general and administrative expense reflects higher spending on information technology and other corporate functions, partly due to expenses associated with Sarbanes-Oxley Act compliance efforts; the unfavorable impact of foreign currency denominated expenses; and the impact of a gain from a legal settlement in 2003 that was recorded as a reduction to general and administrative expense. There were no significant fluctuations in the nature and amounts of research and development expense or of sales and marketing expense. Food Diagnostics Group. Operating expenses for FDG increased $2.8 million, or 18%, to $18.4 million from $15.6 million in the same period of the prior year and, as a percent of sales, increased to 39% from 35% in the same period of the prior year. The increase was attributable to a 25% ($1.1 million) increase in general and administrative expense, a 14% ($0.6 million) increase in research and development expense, a 5% ($0.3 million) increase in sales and marketing expense, and a $0.7 million decrease in other income. The increase in general and administrative expense resulted primarily from ongoing expenses associated with the China joint venture formed in 2003; higher spending on information technology and other corporate functions, partly due to expenses associated with Sarbanes-Oxley Act compliance efforts; the unfavorable impact of foreign currency denominated expenses; and expenses associated with the Bommeli acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2004. The increase in research and development expense was due primarily to higher compensation costs for additional personnel; increased spending in support of our HerdChek BSE Antigen Test Kit; and expenses associated with the Bommeli acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2004. The increase in sales and marketing expense resulted primarily from increased spending in support of our HerdChek BSE Antigen Test Kit and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency-denominated expenses, partly offset by the nonrecurrence in 2004 of expenses incurred in 2003 in connection with the formation of the China joint venture. The decrease in other income results from the nonrecurrence in 2004 of the reduction in an accrual related to a third-party claim recorded as other income in 2003. For 2005, we expect FDG operating expenses to increase as a percent of sales due to integration costs and intangible amortization expense associated with the Bommeli acquisition. Other. Operating expenses for 2004, consisting primarily of corporate research and development, decreased $0.2 million, or 6%, to $3.2 million from $3.4 million for the same period of the prior year. 22 Interest Income Net interest income was $3.1 million for 2004 compared with $2.9 million during 2003. The increase in interest income was due to higher average invested cash balances partially offset by lower effective interest rates. Provision for Income Taxes Our effective income tax rate was 29.7% for 2004 compared with 31.5% for 2003. The majority of this rate reduction resulted from the resolution of an IRS income tax audit through the year 2001. As a result of completing this audit, the Company reduced previously accrued taxes. Other rate reductions resulted from the release in 2004 of a valuation allowance on international deferred tax assets as a result of a foreign subsidiary demonstrating consistent sustained profitability and changes in certain state and international tax estimates partially offset by revisions in 2003 to international tax estimates and a charge to write-down fixed assets occurring in a high-tax jurisdiction. The increase in our valuation allowances from 2002 to 2003 was primarily related to the generation of state net operating losses that we believe are not likely to be realized. The generation of state net operating losses increased our valuation allowance by $0.5 million. The reduction in valuation allowances from 2003 to 2004 was primarily related to releasing a valuation allowance that previously offset the international deferred tax assets of an international subsidiary. This valuation allowance of $0.7 million was released as a result of our determination that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized. The recently enacted American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 allows for a reduced rate of United States tax on qualifying repatriations of earnings held outside the United States. We are currently studying the impact of this provision and we have not made a final determination as to the amounts, if any, that will be repatriated. As such, the income tax effect of any repatriation cannot be estimated. Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2003 Compared to Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2002 Revenue Total Company. Revenue for the total company increased $63.3 million, or 15%, to $476.0 million from $412.7 million in the same period of the prior year. The following table presents revenue for the Company and its operating segments: For the Twelve Months Ended December 31, Net Revenue (in thousands) 2003 2002 Dollar Change Percentage Change Percentage Change from Currency (1) Percentage Change Net of Currency Effect CAG $ 384,419 $ 326,897 $ 57,522 17 .6% 3 .6% 14 .0% Water 46,936 41,969 4,967 11 .8% 4 .2% 7 .6% FDG 44,637 43,804 833 1 .9% 8 .0% (6 .1%) Total Company $ 475,992 $ 412,670 $ 63,322 15 .3% 4 .1% 11 .2% (1) Represents the percentage change in revenue attributed to the effect of changes in currency rates from 2002 to 2003. Companion Animal Group. Revenue for CAG increased $57.5 million, or 18%, to $384.4 million from $326.9 million in the same period of the prior year. This increase resulted primarily from sales of instruments and consumables and, to a lesser degree, rapid assay products, laboratory and consulting services, and pharmaceutical products. The favorable impact of currency exchange rates on sales outside the U.S. contributed an aggregate of $11.8 million, or 4%, to the increase in CAG revenue. The increase in sales of our instruments and consumables (an increase of $33.8 million, or 24%) was due to increased sales of the LaserCyte hematology system, which was launched in the fourth quarter of 2002, partially offset by lower sales of QBC VetAutoread systems, and increased sales of VetTest slides and, to a lesser extent, LaserCyte tubes, partially offset by reduced sales of QBC VetAutoread tubes resulting from the replacement of QBC VetAutoread systems by LaserCyte systems. The overall increase in sales of instrument consumables was due to the favorable impact of currency exchange rates on sales outside the U.S., the impact of reductions in distributors inventory levels in 2002, higher volume outside the U.S. and increased domestic clinic-level sales. 23 The increase in sales of rapid assay products (an increase of $12.5 million, or 18%) was due to increased domestic clinic-level sales of canine products and to a lesser degree, feline products, higher average unit prices, the impact of reductions in distributors inventory levels in 2002 and the favorable impact of currency exchange rates on sales outside the U.S. The increased sales volume was due in part to the apparent temporary difficulty of one of our competitors in supplying certain competitive products to the market. In January 2004, this competitor announced that it had reentered the heartworm market. In addition, another competitor announced that it had entered the heartworm market. Shipments to distributors of our instrument consumables and rapid assay products during 2002 were significantly reduced by the Company as part of a plan to reduce product inventories held by distributors. The reduced shipments during 2002 create a favorable year-to-year comparison for revenue growth rates for 2003. The increase in sales of laboratory and consulting services (an increase of $8.2 million, or 9%) resulted primarily from higher volume primarily in the U.S. and to a lesser extent in the U.K. and Australia, the favorable impact of currency exchange rates on sales at our laboratories outside the U.S. and favorable pricing partially offset by the termination of the veterinary referral business. The increase in sales of pharmaceutical products (an increase of $1.8 million, or 35%), resulted from the commencement of sales of a product licensed to a third party and, to a lesser extent, growth of existing products. Water. Revenue for Water increased $5.0 million, or 12%, to $46.9 million from $42.0 million for the same period of the prior year. The increase resulted primarily from higher sales volume of water-testing products and the favorable impact of currency exchange rates on sales outside the U.S. The favorable impact of currency exchange rates on sales outside the U.S. contributed an aggregate of $1.8 million, or 4%, to the increase in Water revenue. Food Diagnostics Group. Revenue for FDG increased $0.8 million, or 2%, to $44.6 million from $43.8 million for the same period of the prior year. The increase was due to the favorable impact of currency exchange rates on sales outside the U.S. The favorable impact of currency exchange rates on sales outside the U.S. contributed an aggregate of $3.5 million, or 8%, to the increase in FDG revenue. An increase in sales of production animal diagnostics (an increase of $1.1 million, or 4%) resulted from the favorable impact of currency exchange rates on sales outside the U.S. These increases were partially offset by lower average unit prices and sales volume. A decrease in sales of dairy-testing products (a decrease of $0.3 million, or 2%) was attributable to lower unit sales volume, offset partially by the favorable impact of currency exchange rates on sales outside the U.S. Gross Profit Total Company. Gross profit for the total company increased $37.6 million, or 20%, to $230.3 million from $192.7 million for the same period in the prior year. As a percentage of total company revenue, gross profit increased to 48% in 2003 from 47% in 2002. The following table presents gross profit and gross profit percentage for the Company and its operating segments: For the Twelve Months Ended December 31, Gross Profit (in thousands) 2003 Percent of Sales 2002 Percent of Sales Dollar Change Percentage Change CAG $ 175,612 45.7% $ 142,726 43.7% $ 32,886 23.0% Water 31,483 67.1% 28,612 68.2% 2,871 10.0% FDG 23,209 52.0% 21,387 48.8% 1,822 8.5% Total Company $ 230,304 48.4% $ 192,725 46.7% $ 37,579 19.5% 24 Companion Animal Group. Gross profit for CAG increased $32.9 million, or 23%, to $175.6 million from $142.7 million in the same period of the prior year due to increased sales volume across the CAG product lines and, to a lesser extent, to an increase in the gross profit percentage. As a percentage of CAG revenue, gross profit increased to 46% from 44% for the same period in the prior year. The increase in gross profit percentage was attributable primarily to greater relative sales of rapid assay products and the 2003 termination of a low-margin veterinary referral business; productivity improvements across CAG product lines in service and distribution operations; the favorable impact of foreign currency rates on sales denominated in those currencies, net of foreign exchange hedge contract losses; reduced amortization of VetTest instruments in our rental and trade-up programs as units became fully amortized; and increased average unit prices of rapid assay products and laboratory services. These increases were partially offset by higher sales of our lower gross margin LaserCyte hematology instrument and by the temporarily higher cost of VetTest slides purchased in 2002 and sold in 2003 as a result of the 2002 renegotiation of our VetTest slide supply agreement with Ortho. Water. Gross profit for Water increased $2.9 million, or 10%, to $31.5 million from $28.6 million for the same period in the prior year, primarily due to increased revenue partially offset by a decrease in the gross profit percentage. As a percentage of Water revenue, gross profit decreased to 67% from 68% for the same period in the prior year. The decrease in gross profit percentage was attributable primarily to higher royalty expenses, the net impact of currency exchange and exchange contract losses, unfavorable manufacturing variances, and an unfavorable product mix of higher sales of lower margin accessories. Food Diagnostics Group. Gross profit for FDG increased $1.8 million, or 9%, to $23.2 million from $21.4 million for the same period in the prior year, primarily due to an increase in the gross profit percentage. As a percentage of FDG revenue, gross profit increased to 52% from 49% for the same period in the prior year. The increase in gross profit percentage was attributable primarily to reduced inventory writedowns in 2003 compared to those recognized in the same period in 2002, primarily on an instrument and related components sold by the dairy business. Operating Expenses Total Company. Total company operating expenses increased $23.0 million to $149.9 million from $126.9 million for the same period of the prior year. As a percentage of revenues, operating expenses remained flat at 31%. The following tables present operating expenses and operating income for the Company and its operating segments: For the Twelve Months Ended December 31, Operating Expenses (in thousands) 2003 Percent of Sales 2002 Percent of Sales Dollar Change Percentage Change CAG $ 120,396 31.3% $ 96,674 29.6% $ 23,722 24.5% Water 10,549 22.5% 10,235 24.4% 314 3.1% FDG 15,603 35.0% 13,724 31.3% 1,879 13.7% Other 3,369 N/A 6,277 N/A (2,908 ) (46.3% ) Total Company $ 149,917 31.5% $ 126,910 30.8% $ 23,007 18.1% Operating Income (in thousands) 2003 Percent of Sales 2002 Percent of Sales Dollar Change Percentage Change CAG $ 55,216 14.4% $ 46,052 14.1% $ 9,164 19.9% Water 20,934 44.6% 18,377 43.8% 2,557 13.9% FDG 7,606 17.0% 7,663 17.5% (57 ) (0.7% ) Other (3,369 ) N/A (6,277 ) N/A 2,908 (46.3% ) Total Company $ 80,387 16.9% $ 65,815 15.9% $ 14,572 22.1% Companion Animal Group. Operating expenses for CAG increased $23.7 million, or 25%, to $120.4 million from $96.7 million in the same period of the prior year. The increase was attributable to a 28% ($12.7 million) increase in sales and marketing expense, a $7.5 million increase in other expense, a 9% ($1.9 million) increase in research and development expense, and a 6% ($1.7 million) increase in general and administrative expense. The increase in sales and marketing expense resulted primarily from increased personnel and marketing program costs, increased costs to support the ramp-up in LaserCyte sales and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency-denominated expenses. 25 The increase in other expense is primarily due to a $7.4 million charge for the write-down of production equipment purchased for the manufacture of consumables for use in an alternative clinical chemistry system as described above. The increase in research and development expense resulted from increased staffing. The increase in administrative expenses reflects higher spending on information technology and other corporate functions and an increase in bad debt provisions, offset partially by the elimination of certain expenses related to legal matters that concluded in 2002. Water. Operating expenses for Water increased $0.3 million, or 3%, to $10.5 million from $10.2 million in the same period of the prior year. The increase was attributable to a 21% ($0.9 million) increase in sales and marketing expense and an 11% ($0.2 million) increase in research and development expense, partly offset by a $0.8 million reduction in other expense. The increase in sales and marketing expense resulted primarily from increased marketing activities and headcount. The increase in research and development expense was due primarily to compensation and benefits associated with additional personnel. The decrease in other expense reflects the absence of certain nonrecurring expenses that were recognized in 2002 associated with a write-off of intangible assets and litigation that concluded in 2002. Food Diagnostics Group. Operating expenses for FDG increased $1.9 million, or 14%, to $15.6 million from $13.7 million in the same period of the prior year. The increase was attributable to a 23% ($1.4 million) increase in sales and marketing expense, a 17% ($0.7 million) increase in general and administrative expense, and a 16% ($0.6 million) increase in research and development expense, partly offset by a $0.8 million increase in other income. The increase in sales and marketing expense resulted primarily from increased marketing activities and headcount, and from expenses incurred in connection with the formation of the China joint venture (see Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements). The increase in general and administrative expense reflects an increase in administrative support expenses outside of the U.S., including support of the China joint venture and higher spending on information technology and other corporate functions. The increase in research and development expense was due to new product development efforts, primarily related to products for diagnosis of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. The increase in other income was primarily due to a reduction in an accrual related to a third-party claim. Other. Operating expenses for 2003 decreased $2.9 million, or 46%, to $3.4 million from $6.3 million for the same period of the prior year. The decrease resulted primarily from $3.4 million in nonrecurring benefits provided in 2002 in connection with the retirement of our former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer in January 2002, partly offset by corporate research and development hiring costs incurred in 2003. Interest Income Net interest income was $2.9 million for 2003 compared with $3.0 million during 2002. The decrease was due to lower effective interest rates and the receipt in 2002 of $0.3 million in interest on a domestic tax refund. The decrease was partially offset by interest earned on higher invested cash balances. Provision for Income Taxes Our effective tax rate was 31.5% for 2003 compared with 34.0% for 2002. The decrease in the effective rate is due to ongoing domestic and international tax planning initiatives, revisions to prior year international tax estimates and the charge to write-down fixed assets discussed above occurring in a high-tax jurisdiction. The write-down reduced the effective tax rate by 0.5%. 26 RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In December 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued FASB Interpretation No. 46R, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an interpretation of ARB 51 ( FIN 46R ). FIN 46R provides guidance on the identification of entities for which control is achieved through means other than through voting rights ( variable interest entities ) and on the determination of when such entities are required to be included in the consolidated financial statements of the business enterprise that holds an interest in the variable interest entity. This new model for consolidation applies to an entity in which either (1) the equity investors do not have a controlling financial interest or (2) the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity activities without receiving additional subordinated financial support from other parties. In addition, FIN 46R requires additional related disclosures. Certain disclosure provisions of FIN 46R apply to all financial statements issued after January 31, 2003, the consolidation provisions apply to variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003, and to variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date, and the remaining provisions, with the exception of interest in special purpose entities, apply at the end of the first fiscal year or interim period ending after March 15, 2004 to variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired before February 1, 2003. Application for interest in special purpose entities is required for periods after December 15, 2003. The adoption of FIN 46R had no material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In December 2003, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin ( SAB ) No. 104, Revenue Recognition, ( SAB No. 104 ) which replaces SAB No. 101. This staff accounting bulletin revises or rescinds portions of the interpretative guidance included in Topic 13 of the codification of staff accounting bulletins in order to make this interpretive guidance consistent with current authoritative accounting and auditing guidance and SEC rules and regulations. The principal revisions relate to the rescission of material no longer necessary because of private sector developments in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. This staff accounting bulletin also rescinds the Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements Frequently Asked Questions and Answers document issued in conjunction with Topic 13. Selected portions of that document have been incorporated into Topic 13. SAB No. 104 also rescinds the accounting guidance in SAB No. 101 related to multiple-element arrangements as this guidance has been superseded as a result of the issuance of EITF 00-21. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123(R), Share-Based Payment , which is a revision of SFAS No. 123 and supersedes Accounting Principles Board ( APB ) Opinion No. 25. SFAS No. 123(R) requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be valued at fair value on the date of grant, and to be expensed over the applicable vesting period. Pro forma disclosure of the income statement effects of share-based payments is no longer an alternative. SFAS No. 123(R) is effective for all stock-based awards granted on or after July 1, 2005. In addition, companies must also recognize compensation expense related to any awards that are not fully vested as of the effective date. Compensation expense for the unvested awards will be measured based on the fair value of the awards previously calculated in developing the pro forma disclosures in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123. We plan to use the modified prospective application method and to adopt the standard on July 1, 2005. We are currently studying SFAS No. 123R and believe we will recognize approximately $8.0 million in pre-tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2005 related to this standard. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES We fund the capital needs of our business through cash generated from operations. As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, we had $137.3 million and $220.7 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, respectively, and working capital of $201.6 million and $270.2 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, we also had long-term investments primarily in municipal bonds of $19.7 million and $35.1 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, we had total cash, short-term investments and long-term investments of $157.0 million and $255.8 million, respectively. Effective January 1, 2003, we entered into a workers compensation insurance policy for U.S. employees under which we retain the first $0.25 million in claim liability per incident and up to specific limits, based on payroll, in claim liability in the aggregate. We renewed this workers compensation policy effective January 1, 2004, and entered into a similar workers compensation policy effective January 1, 2005. We are liable for up to $3.0 million and $1.4 million in aggregate claim liability for 2004 and 2003, respectively, and estimate that we will be liable for up to $2.5 million for 2005. We have recorded our estimated claim liability as of December 31, 2004 and 2003 based on claims incurred and the estimated ultimate cost to settle the claims. The insurance company administers and pays these claims, and we reimburse the insurance company for our portion of these claims. The insurance company provides insurance for claims above the individual occurrence and aggregate limits. We issued a $1.1 million letter of credit to the insurance company as security for these claims as of December 31, 2004, and agreed to issue a $0.5 million letter of credit for 2004 for our 2005 policy. 27 We purchased approximately $29.1 million in fixed assets and $2.6 million in rental instruments sold under recourse during the year ended December 31, 2004, principally related to the CAG segment. Our total capital budget for 2005 is approximately $28.0 million. Research and development expense as a percentage of revenue for 2005 is expected to be slightly lower than 2004 levels as we will record relatively higher proportion of our revenues from our laboratory services business, which does not incur significant research and development expenses. Under certain supply agreements with suppliers of veterinary instruments, slides for our VetTest instruments and certain raw materials, at December 31, 2004, we had aggregate commitments to purchase approximately $64.7 million of products in 2005. In 2004, we utilized cash of $53.9 million to acquire Vet Med Lab, Bommeli, a laboratory in Columbus, Ohio, and a production animal diagnostics company in New York. Cash provided by operating activities was $95.4 million during 2004. Cash of $8.2 million was generated from the income tax benefit obtained due to the exercise of nonqualified stock options and disqualifying dispositions of incentive stock options. Non-cash expense of $4.6 million was recorded from the provision for deferred income taxes primarily due to accelerated depreciation. Cash of $5.8 million was used to pay vendor payables primarily due to Ortho for VetTest slides that were received in 2003. Cash of $5.2 million was used to increase accounts receivable due to higher sales. Cash of $5.4 million was used by a decrease in accruals due primarily to the settlement of a third-party claim. During 1999 and 2000, the Board of Directors authorized the purchase of up to 10,000,000 shares of our common stock in the open market or in negotiated transactions. In October 2003, the Board authorized the purchase of an additional 2,000,000 shares of common stock, and in October 2004, the Board of Directors increased the authorization by an additional 2,000,000 shares of common stock. During 2004, we repurchased approximately 2,413,000 shares of our common stock for $128.8 million at an average price of $53.37 per share. As of December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, approximately 11,955,000, 9,541,000, and 8,614,000 cumulative shares, respectively, had been repurchased under these programs. During 2004 and 2003, the Company received approximately 1,000 and 133,000 shares of stock, respectively, which were owned by the holder for greater than six months, in payment for the exercise price of stock options. The shares of stock had a fair market value of $0.1 million and $4.9 million, respectively. See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements. We are required to make the following payments in the years below: (in thousands) Total 2005 2006-2007 2008-2009 After 2009 Minimum royalty payments $ 8,526 $ 643 $ 2,164 $ 2,289 $ 3,430 Operating leases 41,218 7,112 10,280 7,144 16,682 Unconditional purchase obligations (1) 152,854 64,704 52,750 29,500 5,900 Total contractual cash obligations $ 202,598 $ 72,459 $ 65,194 $ 38,933 $ 26,012 (1) Of this amount, $131.8 million represents our minimum purchase obligation under our VetTest slide supply agreement with Ortho. We believe that current cash, short-term investments, long-term investments and funds generated from operations will be sufficient to fund our operations and capital purchase requirements. FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS The future operating results of IDEXX involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual events or results may differ materially from those discussed in this report. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, the factors discussed below, as well as those discussed elsewhere in this report. 28 IDEXX Future Growth and Profitability Depends on Several Factors The future success of our business depends upon our ability to successfully implement various strategies, including: Developing, manufacturing and marketing new products with new features and capabilities, including pharmaceutical products and a new clinical chemistry instrument, and improving and enhancing existing products, including the LaserCyte system; Expanding our market by increasing use of our products by our customers; Strengthening our sales and marketing activities both within the U.S. and in geographies outside of the U.S.; Developing and implementing new technology development and licensing strategies; and identifying, completing and integrating acquisitions that enhance our existing businesses or create new business areas for us; and Reducing the costs of manufacturing our products and providing services through operating efficiencies. However, we may not be able to successfully implement some or all of these strategies and increase or sustain our rate of growth or profitability. IDEXX Markets Are Competitive and Subject to Rapid and Substantial Technological Change We face intense competition within the markets in which we sell our products and services. We expect that future competition will become even more intense, and that we will have to compete with changing and improving technologies. Some of our competitors and potential competitors, including large pharmaceutical companies, have substantially greater capital, manufacturing, marketing, and research and development resources than we do. IDEXX Products and Services Are Subject to Various Government Regulations In the U.S., the manufacture and sale of our products are regulated by agencies such as the U.S. Department of Agriculture ( USDA ), U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ). Most diagnostic tests for animal health applications, including our canine, feline, poultry and livestock tests, must be approved by the USDA prior to sale. Our water-testing products must be approved by the EPA before they can be used by customers in the U.S. as a part of a water-quality monitoring program required by the EPA. Our pharmaceutical and dairy-testing products require approval by the FDA. The manufacture and sale of our products are subject to similar laws in many foreign countries. Any failure to comply with legal and regulatory requirements relating to the manufacture and sale of our products in the U.S. or in other countries could result in fines and sanctions against us or removals of our products from the market, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We have entered into an agreement with the FDA under which we have agreed, among other things, to perform specified lot release and stability testing of our SNAP beta-lactam dairy-testing products and to provide related data to the FDA. If the FDA were to determine that one or more lots of product failed to meet applicable criteria for product performance or stability, the FDA could take various actions, including requiring us to recall products or restricting our ability to sell these products. Sales of dairy antibiotic residue-testing products were $15.7 million for the 12 months ended December 31, 2004. Commercialization of animal health pharmaceuticals in the U.S. requires prior approval by the FDA. To obtain such approvals, we are required to submit substantial clinical, manufacturing and other data to the FDA. Regulatory approval for products submitted to the FDA may take several years and following approval, the FDA continues to regulate all aspects of the manufacture, labeling, storage, record keeping and promotion of pharmaceutical products. Failure to obtain, or delays in obtaining, FDA approval for new pharmaceutical products would have a negative impact on our future growth. 29 Changes in Veterinary Medical Practices Could Negatively Affect Operating Results The market for diagnostic tests could be negatively impacted by the introduction or broad market acceptance of vaccines or preventatives for the diseases and conditions for which we sell diagnostic tests and services. Eradication or substantial declines in the prevalence of certain diseases also could lead to a decline in diagnostic testing for such diseases. Such a decline could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. IDEXX Success Is Heavily Dependent Upon Its Proprietary Technologies We rely on a combination of patent, trade secret, trademark and copyright laws to protect our proprietary rights. If we do not have adequate protection of our proprietary rights, our business may be affected by competitors who develop substantially equivalent technologies that compete with us. We cannot ensure that we will obtain issued patents, that any patents issued or licensed to us will remain valid, or that any patents owned or licensed by us will provide protection against competitors with similar technologies. Even if our patents cover products sold by our competitors, the time and expense of litigating to enforce our patent rights could be substantial, and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, expiration of patent rights could result in substantial new competition in the markets for products previously covered by those patent rights. In the past, we have received notices claiming that our products infringe third-party patents and we may receive such notices in the future. Patent litigation is complex and expensive and the outcome of patent litigation can be difficult to predict. We cannot ensure that we will win a patent litigation case or negotiate an acceptable resolution of such a case. If we lose, we may be stopped from selling certain products and/or we may be required to pay damages and/or ongoing royalties as a result of the lawsuit. Any such adverse result could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. IDEXX Purchases Materials for Its Products from a Limited Number of Sources We currently purchase certain products and materials from single sources or a limited number of sources. Some of the products that we purchase from these sources are proprietary, and, therefore, may not be available from other sources. These products include our VetTest chemistry, QBC VetAutoread hematology, VetLyte electrolyte, and VetStat blood gas analyzers and related consumables, digital radiography systems, active ingredients for pharmaceutical products, including Navigator paste, and certain components of our SNAP rapid assay devices, water-testing products and LaserCyte systems. If we are unable to obtain adequate quantities of these products in the future, we could face cost increases or reductions or delays in product shipments, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. The slides sold for use in our VetTest instruments are purchased under an agreement with Ortho at fixed prices. Under this agreement we are required to purchase a minimum of $131.8 million of slides through 2010. To the extent that slides purchased under the contract exceed demand for the slides, we may incur losses in the future under this agreement. To the extent that we are unable to maintain current pricing levels on sales of slides to our customers, our profits on slide sales could decline because we purchase slides at fixed prices. IDEXX Biologic Products Are Complex and Difficult to Manufacture Many of our products are biologics, which are products that are comprised of materials from living organisms, such as antibodies, cells and sera. Manufacturing biologic products is highly complex. Unlike products that rely on chemicals for efficacy (such as most pharmaceuticals), biologics are difficult to characterize due to the inherent variability of biological materials. Difficulty in characterizing biological materials limits the precision of specifications for these materials, which creates greater risk in the manufacturing process. We attempt to mitigate risk associated with the manufacture of biologics by utilizing multiple vendors, manufacturing some of these materials ourselves and maintaining substantial inventories of materials that have demonstrated the appropriate characteristics. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain adequate sources of biological materials or that biological materials that we maintain in inventory will yield finished products that satisfy applicable product release criteria. Our inability to obtain necessary biological materials or to successfully manufacture biologic products that incorporate such materials could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. 30 IDEXX Sales Are Dependent on Distributor Purchasing Patterns We sell many of our products, including substantially all of the rapid assays and instrument consumables sold in the U.S., through distributors. Because significant product sales are made to a limited number of customers, unanticipated changes in the timing and size of distributor purchases can have a negative effect on quarterly results. Our financial performance, therefore, is subject to an unexpected downturn in product demand and may be unpredictable. International Revenue Accounts for a Significant Portion of IDEXX Total Revenue In 2004, 32% of our revenue was attributable to sales of products and services to customers outside the U.S. Various risks associated with foreign operations may impact our international sales. Possible risks include fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies, disruptions in transportation of our products, the differing product and service needs of foreign customers, difficulties in building and managing foreign operations, import/export duties and quotas, and unexpected regulatory, economic or political changes in foreign markets. Prices that we charge to foreign customers may be different than the prices we charge for the same products in the U.S. due to competitive, market or other factors. As a result, the mix of domestic and international sales in a particular period could have a material impact on our results for that period. In addition, many of the products for which our selling price may be denominated in foreign currencies are manufactured, sourced, or both, in the U.S. and our costs are incurred in U.S. dollars. We utilize nonspeculative forward currency exchange contracts to mitigate foreign currency exposure, however, an appreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to the foreign currencies in which we sell these products would reduce our gross margins. The Loss of Our President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman Could Adversely Affect Our Business We rely on the management and leadership of Jonathan W. Ayers, our President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman. We do not maintain key man life insurance coverage for Mr. Ayers. The loss of Mr. Ayers could have a material impact on our business. We Could Be Subject to Class Action Litigation Due to Stock Price Volatility, which, if Occurs, Could Result in Substantial Costs or Large Judgments Against Us The market for our common stock may experience extreme price and volume fluctuations, which may be unrelated or disproportionate to our operating performance or prospects. In the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against companies following periods of volatility in the market prices of their securities. We may be the target of similar litigation in the future. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management attention and resources, which could have a negative effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. If Our Quarterly Results of Operations Fluctuate, This Fluctuation May Cause Our Stock Price to Decline, Resulting in Losses to You Our prior operating results have fluctuated due to a number of factors, including seasonality of certain product lines; changes in our accounting estimates; the impact of acquisitions; timing of distributor purchases, product launches, research and development expenditures, litigation and claim-related expenditures; changes in competitors product offerings; and other matters. Similarly, our future operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to these and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. If our operating results do not meet the expectations of market analysts or investors in future periods, our stock price may fall. 31 Future Operating Results Could Be Materially Affected By the Resolution of Various Uncertain TaxPositions, and Adversely Affected by Potential Changes to Tax Incentives In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and our income tax filings are regularly under audit by tax authorities. Management believes that it has adequately accrued for all potential tax liabilities and, although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits could be materially different than that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals. Additionally, we benefit from certain tax incentives offered by various jurisdictions, some of which are scheduled to expire at the end of 2005. If we are unable to renew such incentives, the expiration of these benefits could have a material negative effect on future earnings.
