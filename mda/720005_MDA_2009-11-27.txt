ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following Management Discussion and Analysis is intended to help the reader understand the results of our operations and financial condition. Management Discussion and Analysis is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements. Executive Overview Year ended September 30, 2009 Compared with the Year ended September 30, 2008 Total Company The economic recession in 2009 provided the backdrop for what was an extremely challenging environment in which to operate for the better part of this fiscal year. Our financial results continue to be positively correlated to the direction of the U.S. equity markets and are subject to volatility due to changes in interest rates, valuation of financial instruments, economic and political trends and industry competition. As a result of the challenging markets, our net revenues decreased by 9% to $2.5 billion, and we generated net income of $153 million, a 35% decline from the prior year. Our financial results were most dramatically impacted by a decrease in revenue from our Private Client Group and Asset Management segments, two of our operations that are highly dependent upon the health of the financial markets. The Fixed Income portion of our Capital Markets segment had a record year by far, while equity underwriting activity was moribund for much of the year. Our bank subsidiary, Raymond James Bank, was not able to achieve the operating results we had anticipated due to unprecedented problems in the commercial real estate sector which arose in 2009 and negatively impacted the year provision for loan losses. During the year we have opportunistically increased the number of financial advisors, a strategy that positions us well for future growth as the markets improve. In order to fuel additional growth opportunities, we accessed the capital markets for the first time in 23 years through a $300 million, ten year senior note offering. Finally, in 2009 we implemented a succession plan for our Chief Executive Officer that will take effect in May 2010, providing an orderly transition for our executive leadership. Year ended September 30, 2008 Compared with the Year ended September 30, 2007 - Total Company We had record annual gross and net revenues for the year, exceeding the prior year by 3% and 8%, respectively. Gross revenues were fueled by strong institutional sales commissions offset by trading losses, while net revenues also benefited from record net interest earnings. Non-interest expenses grew by 9%, thus net income declined 6% from the prior year. Three of our four major segments experienced increases in revenues, but only RJ Bank generated an increase in pre-tax income. 26 Results of Operations - Total Company We currently operate through the following eight business segments: Private Client Group; Capital Markets; Asset Management; RJ Bank; Emerging Markets; Stock Loan/Borrow; Proprietary Capital and certain corporate activities in the Other segment. The following table presents consolidated and segment financial information for the years indicated : Year Ended September 30, September 30, September 30, 2009 2008 2007 (in 000's) Total Company Revenues $ 2,602,519 $ 3,204,932 $ 3,109,579 Pre-tax Income 248,774 386,854 392,224 Private Client Group Revenues 1,557,462 1,999,775 1,987,482 Pre-tax Income 84,873 178,146 222,370 Capital Markets Revenues 533,254 506,158 506,062 Pre-tax Income 73,481 43,627 62,587 Asset Management Revenues 177,359 243,609 241,304 Pre-tax Income 30,411 61,501 62,898 RJ Bank Revenues 343,366 405,304 279,572 Pre-tax Income 80,011 112,282 27,005 Emerging Markets Revenues 14,891 41,607 59,204 Pre-tax (Loss) Income (4,886) (3,426) 3,619 Stock Loan/Borrow Revenues 10,269 36,843 68,685 Pre-tax Income 3,651 7,034 5,003 Proprietary Capital Revenues 12,742 22,869 8,328 Pre-tax Income 1,035 7,361 3,489 Other Revenues 7,153 21,302 37,174 Pre-tax (Loss) Income (19,802) (19,671) 5,253 Intersegment Eliminations Revenues (53,977) (72,535) (78,232) Pre-tax Income - - - 27 Net Interest Analysis The following table presents average balance data and interest income and expense data, as well as the related net interest income: Year Ended September 30, 2009 September 30, 2008 September 30, 2007 Operating Average Operating Average Operating Average Average Interest Yield/ Average Interest Yield/ Average Interest Yield/ Balance Inc./Exp.

Net interest income at RJ Bank increased $106.8 million, or 50%, representing more than all of the $55 million increase in our total net interest earnings. This increase in net interest income at RJ Bank resulted from the significant decline in market rates that occurred early in the fiscal year, leading to lower interest rates being paid on RJ Bank retail deposit accounts throughout the year. RJ Bank benefited as the rates on interest earning assets declined at a much slower pace than rates paid on deposits. The decline in interest rates had a dramatic impact on net interest in the Private Client Group ( PCG ) segment, which declined $42 million, or 45%. Interest earned on assets segregated declined $112 million, or 88%, as rates dropped as low as 0.20% for a portion of the year. Average customer margin balances declined $374 million, or 24%, during 2009, contributing to the decline in interest revenue in the PCG segment. Net interest earnings in the PCG segment will be negatively affected by our recently introduced multi-bank sweep program. Begun in mid-September 2009, this program spreads clients cash deposits incrementally across a network of unaffiliated banks in amounts less than the single-bank FDIC insurance limits, thereby extending full insurance coverage on client balances of up to $2.5 million, or $5 million if jointly held. While the program continues to generate competitive interest earnings for clients, it generates fee income for the PCG segment instead of interest earnings. 28 Net interest on the stock loan/borrow business decreased 38% due to decreased rates and balances despite a focus on hard-to-locate securities. Other interest revenue and expense include earnings on corporate cash and inventory balances, and interest expense on overnight borrowings, our senior notes issued in August, 2009 and the mortgage on our headquarters facility.

Commission revenue decreased $269 million, or 18%, from the prior year, with the majority of that decrease experienced by our domestic independent contractor operation. Commissions in RJ&A PCG declined only $45 million, or 9%, due to the recruitment of 219 employee financial advisors in fiscal 2009 (for a net increase of 94) and 184 in fiscal 2008 (for a net increase of 114). It generally takes newly recruited financial advisors up to two years to reach their previous production levels. Average production per employee financial advisor decreased to $417,000 in fiscal 2009, down 19% from the $515,000 attained in fiscal 2008. The recruitment of above-average producers did not overcome the negative impact that the steep market decline had on our private clients investing activities. RJFS and RJFSA recruited 559 independent contractor financial advisors in fiscal 2009 (for a net increase of 129). Independent contractor financial advisor average production decreased from $330,000 in fiscal 2008 to $273,000 in fiscal 2009, impacted, like RJ&A, by the challenging economic and market conditions. 29 Net interest declined $42 million, or 45%, from the prior year as interest rates declined and spreads narrowed. As rates reached historic lows, earning asset yields continued to fall while there was no room to further lower rates on client deposits, thus compressing the spread earned. Sales commission expense decreased 19%, comparable to the 18% decrease in commission revenue. Total non-interest expenses decreased 13% as a result of our focus on expense control. Administrative expense was tightly controlled despite compensation for additional support personnel, primarily in new branch offices. Business development expense decreased $10 million. These expenses include transition expense, account transfer fees, direct expenses associated with recruiting such as bringing financial advisors to the corporate headquarters, conference expenses and travel expenses, which we minimized as much as possible given the market environment. Occupancy expense includes the expenses associated with the opening of new branch offices and expansion of others. RJ&A added 16 new offices during fiscal 2009 and 19 during fiscal 2008 and as a result, occupancy expenses increased 8%. Given the 17% decline in net revenues and the 13% decrease in non-interest expense, there was a 52% decline in pre-tax earnings. Overall PCG margins decreased from 9.6% to 5.5%. As over half of the PCG revenues are recurring or asset based in nature, the decline in the equity markets (and therefore in the market values of client assets) had a significant impact on revenue. Financial service fees were also lower as these include transaction fees on certain fee-based accounts. Year ended September 30, 2008 Compared with the Year ended September 30, 2007 Private Client Group PCG revenues benefited from the successful recruiting of employee financial advisors, however, this was offset by the impact of uncertain market conditions on investor confidence. As a result, commission revenue increased $70 million, only 5% over the fiscal 2007 year, with $56 million of that increase in RJ&A due to the recruitment of 184 employee financial advisors in fiscal 2008 (for a net increase of 114) and 153 in fiscal 2007 (for a net increase of 59). It generally takes newly recruited financial advisors two years to reach their previous production levels. Average production per employee financial advisor increased to $515,000 in fiscal 2008 driven by the recruiting of above-average producers. RJFS recruited 398 independent contractor financial advisors in fiscal 2008 (for a net increase of 81). Independent contractor financial advisor average production increased from $316,000 in fiscal 2007 to $330,000 in fiscal 2008, again driven by recruiting above average producers. As a result of these two factors, RJFS securities commissions and fees increased $10 million in fiscal 2008 versus fiscal 2007 despite the difficult market environment. Offsetting this modest increase in securities commissions and fees was a 22% decrease in net interest from the 2007 year as interest rates declined and spreads narrowed. Sales commission expense increased 6% in comparison to the 5% increase in commission revenue as it includes the increased expenses associated with recruiting such as hiring bonuses and guaranteed payout amounts. Total non-interest expenses increased 8% as a result of company growth. Administrative expense includes the compensation for additional support personnel, primarily in branch offices. Business development expense includes transition expense, account transfer fees, and the direct expenses associated with recruiting such as bringing financial advisors to the corporate headquarters. Occupancy expense includes the expenses associated with the opening of new branch offices. RJ&A added 19 offices during fiscal 2008 and 14 during fiscal 2007. The 8% increase in non-interest expense exceeded the 4% increase in net revenues, resulting in a 20% decline in pre-tax earnings in fiscal 2008 versus fiscal 2007. Overall PCG margins decreased from 12.5% to 9.6%. While over half of the PCG revenues are recurring in nature, much of that is asset based. With the decline in the equity markets in fiscal 2008, client assets declined and revenues based on these balances will be lower until the market values recover. Historically, in uncertain markets individual investors within PCG execute fewer transactions as they often prefer to wait and see, hoping for positive market movement. 30 Results of Operations Capital Markets The following table presents consolidated financial information for our Capital Markets segment for the years indicated: Year Ended September 30, % Incr.

These profits were almost entirely generated on domestic fixed income products, 76% on municipal and 37% on taxable products. In addition, fixed income institutional sales commissions were 60% higher, as the volatile fixed income markets led many institutions to seek expertise on mortgage-backed products, and many increased their overall weighting in fixed income products. At the same time, institutions decreased their weighting in equities and equity institutional sales commissions declined 11%. This decline was magnified by a lack of new issue activity. The steep equity market decline early in the year led to lower investment banking fee revenue. Equity underwriting fees were $5.3 million and $10.4 million below the prior year in the U.S. and Canada, respectively. This was attributable to the lack of underwritings due to the declining equity markets during the first two quarters. Capital markets activity increased during the third quarter, with 82% of our deals occurring in the last two quarters of the fiscal year, actually generating nine more deals than in the prior year. However, the deals were smaller and we were generally allotted a smaller portion of the deals than in the prior year, resulting in lower revenues. Merger and acquisition fees, which are included in investment banking revenue, were $40.6 million, up 6% from the prior year. 31 Gross revenues were up 5% from the prior year and net revenues were up 10%. Coupled with a 5% increase in non-interest expense, pre-tax earnings were up 68% from the prior year as the impact of increased trading profits is significant to our pre-tax profits. Commission expense increased with a greater percentage (17%) than commission revenues (10%) due to the big increase in fixed income institutional sales commissions which have a higher payout than equity institutional sales commissions. The other compensation expenses, communications and information processing and business development expenses decreased slightly as a result of expense control. Occupancy expense increased 7% due to growth. We have taken advantage of the opportunities to add quality Capital Markets teams. Equity Capital Markets acquired the investment banking firm of Lane Berry International, Inc. The acquisition added 21 investment banking professionals and new offices in Boston and Denver. In total, Investment Banking added a net 26 professionals over the past year. Fixed Income has taken advantage of market conditions in the taxable fixed income institutional sales area to recruit 23 additional professionals, representing a 21% increase in its producing professionals. Year ended September 30, 2008 Compared with the Year ended September 30, 2007 Capital Markets Capital Markets net revenues increased 6% in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 due to record equity and fixed income institutional sales commissions, which increased 13% and 125%, respectively, compared to fiscal 2007. Equity institutional sales commissions were higher both domestically and in Canada as volatile market conditions generated increased activity. The equally volatile fixed income markets produced an even greater increase in commission revenue as institutions sought expertise on various securities, and many altered their weighting in fixed income securities. These increases were offset by reduced investment banking fee revenue compared to the prior year. Equity underwriting fees were $26 million and $3 million below the fiscal 2007 year in the U.S. and Canada, respectively. This was attributable to the lack of underwritings due to the uncertain market conditions. During fiscal 2008, Capital Markets managed or co-managed 82 transactions in the U.S. and Canada, compared to 108 transactions in fiscal 2007. In addition, fiscal 2007 was a record year for merger and acquisition fees. RJTCF saw a dramatic decrease of $15 million in deal related fee revenue (included in underwriting fees) in fiscal 2008 as several of its major clients were no longer in the market. Total Company trading profits declined $18 million (over 100%) with $12.8 million of that decline in the Capital Markets segment. While domestic equity facilitation losses remained consistent at $8 million, overall fixed income trading profits increased from $11 million in fiscal 2007 to $15 million in fiscal 2008. This included a particularly difficult fixed income trading environment due to a flight to quality, especially during the fourth quarter. RJ Ltd. trading profits reversed from a $2.8 million profit in fiscal 2007 to a $6 million loss in fiscal 2008. This was a combined result of an increase in facilitation losses of $6.6 million and a $2.6 million decline in proprietary trading gains. Gross revenues were flat in fiscal 2008 compared with the prior year and net revenues were up 6%. However, due to the $42 million increase in non-interest expense, pre-tax earnings were down 30% in fiscal 2008 from the prior year. Commission expense increased in line with commission revenues. The other compensation expenses, occupancy and communications and information processing expenses increased in fiscal 2008 due to growth as we took advantage of the opportunity to add quality Capital Markets teams. Equity Capital Markets added a net seven professionals in Investment Banking in fiscal 2008, as well as additional Sales and Research personnel. This segment moved or substantially renovated several of its larger offices during fiscal 2008, including offices in New York, Atlanta and Chicago, and opened one new office in San Francisco. Fixed Income took advantage of market conditions in the taxable fixed income institutional sales area and in Public Finance during fiscal 2008 to recruit a combined 49 additional professionals, representing a 20% increase in its producing professionals. These hires were accomplished at lower costs than possible in recent years. 32 Results of Operations - Asset Management The following table presents consolidated financial information for the Asset Management segment for the years indicated: Year Ended September 30, % Incr.

During the year, however, non-money market assets declined 20% and 11% in the December 2008 and March 2009 quarters, respectively. Since a large percentage of the fees are calculated at the beginning of each quarter, this caused significant revenue declines in the March 2009 and June 2009 quarters. The money market funds were significantly impacted by the low interest rates and resulting spread compression. As a result, $27.9 million in fees were waived; $16.9 million that would have been recorded as investment advisory fees in our Asset Management segment and $11 million that would have been recorded as financial service fees in PCG. During September we implemented a multi-bank sweep program to provide FDIC insurance and to improve interest rates for our clients cash deposits. As a result, $2.6 billion was moved from money market funds into other sweep alternatives. This will result in increased fee revenue in PCG but reduced revenue in our Asset Management segment. Expenses were well controlled, down 19% from the prior year. This did not fully mitigate the decline in revenues and pre-tax income declined 51%. Assets under management however, declined by 12%, or $4.2 billion, during fiscal 2009. Positive net inflows for the year were offset by market depreciation. Despite adverse market conditions, net inflows for the managed programs amounted to approximately $730 million in 2009. Portfolios managed by Eagle experienced approximately $535 million in market depreciation in 2009. Market depreciation within RJCS/Freedom portfolios was approximately $1.2 billion. Money market fund assets decreased as a result of the transfer of approximately $2.6 billion, primarily to the new bank sweep program, in September 2009, contributing to the money market net outflow of $3.1 billion for the year. Performance results were very good, as 91% of the investment managers participating in the RJCS program outperformed their indices for the five year period ended September 30, 2009. Of Eagle eight principal investment programs, all outperformed their indices during the same period. At September 30, 2009, four of the eight funds managed by Eagle had earned a four-star or better overall rating from Morningstar. Non-managed fee-based assets increased 24%, or $5.6 billion, from 2008 due to positive net inflows of approximately $6.5 billion. Non-managed programs witnessed a decline in market values in the amount of $900 million in fiscal 2009 as compared to a market decline of $5.9 billion in the prior year. Year ended September 30, 2008 Compared with the Year ended September 30, 2007 - Asset Management Asset Management revenues increased modestly in fiscal 2008 as compared to the prior year despite a slight decline in assets under management as most of the decline occurred in the last few weeks of the 2008 fiscal year. Expenses were well controlled, thus pre-tax income declined only 2%. Assets under management declined by 6% or $2.4 billion during the 2008 fiscal year as positive net sales did not offset a significant decline in the market value of portfolios. Portfolios managed by Eagle experienced approximately $1.9 billion in market depreciation in fiscal 2008 compared to $2.1 billion in appreciation during the prior year. Market depreciation within RJCS/Freedom portfolios was approximately $4 billion compared to appreciation of $1.3 billion in fiscal 2007. Other fee-based programs (non-managed) witnessed a decline in market values in the amount of $5.9 billion in fiscal 2008 as compared to a gain of $1.4 billion in the prior year. Despite adverse market conditions, net inflows for the segment amounted to approximately $7 billion in fiscal 2008. This included approximately $2.3 billion in managed accounts (including Eagle) and $4.7 billion in non-managed fee-based accounts. Money market fund assets increased despite the transfer of $550 million to RJ Bank in March 2008. Performance results were very good, as 87% of the investment managers participating in the RJCS program outperformed their indices for the five year period ended September 30, 2008. Of Eagle 11 principal investment programs, 10 outperformed their indices during the same period. At September 30, 2008, five of the eight funds managed by Eagle had earned a four-star overall rating from Morningstar. 34 Results of Operations - RJ Bank The following table presents consolidated financial information for RJ Bank for the years indicated: Year Ended September 30, % Incr.

The increase in net interest income resulted from the significant decline in market interest rates that occurred early in the fiscal year, leading to low interest rates being paid on the bank retail deposit accounts throughout the year. RJ Bank benefited as the rates on interest earning assets declined at a much slower pace than rates paid on deposits. The provision for loan losses increased $114.6 million, or 209%, resulting from increased nonperforming loans and net loan charge-offs. The increased provisions offset the positive impact of the improvement in net interest income on pre-tax income. Net interest income improved due to an 86% decline in interest expense resulting from lower interest rates paid on deposits. Interest income declined as well, but by a much smaller percentage (14%), as a result of lower interest rates on loans and investments as compared to the prior year. RJ Bank corporate loan portfolio is predominantly LIBOR based and LIBOR was unusually high in comparison to other rates for a period of time early in the year, generating particularly good spreads. Average total banking assets increased from $7.8 billion to $9.1 billion during the current fiscal year. However, due to reduced new loan production and paydowns on existing loans, total banking assets at September 30, 2009 decreased to $7.9 billion from $9.4 billion at September 30, 2008. Total banking assets are adjusted to exclude $3.2 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively, resulting from the year-end gross-up to meet a point in time regulatory asset composition requirement. Corporate loans as of year-end decreased from $4.6 billion to $4.3 billion, while retail and residential loans decreased from $2.6 billion to $2.4 billion. Correspondingly, deposit balances also declined, from $8.8 billion to $7.1 billion, excluding $2.3 billion of deposits at fiscal 2009 year-end retained to meet the point in time regulatory requirement. The loan balances at RJ Bank have nearly tripled over the three-year period since September 30, 2006. This rapid growth, in combination with the impact of the significant national economic downturn on the loan portfolio, gave rise to an attendant increase in the allowance for loan losses. In addition, a significant decline in commercial real estate values and an increase in the actual and projected loss experience on residential loans led to an increase in the provision for loan losses to $169.3 million compared to $54.7 million in the prior year. Net loan charge-offs for the year were $107.2 million compared to $13.6 million in the prior year. Corporate loan charge-offs increased $70.3 million due to losses of $30 million in the residential acquisition and development sector and the charge-off of two commercial real estate related credits totaling $40.1 million. RJ Bank remaining exposure to residential acquisition and development loans is very limited, representing $37 million of the loans outstanding at year-end. The Allowance for Loan Losses ( ALL ) increased as a percentage of total loans from 1.23% to 2.23%. The ALL and nonperforming assets at September 30, 2009 reflect the results of the annual SNC review. RJ Bank loan portfolio does not include any subprime loans. The increase in the ALL was driven by increased nonperforming assets as the loan portfolio has been adversely impacted by the current economic downturn and the decline in real estate values. Nonperforming assets increased during the year to $167.1 million from $62.3 million at the previous year-end. Credits in the commercial real estate sector, residential acquisition and development sector and loans tied to consumer spending have been particularly impacted. Additionally, increasing residential loan delinquencies have impacted nonperforming loan balances. Corporate nonperforming assets increased $51.7 million and residential/consumer nonperforming assets increased $53.1 million. A further deterioration of conditions within any given sector in which RJ Bank has significant exposure, or within the overall economy generally, could lead to substantial credit problems and additional significant provisions for loan losses and/or charge-offs. As of September 30, 2009, the unrealized loss on our available for sale securities portfolio was $97.8 million, compared to $89 million as of September 30, 2008. The unrealized loss was due to continued wide interest rate spreads across market sectors related to the continued uncertainty in the residential non-agency CMO securities market. Certain securities were considered to be other-than- temporarily-impaired ( OTTI ) during the year because RJ Bank does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis, and therefore, an OTTI expense of $12.9 million was reflected in fiscal 2009 pre-tax income as compared to a $4.9 million OTTI charge in fiscal 2008. Other expenses increased to $54.4 million during the year from $34.8 million for the previous year. The 56% increase was primarily attributable to an $11.3 million increase in FDIC insurance premiums as compared to the prior year, which was comprised of a special industry-wide assessment ($4 million) and increased FDIC premiums resulting from higher assessment rates issued during the year. In addition, there were $5.1 million more write-downs on other real estate owned as compared to the prior year. 36 Year ended September 30, 2008 Compared with the Year ended September 30, 2007 RJ Bank Net interest income increased 155% and pre-tax profits at RJ Bank more than quadrupled during the fiscal year compared to the prior year. Interest revenue at RJ Bank increased 46% despite falling rates, with the loan balances increasing from $4.7 billion to $7.1 billion. The loan increase consisted primarily of 24% purchased residential mortgage pools and 73% corporate loans, with 97% of the latter purchased or originated participations in syndicated loans. As a result, total assets increased from $6.3 billion to $9.4 billion, adjusted to exclude the investment of the $1.9 billion FHLB advance repaid on October 1, 2008. Corporate loans increased from $2.8 billion to $4.6 billion, while retail and residential loans increased from $1.9 billion to $2.6 billion. The growth in loans was funded by the growth in customer deposits. The influx of client cash balances into the RJ Bank Deposit Program (reaching historically high levels), generated by a combination of new clients bringing cash to the firm, clients raising cash, and clients electing to hold their cash in FDIC insured accounts, plus the bulk transfer of $550 million in cash balances in March 2008, resulted in a $3.2 billion increase in deposit balances from $5.6 billion to $8.8 billion. As a result of the falling interest rate environment, interest expense fell 1% despite the higher balances. RJ Bank has benefited from the declining interest rate environment as the rates on the interest earning assets have declined at a slower pace than the rates paid on deposits. In addition, RJ Bank corporate loan portfolio is predominantly LIBOR based and LIBOR was unusually high in comparison to other rates for a period of time during the year, generating particularly good spreads. The growth in loan balances at RJ Bank gave rise to an attendant increase in the provisions for loan loss to $54.7 million compared to $29.4 million in the prior year. Net loan charge-offs for the year were $13.6 million compared to $1.1 million in the prior year. RJ Bank has no exposure to subprime loans. In addition to the increase in the allowance for loan loss, charge-offs and nonperforming assets have increased as the loan portfolio has grown and aged. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2008, RJ Bank experienced some credit quality deterioration in corporate credits in the Residential Acquisition and Development/Homebuilder Industry segment. Four credits in this segment account for approximately $35.7 million in nonaccrual loans (91% of the nonperforming corporate assets above) and three of those credits contributed $8.5 million in net charge-offs (83% of the corporate loan charge-offs above) for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2008. Total loans outstanding and commitments in this industry segment are $98 million and $116 million, respectively. Committed exposures to this industry segment have been reduced by more than 40% over the past year. Credit trends in other segments of our corporate loan portfolio remained relatively stable through September 30, 2008. RJ Bank does not own any payment option ARM loans or subprime mortgage loans. SNC, large syndicated corporate loans that are reviewed under a common program in which several bank regulatory agencies participate, comprise approximately 90% of RJ Bank corporate loan portfolio. RJ Bank residential loan portfolio consists of 76% in interest-only mortgages. About 7% of the residential loan portfolio was originated under a streamlined documentation feature for high net worth clients or with reduced documentation, which may be considered Alt A. However, for streamlined documentation, very strict standards must be met including a minimum $1 million account relationship, maximum loan-to-value ( LTV ) of 70%, and minimum credit score of 720. In addition, the streamlined documentation feature is only available for purchases and is not available for cash out refinance transactions. 37 The following table presents average balance data and operating interest income and expense data for our banking operations, as well as the related interest yields and rates and interest spread for the years indicated: Year Ended September 30, 2009 September 30, 2008 September 30, 2007 Operating Average Operating Average Operating Average Average Interest Yield/ Average Interest Yield/ Average Interest Yield/ Balance Inc./Exp.

(2) Negotiable Order of Withdrawal ( NOW ) account. (3) The increase in interest spreads is due to a rapid decline in short-term interest rates, which led to a decline in RJ Bank cost of funds. (4) In light of current economic conditions, RJ Bank experienced increased loan loss provisions. Increases and decreases in interest income and interest expense result from changes in average balances (volume) of interest-earning banking assets and liabilities, as well as changes in average interest rates. The following table shows the effect that these factors had on the interest earned on RJ Bank's interest-earning assets and the interest incurred on its interest-bearing liabilities. The effect of changes in volume is determined by multiplying the change in volume by the previous year's average yield/cost. Similarly, the effect of rate changes is calculated by multiplying the change in average yield/cost by the previous year's volume. Changes applicable to both volume and rate have been allocated proportionately. 39 2009 Compared to 2008 2008 Compared to 2007 Increase (Decrease) Due To Increase (Decrease) Due To Volume Rate Total Volume Rate Total (in 000 s) Interest Revenue Interest-Earning Banking Assets: Loans, Net of Unearned Income: Commercial Loans $ 8,437 $ (14,800) $ (6,363) $ 22,725 $ (9,017) $13,708 Real Estate Construction Loans 5,815 (8,972) (3,157) 13,999 (6,125) 7,874 Commercial Real Estate Loans 38,835 (70,020) (31,185) 134,924 (54,322) 80,602 Residential Mortgage Loans 22,758 (8,357) 14,401 36,812 2,406 39,218 Consumer Loans 409 (498) (89) 474 (275) 199 Reverse Repurchase Agreements (6,433) (15,085) (21,518) (4,873) (18,726) (23,599) Agency Mortgage Backed Securities 1,762 (6,186) (4,424) 1,468 (4,328) (2,860) Non-agency Collateralized Mortgage Obligations (8,485) 5,582 (2,903) 8,435 2,231 10,666 Money Market Funds, Cash and Cash Equivalents 5,070 (7,618) (2,548) 7,145 (4,262) 2,883 FHLB Stock and Other 1,675 (1,902) (227) 317 (133) 184 Total Interest-Earning Banking Assets $ 69,843 $ (127,856) $ (58,013) $ 221,426 $ (92,551) $ 128,875 Interest Expense Interest-Bearing Banking Liabilities: Retail Deposits: Certificates Of Deposit $ (1,323) $ (1,228) $ (2,551) $ 119 $ (360) $ (241) Money Market, Savings and NOW Accounts 30,912 (189,370) (158,458) 138,808 (144,297) (5,489) FHLB Advances and Other (3,830) 19 (3,811) 4,426 (906) 3,520 Total Interest-Bearing Banking Liabilities 25,759 (190,579) (164,820) 143,353 (145,563) (2,210) Change in Net Operating Interest Income $ 44,084 $ 62,723 $ 106,807 $ 78,073 $ 53,012 $ 131,085 40 Results of Operations Emerging Markets Year Ended September 30, % Incr.

The global economic slowdown and credit crisis continued to significantly impact emerging markets in all business lines. The results in the emerging market segment declined to a $4.9 million loss from a $3.4 million loss in the prior year. This decline was a result of a $24 million, or 80%, decline in commission revenues which was almost entirely offset by a $3.5 million increase in trading profits and a $22 million decline in non-interest expenses. Our minority interest partners shared in $2.3 million of the fiscal 2009 loss before taxes. In December, our joint venture in Turkey ceased operations and subsequently filed for protection under Turkish bankruptcy laws. We have fully reserved for our equity interest in this joint venture. Year ended September 30, 2008 Compared with the Year ended September 30, 2007 Emerging Markets Emerging markets consists of the results of our joint ventures in Argentina, Uruguay, Brazil and Turkey. The results in the emerging market segment declined from a $3.6 million profit in fiscal 2007 to a $3.4 million loss in fiscal 2008. This decline was a result of a greater decline in revenues than an increase in expenses. Expenses were impacted by our investment in Brazil. The global economic slowdown and credit crisis significantly impacted emerging markets in all business lines. Commission revenue declined 23% in fiscal 2008 as compared to the prior year as the economic slowdown and a series of political crises in Turkey and Argentina during 2008 severely undermined investors confidence in these countries. Trading profits declined due to losses taken in proprietary positions in Turkey. The commission expense portion of compensation expense declined in proportion to the decline in commission revenue. Other expenses in fiscal 2007 were unusually high due to the accrual of tax liabilities and the related legal expenses. As of September 30, 2008, we were still awaiting the final outcome of the litigation in Turkey, and in light of the suspension of the entity license, our ability to continue as a going concern in Turkey was uncertain. We had fully reserved for our investment in the Turkish joint venture as of September 30, 2008 and, accordingly, fiscal 2008 pre-tax earnings did not include any net impact of our Turkish joint venture. 41 Results of Operations Stock Loan/Borrow Year Ended September 30, % Incr.

The vast majority of the balances continue to be matched book business on which average spreads declined from 0.65% to 0.41%. Expenses continue to be closely monitored and were 15% lower than in the prior year. This was not enough to offset the 38% decline in net revenues and as a result pre-tax profits declined 48%. Year ended September 30, 2008 Compared with the Year ended September 30, 2007 Stock Loan/Borrow Despite an approximately 15% decline in average stock borrow balances from the 2007 fiscal year, net interest in this segment increased 9% in fiscal 2008. The vast majority of the balances were matched book business with similar asset and liability balances. Average spreads on the matched book business increased from 0.5% to 0.65% in fiscal 2008, resulting in the increased net interest. Expenses were lower in fiscal year 2008 than in the prior year resulting in a 41% increase in pre-tax profits.

During fiscal 2009, our direct merchant banking investments and Raymond James Capital Partners L.P. portfolio increased in value by $2.4 million and $12.1 million, respectively, while the RJF private equity investment and EIF Funds portfolio decreased by $2.8 million. Since we do not own 100% of all of the investments held in this segment, $8.1 million of the net income is attributable to other investors. Year ended September 30, 2008 Compared with the Year ended September 30, 2007 Proprietary Capital Proprietary Capital results in fiscal year 2008 were driven by the valuations within Raymond James Capital Partners, L.P., Ballast Point Ventures I and II, L.P., the EIF Funds, our direct merchant banking investments managed by Raymond James Capital, Inc. and the third-party private equity funds in which RJF was invested. During fiscal 2008, our direct merchant banking investments, Raymond James Capital Partners L.P. and RJF private equity investment portfolio increased in value by $3 million, $8.2 million and $4 million, respectively.

Expenses in this segment are predominantly executive compensation and beginning in August 2009, interest on our senior notes. This interest will be approximately $26 million annually. Year ended September 30, 2008 Compared with the Year ended September 30, 2007 - Other Revenue in the Other segment includes interest earnings on available corporate cash balances and gains/losses on corporate investments, including company-owned life insurance used as a funding vehicle for non-qualified deferred compensation programs. Expenses in this segment are predominantly executive compensation and certain compensation accruals related to our benefit plans as a result of increased profitability at RJ Bank. Liquidity and Capital Resources Senior management establishes our liquidity and capital policies. These policies include senior management review of short- and long-term cash flow forecasts, review of monthly capital expenditures, the monitoring of the availability of alternative sources of financing and the daily monitoring of liquidity in our significant subsidiaries. Our decisions on the allocation of capital to our business units consider, among other factors, projected profitability and cash flow, risk and impact on future liquidity needs. Our treasury department assists in evaluating, monitoring and controlling the impact that our business activities have on our financial condition, liquidity and capital structure as well as maintains the relationships with various lenders. The objectives of these policies are to support the successful execution of our business strategies while ensuring ongoing and sufficient liquidity. 43 During 2008, the unprecedented volatility of the financial markets, accompanied by a severe deterioration of economic conditions worldwide, had a pronounced adverse effect on the availability of credit through traditional sources. As a result of concern about the stability of the markets generally and the strength of counterparties specifically, many lenders reduced and, in some cases, ceased to provide us with funding. While these conditions somewhat improved during 2009, the availability of credit through traditional sources remained limited. See Sources of Liquidity-Borrowings section below for additional information. Liquidity is provided primarily through our business operations and financing activities. Cash provided by operating activities during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2009 was approximately $414 million, primarily attributable to our positive net earnings and the decreases in brokerage client receivables, segregated assets (directly correlated to decreases in brokerage client deposits), stock-borrowed receivables and receivables from broker-dealers and clearing organizations. This was partially offset by decreases in brokerage client deposits, stock-loaned payables and payables to broker-dealers and clearing organizations. Investing activities used $1.07 billion, which is primarily attributable to loan originations and purchases of available for sale securities and an increase in securities purchased under agreements to resell at RJ Bank. This was partially offset by loan repayments and maturations and repayments of available for sale securities at RJ Bank. Financing activities used $242 million, predominantly as a result of repayments of the borrowed funds outstanding as of September 30, 2008, which included a $1.9 billion overnight borrowing to meet point-in-time regulatory balance sheet composition requirements related to RJ Bank qualifying as a thrift institution at September 30, 2008. This was offset by proceeds from borrowed funds including a $900 million overnight borrowing to meet point-in-time regulatory balance sheet composition requirements related to RJ Bank qualifying as a thrift institution at September 30, 2009, $297 million in capital raised from the issuance of senior debt and an increase in deposits of $649 million at RJ Bank. We believe our existing assets, most of which are liquid in nature, together with funds generated from operations and committed and uncommitted credit facilities, should provide adequate funds for continuing operations at current levels of activity. Sources of Liquidity In addition to the liquidity provided through our business operations, we have various potential sources of capital. Liquidity Available from Subsidiaries Our two principal domestic broker-dealer subsidiaries are required to maintain net capital equal to the greater of $250,000 or 2% of aggregate debit balances arising from customer transactions. At September 30, 2009, both of these brokerage subsidiaries far exceeded their minimum net capital requirements. At that date, these subsidiaries had excess net capital of $269 million, of which approximately $69 million is available for dividend (after taking into account regulatory or other restrictions, including debt covenants) while still maintaining a capital level well above regulatory early warning guidelines. Subject to notification and in some cases approval by the OTS, RJ Bank may pay dividends to the parent company as long as RJ Bank maintains its well capitalized status under bank regulatory capital guidelines. However, certain of our debt covenants impose capital maintenance requirements on RJ Bank that may from time to time impact its ability to pay a dividend. See further discussion of RJ Bank ability to pay dividends in Note 25 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Liquidity available to us from our subsidiaries, other than our broker-dealer subsidiaries and RJ Bank, is not limited by regulatory requirements, but is relatively insignificant. 44 Borrowings and Financing Arrangements The following table presents our domestic financing arrangements with third-party lenders as of September 30, 2009: Committed Committed Uncommitted Uncommitted Total Financing Unsecured Secured Secured Unsecured Arrangements (in 000 s) RJ&A $ - $ 325,000 $ 285,100 $ 200,000 $ 810,100 RJF 100,000 - - - 100,000 RJ Bank 10,000 - - - 10,000 Total Company $ 110,000 $ 325,000 $ 285,100 $ 200,000 $ 920,100 At September 30, 2009, we maintained five 364-day committed and several uncommitted financing arrangements denominated in U.S. dollars totaling $920.1 million and one uncommitted line of credit denominated in Canadian dollars ( CDN ) in the amount of CDN $20 million. Lenders are under no obligation to lend to us under uncommitted credit facilities. Committed facilities include a $100 million unsecured revolving credit agreement in the name of RJF, which closed in February 2009. Committed facilities provided by commercial banks in the name of RJ&A include a $75 million bilateral repurchase agreement, a $150 million tri-party repurchase agreement and a $100 million secured line of credit. These facilities are subject to 0.013%, 0.05% and 0.05% commitment fees, respectively, and the required market value of the collateral ranges from 102% to 125%. Additionally, RJ&A maintains $285.1 million in uncommitted secured facilities provided by commercial banks. Unsecured, uncommitted loan facilities available to RJ&A totaled $200 million. At September 30, 2009, RJ Bank had a $10 million committed unsecured line of credit provided by a commercial bank for the sole purpose of purchasing Fed Funds to meet short-term and unexpected funding needs. At September 30, 2009, there were collateralized financings outstanding in the amount of $104.3 million. Of this amount, consolidated repurchase agreement financings of $74.3 million are included in Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase and $30 million in borrowings from uncommitted secured facilities are included in Other Borrowings on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. Such financings are collateralized by non-customer, RJ&A-owned securities. The interest rates for all of our financing facilities are variable and are based on the Fed Funds rate, LIBOR, credit default swaps rate or Canadian prime rate as applicable. Unlike committed credit facilities, uncommitted lenders are not subject to any formula determining the interest rates they may charge on a loan. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2009, interest rates on the utilized financing facilities ranged from (on a 360 days per year basis) 0.58% to 5.00%. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2008, those interest rates ranged from 1.58% to 7.75%. We have guaranteed a settlement line of credit in Argentina for $9 million. There are also two unsecured settlement lines of credit available to the Argentina venture in the amount of $4.5 million. At September 30, 2009, there were no outstanding balances on these lines. The interest rate for these lines of credit ranged from 4% to 18%. RJ Bank had $950 million in FHLB advances outstanding at September 30, 2009, comprised of one short-term fixed-rate advance, one overnight advance and several long-term, fixed-rate advances. The overnight advance of $900 million was made to meet point-in-time regulatory balance sheet composition requirements related to its qualifying as a thrift institution. Due to this overnight advance, RJ Bank had $304 million in immediate credit available from the FHLB on September 30, 2009 and total available credit of 40% of total assets, with the pledge of additional collateral to the FHLB. Following the repayment of the $900 million overnight advance on October 1, 2009, RJ Bank had $1.2 billion in immediate credit available from the FHLB and total available credit of 40% of total assets with the pledging of additional collateral to the FHLB. See Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. At September 30, 2009, all of the FHLB advances outstanding were secured by a blanket lien on RJ Bank residential loan portfolio and FHLB stock. 45 At September 30, 2009 and September 30, 2008, we had other debt of $359 million and $62.2 million, respectively. The balance at September 30, 2009 is comprised of a $59.1 million balance outstanding on our mortgage loan for our home-office complex and $300 million outstanding on our senior notes due August 2019. In August 2009, we sold $300 million in aggregate principal amount of 8.60% senior notes, due August 2019, in a registered public offering. Interest on these senior notes is payable semi-annually commencing on February 15, 2010. These senior notes may be redeemed in whole by us at any time, or in part from time to time prior to the maturity date, at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of the notes redeemed, or (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon, discounted to the redemption date at a discount rate equal to a designated U.S. Treasury rate, plus 50 basis points, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the redemption date. Our long-term debt ratings are: Standard and Poors BBB, Moody's Investor Services Baa2. Other Sources of Liquidity We own a significant number of life insurance policies utilized to fund certain non-qualified deferred compensation plans. We are able to borrow up to 90% of the cash surrender value of these policies, which have a recorded value of $117.7 million as of September 30, 2009. There are no borrowings outstanding against these policies as of September 30, 2009. Our ability to provide additional capital to RJ Bank is limited by our available liquidity. At September 30, 2009, our available liquidity from which to provide capital to RJ Bank was approximately $175 million, consisting predominantly of the excess capital at our broker-dealer subsidiary, RJ&A, that was available from time to time for dividends to the parent company and other undeployed cash generated by the August 2009 senior note financing. See Note 21 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the capitalization of RJ Bank as of September 30, 2009 and 2008. See Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies section for information regarding our commitments. Statement of Financial Condition Analysis Our statement of financial condition consists primarily of cash and cash equivalents (a large portion of which are segregated for the benefit of customers), receivables and payables. The items presented in our statement of financial condition are primarily liquid in nature, providing us with flexibility in financing our business. Total assets of $18.2 billion at September 30, 2009 were down approximately 12% from September 30, 2008. Most of this decrease is due to the decrease in segregated assets as a result of the multi-bank sweep program that began in September 2009 (see Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of this program) . As of September 30, 2009, our liabilities were comprised primarily of deposits of $9.4 billion at RJ Bank and brokerage client payables of $3.8 billion at the broker-dealer subsidiaries, as well as corporate debt of $359 million and other borrowings of $980 million. We primarily act as an intermediary in stock loan/borrow transactions. As a result, the liability of $490 million associated with the stock loan transactions is related to the $417 million receivable comprised of our cash deposits for stock-borrowed transactions. To meet our obligations to clients and operating needs, we have approximately $2.3 billion in cash and $2.3 billion in assets segregated pursuant to regulations. We also have client brokerage receivables of $1.5 billion and $6.6 billion in loans at RJ Bank. 46 Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies We have contractual obligations to make future payments in connection with our short and long-term debt, non-cancelable lease agreements, partnership investments, commitments to extend credit, underwriting commitments and a naming rights agreement. The following table sets forth these contractual obligations by fiscal year: Total 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Thereafter (in 000 s) Long-Term Debt (1) $ 404,034 $ 3,075 $ 48,255 $ 3,445 $ 3,647 $ 3,860 $ 341,752 Variable Interest Entities Loans (2) 89,244 12,780 12,806 13,297 13,280 13,610 23,471 Short-Term Debt (1) 935,000 935,000 - - - - - Operating Leases 224,824 45,602 39,672 34,403 28,915 19,640 56,592 Investments Private Equity Partnerships (3) 49,600 49,600 - - - - - Certificates of Deposit 193,479 95,782 43,212 12,946 19,500 22,039 - Commitments to Extend Credit - RJ Bank (4) 1,920,186 1,920,186 - - - - - RJ Multi-Family Unfunded Loans 6,793 6,793 - - - - - Underwriting Commitments 28,953 28,953 - - - - - Naming Rights for Raymond James Stadium 23,659 3,409 3,545 3,687 3,835 3,988 5,195 Loans and Transition Assistance Commitments to Financial Advisors (3) 29,796 14,599 9,771 5,341 85 - - Total $ 3,905,568 $ 3,115,779 $ 157,261 $ 73,119 $ 69,262 $ 63,137 $ 427,010 (1) See Notes 11 and 13 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. (2) Loans which are non-recourse to us. See Note 12 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.. (3) See Note 16 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. (4) Because many commitments expire without being funded in whole or part, the contract amounts are not estimates of future liquidity requirements. Our Board of Directors approved up to $200 million in short-term or mezzanine financing investments, primarily related to investment banking transactions. As of September 30, 2009, we did not have any such investments. The Board of Directors has approved the use of up to $75 million for investment in proprietary merchant banking opportunities. As of September 30, 2009, we have invested approximately $33.5 million. The use of this capital is subject to availability of funds. We are authorized by the Board of Directors to repurchase our common stock for general corporate purposes. There is no formal stock repurchase plan at this time. Since May 2004, our Board of Directors has authorized $150 million for repurchases at the discretion of our Board Share Repurchase Committee. As of September 30, 2009 the unused portion of this authorization was $65.4 million. RJ Bank has outstanding at any time a significant number of commitments to extend credit, and other credit-related off balance sheet financial instruments such as standby letters of credit and loan purchases. Because many loan commitments expire without being funded in whole or part, the contract amounts are not estimates of our actual future credit exposure or our future liquidity requirements. Based on the underlying terms and conditions of these loans, management believes it is highly unlikely that a material percentage of these commitments would be drawn. Many of these loan commitments have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and, historically, a large percentage of the letters of credit expire without being funded. As of September 30, 2009, RJ Bank had entered into term reverse repurchase agreements totaling $2 billion. The term agreements were with two counterparties having individual exposures of $1 billion each, which matured on October 1 st and 2 nd , 2009. Although RJ Bank was exposed to risk that these counterparties may not fulfill their contractual obligations, we believe the risk of default is minimal due to the U.S. Treasury or agency securities received as collateral, the creditworthiness of the counterparties, which is closely monitored, and the short duration of these agreements. 47 The FDIC announced in November 2009 that it will require insured financial institutions to pay on December 30, 2009 their estimated quarterly assessments for the fourth calendar quarter in 2009, as well as prepay their estimated assessments for the calendar years of 2010 through 2012. This measure was taken by the FDIC in order to ensure its ability to fund expenditures in connection with expected financial institution failures. The amount to be assessed will be based on a financial institution base assessment rate at September 30, 2009, and the financial institution regular assessment base (deposits) on September 30, 2009. The assessment rate will be increased by three basis points for calendar years 2011 and 2012 and the deposit base will be increased quarterly by an estimated 5% annual growth rate through the end of 2012. RJ Bank has estimated this prepaid FDIC insurance assessment to be approximately $45 million, which will be reflected as a prepaid asset on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition at the end of the first quarter in fiscal year 2010. We are the lessor in a leveraged commercial aircraft transaction with Continental Airlines, Inc. ( Continental ). Our ability to realize our expected return is dependent upon this airline ability to fulfill its lease obligation. In the event that this airline defaults on its lease commitment and the Trustee for the debt holders is unable to re-lease or sell the plane with adequate terms, we would suffer a loss of some or all of our investment. The value of our leveraged lease with Continental is approximately $8 million, which is included in Other Assets on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition, as of September 30, 2009. Our equity investment represented 20% of the aggregate purchase price; the remaining 80% was funded by public debt issued in the form of equipment trust certificates. The residual value of the aircraft at the end of the lease term of approximately 17 years is projected to be 15% of the original cost. This lease expires in May 2014. Although Continental remains current on its lease payments to us, the inability of Continental to make its lease payments, or the termination or modification of the lease through a bankruptcy proceeding, could result in the write-down of our investment and the acceleration of certain income tax payments. We continue to monitor this lessee for specific events or circumstances that would increase the likelihood of a default on Continental obligations under this lease. We offer loans and transition assistance to our financial advisors mainly for recruiting or retention purposes. These commitments are contingent upon certain events occurring, including but not limited to the financial advisor joining us and meeting certain production requirements. In certain circumstances, we may make commitments prior to funding them. As of September 30, 2009, we made commitments of approximately $29.8 million in loans and transition assistance that have not yet been funded. In the normal course of business, certain subsidiaries of ours act as general partner and may be contingently liable for activities of various limited partnerships. These partnerships engaged primarily in real estate activities. In our opinion, such liabilities, if any, for the obligations of the partnerships will not in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position. RJ&A and RJFS have been subject to ongoing investigations in connection with their sale of ARS. ARS are long-term debt and equity instruments whose interest/dividend rates are reset by periodic (typically weekly or monthly) auctions. The auctions also provided liquidity to ARS holders. Those auctions began failing in February 2008, resulting in holders being unable to liquidate investments they believed to be readily saleable for cash at par. The SEC, whose investigation is now in its sixteenth month, continues to take testimony of various individuals and from time to time seeks additional documents and information. The Office of Financial Regulation of the State of Florida, which began its investigation of us a year ago, has also sought extensive documentation and has been contacting our clients. In addition, Florida regulators have taken the testimony of approximately twenty individuals, who are employees or independent financial advisors. Extensive documentation has also been provided to the Office of the Attorney General of the State of New York, which is monitoring these investigations. To date, none of the regulators have reported to us on the status of their investigations or provided us with any indication as to a timeline for completing their investigations, nor have they made any demand of us to take any remedial action with respect to ARS held by our clients. If we were to consider resolving pending claims, inquiries or investigations by offering to repurchase all or a significant portion of these ARS from certain clients, we would have to have sufficient regulatory capital and cash or borrowing power to do so, and at present we do not have such capacity. Because we believe we have meritorious defenses and do not have sufficient regulatory capital, cash or borrowing capacity to repurchase all or a significant portion of the remaining ARS held by our clients, any action to compel repurchasing ARS would likely be vigorously contested by us. As of September 30, 2009, approximately two-thirds of the remaining $800 million of ARS currently held by Raymond James clients have been issued by funds of Nuveen Investments, a large mutual fund sponsor. Nuveen is currently pursuing alternatives to refinance the ARS issued by its funds. Although there can be no assurance that Nuveen's refinancing plans will be successful, their refinancing would significantly reduce our clients' holdings of ARS. 48 In addition, see Item 3, Legal Proceedings, for discussion of ARS and the potential implications of our current liquidity position on our ability to resolve these matters. See Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our commitments and contingencies. Regulatory Our broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to requirements of the SEC in the United States and the IIROC in Canada relating to liquidity and capital standards. Our domestic broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to the requirements of the Uniform Net Capital Rule (Rule 15c3-1) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. RJ&A, a member firm of FINRA, is also subject to the rules of FINRA, whose requirements are substantially the same. Rule 15c3-1 requires that aggregate indebtedness, as defined, not exceed 15 times net capital, as defined. Rule 15c3-1 also provides for an alternative net capital requirement , which RJ&A, RJFS, EFD and Raymond James (USA) Ltd. have elected. It requires that minimum net capital, as defined, be equal to the greater of $250,000 or 2% of Aggregate Debit Items arising from client transactions. FINRA may require a member firm to reduce its business if its net capital is less than four percent of Aggregate Debit Items and may prohibit a member firm from expanding its business and declaring cash dividends if its net capital is less than 5% of Aggregate Debit Items. RJ&A, RJFS, EFD and Raymond James (USA) Ltd. all had net capital in excess of minimum requirements as of September 30, 2009. RJ Ltd. is subject to the Minimum Capital Rule (By-Law No. 17 of the IIROC) and the Early Warning System (By-Law No. 30 of the IIROC). The Minimum Capital Rule requires that every member shall have and maintain at all times Risk Adjusted Capital greater than zero calculated in accordance with Form 1 (Joint Regulatory Financial Questionnaire and Report) and with such requirements as the Board of Directors of the IIROC may from time to time prescribe. Insufficient Risk Adjusted Capital may result in suspension from membership in the stock exchanges or the IIROC. The Early Warning System is designed to provide advance warning that a member firm is encountering financial difficulties. This system imposes certain sanctions on members who are designated in Early Warning Level 1 or Level 2 according to its capital, profitability, liquidity position, frequency of designation or at the discretion of the IIROC. Restrictions on business activities and capital transactions, early filing requirements, and mandated corrective measures are sanctions that may be imposed as part of the Early Warning System. RJ Ltd. was not in Early Warning Level 1 or Level 2 during fiscal 2009 or 2008. RJ Bank is subject to various regulatory and capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory, and possibly, additional discretionary actions by regulators. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, RJ Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of RJ Bank's assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. RJ Bank's capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings, and other factors. Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require RJ Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of Total and Tier I Capital (as defined in the regulations) to risk-weighted assets (as defined). Management believes, as of September 30, 2009, that RJ Bank meets all capital adequacy requirements to which it is subject. RJ Bank ability to maintain its well capitalized level may be limited by our ability to continue to provide capital to RJ Bank. At September 30, 2009, our available liquidity from which to provide capital to RJ Bank was $175 million, consisting predominantly of the excess capital at our broker-dealer subsidiary, RJ&A, that was available from time to time for dividends to the parent company and other undeployed cash generated by the August 2009 senior note financing. RJ Bank applied to the OCC to convert from a federal savings bank to a national bank on November 29, 2008 and RJF applied to the Federal Reserve Board to become a bank holding company on December 5, 2008. RJF had a preliminary visit by a Federal Reserve Board examiner in January 2009. During August 2009, the Federal Reserve Board conducted a pre-approval inspection of RJF. The Federal Reserve Board has completed its inspection but not its report and continues to present questions that arose in the course of that inspection. RJF is currently unable to estimate if or when it could be approved as a bank holding company. Federal Reserve Board staff also indicated that resolution of our outstanding ARS issue could impact the timing of RJF conversion application. The OCC has completed its inspection of RJ Bank and we are not aware of any impediments to RJ Bank conversion to a national bank, other than approval by the Federal Reserve Board of RJF as a bank holding company. 49 Our business plan for RJ Bank is for it to become a commercial bank, enabling it to have a majority of its loan portfolio composed of corporate and commercial real estate loans. If RJ Bank remains a thrift, its business mix would be required to be oriented to loans related to residential real estate and other qualifying thrift assets. See Note 21 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on regulatory and capital requirements. Critical Accounting Policies The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. For a full description of these and other accounting policies, see Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We believe that of our significant accounting policies, those described below involve a high degree of judgment and complexity. These critical accounting policies require estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses reported in the consolidated financial statements. Due to their nature, estimates involve judgment based upon available information. Actual results or amounts could differ from estimates and the difference could have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. Therefore, understanding these policies is important in understanding the reported results of our operations and our financial position. Valuation of Financial Instruments, Investments and Other Assets The use of fair value to measure financial instruments, with related gains or losses recognized in our Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income, is fundamental to our financial statements and our risk management processes. Trading instruments and Available for sale securities are reflected in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value. Unrealized gains and losses related to these financial instruments are reflected in our net income or in our other comprehensive income, depending on the underlying purpose of the instrument. We measure the fair value of our financial instruments in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ). GAAP defines fair value, establishes a framework that we use to measure fair value and provides for certain disclosures we provide about our fair value measurements included in our financial statements. Refer to Notes 3 and 4 in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for these disclosures. Fair value is defined by GAAP as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between willing market participants on the measurement date. We determine the fair values of our financial instruments and any other assets and liabilities required by GAAP to be recognized at fair value in the financial statements as of the close of business at each financial statement reporting period. For impairment tests or assessments of non-financial instruments such as goodwill, certain real estate owned and other long-lived assets, GAAP does not require us to apply the above described fair value measurement process to such assets until our next fiscal year (i.e. beginning October 1, 2009) . In determining fair value in accordance with GAAP, we use various valuation approaches, including market and/or income approaches. Fair value is a market-based measure considered from the perspective of a market participant. As such, even when assumptions of market participants are not readily available, our own assumptions reflect those that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. GAAP provides for the following three levels to be used to classify our fair value measurements: Level 1 Financial instruments included in Level 1 are highly liquid instruments with quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. These include equity securities traded in active markets and certain U. S. Treasury securities, other governmental obligations, or publicly traded corporate debt securities. 50 Level 2 Financial instruments reported in Level 2 include those that have pricing inputs that are other than quoted prices in active markets, but which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date. Instruments that are generally included in this category are equity securities that are not actively traded, corporate obligations infrequently traded, certain government and municipal obligations, interest rate swaps, certain asset-backed securities consisting of collateral loan obligation securities, certain mortgage-backed securities and most derivative instruments. Level 3 Financial instruments reported in Level 3 do not have two-way markets and are measured using our best estimate of fair value, where significant inputs into the determination of fair value are unobservable. These valuations require significant judgment or estimation. Instruments in this category generally include equity securities with unobservable inputs such as those investments made in our proprietary capital segment, certain non-agency backed collateralized loan obligation securities, certain non-agency backed asset-backed securities and certain municipal and corporate obligations. GAAP requires that we maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when performing our fair value measurements. The availability of observable inputs can vary from instrument to instrument and in certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, an instrument level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement of an instrument requires judgment and consideration of factors specific to the instrument. Valuation Techniques The fair value for certain of our financial instruments is derived using pricing models and other valuation techniques that involve significant management judgment. The price transparency of financial instruments is a key determinant of the degree of judgment involved in determining the fair value of our financial instruments. Financial instruments for which actively quoted prices or pricing parameters are available will generally have a higher degree of price transparency than financial instruments that are thinly traded or not quoted. In accordance with GAAP, the criteria used to determine whether the market for a financial instrument is active or inactive is based on the particular asset or liability. For equity securities, our definition of actively traded is based on average daily volume and other market trading statistics. We have determined the market for certain other types of financial instruments, including certain collateralized mortgage obligations ( CMOs ), asset-backed securities ( ABS ) and certain collateralized debt obligations, to be inactive as of September 30, 2009. As a result, the valuation of these financial instruments included significant management judgment in determining the relevance and reliability of market information available. We considered the inactivity of the market to be evidenced by several factors, including decreased price transparency caused by decreased volume of trades relative to historical levels, stale transaction prices and transaction prices that varied significantly either over time or among market makers. The specific valuation techniques utilized for the categorization of financial instruments presented in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition are described below. Trading Instruments and Trading Instruments Sold but Not Yet Purchased Trading Securities Trading securities are comprised primarily of the financial instruments held by our broker-dealer subsidiaries (see Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information). When available, we use quoted prices in active markets to determine the fair value of these securities. Such instruments are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Examples include exchange traded equity securities and liquid government debt securities. When instruments are traded in secondary markets and quoted market prices do not exist for such securities, we utilize valuation techniques including matrix pricing to estimate fair value. Matrix pricing generally utilizes spread-based models periodically re-calibrated to observable inputs such as market trades or to dealer price bids in similar securities in order to derive the fair value of the instruments. Valuation techniques may also rely on other observable inputs such as yield curves, interest rates and expected principal repayments, and default probabilities. Instruments valued using these inputs are typically classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. We utilize prices from independent services to corroborate our estimate of fair value. Depending upon the type of security, the pricing service may provide a listed price, a matrix price, or use other methods including broker-dealer price quotations. 51 Positions in illiquid securities that do not have readily determinable fair values require significant judgment or estimation. For these securities we use pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques. Assumptions utilized by these techniques include estimates of future delinquencies, loss severities, defaults and prepayments. Securities valued using these techniques are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. For certain CMOs, where there has been limited activity or less transparency around significant inputs to the valuation, such as assumptions regarding performance of the underlying mortgages, these securities are currently classified as Level 3 even though we believe that Level 2 inputs will likely be obtainable should markets for these securities become more active in the future. Derivatives We enter into interest rate swaps and futures contracts as part of our fixed income business to facilitate customer transactions and to hedge a portion of our trading inventory. In addition, to mitigate interest rate risk should there be a significantly rising rate environment, RJ Bank may purchase interest rate caps. See Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. RJ Bank also enters into commitments to sell originated, fixed-rate mortgage loans as well as commitments to sell Small Business Administration ( SBA ) loans. Fair values for derivative contracts are obtained from counterparties and from pricing models that consider current market trading levels and the contractual prices for the underlying financial instruments, as well as time value, yield curve and other volatility factors underlying the positions. Where model inputs can be observed in a liquid market and the model does not require significant judgment, such derivative contracts are typically classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Available for Sale Securities Available for sale securities are comprised primarily of CMOs and other residential mortgage related debt securities. These securities are generally held by RJ Bank. Debt and equity securities classified as available for sale are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of deferred taxes, reported in shareholders' equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income ( OCI ) unless the loss is considered to be other-than-temporary, in which case the related credit loss portion is recognized as a loss in other revenue. The fair value of available for sale securities is determined by obtaining third-party pricing service bid quotations and third-party broker-dealer quotes. Third-party pricing service bid quotations are based on current market data. The third-party pricing service utilizes evaluated pricing models that vary by asset class and incorporate available trade, bid and other current market information as well as cash flow expectations and, when available, loan performance data. The market inputs the third-party pricing service normally seeks for these price evaluations are based upon observable data including benchmark yields, reported trades, broker-dealer quotes, issuer spreads, two-sided markets, benchmark securities, bids, offers, and reference data including market research publications. Securities valued using these valuation techniques are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. For senior non-agency CMOs where a significant difference exists between the third-party pricing service bid quotation and the third-party broker-dealer quote, we utilize a discounted cash flow analysis to determine which price quote is most representative of fair value under the current market conditions. In most cases (20 of 25 senior securities at September 30, 2009), third-party pricing service bid quotations based upon observable data as described above were determined to be the most representative indication of fair value for these securities. For the five remaining senior securities, our discounted cash flow analysis indicated third-party broker-dealer quotes were more representative and accordingly, we gave correspondingly more weight to that indicator of fair value. In order to validate that the inputs used by the third-party pricing service are observable, we request, on a quarterly basis, their inputs for a sample of senior securities and compare these inputs to those we considered appropriate and used in our own discounted cash flow analysis. Securities measured using these valuation techniques are generally classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. For all subordinated non-agency CMOs, we estimate fair value by utilizing discounted cash flow analyses, using observable market data where available as well as our own unobservable inputs. The unobservable inputs utilized in these valuation techniques reflect our own supposition about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing a security, including those about future delinquencies, loss severities, defaults and prepayments. Securities valued using these valuation techniques are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. 52 If the third-party pricing service bid quotations and broker-dealer quotes are not available, or are deemed unreliable, then a security fair value is estimated using our discounted cash flow analyses as is used for the subordinated non-agency CMOs. In such instances, the securities measured are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. For securities in an unrealized loss position at period end we make an assessment whether these securities are impaired on an other-than-temporary basis. In order to evaluate our risk exposure and any potential impairment of these securities, on a periodic basis we review the characteristics of each security owned such as collateral type, delinquency and foreclosure levels, credit enhancement, projected loan losses and collateral coverage. The following factors are considered to determine whether an impairment is other-than-temporary: our intention to sell the security, our assessment of whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before the recovery of its amortized cost basis, and whether the evidence indicating that we will recover the entire amortized cost basis of a security outweighs evidence to the contrary. Evidence considered in this assessment includes the reasons for the impairment, the severity and duration of the impairment, changes in value subsequent to period end, recent events specific to the issuer or industry, forecasted performance of the security, and any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency. Securities on which there is an unrealized loss that is deemed to be other-than-temporary are written down to fair value with the credit loss portion of the write-down recorded as a realized loss in other revenue and the non-credit portion of the write-down recorded in other comprehensive income. The credit loss portion of the write-down is the difference between the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis of the security. The previous amortized cost basis of the security less the other-than-temporary impairment recognized in earnings establishes the new cost basis for the security. We estimate the portion of loss attributable to credit using a discounted cash flow model. Our discounted cash flow model utilizes relevant assumptions such as prepayment rate, default rate, and loss severity on a loan level basis. Private Equity Investments Private equity investments, held primarily by our Proprietary Capital segment, consist of various direct and third-party private equity and merchant banking investments. The valuation of these investments requires significant management judgment due to the absence of quoted market prices, inherent lack of liquidity and long-term nature of these assets. Direct private equity investments are valued initially at the transaction price until significant transactions or developments indicate that a change in the carrying values of these investments is appropriate. Generally, the carrying values of these investments will be adjusted based on financial performance, investment-specific events, financing and sales transactions with third parties and changes in market outlook. Investments in funds structured as limited partnerships are generally valued based on the financial statements of the partnerships. Investments valued using these valuation techniques are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Other Investments Other investments consist primarily of Canadian government bonds and term deposits with Canadian financial institutions. The Canadian government bonds are measured at fair value with any changes recognized in our Consolidated Statements of Income for the period. The fair value is based upon recent external market transactions. The Canadian financial institution term deposits are recorded at cost, which approximates market value. These investments are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Level 3 Assets and Liabilities Level 3 assets were $162.9 million and $190.2 million as of September 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and represented approximately 13.2% of total assets measured at fair value as of September 30, 2009. Level 3 liabilities were less than $200,000 as of both September 30, 2009 and 2008, and represented less than 1% of total liabilities measured at fair value as of September 30, 2009. 53 Goodwill Goodwill is related to our acquisition of Roney & Co. (now part of RJ&A) and Goepel McDermid, Inc. (now called Raymond James Ltd.). Goodwill represents the excess cost of a business acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired. GAAP does not provide for amortization of indefinite-life intangible assets such as goodwill. Rather, these assets are subject to impairment testing on an annual basis, or more often if events or circumstances indicate there may be impairment. This impairment test involves assigning tangible assets and liabilities, identified intangible assets and goodwill to reporting units and comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount. If the fair value is less than the carrying amount, a further test is required to measure the amount of the impairment. We use a combination of comparable transactions and discounted cash flow to estimate the fair value of our reporting units. We calculate an estimated fair value based on multiples of revenues, earnings, and book value of comparable transactions. The selection of comparables and assumptions for the discounted cash flow scenarios and the weight assigned to each methodology requires significant judgment. As of September 30, 2009, the $63 million balance of goodwill had been allocated to the Private Client Group of RJ&A, and both the Private Client Group and Capital Markets segments of RJ Ltd. We performed our annual impairment testing as of December 31, 2008. Our analysis did not indicate impairment of the goodwill asset, despite the impact of unfavorable market conditions on the Private Client Group and Capital Market segments. We will continue to perform impairment testing on an annual basis or when an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit falling below its carrying amount. Allowance for Loan Losses and Other Provisions for Losses We recognize liabilities for contingencies when there is an exposure that, when fully analyzed, indicates it is both probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. When a range of probable loss can be estimated, we accrue the most likely amount of potential loss within that range; if the single most likely amount of potential loss within the range is not determinable, we accrue the minimum potential loss from our range of probable loss. We record reserves related to legal proceedings in Trade and Other Payables within our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. The determination of these reserve amounts requires significant judgment. We consider many factors including, but not limited to: the amount of the claim; the amount of the loss in the client's account; the basis and validity of the claim; the possibility of wrongdoing on the part of one of our employees; previous results in similar cases; and legal precedents and case law. Each legal proceeding is reviewed with counsel in each accounting period and the reserve is adjusted as we consider appropriate. Any change in the reserve amount is recorded in the consolidated financial statements and is recognized as a charge/credit to earnings in that period. We make loans or pay advances to financial advisors, primarily for recruiting and retention purposes. We provide for an allowance for doubtful accounts based on an evaluation of our ability to collect such receivables. Our ongoing evaluation includes the review of specific accounts of financial advisors no longer associated with us and our historical collection experience. We also record reserves or allowances for doubtful accounts related to client receivables. Client receivables at our broker-dealer subsidiaries are generally collateralized by securities owned by the brokerage clients. Therefore, when a receivable is considered to be impaired, the amount of the impairment is generally measured based on the fair value of the securities acting as collateral, which is measured based on current prices from independent sources such as listed market prices or broker-dealer price quotations. RJ Bank provides an allowance for loan losses which reflects our continuing evaluation of the probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio. The allowance for loan losses is comprised of two components: allowances calculated based on formulas for homogeneous classes of loans and specific allowances assigned to certain classified loans individually evaluated for impairment. The calculation of the allowance based on formulas is subjective as we segregate the loan portfolio into homogeneous classes. Each class is then assigned an allowance percentage based on the perceived risk associated with that class of loans, which is then further segregated by loan grade. 54 RJ Bank loan grading process provides specific and detailed risk measurement across the corporate loan portfolio. The factors taken into consideration when assigning the allowance percentage to each allowance category include estimates of borrower default probabilities and collateral values; trends in delinquencies; volume and terms; changes in geographic distribution, lending policies, local, regional, and national economic conditions; concentrations of credit risk, past loss history and examination results from regulatory agencies. In addition, we provide for potential losses inherent in RJ Bank unfunded lending commitments using the criteria above, further adjusted for an estimated probability of funding. As part of the ongoing evaluation process, charge-offs are considered on residential mortgage loans once the loans are delinquent 90 days or more and generally are taken before the loan is 120 days past due. A charge-off is taken for the difference between the loan amount and the amount that we estimate will ultimately be collected, based on the value of the underlying collateral less estimated costs to sell. The property values are adjusted for anticipated selling costs and the balance is charged-off against the allowance. We predominantly use broker price opinions ( BPO ) for these valuations as access to the property is restricted during the foreclosure process and there is insufficient data available for a full appraisal to be performed. BPOs contain relevant and timely sale comparisons and listings in the marketplace, and therefore, we have found these BPOs to be good determinants of market value in lieu of appraisals and are more reliable than an automated valuation tool or the use of tax assessed values. A full appraisal is obtained post-foreclosure. We take further charge-offs against the owned asset if an appraisal has a lower valuation than the original BPO. If a loan remains in pre-foreclosure status for more than six months, an updated valuation is obtained and further charge-offs are taken if necessary. In addition, these loans are reviewed in a monthly delinquency meeting jointly administered by our retail banking and credit risk managers. For individual loans identified as impaired, RJ Bank measures impairment based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate, the loan's observable market price, or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. After consideration of the borrower ability to restructure the loan, alternative sources of repayment, and other factors affecting the borrower ability to repay the debt, the portion of the allowance deemed to be a confirmed loss, if any, is charged-off. For collateral dependent corporate loans secured by real estate, the amount of the allowance considered a confirmed loss and charged-off is generally equal to the difference between the recorded investment in the loan and the appraised value less estimated costs to sell the collateral. These impaired loans are then considered to be in a workout status and we continually evaluate all factors relevant in determining the collectability and fair value of the loan. Appraisals on these impaired loans are obtained early in the impairment process as part of determining fair value and are updated as deemed necessary given the facts and circumstances of each individual situation. We closely monitor all individual nonperforming commercial real estate loans. Certain factors such as guarantor recourse, additional borrower cash contributions or stable operations will mitigate the need for more frequent than annual appraisals. In our continuous evaluation of each individual loan, we consider more frequent appraisals in geographies where commercial property values are known to be experiencing a greater amount of volatility. For other corporate loans, we evaluate all sources of repayment, including the estimated liquidation value of collateral pledged, to arrive at the amount considered to be a loss and charged-off. Corporate banking and credit risk managers hold a monthly meeting to review criticized loans. Additional charge-offs are taken when the value of the collateral changes or there is an adverse change in the expected cash flows. The majority of RJ Bank corporate loan portfolio is comprised of participations in SNC, or other large syndicated loans led by approximately 30 different financial institutions. The SNCs are loan syndications totaling over $20 million that are shared between three or more regulated institutions. The process for evaluating these SNC loans is consistent with the process described above for all corporate loans. In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review our allowance for loan losses. Such agencies may require us to recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgments and information available at the time of their examination. At September 30, 2009, the amortized cost of all RJ Bank loans was $6.8 billion and an allowance for loan losses of $150.3 million was recorded against that balance. The total allowance for loan losses is equal to 2.23% of the amortized cost of the loan portfolio. 55 The following table allocates RJ Bank allowance for loan losses by loan category: September 30, September 30, September 30, 2009 2008 2007 Loan Category Loan Category Loan Category as a % of as a % of as a % of Total Loans Total Loans Total Loans Allowance Receivable Allowance Receivable Allowance Receivable ($ in 000 s) Commercial Loans $ 15,279 13% $10,147 10% $ 4,471 7% Real Estate Construction Loans 3,237 3% 7,061 5% 2,121 3% Commercial Real Estate Loans (1) 103,580 49% 62,197 49% 35,766 49% Residential Mortgage Loans 28,088 35% 8,589 36% 4,659 41% Consumer Loans 88 - 161 - 5 - Total $ 150,272 100% $88,155 100% $47,022 100% (1) Loans wholly or partially secured by real estate.

If our underlying assumptions and judgments prove to be inaccurate, the allowance for loan losses could be insufficient to cover actual losses. These losses would result in a decrease in our net income as well as a decrease in the level of regulatory capital at RJ Bank. 56 Income Taxes The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. GAAP recognizes that the final outcome of certain tax positions we may take are uncertain, and provides standards for reflecting these uncertainties in our financial statements. Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. See Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our uncertain tax positions. Effects of recently issued accounting standards, and accounting standards not yet adopted In December 2007, the FASB issued new guidance on accounting for business combinations which includes the fundamental principle of recording the acquired business at fair value as well as requiring acquisition-related costs to be recognized separately from the acquisition and expensed as incurred. In addition, this new pronouncement requires extensive disclosures about the acquisition quantitative and qualitative effects including validation of the fair value of goodwill. This new guidance is effective for all business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008. Accordingly, we will apply this pronouncement to any of our business combinations occurring after October 1, 2009. This pronouncement did not affect our consolidated financial statements, but may have an effect on accounting for future business combinations. In December 2007, the FASB issued new guidance requiring noncontrolling interests to be treated as a separate component of equity, not as a liability or other item outside of permanent equity. This new guidance is applicable to the accounting for noncontrolling interests and transactions with noncontrolling interest holders in consolidated financial statements and is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008. Accordingly, we will adopt this new pronouncement as of October 1, 2009. The adoption will result in an increase in stockholders equity of approximately $200 million on our opening fiscal year 2010 consolidated statement of financial condition; however, we do not expect the adoption of this pronouncement to have a material effect on our results of operations or cash flows. In February 2008, the FASB delayed the effective date of the application of certain fair value pronouncements applicable to nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are not remeasured at fair value on a recurring basis (at least annually) until fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008. Accordingly, we will apply this pronouncement to our financial statements for the fiscal year commencing on October 1, 2009, including interim periods. We do not expect the adoption of this pronouncement to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In February 2008, the FASB issued new guidance applicable to the accounting for transfers of financial assets and repurchase financing transactions. This new guidance addresses the issue of whether these transactions should be viewed as two separate transactions or as one "linked" transaction. The guidance includes a "rebuttable presumption" that presumes linkage of the two transactions unless the presumption can be overcome by meeting certain criteria. This new pronouncement is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008. Accordingly, we will adopt this new guidance effective for our fiscal year 2010 including all interim periods. This new guidance applies only to original transfers made after that date; early adoption is not allowed. As of September 30, 2009, we had no positions for which this guidance would have been applicable. In March 2008, the FASB issued new guidance regarding disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities. This new guidance required expanded disclosures regarding derivative instruments and hedging activities to include how and why an entity is using a derivative instrument or hedging activity, an explanation of its accounting for such instruments, and how the instrument affects the entity financial position and performance as well as cash flows. This new pronouncement also clarifies that derivative instruments are subject to concentration-of-credit-risk disclosures. We have adopted this new pronouncement during fiscal year 2009. See Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the application of this pronouncement. 57 In June 2008, the FASB issued new guidance for determining whether instruments granted in share-based payment transactions are participating securities. This new guidance requires unvested share-based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents to be treated as participating securities under the two-class method and, therefore, included in the earnings allocation in computing earnings per share. This new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. Accordingly, we will apply this pronouncement to our consolidated financial statements effective in our fiscal year 2010 including all interim periods within the fiscal year. We have evaluated the impact of the adoption of this new guidance and have determined that our unvested restricted stock awards and units are participating securities requiring the two-class method of computing earnings per share. Under the two-class method, our basic and diluted earnings per common share for the year ended September 30, 2009 would have been $1.25 and $1.24, respectively. In October 2008, the FASB issued new guidance for determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that asset is not active. We adopted this additional fair value determination guidance during fiscal year 2009. See Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the outcome of our fair value determinations. In April 2009, the FASB issued guidance on recognition and presentation of other-than-temporary impairments for debt securities classified as held-to-maturity to shift the focus from an entity intent to hold until recovery to its intent or requirement to sell. RJ Bank held securities that were included within the scope of this guidance. The guidance applied to previously OTTI securities as of the effective date and mandated a cumulative-effect adjustment from retained earnings to accumulated other comprehensive income on the opening balance sheet in the period of adoption, if material, for the non-credit portion of a previously OTTI debt security held as of the date of initial adoption. We adopted this guidance during fiscal year 2009. We did not record a cumulative-effect adjustment upon adoption of the guidance as we did not consider the adjustment to be material. See Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the application of this guidance. In April 2009, the FASB issued guidance for determining fair value when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased as well as identifying circumstances that indicate a transaction is not orderly. We adopted this additional fair value determination guidance during fiscal year 2009. The adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In May 2009, the FASB issued new guidance to be used in the evaluation of trends and transactions that may occur and result in recognition or disclosure in the financial statements after the balance sheet date through the date the financial statements are issued. Provisions within this new guidance address the circumstances under which such events or transactions which occur subsequent to the reporting period-end must be recognized in the financial statements. We have adopted this new guidance during fiscal year 2009 and it did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. In June 2009, the FASB issued new guidance regarding the accounting for transfers of financial assets, as an amendment of previously issued guidance. This new guidance eliminates the Qualified Special Purpose Entity ( QSPE ) concept, creates more stringent conditions for reporting a transfer of a portion of a financial asset as a sale, clarifies the derecognition criteria, revises how retained interests are initially measured, and removes the guaranteed mortgage securitization recharacterization provisions. This new guidance requires additional year-end and interim disclosures and is not effective for us until October 1, 2010, and for subsequent interim and annual reporting periods thereafter. Early adoption is prohibited. We are currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of this new guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements. In June 2009, the FASB issued new guidance amending the existing pronouncement related to the consolidation of variable interest entities. This new guidance requires the reporting entities to evaluate former QSPE for consolidation, changes the approach to determine a variable interest entity primary beneficiary from a quantitative assessment to a qualitative assessment designed to identify a controlling financial interest, and increases the frequency of required assessments to determine whether we are the primary beneficiary of any variable interest entities which we are a party to. This new guidance is not effective for us until October 1, 2010 and earlier adoption is prohibited. We are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this new guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Information concerning our off balance sheet arrangements is included in Note 22 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Such information is hereby incorporated by reference. 58 Effects of Inflation Our assets are primarily liquid in nature and are not significantly affected by inflation. However, the rate of inflation affects our expenses, including employee compensation, communications and occupancy, which may not be readily recoverable through charges for services we provide to our clients.
