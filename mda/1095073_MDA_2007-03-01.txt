ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION The following is a discussion of the results of operations and financial condition of the Company. This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes thereto presented under ITEM 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data . INDUSTRY CONDITIONS The worldwide reinsurance and insurance businesses are highly competitive, as well as cyclical by product and market. Competition in the types of reinsurance and insurance business that the Company underwrites is based on many factors, including the perceived overall financial strength of the reinsurer or insurer, ratings of the reinsurer or insurer by A.M. Best and/or S&P, underwriting expertise, the jurisdictions where the reinsurer or insurer is licensed or otherwise authorized, capacity and coverages offered, premiums charged, other terms and conditions of the reinsurance and insurance business offered, services offered, speed of claims payment and reputation and experience in lines written. These factors operate at the individual market participant level to varying degrees, as applicable to the specific participant circumstances. They also operate in aggregate across the reinsurance industry more generally, contributing, in combination with economic conditions and variations in the reinsurance buying practices of insurance companies (by participant and in the aggregate), to cyclical movements in reinsurance rates, terms and conditions and ultimately reinsurance industry aggregate financial results. The Company competes in the U.S., Bermuda and international reinsurance and insurance markets with numerous global competitors. The Company competitors include independent reinsurance and insurance companies, subsidiaries or affiliates of established worldwide insurance companies, reinsurance departments of certain insurance companies and domestic and international underwriting operations, including underwriting syndicates at Lloyd s. Some of these competitors have greater financial resources than the Company and have established long-term and continuing business relationships, which can be a significant competitive advantage. In addition, the lack of strong barriers to entry into the reinsurance business and the potential for securitization of reinsurance and insurance risks through capital markets provide additional sources of potential reinsurance and insurance capacity and competition. In 2006, the Company observed strong price increases, and more restricted limits, in those property lines and regions that were most affected by the catastrophe events of 2005, principally Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma. Reinsurance capacity in these areas was constrained, particularly for catastrophe reinsurance, which includes southeastern U.S. exposures and in the retrocession and energy lines. The record catastrophe losses of 2005 have also generally led to modest strengthening for U.S. property lines that have little or no substantive catastrophe exposure and price stabilization in most casualty insurance and reinsurance markets. However, certain of the Company U.S. casualty lines continue to exhibit weaker market conditions led by the medical stop loss and D&O reinsurance classes, as well as the California workers compensation insurance line. The Company believes that U.S. casualty reinsurance generally remains adequately priced; however, increased price competition at the insurance company level and cedants increased appetite for retaining more profitable business net following several years of hard-market conditions, may result in modestly softer reinsurance pricing. The Company U.S. insurance operation is less affected by these standard casualty insurance market conditions given its specialty insurance program orientation. Finally, the Company continues to observe generally stable property reinsurance market conditions in most countries outside of the U.S., except for hardening property market conditions in Mexico following Hurricane Wilma, while casualty rates are softening. U.S. property reinsurance market conditions tightened, particularly within peak catastrophe zones, during 2006. This market hardening was particularly pronounced in third quarter renewals with incrementally higher rate changes and even more restrictive coverage terms than earlier in 2006. As a result, many reinsurance buyers were not able to fully place their reinsurance program and have been forced to raise retention levels and/or 47 reduce catastrophe limit purchases. In turn, insurance companies continue to adjust limits and coverages and increase the premium rates they charge their customers. Together, these trends have generally resulted in insurance companies retaining more property risk exposure and being more prone to potential future earnings volatility than in past years. This trend reflects an imbalance between reinsurance supply and demand. As a result of this imbalance and higher rates, additional competition is entering the market in the form of new companies and alternative risk transfer mechanisms. In January 2007, the Florida legislature enacted insurance reform that increases insurer access to the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund, thus potentially reducing the amount of reinsurance purchased from the private reinsurance market. The Company is unable to predict the impact on future market conditions from the increased competition and legislative reform. In addition to these market forces, reinsurers continue to reassess their risk appetites and rebalance their property portfolios to reflect improved price to exposure metrics against the backdrop of: (i) recent revisions to the industry catastrophe loss projection models, which are indicating significantly higher loss potentials and consequently higher pricing requirements and (ii) elevated rating agency scrutiny and capital requirements for many catastrophe exposed companies. In light of its 2005 catastrophe experience, the Company reexamined its risk management practices, concluded that its control framework operated generally as intended and made appropriate portfolio adjustments to its property reinsurance operations during the first nine months of 2006. This portfolio repositioning, particularly within peak catastrophe zones, including Southeast U.S., Mexico and Gulf of Mexico, has enabled the Company to benefit from these dislocated markets by carefully shifting the mix of its writings toward the most profitable classes, lines, customers and territories and enhancing portfolio balance and diversification. Overall, the Company believes that current marketplace conditions offer solid opportunities for the Company given its strong ratings, distribution system, reputation and expertise. The Company continues to employ its opportunistic strategy of targeting those segments offering the greatest profit potential, while maintaining balance and diversification in its overall portfolio. 48 FINANCIAL SUMMARY The Company management monitors and evaluates overall Company performance based upon financial results. The following table displays a summary of the consolidated net income (loss), ratios and shareholders equity for the years indicated: Years Ended December 31, Percentage Increase/(Decrease) (Dollars in thousands) 2006 2005 2004 2006/2005 2005/2004 Gross written premiums $ 4,000,870 $ 4,108,562 $ 4,704,135 -2.6 % -12.7 % Net written premiums 3,875,714 3,972,041 4,531,488 -2.4 % -12.3 % REVENUES: Premiums earned $ 3,853,153 $ 3,963,093 $ 4,425,082 -2.8 % -10.4 % Net investment income 629,378 522,833 495,908 20.4 % 5.4 % Net realized capital gains 35,067 90,284 89,614 -61.2 % 0.7 % Net derivative expense (410 ) (2,638 ) (2,660 ) 84.4 % 0.8 % Other income (expense) 112 (11,116 ) 9,562 N M N M Total revenues 4,517,300 4,562,456 5,017,506 -1.0 % -9.1 % CLAIMS AND EXPENSES: Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses 2,434,420 3,724,317 3,291,139 -34.6 % 13.2 % Commission, brokerage, taxes and fees 883,254 914,847 975,176 -3.5 % -6.2 % Other underwriting expenses 137,977 129,800 114,870 6.3 % 13.0 % Interest, fee and bond issue cost amortization expense 69,899 74,413 76,610 -6.1 % -2.9 % Total claims and expenses 3,525,550 4,843,377 4,457,795 -27.2 % 8.6 % INCOME (LOSS) BEFORE TAXES 991,750 (280,921 ) 559,711 453.0 % -150.2 % Income tax expense (benefit) 150,922 (62,254 ) 64,853 342.4 % -196.0 % NET INCOME (LOSS) $ 840,828 $ (218,667 ) $ 494,858 484.5 % -144.2 % RATIOS: Point Change Point Change Loss ratio 63.2 % 94.0 % 74.4 % (30.8 ) 19.6 Commission and brokerage ratio 22.9 % 23.1 % 22.0 % (0.2 ) 1.1 Other underwriting expense ratio 3.6 % 3.2 % 2.6 % 0.4 0.6 Combined ratio 89.7 % 120.3 % 99.0 % (30.6 ) 21.3 December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2006 2005 2004 Shareholders' equity $ 5,107.7 $ 4,139.7 $ 3,712.5 23.4 % 11.5 % (NM, not meaningful) The Company 2006 results were very strong with net income of $840.8 million compared to a net loss of $218.7 million for 2005. This significant earnings improvement reflects the favorable effect of a benign U.S. hurricane season relative to unprecedented Company and industry hurricane losses experienced in 2005, as well as favorable underlying underwriting fundamentals. 49 Gross written premiums declined for 2006 compared to 2005 as the Company continued its disciplined underwriting and risk management practices. In particular, the Company repositioned its U.S. property reinsurance portfolio resulting in improved pricing, but lower premium volume. The premium volume decline also reflects much lower premiums due to the run-off insurance credit program business and a cut back in treaty casualty writings in response to market softening in many U.S. casualty reinsurance classes. Investment income increased from the growth of the invested asset base and greater income from limited partnership investments. The Company shareholders equity increased by $1.0 billion to $5.1 billion in 2006, principally attributable to the record net income generated during the year. This compares to an increase of $0.4 billion to $4.1 billion in 2005. Revenues. Gross and net written premiums declined 2.6% and 2.4%, respectively, for 2006 compared to 2005, while net premiums earned declined 2.8% in 2006 compared to 2005. The decrease in full year net premiums earned was primarily due to a decline in the U.S. insurance segment of 7.5%, reflective of: i) a reduction in credit business from an auto loan insurance program which is in run-off; and ii) continued reductions in the California workers compensation writings due to competitive market conditions. In addition, net premiums earned for the worldwide reinsurance segments in the aggregate decreased by 1.5% for 2006, reflecting multiple segment level factors, including a significant return premium for a Florida property quota share contract cancelled in 2006, the absence of sizable reinstatement premiums triggered in 2005 from severe catastrophic events, as well as the exercise of continued underwriting disciplines which emphasizes potential profitability over volume. Net investment income increased 20.4% for 2006 compared to 2005, reflecting continued year-over-year growth in invested assets from positive cash flow from operations and a $43.2 million increase in income from limited partnership investments. The average investment portfolio yields for 2006 were 4.6% pre-tax and 4.0% after-tax, slightly higher compared to the prior year. Net realized capital gains were modest in relation to the Company invested asset base, mainly reflecting normal portfolio management activities in response to changes in interest rates and credit spreads. Expenses. The Company incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses ( LAE ) decreased 34.6% in 2006 compared to 2005, primarily due to the relative absence of current year catastrophe losses. The Company loss ratio improvement of 31 points for 2006 compared to 2005 included a 30 point improvement due to the relative absence of current year catastrophes. Commission, brokerage, and tax expenses decreased by 3.5% in 2006 from 2005. The 2.8% decline in earned premiums in 2006 compared to 2005 was the principal driver of the decrease in this directly variable expense. Other underwriting expenses for 2006 increased by 6.3% compared to 2005, all due to growth in corporate non-allocated expenses. The Company effective income tax rate for 2006 was 15.2% compared with the effective tax rate for 2005 of 22.2%, which was impacted by the large catastrophe losses. SEGMENT INFORMATION The Company, through its subsidiaries, operates in five segments: U.S. Reinsurance, U.S. Insurance, Specialty Underwriting, International and Bermuda. The U.S. Reinsurance operation writes property and casualty, treaty and facultative reinsurance, through reinsurance brokers, as well as directly with ceding companies within the U.S. The U.S. Insurance operation writes property and casualty insurance primarily through general agents and 50 surplus lines brokers within the U.S. The Specialty Underwriting operation writes A&H, marine, aviation and surety business within the U.S. and worldwide through brokers and directly with ceding companies. The International operation writes property and casualty reinsurance through Everest Re branches in Canada and Singapore, in addition to foreign business written through Everest Re Miami and New Jersey offices. The Bermuda operation provides reinsurance and insurance to worldwide property and casualty markets and reinsurance to life insurers through brokers and directly with ceding companies from its Bermuda office and reinsurance to the United Kingdom and European markets through its UK branch. These segments are managed in a carefully coordinated fashion with strong elements of central control, with respect to pricing, risk management, control of aggregate exposures to catastrophic events, capital, investments and support operations. Management monitors and evaluates the financial performance of these operating segments based upon their underwriting results. Underwriting results include earned premium less losses and LAE incurred, commission and brokerage expenses and other underwriting expenses and are analyzed using ratios, in particular loss, commission and brokerage and other underwriting expense ratios, which, respectively, divide incurred losses, commissions and brokerage and other underwriting expenses by earned premium. The Company utilizes inter-affiliate reinsurance but such reinsurance generally does not impact segment results, as business is generally reported within the segment in which the business was produced. For selected financial information regarding these segments, see Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The following tables present the relevant underwriting results for the operating segments for the three years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004: U.S. Reinsurance (Dollars in thousands) 2006 2005 2004 Gross written premiums $ 1,336,728 $ 1,386,168 $ 1,478,159 Net written premiums 1,331,677 1,383,690 1,468,466 Premiums earned $ 1,281,055 $ 1,396,133 $ 1,473,545 Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses 851,172 1,479,560 1,168,563 Commission and brokerage 298,111 358,101 373,581 Other underwriting expenses 24,946 23,981 23,390 Underwriting gain (loss) $ 106,826 $ (465,509 ) $ (91,989 ) U.S. Insurance (Dollars in thousands) 2006 2005 2004 Gross written premiums $ 866,294 $ 932,469 $ 1,167,808 Net written premiums 753,324 815,316 1,019,716 Premiums earned $ 761,685 $ 823,015 $ 937,576 Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses 519,904 530,781 658,777 Commission and brokerage 123,087 132,630 130,380 Other underwriting expenses 48,918 51,911 49,277 Underwriting gain $ 69,776 $ 107,693 $ 99,142 51 Specialty Underwriting (Dollars in thousands) 2006 2005 2004 Gross written premiums $ 251,209 $ 314,630 $ 487,072 Net written premiums 243,819 299,316 470,571 Premiums earned $ 244,501 $ 301,454 $ 459,284 Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses 163,925 317,917 302,010 Commission and brokerage 67,829 79,692 129,209 Other underwriting expenses 6,559 6,756 7,068 Underwriting gain (loss) $ 6,188 $ (102,911 ) $ 20,997 International (Dollars in thousands) 2006 2005 2004 Gross written premiums $ 731,745 $ 706,584 $ 687,657 Net written premiums 730,717 704,870 684,390 Premiums earned $ 719,475 $ 683,435 $ 655,694 Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses 382,839 574,653 419,101 Commission and brokerage 180,541 166,968 161,106 Other underwriting expenses 13,830 12,622 11,298 Underwriting gain (loss) $ 142,265 $ (70,808 ) $ 64,189 Bermuda (Dollars in thousands) 2006 2005 2004 Gross written premiums $ 814,894 $ 768,711 $ 883,439 Net written premiums 816,177 768,849 888,345 Premiums earned $ 846,437 $ 759,056 $ 898,983 Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses 516,580 821,406 742,688 Commission and brokerage 213,686 177,456 180,900 Other underwriting expenses 17,193 16,153 13,998 Underwriting gain (loss) $ 98,978 $ (255,959 ) $ (38,603 ) 52 The following table reconciles the underwriting results for the operating segments to income before tax as reported in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income for the three years ended December 31: (Dollars in thousands) 2006 2005 2004 Underwriting gain (loss) $ 424,033 $ (787,494 ) $ 53,736 Net investment income 629,378 522,833 495,908 Net realized capital gains 35,067 90,284 89,614 Net derivative expense (410 ) (2,638 ) (2,660 ) Corporate expenses (26,531 ) (18,377 ) (9,839 ) Interest, fee and bond issue cost amortization expense (69,899 ) (74,413 ) (76,610 ) Other income (expense) 112 (11,116 ) 9,562 Income (loss) before taxes $ 991,750 $ (280,921 ) $ 559,711 CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2006 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2005 Premiums Written. Gross written premiums decreased 2.6% to $4,000.9 million in 2006 from $4,108.6 million in 2005. The Specialty Underwriting operation decreased 20.2% ($63.4 million), driven by a $53.2 million reduction in A&H premiums, as pricing for this business continues to be difficult and a $23.6 million decrease in marine and aviation premiums, partially offset by a $13.4 million increase in surety premiums. The U.S. Insurance operation decreased 7.1% ($66.2 million), mainly reflecting continued reductions in the California workers compensation business and run-off of the credit business. The U.S. Reinsurance operation decreased 3.6% ($49.4 million), principally reflecting a $72.7 million decrease in treaty casualty business, partially offset by a $16.4 million increase in treaty property business and by an $11.6 million increase in facultative business. Partially offsetting these declines was a 6.0% ($46.2 million) increase in the Bermuda operation, reflecting increases in treaty business in the UK, Europe and Bermuda, partially offset by decreased facultative business in Bermuda. The International operation increased 3.6% ($25.2 million), primarily due to a $47.1 million increase in international business written through the Miami and New Jersey offices, representing primarily Latin American business and by a $22.8 million increase in Canadian business, partially offset by a $44.1 million decrease in Asian business. The Company endeavors to write only business that meets its profit criteria; generally, increases and decreases in a line of business or region are the result of changing perceptions of the profit opportunities in the various markets. Ceded premiums decreased to $125.2 million in 2006 from $136.5 million in 2005. Ceded premiums generally relate to specific reinsurance purchased by the U.S. Insurance operation and fluctuate based upon the level of premiums written in the individual reinsured programs. Net written premiums decreased by 2.4% to $3,875.7 million in 2006 from $3,972.0 million in 2005, reflecting the $107.7 million decrease in gross written premiums and the $11.4 million decrease in ceded premiums. Premium Revenues. Net premiums earned decreased by 2.8% to $3,853.2 million in 2006 from $3,963.1 million in 2005. Contributing to this decrease was an 18.9% ($57.0 million) decrease in the Specialty Underwriting operation, an 8.2% ($115.1 million) decrease in the U.S. Reinsurance operation, a 7.5% ($61.3 million) decrease in the U.S. Insurance operation, partially offset by an 11.5% ($87.4 million) increase in the Bermuda operation and a 5.3% ($36.0 million) increase in the International operation. Additional premiums, related to catastrophe business, included in net earned premiums contributed $4.9 million and $81.8 million for 2006 and 2005, respectively. The changes reflect period to period changes in net written premiums and business mix, together with normal variability in earning patterns. Business mix changes occur not only as the Company shifts emphasis between products, lines of business, distribution channels and markets, but also as individual 53 contracts renew or non-renew, almost always with changes in coverage, structure, prices and/or terms and as new contracts are accepted. As premium reporting, earnings, loss and commission characteristics derive from the provisions of individual contracts, the continuous turnover of individual contracts, arising from both strategic shifts and daily underwriting decisions, can and does introduce appreciable variability in various underwriting line items. Changes in estimates of the reporting patterns of ceding companies also affect premiums earned. Expenses Incurred Losses and LAE. The Company loss and LAE reserves reflect estimates of ultimate claim liability. Such estimates are re-evaluated on an ongoing basis, including re-estimates of prior period reserves, taking into consideration all available information and, in particular, recently reported loss and claim experience related to prior periods. The effect of such re-evaluations is recorded in incurred losses for the current period. The following table shows the components of the Company incurred losses and LAE for 2006 and 2005: December 31, 2006 December 31, 2005 (Dollars in millions) Current Year Prior Years Total Incurred Current Year Prior Years Total Incurred All Segments Attritional (a) $ 2,283 .2 $ (243 .3) $ 2,039 .9 $ 2,383 .6 $ (226 .3) $ 2,157 .2 Catastrophes 15 .6 272 .3 287 .9 1,367 .2 118 .5 1,485 .7 A&E - 106 .6 106 .6 - 81 .4 81 .4 Total All segments $ 2,298 .8 $ 135 .6 $ 2,434 .4 $ 3,750 .7 $ (26 .4) $ 3,724 .3 Loss Ratio 59.7 % 3.5 % 63.2 % 94.6 % -0.7 % 94.0 % (a) Attritional losses exclude catastrophe and A&E losses (Some amounts may not reconcile due to rounding.) The Company incurred losses and LAE decreased 34.6% to $2,434.4 million in 2006 from $3,724.3 million in 2005, due to significantly reduced current year catastrophe losses and a reduction in current and prior years attritional losses, partially offset by increased prior years reserve development on catastrophe and A&E losses. Incurred losses and LAE in 2006 reflected ceded losses and LAE of $109.5 million compared to ceded losses and LAE in 2005 of $95.2 million. The Company loss ratio, which is calculated by dividing incurred losses and LAE by current year net premiums earned, improved by 30.8 points to 63.2% over the comparable 2005 period, principally due to a 34.1 point improvement of current year catastrophe losses, partially offset by 4.2 points related to an increase in prior years reserve strengthening. 54 The following table shows the U.S. Reinsurance segment components of incurred losses and LAE for 2006 and 2005: December 31, 2006 December 31, 2005 (Dollars in millions) Current Year Prior Years Total Incurred Current Year Prior Years Total Incurred Attritional $ 683 .6 $ (50 .4) $ 633 .2 $ 824 .3 $ (63 .3) $ 760 .9 Catastrophes 8 .9 181 .7 190 .6 634 .6 72 .5 707 .2 A&E - 27 .4 27 .4 - 11 .5 11 .5 Total segment $ 692 .5 $ 158 .7 $ 851 .2 $ 1,458 .8 $ 20 .7 $ 1,479 .6 Loss Ratio 54.1 % 12.4 % 66.4 % 104.5 % 1.5 % 106.0 % (Some amounts may not reconcile due to rounding.) The U.S. Reinsurance segment incurred losses and LAE decreased 42.5%, or $628.4 million, for 2006 compared to 2005, primarily due to significantly reduced current year catastrophe losses, principally within the treaty property unit and decreased earned premiums. The segment loss ratio improved by 39.6 points from 2005 due to a decrease in catastrophe losses, coupled with an improvement in the overall attritional loss ratio. The segment attritional loss ratio improvement generally results from more favorable current year pricing, principally on the property business. The following table shows the U.S. Insurance segment components of incurred losses and LAE for 2006 and 2005: December 31, 2006 December 31, 2005 (Dollars in millions) Current Year Prior Years Total Incurred Current Year Prior Years Total Incurred Attritional $ 588 .0 $ (68 .5) $ 519 .5 $ 548 .9 $ (19 .5) $ 529 .5 Catastrophes - 0 .4 0 .4 1 .3 - 1 .3 Total segment $ 588 .0 $ (68 .1) $ 519 .9 $ 550 .2 $ (19 .5) $ 530 .8 Loss Ratio 77.2 % -8.9 % 68.3 % 66.9 % -2.4 % 64.5 % (Some amounts may not reconcile due to rounding.) The U.S. Insurance segment incurred losses and LAE decreased 2.0%, or $10.9 million, for 2006 as compared to 2005, primarily due to reduced earned premiums, which related to the continued reduction in the California workers compensation business and run-off of a credit program. The segment loss ratio increased 3.8 points from 2005, primarily due to higher losses on the credit program. 55 The following table shows the Specialty Underwriting segment components of incurred losses and LAE for 2006 and 2005: December 31, 2006 December 31, 2005 (Dollars in millions) Current Year Prior Years Total Incurred Current Year Prior Years Total Incurred Attritional $ 141 .2 $ (38 .2) $ 103 .0 $ 186 .5 $ (33 .0) $ 153 .4 Catastrophes - 60 .9 60 .9 147 .6 16 .9 164 .5 Total segment $ 141 .2 $ 22 .7 $ 163 .9 $ 334 .1 $ (16 .1) $ 317 .9 Loss Ratio 57.7 % 9.3 % 67.0 % 110.8 % -5.4 % 105.5 % (Some amounts may not reconcile due to rounding.) The Specialty Underwriting segment incurred losses and LAE decreased 48.4%, or $154.0 million, for 2006 as compared to 2005, primarily due to decreased catastrophe losses and a reduction in earned premiums across all classes of business. Correspondingly, the segment loss ratio improved by 38.5 points from 2005. The following table shows the International segment components of incurred losses and LAE for 2006 and 2005: December 31, 2006 December 31, 2005 (Dollars in millions) Current Year Prior Years Total Incurred Current Year Prior Years Total Incurred Attritional $ 389 .3 $ (31 .7) $ 357 .5 $ 386 .1 $ (66 .1) $ 319 .9 Catastrophes 6 .7 18 .6 25 .3 237 .8 16 .9 254 .7 Total segment $ 396 .0 $ (13 .1) $ 382 .8 $ 623 .9 $ (49 .2) $ 574 .7 Loss Ratio 55.0 % -1.8 % 53.2 % 91.3 % -7.2 % 84.1 % (Some amounts may not reconcile due to rounding.) The International segment incurred losses and LAE decreased 33.4%, or $191.8 million, for 2006 as compared to 2005, reflecting lower catastrophe losses. The segment loss ratio improved by 30.9 points from 2005, primarily due to reduced current year catastrophe losses incurred in Canada, Asia and international. 56 The following table shows the Bermuda segment components of incurred losses and LAE for 2006 and 2005: December 31, 2006 December 31, 2005 (Dollars in millions) Current Year Prior Years Total Incurred Current Year Prior Years Total Incurred Attritional $ 481 .2 $ (54 .4) $ 426 .7 $ 437 .8 $ (44 .4) $ 393 .5 Catastrophes - 10 .7 10 .7 345 .9 12 .2 358 .0 A&E - 79 .2 79 .2 - 69 .9 69 .9 Total segment $ 481 .2 $ 35 .4 $ 516 .6 $ 783 .7 $ 37 .7 $ 821 .4 Loss Ratio 56.8 % 4.2 % 61.0 % 103.2 % 5.0 % 108.2 % (Some amounts may not reconcile due to rounding.) The Bermuda segment incurred losses and LAE decreased 37.1%, or $304.8 million, for 2006 as compared to 2005. The segment loss ratio improved by 47.2 points from 2005, due to a reduction in catastrophe losses in the current year and an increase in favorable development on prior period attritional reserves, partially offset by A&E reserve strengthening. The net prior year improvement was more than offset by an increase in the current year attritional losses reflecting increased earned premiums and a mix of business shift toward more casualty business. Underwriting Expenses. The Company expense ratio, which is calculated by dividing underwriting expenses by net premiums earned, was 26.5% for 2006 compared to 26.3% for 2005. The following table shows the expense ratios for each of the Company operating segments for 2006 and 2005. Segment Expense Ratios Segment 2006 2005 U.S. Reinsurance 25.3 % 27.3 % U.S. Insurance 22.5 % 22.4 % Specialty Underwriting 30.5 % 28.6 % International 27.0 % 26.3 % Bermuda 27.3 % 25.5 % Segment underwriting expenses decreased by 3.1% to $994.7 million for 2006 from $1,026.3 million in 2005. Commission, brokerage, taxes and fees decreased by $31.6 million, principally due to decreases in premium volume and changes in the mix and of business. Segment other underwriting expenses were $0.1 million for both 2006 and 2005. Contributing to the segment underwriting expense decreases were a 15.5% ($59.0 million) decrease in the U.S. Reinsurance operation, a 14.0% ($12.1 million) decrease in the Specialty Underwriting operation and a 6.8% ($12.5 million) decrease in the U.S. Insurance operation, partially offset by an 19.3% ($37.3 million) increase in the Bermuda operation and an 8.2% ($14.8 million) increase in the International operation. The changes for each operation expenses principally resulted from changes in commission expenses due to changes in premium volume and business mix by class and type and, in some cases, changes in the use of specific reinsurance. The Company combined ratio, which is the sum of the loss and expense ratios, decreased by 30.6 points to 89.7% in 2006 compared to 120.3% in 2005, as a result of lower catastrophe and attritional losses. 57 The following table shows the combined ratios for each of the Company operating segments in 2006 and 2005. The combined ratios for all operations were impacted by the loss and expense ratio variations noted above. Segment Combined Ratios Segment 2006 2005 U.S. Reinsurance 91.7 % 133.3 % U.S. Insurance 90.8 % 86.9 % Specialty Underwriting 97.5 % 134.1 % International 80.2 % 110.4 % Bermuda 88.3 % 133.7 % Investment Results. Net investment income increased 20.4% to $629.4 million in 2006 from $522.8 million in 2005, primarily reflecting the growth in invested assets to $14.0 billion in 2006 from $13.0 billion in 2005 and a $43.2 million increase in investment income from limited partnership investments. Investment income from equity investments in limited partnerships fluctuates from year to year depending on the performance of the individual investments made by the partnerships as well as the movement in the equity markets. Period to period changes in investment income are also impacted by changes in the level and mix of invested assets, prevailing interest rates and price movements in the equity markets. The following table shows the components of net investment income for the years ended as indicated: (Dollars in thousands) 2006 2005 Fixed maturities $ 508,524 $ 496,959 Equity securities 22,281 16,582 Short-term investments 56,845 20,128 Other investment income 60,702 14,591 Total gross investment income 648,352 548,260 Interest credited and other expense (18,974 ) (25,427 ) Total net investment income $ 629,378 $ 522,833 The following table shows a comparison of various investment yields for the year indicated: 2006 2005 Imbedded pre-tax yield of cash and invested assets at December 31 4.6 % 4.5 % Imbedded after-tax yield of cash and invested assets at December 31 4.0 % 3.9 % Annualized pre-tax yield on average cash and invested assets 4.8 % 4.4 % Annualized after-tax yield on average cash and invested assets 4.2 % 3.8 % 58 The Company, because of its historical income orientation, had generally managed its investments to maximize reportable income. Starting in 2004, the Company began investing a portion of its assets in equity securities, principally in response to perceived changes in the relative attractiveness of the debt and equity markets. In 2006, the Company added $330.5 million of equity securities into the overall investment portfolio. The Company also added $180.4 million of other invested assets, principally limited partnerships. The following table provides a comparison of the Company total return by asset class relative to broadly accepted industry benchmarks for 2006 and 2005. 2006 2005 Company's fixed income portfolio total return 4.6 % 3.2 % Lehman bond aggregate index 4.3 % 2.4 % Company's common equity portfolio total return 19.2 % 13.8 % S & P 500 index 15.8 % 4.9 % Company's other invested asset portfolio total return 19.8 % 7.2 % Net realized capital gains of $35.1 million in 2006 emanated from realized capital gains on the Company investments of $49.0 million, resulting principally from gains on equity securities of $34.1 million and fixed maturities of $14.9 million, partially offset by $13.9 million of realized capital losses, resulting principally from losses on equity securities of $11.9 million and fixed maturities of $2.0 million including $14.0 thousand from other than temporary market declines. Net realized capital gains of $90.3 million in 2005, reflected realized capital gains on the Company investments of $106.2 million, including $41.3 million on the sale of interest only strips investments, partially offset by $15.9 million of realized capital losses, which included $7.0 million related to the write-downs in the value of interest only strips deemed to be impaired on an other than temporary basis in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 99-20, Recognition of Interest Income and Impairment on Purchased and Retained Beneficial Interests in Securitized Financial Assets ( EITF 99-20 ). The Company had issued seven equity put options in prior years, which were outstanding at December 31, 2006. These products meet the definition of derivatives under FAS 133. The Company recognized net derivative expense of $0.4 million and $2.6 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively, reflecting changes in the fair value of the equity put options. Corporate, Non-allocated Expenses. Corporate underwriting expenses not allocated to segments were $26.5 million in 2006, compared to $18.4 million in 2005, primarily due to increase in share-based compensation expense. Interest, fees and bond issue cost amortization expense in 2006 and 2005 were $69.9 million and $74.4 million, respectively. Interest, fees and bond issue cost amortization expense in 2006 included $31.1 million related to the senior notes, $37.5 million related to the junior subordinated debt securities, $0.9 million related to the bond issue cost amortization and $0.4 million related to the credit line under the Company revolving credit facilities. Interest, fees and bond issue cost amortization expense in 2005 included $35.5 million related to the senior notes, $37.5 million related to the junior subordinated debt securities, $1.0 million to the bond issue cost amortization and $0.4 million related to the credit line under the Company revolving credit facilities. Interest expense on senior notes decreased due to the retirement on March 15, 2005 of the 8.5% senior notes issued on March 14, 2000. Other income in 2006 was $0.1 million and other expense in 2005 was $11.1 million. The change was primarily due to the fluctuation in foreign currency exchange. 59 Income Taxes. The Company income tax expense is primarily a function of the statutory tax rates and corresponding net income in the jurisdictions where the Company operates, coupled with the impact from tax preferenced investment income. Variations in the effective tax rate generally result from changes in the relative levels of pre-tax income among jurisdictions with different tax rates. The Company recorded income tax expense of $150.9 million in 2006 compared to an income tax benefit of $62.3 million in 2005. The increase was primarily due to the significant change in pre-tax income in 2006 compared to the pre-tax loss in 2005. Net Income (Loss). Net income was $840.8 million in 2006 compared to a net loss of $218.7 million in 2005, primarily caused by much larger catastrophe losses in 2005 than in 2006. YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2005 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004 Premiums Written. Gross written premiums decreased 12.7% to $4,108.6 million in 2005 from $4,704.1 million in 2004 reflecting a disciplined underwriting response to modest reinsurance market softening that affected all segments, resulting in an overall premium decline. Premiums declined 35.4% ($172.4 million) in the Specialty Underwriting operation, primarily due to a $145.4 million decrease in A&H business and a $47.9 million decrease in surety business, partially offset by a $20.9 million increase in marine and aviation business. The U.S. Insurance operation decreased 20.2% ($235.3 million), principally as a result of a $242.6 million decrease in workers compensation, resulting primarily from changes in the California workers compensation market. The Bermuda operation decreased 13.0% ($114.7 million), reflecting declines in individual risk underwritten insurance and reinsurance in Bermuda and in motor business reinsurance in the U.K. The U.S. Reinsurance operation decreased 6.2% ($92.0 million), principally relating to a $173.1 million decrease in treaty casualty business and a $29.3 million decrease in facultative business, partially offset by a $118.9 million increase in treaty property business. The International operation increased 2.8% ($18.9 million), resulting primarily from a $75.0 million increase in Asian business, partially offset by a $43.6 million decrease in international business written through the Miami and New Jersey offices, representing primarily Latin American business and an $11.3 million decrease in Canadian business. Ceded premiums decreased to $136.5 million in 2005 from $172.6 million in 2004, principally resulting from the decrease in gross premiums in the U.S. Insurance operations. Ceded premiums generally relate to specific reinsurance purchased by the U.S. Insurance operation and fluctuate based upon the level of premiums written in the individual reinsured programs. Net written premiums decreased by 12.3% to $3,972.0 million in 2005 from $4,531.5 million in 2004, reflecting the $595.6 million decrease in gross written premiums and the $36.1 million decrease in ceded premiums. Premium Revenues. Net premiums earned decreased by 10.4% to $3,963.1 million in 2005 from $4,425.1 million in 2004. Contributing to this decrease was a 34.4% ($157.8 million) decrease in the Specialty Underwriting operation, a 15.6% ($139.9 million) decrease in the Bermuda operation, a 12.2% ($114.6 million) decrease in the U.S. Insurance operation and a 5.3% ($77.4 million) decrease in the U.S. Reinsurance operation, partially offset by a 4.2% ($27.7 million) increase in the International operation. Partially tempering the decline in net premiums earned in 2005 were $81.8 million of reinstatement premiums of which $64.4 million were due to Hurricanes Katrina and Wilma. Generally, catastrophe reinsurance provides coverage for one event; however, when limits are exhausted, some contractual arrangements provide for the availability of additional coverage upon the payment of additional premium. This additional premium is referred to as reinstatement premium. There were no such reinstatement premiums for 2004. All of these changes reflect period to period changes in net written premiums and business mix, together with normal variability in earnings patterns. Business mix changes occur not only as the Company shifts emphasis between products, lines of business, distribution channels and markets, but also as individual contracts renew or non-renew, almost always with changes in coverage, structure, prices and/or terms, and as new contracts are accepted with coverages, structures, prices and/or terms different from those of expiring contracts. As premium reporting, earnings, loss and commission characteristics derive from the provisions of individual contracts, the continuous turnover of individual 60 contracts, arising from both strategic shifts and day to day underwriting, can and does introduce appreciable background variability in various underwriting line items. Changes in estimates related to the reporting patterns of ceding companies also affect premiums earned. Expenses Incurred Losses and LAE. The Company loss and LAE reserves reflect estimates of ultimate claim liability. Such estimates are re-evaluated on an ongoing basis, including re-estimates of prior period reserves, taking into consideration all available information and, in particular, newly reported loss and claim experience. The effect of such re-evaluations impacts incurred losses for the current period. The following table shows the components of the Company incurred losses and LAE for 2005 and 2004: December 31, 2005 December 31, 2004 (Dollars in millions) Current Year Prior Years Total Incurred Current Year Prior Years Total Incurred All Segments Attritional (a) $ 2,383 .6 $ (226 .3) $ 2,157 .2 $ 2,612 .9 $ 128 .7 $ 2,741 .7 Catastrophes 1,367 .2 118 .5 1,485 .7 428 .8 (38 .7) 390 .0 A&E - 81 .4 81 .4 - 159 .4 159 .4 Total All segments $ 3,750 .7 $ (26 .4) $ 3,724 .3 $ 3,041 .7 $ 249 .4 $ 3,291 .1 Loss Ratio 94.6 % -0.7 % 94.0 % 68.7 % 5.6 % 74.4 % (a) Attritional losses exclude catastrophe and A&E losses (Some amounts may not reconcile due to rounding.) The Company incurred losses and LAE increased by 13.2% to $3,724.3 million in 2005 from $3,291.1 million in 2004. The increase in incurred losses and LAE was principally attributable to the increase in estimated losses due to property catastrophes, partially offset by favorable attritional prior period reserve development and a lower level of earned premiums. Incurred losses and LAE in 2005 reflected ceded losses and LAE of $95.2 million compared to ceded losses and LAE in 2004 of $141.0 million. The Company loss ratio, which is calculated by dividing incurred losses and LAE by net premiums earned, increased by 19.6 percentage points to 94.0% in 2005 from 74.4% in 2004. This 19.6 point year over year loss ratio increase was primarily the result of a 28.7 point increase due to catastrophe losses, partially offset by a 10.2 point improvement in attritional and A&E prior year reserve development. Incurred losses and LAE include catastrophe losses, which include the impact of both current period events and favorable and unfavorable development on prior period events and are net of reinsurance. Individual catastrophe losses are reported net of specific reinsurance, but before recoveries under corporate level reinsurance and potential incurred but not reported ( IBNR ) loss reserve offsets. Catastrophe losses, net of contract specific cessions, were $1,485.7 million in 2005, related principally to aggregate estimated losses driven by Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma with catastrophe losses of $765.9 million, $151.0 million and $381.6 million, respectively, but also reflected catastrophe losses related to hurricanes Emily ($19.8 million) and Dennis ($7.0 million), floods in India ($13.2 million), Calgary ($9.6 million) and Europe ($6.2 million) and storms in Ontario ($12.9 million). The 2005 results also reflect net unfavorable reserve development on 2004 and prior catastrophes of $118.5 million. Catastrophe losses, net of contract specific cessions, were $390.0 million in 2004, related principally to aggregate estimated losses of $428.8 million from Hurricanes Charley, Frances, Ivan and Jeanne, Pacific typhoons, Edmonton hailstorms and the Asian tsunami, which were partially offset by $33.4 million of reserve reductions related to the 2001 World Trade Center losses. 61 Net favorable prior period reserve adjustments for the year ended December 31, 2005 were $26.4 million compared to net unfavorable prior period reserve adjustments of $249.4 million in 2004. For the year ended December 31, 2005, the favorable reserve adjustments included net favorable attritional reserve adjustments of $226.3 million related primarily to property business classes, partially offset by net unfavorable prior period catastrophe adjustments of $118.5 million related primarily to the 2004 hurricanes and net unfavorable A&E adjustments of $81.4 million. For the year ended December 31, 2004, the unfavorable prior period reserve adjustments included net unfavorable A&E adjustments of $159.4 million and net unfavorable attritional development of approximately $128.7 million relating primarily to casualty reinsurance. Partially offsetting the 2004 unfavorable development was $38.7 million of favorable catastrophe development principally related to the reduction of reserves for the World Trade Center events. It is important to note that attritional reserve development arises from the re-evaluation of accident year results and that such re-evaluations may also impact premiums and commissions attributed by accident year, generally mitigating, in part, the impact of loss developments and that such impacts are recorded as part of the overall reserve evaluation process. Aggregate reserve development related to A&E exposures was $81.4 million and $159.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The Company has A&E exposure related to contracts written by the Company prior to 1986 and to claim obligations acquired as part of the Mt. McKinley acquisition in September 2000. The reserve strengthening on business written by the Company, net of reinsurance, was $11.5 million and the net strengthening on the acquired Mt. McKinley business was $69.9 million in 2005. Substantially all of the Company A&E exposures relate to insurance and reinsurance contracts with coverage periods prior to 1986. Given the uncertainties surrounding the settlement of A&E losses, management is unable to establish a meaningful range for these obligations. The following table shows the U.S. Reinsurance segment components of incurred losses and LAE for 2005 and 2004: December 31, 2005 December 31, 2004 (Dollars in millions) Current Year Prior Years Total Incurred Current Year Prior Years Total Incurred Attritional $ 824 .3 $ (63 .3) $ 760 .9 $ 805 .4 $ 102 .2 $ 907 .6 Catastrophes 634 .6 72 .5 707 .2 285 .5 (34 .8) 250 .7 A&E - 11 .5 11 .5 - 10 .3 10 .3 Total segment $ 1,458 .8 $ 20 .7 $ 1,479 .6 $ 1,090 .9 $ 77 .7 $ 1,168 .6 Loss Ratio 104.5 % 1.5 % 106.0 % 74.0 % 5.3 % 79.3 % (Some amounts may not reconcile due to rounding.) The U.S. Reinsurance segment incurred losses and LAE increased 26.6%, or $311.0 million, for 2005 as compared to 2004. The segment loss ratio increased by 26.7 points over 2004 due to current year catastrophe losses and unfavorable prior period catastrophe reserve adjustments, partially offset by favorable attritional loss development. The prior years unfavorable loss development for the year ended December 31, 2004 was primarily attributable to a proliferation of claims related to bankruptcies and other financial management improprieties during the late 1990 and early 2000. This increased number of claims, combined with larger claims, had significantly increased incurred losses on the professional liability policies. In the general casualty area, the Company continued to experience losses greater than historical trends for accident years 1998 through 2001. 62 The following table shows the U.S. Insurance segment components of incurred losses and LAE for 2005 and 2004: December 31, 2005 December 31, 2004 (Dollars in millions) Current Year Prior Years Total Incurred Current Year Prior Years Total Incurred Attritional $ 548 .9 $ (19 .5) $ 529 .5 $ 614 .5 $ 43 .3 $ 657 .8 Catastrophes 1 .3 - 1 .3 1 .0 - 1 .0 Total segment $ 550 .2 $ (19 .5) $ 530 .8 $ 615 .5 $ 43 .3 $ 658 .8 Loss Ratio 66.9 % -2.4 % 64.5 % 65.6 % 4.6 % 70.3 % (Some amounts may not reconcile due to rounding.) The U.S. Insurance segment incurred losses and LAE decreased 19.4%, or $128.0 million, for 2005 as compared to 2004. The segment loss ratio improved by 5.8 points from 2004 primarily due to favorable prior period adjustments principally on the California workers compensation business for the 2004 accident year as the results of benefit reform have become clearer and the 2004 unfavorable prior period reserve adjustments related principally to the casualty classes for accident years 2000 through 2002, where the Company strengthened its reserves for California workers compensation insurance. While management believes the cumulative results through 2005 remain quite positive, there was some deterioration in claim frequency and severity related to accident years 2001 and 2002. The following table shows the Specialty Underwriting segment components of incurred losses and LAE for 2005 and 2004: December 31, 2005 December 31, 2004 (Dollars in millions) Current Year Prior Years Total Incurred Current Year Prior Years Total Incurred Attritional $ 186 .5 $ (33 .0) $ 153 .4 $ 279 .6 $ 3 .6 $ 283 .2 Catastrophes 147 .6 16 .9 164 .5 17 .3 1 .5 18 .8 Total segment $ 334 .1 $ (16 .1) $ 317 .9 $ 296 .9 $ 5 .1 $ 302 .0 Loss Ratio 110.8 % -5.4 % 105.5 % 64.6 % 1.1 % 65.8 % (Some amounts may not reconcile due to rounding.) The Specialty Underwriting segment incurred losses and LAE increased 5.3%, or $15.9 million, for 2005 as compared to 2004, due to the significant catastrophe losses in 2005 and development of catastrophes from prior years. The segment loss ratio increased by 39.7 points over 2004, primarily due to increased catastrophe losses, however was partially offset by favorable attritional loss development on the marine, aviation, surety and A&H classes of business. 63 The following table shows the International segment components of incurred losses and LAE for 2005 and 2004: December 31, 2005 December 31, 2004 (Dollars in millions) Current Year Prior Years Total Incurred Current Year Prior Years Total Incurred Attritional $ 386 .1 $ (66 .1) $ 319 .9 $ 346 .5 $ (13 .3) $ 333 .2 Catastrophes 237 .8 16 .9 254 .7 87 .6 (1 .7) 85 .9 Total segment $ 623 .9 $ (49 .2) $ 574 .7 $ 434 .1 $ (15 .1) $ 419 .1 Loss Ratio 91.3 % -7.2 % 84.1 % 66.2 % -2.3 % 63.9 % (Some amounts may not reconcile due to rounding.) The International segment incurred losses and LAE increased 37.1%, or $155.6 million, for 2005 as compared to 2004. The segment loss ratio increased by 20.2 points over 2004, primarily reflective of the significant property catastrophe losses in 2005 and development on prior years catastrophes, partially offset by an improvement in attritional prior year reserves on the Canadian, Asian and international business. The following table shows the Bermuda segment components of incurred losses and LAE for 2005 and 2004: December 31, 2005 December 31, 2004 (Dollars in millions) Current Year Prior Years Total Incurred Current Year Prior Years Total Incurred Attritional $ 437 .8 $ (44 .4) $ 393 .5 $ 566 .9 $ (6 .9) $ 560 .0 Catastrophes 345 .9 12 .2 358 .0 37 .4 (3 .8) 33 .6 A&E - 69 .9 69 .9 - 149 .1 149 .1 Total segment $ 783 .7 $ 37 .7 $ 821 .4 $ 604 .3 $ 138 .4 $ 742 .7 Loss Ratio 103.2 % 5.0 % 108.2 % 67.2 % 15.4 % 82.6 % (Some amounts may not reconcile due to rounding.) The Bermuda segment incurred losses and LAE increased 10.6%, or $78.7 million, for 2005 as compared to 2004. The segment loss ratio increased by 25.6 points over 2004, reflecting catastrophe losses in 2005 and prior period catastrophe development, partially offset by favorable prior period attritional reserves, primarily from the UK branch produced business. The A&E reserve development for both 2005 and 2004 primarily related to asbestos exposures that were assumed through the September 19, 2000 loss portfolio transfer from Mt. McKinley. Underwriting Expenses. The Company expense ratio, which is calculated by dividing underwriting expenses by net premiums earned, was 26.3% for 2005 compared to 24.6% for 2004. 64 The following table shows the expense ratios for each of the Company operating segments for 2005 and 2004. Segment Expense Ratios Segment 2005 2004 U.S. Reinsurance 27.3 % 26.9 % U.S. Insurance 22.4 % 19.1 % Specialty Underwriting 28.6 % 29.6 % International 26.3 % 26.3 % Bermuda 25.5 % 21.7 % Segment underwriting expenses decreased by 5.0% to $1,026.3 million in 2005 from $1,080.2 million in 2004. Commission, brokerage, taxes and fees decreased by $60.3 million, principally reflecting decreases in premium volume and changes in the mix of business. Segment other underwriting expenses increased by $6.4 million as the Company continued to expand operations. Contributing to the segment underwriting expense decreases were a 36.6% ($49.8 million) decrease in the Specialty Underwriting operation, a 3.8% ($14.9 million) decrease in the U.S. Reinsurance operation and a 0.7% ($1.3 million) decrease in the Bermuda operation, partially offset by a 4.2% ($7.2 million) increase in the International operation and a 2.7% ($4.9 million) increase in the U.S. Insurance operation. The changes for each operation expenses principally resulted from changes in commission expenses related to changes in premium volume and business mix by class and type and, in some cases, changes in the use of specific reinsurance, as well as the underwriting performance of the underlying business. The Company combined ratio, which is the sum of the loss and expense ratios, increased by 21.3 percentage points to 120.3% in 2005 as compared to 99.0% in 2004, with the increase principally resulting from elevated catastrophe losses, partially offset by improved prior year development. The following table shows the combined ratios for each of the Company operating segments in 2005 and 2004. The combined ratios for all operations were impacted by the loss and expense ratio variability noted above. Segment Combined Ratios Segment 2005 2004 U.S. Reinsurance 133.3 % 106.2 % U.S. Insurance 86.9 % 89.4 % Specialty Underwriting 134.1 % 95.4 % International 110.4 % 90.2 % Bermuda 133.7 % 104.3 % Investment Results. Net investment income increased 5.4% to $522.8 million in 2005 from $495.9 million in 2004, reflecting growth in invested assets tempered by lower investment yields and lower returns from limited partnership investments. Investable assets increased by $1.4 billion to $13.0 billion in 2005, principally reflecting the effects of investing $1,070.6 million cash flow from operations during the year and $758.2 million net proceeds from issuance of common shares, partially offset by $250.0 million in debt repayment. The lower investment yield reflects the Company elevated short-term investments following its common share capital raising in the fourth quarter, which also reduced the investment income portfolio duration. Investment income for the limited partnerships for the year ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 was $11.5 million and $41.8 million, respectively. 65 The following table shows the components of net investment income for the years ended as indicated: (Dollars in thousands) 2005 2004 Fixed maturities $ 496,959 $ 475,906 Equity securities 16,582 8,453 Short-term investments 20,128 6,913 Other investment income 14,591 44,126 Total gross investment income 548,260 535,398 Interest credited and other expense (25,427 ) (39,490 ) Total net investment income $ 522,833 $ 495,908 The following table shows a comparison of various investment yields for the years indicated: 2005 2004 Imbedded pre-tax yield of cash and invested assets at December 31 4.5 % 4.7 % Imbedded after-tax yield of cash and invested assets at December 31 3.9 % 4.1 % Annualized pre-tax yield on average cash and invested assets 4.4 % 5.0 % Annualized after-tax yield on average cash and invested assets 3.8 % 4.2 % The Company, because of its historical income orientation, has generally considered total return, the combination of income yield and capital appreciation/depreciation, to be relatively less important as a measure of performance than its overall income yield. However, in 2005, with changes the Company perceived in overall investment market conditions, the Company continued to reweight its view of total return and added $350.4 million in 2005 of equity securities into the overall investment portfolio. The Company also added $125.2 million of other invested assets, principally limited partnerships. The following table provides a comparison of the Company total return by asset class relative to broadly accepted industry benchmarks for 2005 and 2004. 2005 2004 Company's fixed income portfolio total return 3.2 % 6.5 % Lehman bond aggregate index 2.4 % 4.3 % Company's common equity portfolio total return 13.8 % 21.9 % S & P 500 index 4.9 % 10.9 % Company's other invested asset portfolio total return 7.2 % 43.2 % The Company net realized capital gains were $90.3 million in 2005, which reflected realized capital gains on the Company investments of $106.2 million, including $41.3 million on the sale of interest only strips investments, partially offset by $15.9 million of realized capital losses, which included $7.0 million related to the write-downs in the value of interest only strips deemed to be impaired on an other than temporary basis in accordance with EITF 99-20. Net realized capital gains were $89.6 million in 2004, which reflected realized capital gains on the Company investments of $164.3 million, including $118.2 million on the sale of interest only strip investments, partially offset by $74.7 million of realized capital losses, which included $65.0 million related to the write-downs in the value of interest only strips deemed to be impaired on an other than temporary basis in accordance with EITF 99-20. The Company has issued seven equity put options in its product portfolio at December 31, 2005, which were outstanding. These products meet the definition of a derivative under Financial Accounting Standards No. 133. The Company recognized net derivative expense of $2.6 million and $2.7 million in 2005 and 2004, 66 respectively, reflecting changes in fair value for the equity put options. See also Note 2 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Corporate, Non-allocated Expenses. Corporate underwriting expenses not allocated to segments were $18.4 million for 2005 as compared to $9.8 million for 2004 as the Company expanded its infrastructure to support operations. Interest, fees and bond issue cost amortization expense in 2005 and 2004 were $74.4 million and $76.6 million, respectively. Interest, fees and bond issue cost amortization expense in 2005 included $35.5 million related to the senior notes, $37.5 million related to the junior subordinated debt securities, $1.0 million related to the bond issue cost amortization and $0.4 million related to the credit line under the Company revolving credit facilities. Interest, fees and bond issue cost amortization expense in 2004 included $41.9 million related to the senior notes, $32.4 million related to the junior subordinated debt securities, $1.1 million related to the bond issue cost amortization and $1.2 million related to the credit line under the Company revolving credit facilities. The lower interest expense on the senior notes was due to the retirement of the 8.5% senior notes due March 15, 2005, partially offset by the issuance of new 5.4% senior notes on October 12, 2004. Other expense in 2005 was $11.1 million compared to other income of $9.6 million in 2004. The change in net other expense for 2005 from net other income in 2004 was primarily due to variability in the impact of foreign exchange. Income Taxes. The Company income tax expense is primarily a function of the statutory tax rates and corresponding net income in the jurisdictions where the Company operates, coupled with the impact from tax preferenced investment income. Variations generally reflect changes in the relative levels of pre-tax income between jurisdictions with different tax rates, and specifically for 2005, also reflected the significant increase in incurred losses relating to catastrophes resulting, ultimately, in a pre-tax loss for the year. The Company recognized income tax benefits of $62.3 million in 2005 compared to income tax expense of $64.9 million in 2004 . The 2004 tax expense was impacted by various issues, including the transfer of the Company UK branch to Bermuda Re, giving rise to a net tax expense. Net (Loss) Income. Net loss was $218.7 million in 2005 compared to net income of $494.9 million in 2004, with the change primarily reflecting reduced underwriting profitability due to catastrophe losses, partially offset by favorable prior period reserve development, related tax benefits and improved investment income. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The following is a summary of the critical accounting policies related to accounting estimates that (1) require management to make assumptions about highly uncertain matters and (2) could materially impact the consolidated financial statements if management made different assumptions. LOSS AND LAE RESERVES. The Company most critical accounting policy is the determination of its loss and LAE reserves. The Company maintains reserves equal to its estimated ultimate liability for losses and LAE with respect to reported and unreported claims relating to both its insurance and reinsurance businesses. Because reserves are based on estimates of ultimate losses and LAE by underwriting or accident year, management, uses a variety of statistical and actuarial techniques to monitor reserve adequacy over time and evaluates new information as it becomes known and adjusts reserves whenever an adjustment appears warranted. Management considers many factors when setting reserves, including: (1) the Company exposure base, generally its projected ultimate premiums earned; (2) its expected loss ratios by product and class categories as determined through extensive interaction between its underwriters and actuaries; (3) actuarial methodologies which analyze the Company loss reporting and payment experience, information from ceding companies and historical trends, such as reserving patterns, loss payments and product mix; (4) current legal interpretations of coverage and liability; (5) economic conditions; and (6) the uncertainties discussed below regarding reserve requirements 67 for asbestos and environmental (A&E) claims. Based on these considerations, management believes that adequate provision has been made for the Company insurance and reinsurance loss and LAE reserves. Actual losses and LAE ultimately paid may deviate, perhaps substantially, from such reserves, impacting income in the period in which the change in estimated ultimate loss projections is recorded. See also Note 1 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company notes that there generally is more uncertainty in establishing loss reserves for reinsurance liabilities than for insurance liabilities. At December 31, 2006 the Company had reinsurance reserves of $6,720.7 million and insurance loss reserves of $2,119.4 million, of which $260.4 million and $320.5 million, respectively, were loss reserves for A&E liabilities. A detailed discussion of additional considerations related to A&E exposures follows later in this section. The detailed data required to evaluate ultimate losses for insurance business is accumulated from the Company underwriting and claim systems. Reserving for reinsurance requires evaluation of loss information received from ceding companies. Ceding companies report losses to the Company in many forms dependent on the type of contract and the negotiated reporting requirements. Generally, proportional/quota share contracts require the submission of a monthly/quarterly account, which includes premium and loss settlement activity for the period with corresponding reserves as established by the ceding company. This information is recorded into the Company records. For certain proportional contracts, there is also an individual loss reporting clause, which requires a detailed loss report on claims that exceed a certain dollar threshold or relate to a particular type of loss. Excess of loss and facultative contracts generally require individual loss reporting with precautionary notices generally sent when losses reach a significant percentage of the attachment point of the contract or when certain causes of loss or types of injury occur. All individual loss reports and supporting claim information are managed by the Company experienced claims staff. Based on its own evaluation of the claim, the Company may choose to establish additional case reserves (ACRs) as a supplement above the case reserves reported by the ceding company. To ensure ceding companies are submitting required and accurate data, the Underwriting, Claim, Reinsurance Accounting and Internal Audit departments of the Company perform various reviews of the ceding carriers, particularly larger ceding companies. Both reinsurance and insurance reserves are categorized into exposure groupings for actuarial analysis. The exposure groupings are selected in such that the underlying exposures have reasonably homogeneous loss development characteristics but are large enough to make the estimation of ultimate losses credible. The selection of exposure groupings is reviewed periodically and may change over time as the Company business changes. The Company currently uses over 200 exposure groupings to develop its reserve estimates. One of the key selection characteristics for the exposure groupings is the length of time it historically takes to report and settle claims. Claims that are reported and settled relatively quickly are commonly referred to as short tail lines and principally derive from property coverages. Casualty claims on the other hand tend to take longer to be reported and settled and are generally referred to as long tail lines. Shorter tail lines are generally subject to less volatility in the ultimate loss estimation and re-estimation process than longer tail lines. The same accepted actuarial methodologies, such as Borhuetter-Ferguson, expected loss ratio and chain ladder reserving methods, supplemented by judgment where appropriate, are used to develop an estimate of ultimate losses and LAE for each exposure group. Although the same actuarial methodologies are used for both short tail and long tail lines, the faster reporting of experience for the short tail lines allows for earlier reliance on the estimates derived from the reported loss experience based methods than is possible for the long tail lines, for which, consequently, reliance must be placed on the exposure based estimates. For both short and long tail lines, these general approaches are supplemented by judgment in determining the ultimate losses and LAE for each exposure group. Projected losses from widespread catastrophic events, such as hurricanes, generally cannot be estimated using traditional actuarial models. The loss estimates for these types of events are judgmentally established based on available information derived from the Company quantitative and qualitative exposure analyses, reports and communications from ceding companies and management 68 judgment. Due to the inherent uncertainty in estimating such losses, these estimates are subject to variability, the potential for which increases with the severity and complexity of the underlying event. There are no explicit provisions for reserve uncertainty imbedded in the key actuarial assumptions or added to the actuarially determined reserves. In situations where historical results have been volatile or the class of business is new and immature, the Company actuaries ultimate reserve selections may implicitly include a provision for uncertainty, but this is not significant in relation to the entire reserve balance and is not separately captured on a quantitative basis. The amount of carried reserves at the end of each reporting period is the amount of projected ultimate losses and LAE, reduced by the cumulative amount paid. Similarly, IBNR reserves are determined by subtracting case reserves and ACRs from total loss reserves. Detailed reserve studies for each exposure group are completed once a year for reinsurance and quarterly for insurance. The completed annual reinsurance reserve studies are rolled forward for each accounting period until the subsequent reserve study is completed. The roll forward analysis includes a comparison of actual reported losses to actuarially expected losses. Any significant variance between actual and expected losses is investigated and appropriate adjustments recorded. For the years presented, there were no significant changes in the key actuarial methodologies and procedures used to project ultimate losses and therefore, loss reserve changes principally result from changes in managements estimates of ultimate losses from amounts reported in prior periods. Given the inherent variability in loss reserves, the Company has developed an estimated range of possible gross reserve levels. This table of ranges by segment, accompanied by commentary on potential and historical variability, is included in Financial Condition under Loss and LAE Reserves. The ranges are statistically developed using the same exposure groups used in the reserve setting process and aggregated to the segment level. The starting point for developing the ranges is the reported reserves, which reflect the Company best estimate of ultimate unpaid losses. For each exposure group, the Company calculates a range for each year reflecting actuarial judgment for two variables. The first is the historical pattern of ratios of IBNR to premiums earned at the level of the underlying business maturity relative to its ultimate expected outcome. The second is the uncertainty associated with the underlying business position within its underwriting cycle. The ranges by year are then aggregated to develop a range for the exposure group taking into account correlations that exist. The exposure groups are then aggregated to segment, again accounting for existing correlations. The Company notes that its presentation of this information is not directly comparable to similar presentations of other companies as there are no consistently applied actuarial or accounting standards governing such presentations. The Company further notes that its recorded reserves reflect the Company best point estimate of its liabilities and that its actuarial methodologies focus on such point estimates around which ranges are subsequently developed. ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURES. The Company continues to receive claims under expired contracts, both insurance and reinsurance, asserting alleged injuries and/or damages relating to or resulting from environmental pollution and hazardous substances, including asbestos. The Company environmental claims typically involve potential liability for (a) the mitigation or remediation of environmental contamination or (b) bodily injury or property damages caused by the release of hazardous substances into the land, air or water. The Company asbestos claims typically involve potential liability for bodily injury from exposure to asbestos or for property damage resulting from asbestos or products containing asbestos. The Company reserves include an estimate of the Company ultimate liability for A&E claims. This estimate is made based on judgmental assessment of the underlying exposures as the result of: (1) long and variable reporting delays, both from insureds to insurance companies and from ceding companies to reinsurers; (2) historical data, which is more limited and variable on A&E losses than historical information on other types of casualty claims; and (3) unique aspects of A&E exposures for which ultimate value cannot be estimated using traditional reserving techniques. There are significant uncertainties in estimating the amount of the Company 69 potential losses from A&E claims. Among the uncertainties are: (a) potentially long waiting periods between exposure and manifestation of any bodily injury or property damage; (b) difficulty in identifying sources of asbestos or environmental contamination; (c) difficulty in properly allocating responsibility and/or liability for asbestos or environmental damage; (d) changes in underlying laws and judicial interpretation of those laws; (e) the potential for an asbestos or environmental claim to involve many insurance providers over many policy periods; (f) questions concerning interpretation and application of insurance and reinsurance coverage; and (g) uncertainty regarding the number and identity of insureds with potential asbestos or environmental exposure. With respect to asbestos claims in particular, several additional factors have emerged in recent years that further compound the difficulty in estimating the Company liability. These developments include: (a) the significant growth over a short period of time in the number of claims filed, in part reflecting a much more aggressive plaintiff bar and including claims against defendants who may only have a peripheral connection to asbestos; (b) a disproportionate percentage of claims filed by individuals with no functional injury, which should have little to no financial value but that have increasingly been considered in jury verdicts and settlements; (c) the growth in the number and significance of bankruptcy filings by companies as a result of asbestos claims (including, more recently, bankruptcy filings in which companies attempt to resolve their asbestos liabilities in a manner that is prejudicial to insurers and forecloses insurers from participating in the negotiation of asbestos related bankruptcy reorganization plans); (d) the concentration of claims in a small number of states that favor plaintiffs; (e) the growth in the number of claims that might impact the general liability portion of insurance policies rather than the product liability portion; (f) measures adopted by specific courts to ameliorate the worst procedural abuses; (g) an increase in settlement values being paid to asbestos claimants, especially those with cancer or functional impairment; (h) legislation in some states to address asbestos litigation issues; and (i) the potential that other states or the U.S. Congress may adopt legislation on asbestos litigation. Anecdotal evidence suggests that new claims filing rates have decreased, that new filings of asbestos-driven bankruptcies have decreased and that various procedural and legislative reforms are beginning to diminish the potential ultimate liability for asbestos losses. Management believes that these uncertainties and factors continue to render reserves for A&E and particularly asbestos losses significantly less subject to traditional actuarial analysis than reserves for other types of losses. Given these uncertainties, management believes that no meaningful range for such ultimate losses can be established. The Company establishes reserves to the extent that, in the judgment of management, the facts and prevailing law reflect an exposure for the Company or its ceding companies. The Company A&E liabilities stem from Mt. McKinley direct insurance business and Everest Re assumed reinsurance business. In connection with the acquisition of Mt. McKinley, which has significant exposure to A&E claims, LM provided reinsurance to Mt. McKinley covering 80% ($160.0 million) of the first $200.0 million of any adverse development of Mt. McKinley reserves as of September 19, 2000 and The Prudential guaranteed LM obligations to Mt. McKinley. Cessions under this reinsurance agreement exhausted the limit available under the contract at December 31, 2003. Due to the uncertainties discussed above, the ultimate losses attributable to A&E, and particularly asbestos, may be subject to more variability than are non-A&E reserves and such variation could have a material adverse effect on the Company financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows. See also Notes 1 and 3 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. With respect to Mt. McKinley, where the Company has a direct relationship with policyholders, the Company aggressive litigation posture and the uncertainties inherent in the asbestos coverage and bankruptcy litigation have provided an opportunity to actively engage in settlement negotiations with a number of those policyholders who have potentially significant asbestos liabilities. Those discussions are oriented towards achieving reasonable negotiated settlements that limit Mt. McKinley liability to a given policyholder to a sum certain. Because of uncertainties and risks inherent in litigation, the Company cannot be certain that in every instance 70 this approach will lead to negotiated settlements in the range expected by the Company. Between 2004 and 2006, the Company concluded such settlements or reached agreement in principle with 14 of its high profile policyholders. The Company currently has identified 8 policyholders based on their past claim activity and/or potential future liabilities as High Profile Policyholders and its settlement efforts are generally directed at such policyholders, in part because their exposures have developed to the point where both the policyholder and the Company have sufficient information to be motivated to settle. The Company believes that this active approach will ultimately result in a more cost-effective liquidation of Mt. McKinley liabilities than a passive approach, although it may also introduce additional variability in Mt. McKinley losses and cash flows as reserves are adjusted to reflect the developments in litigation, negotiations and, ultimately, potential settlements. There is less potential for similar settlements with respect to the Company reinsurance asbestos claims. Ceding companies, with their direct obligation to insureds and overall responsibility for claim settlements, are not consistently aggressive in developing claim settlement information and conveying this information to reinsurers, which can introduce significant and perhaps inappropriate delays in the reporting of asbestos claims/exposures to reinsurers. These delays not only extend the timing of reinsurance claim settlements, but also restrict the information available to estimate the reinsurers ultimate exposure. See the discussion below under the heading Financial Condition Loss and LAE Reserves . REINSURANCE RECEIVABLES. The Company purchases reinsurance to reduce its exposure to large claims and catastrophic loss occurrences. These agreements provide for recovery from reinsurers of a portion of losses and loss expenses under certain circumstances without relieving the insurer of its obligation to the policyholder. In the event reinsurers were unable to meet their obligations under these agreements or were able to successfully challenge losses ceded by the Company under the contracts, the Company would not be able to realize the full value of the reinsurance recoverable balance. In some cases, the Company may hold partial collateral for the receivable, including letters of credit, trust assets and cash. Additionally, creditworthy foreign reinsurers of business written in the U.S. are generally required to secure their obligations. The Company establishes reserves for uncollectible balances based on management assessment of the collectibility of the outstanding balances. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, the reserve for uncollectible balances was $87.0 million and $25.0 million, respectively. To minimize exposure from uncollectible reinsurance receivables, the Company has a reinsurance credit security committee that generally evaluates the financial strength of a reinsurer prior to entering into a reinsurance arrangement. Management believes that adequate provision has been made for the Company uncollectible balances. Actual uncollectible amounts may vary, perhaps substantially, from such reserves, impacting income in the period in which the change in reserves is made. See also Note 1 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Financial Condition Reinsurance Receivables below. PREMIUMS WRITTEN AND EARNED. Premiums written by the Company are earned ratably over the coverage periods of the related insurance and reinsurance contracts or policies. Unearned premium reserves are established to cover the remainder of the unexpired contract period. Such reserves are established based upon reports received from ceding companies or computed using pro rata methods based on statistical data. Premiums earned, and the related costs, which have not yet been reported to the Company, are estimated and accrued. Because of the inherent lag in the reporting of written and earned premiums by the Company ceding companies, standard accepted actuarial methodologies are used to estimate earned but not reported premium at each financial reporting date. These earned but not reported premiums are combined with reported earned premiums to comprise the exposure base for determining the Company incurred losses and loss and LAE reserves. Commission expense and incurred losses related to the change in earned but not reported premium are included in current period company and segment financial results. See also Note 1 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 71 The following table displays the estimated components of earned but not reported premiums by segment at December 31 for the years indicated: (Dollars in thousands) Earned But Not Reported Premium By Segment 2006 2005 2004 U.S. Reinsurance $ 426,238 $ 549,866 $ 485,880 U.S. Insurance 16,474 21,267 38,487 Specialty Underwriting 85,243 84,963 136,687 International 199,852 225,664 216,632 Bermuda 160,581 121,147 233,940 Total $ 888,388 $ 1,002,908 $ 1,111,626 INVESTMENT VALUATION. The Company investment portfolio consists of fixed income investments classified for accounting purposes as available for sale and equity securities. Accordingly, these securities are marked to market on a quarterly basis. Most securities are traded on national exchanges where market values are readily available. The Company holds some privately placed securities, less than 0.5% of the portfolio, that are either valued by an investment advisor or by the Company using cash flow projections. At December 31, 2006, the Company investment portfolio included $442.5 million of limited partnership investments whose value are reported pursuant to the equity method of accounting, which management believes approximates market value. In 2005, the Company owned interest only strips that were accounted for in accordance with EITF 99-20, which sets forth the rules for determining when these securities must be written down to fair value due to impairment. Unrealized gains and losses from market fluctuations are reflected as comprehensive income, while market value declines that are considered other than temporary impairments are reflected in the income statement as realized capital losses. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, the Company had unrealized gains net of tax of $302.9 million and $214.6 million, respectively. The Company considers many factors when determining whether a market value decline is other than temporary, including: (1) the length of time the market value has been below book value, (2) the credit strength of the issuer, (3) the issuer market sector, (4) the length of time to maturity and (5) for asset backed securities, increases in prepayments. If management assessments change in the future, the Company may ultimately record a realized loss after management originally concluded that the decline in value was temporary. See also Note 1 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. FINANCIAL CONDITION CASH AND INVESTED ASSETS. Aggregate invested assets, including cash and short-term investments, were $13,957.1 million at December 31, 2006 and $12,970.8 million at December 31, 2005. This increase in cash and invested assets resulted primarily from $636.3 million in cash flows from operations, $176.4 million of foreign currency translation gains, $35.1 million of net realized capital gains and a $131.7 million increase in net pre-tax unrealized appreciation of the Company investments comprised of a $191.9 million increase in pre-tax unrealized appreciation on the equity securities portfolio, partially offset by a $60.2 million decrease in pre-tax unrealized appreciation in fixed maturities portfolio. Cumulative gross pre-tax unrealized appreciation and depreciation across the Company investment portfolio were $594.5 million and $122.8 million, respectively, at December 31, 2006 compared to $443.1 million and $103.1 million, respectively, at December 31, 2005. The Company principal investment objectives are to ensure funds are available to meet its insurance and reinsurance obligations and to maximize after-tax investment income while maintaining a high quality diversified investment portfolio. Considering these objectives, the Company views its investment portfolio as having two components; 1) the investments needed to satisfy outstanding liabilities and 2) investments funded by the Company shareholders equity. 72 For outstanding liabilities, the Company invests in taxable and tax-preferenced fixed income securities with an average credit quality of Aa, as rated by the independent investment rating service of Moody s. The Company mix of taxable and tax-preferenced investments is adjusted continuously, consistent with the Company current and projected operating results, market conditions and the Company tax position. This fixed maturity portfolio is externally managed by an independent, professional investment manager using portfolio guidelines approved by the Company. Over the past few years, the Company has reallocated its shareholders equity investment portfolio to include 1) publicly traded equity securities, primarily exchange traded funds, and 2) private equity limited partnership investments. The objective of this portfolio diversification is to enhance the risk-adjusted total return of the investment portfolio by allocating a prudent portion of the portfolio to higher return asset classes. The Company has limited its allocation to these asset classes because 1) the potential for volatility in their values and 2) the impact of these investments on regulatory and rating agency capital adequacy models. At December 31, 2006, the market value of investments in equity and limited partnership securities approximated 40% of shareholders equity. During 2005 and 2004, the Company invested in interest only strips. These investments were intended to mitigate potential decreases in unrealized appreciation on the Company fixed income portfolio during a period when management believed there was high potential for increased general interest rates. These securities give the holder the right to receive interest payments at a stated coupon rate on an underlying pool of mortgages. The interest payments on the outstanding mortgages are guaranteed by entities generally rated AAA. The ultimate cash flow from these investments is primarily dependent upon the average life of the mortgage pool. Generally, as mortgage rates decline, mortgagors tend to pre-pay their mortgage loans which decreases the average life of a mortgage pool and reduces expected cash flows. Conversely, as mortgage rates rise, prepayments are more likely to slow and ultimate cash flows tend to rise. Accordingly, the market value of these investments tends to increase as general interest rates rise and decline as general interest rates fall. These movements are generally counter to the impact of interest rate movements on the Company other fixed income investments. Although the Company invested in interest only strips during 2005 and 2004, the Company had liquidated its positions in interest only strips and held no such securities at or after December 31, 2005. The tables below summarize the composition and characteristics of the Company investment portfolio at December 31: 2006 2005 2004 Fixed maturities 73.9% 77.5% 86.3% Equity securities 11.6% 8.4% 5.6% Short-term investments 9.4% 11.1% 5.1% Other invested assets 3.3% 2.2% 1.4% Cash 1.8% 0.8% 1.6% Total investments and cash 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% 2006 2005 2004 Fixed income portfolio duration 4.1 years 4.3 years 5.2 years Fixed income composite credit quality Aa2 Aa1 Aa2 Imbedded end of period yield, pre-tax 4.6% 4.5% 4.7% Imbedded end of period yield, after-tax 4.0% 3.9% 4.1% The increase in equity securities and other invested assets reflects a modest and continuing reweighting of the Company target investment mix. 73 The following table provides a comparison of the Company total return by asset class relative to broadly accepted industry benchmarks for the years indicated: 2006 2005 Company's fixed income portfolio total return 4.6 % 3.2 % Lehman bond aggregate index 4.3 % 2.4 % Company's common equity portfolio total return 19.2 % 13.8 % S & P 500 index 15.8 % 4.9 % Company's other invested asset portfolio total return 19.8 % 7.2 % REINSURANCE RECEIVABLES. Reinsurance receivables for both paid and unpaid losses totaled $772.8 million at December 31, 2006, $1,048.7 million at December 31, 2005, and $1,210.8 million at December 31, 2004. At December 31, 2006, $169.4 million, or 21.9%, was receivable from Transatlantic, $100.9 million, or 13.1%, was receivable from LM, whose obligations are guaranteed by The Prudential, $100.2 million, or 13.0%, was receivable from Founders, $100.0 million, or 12.9%, was receivable from Continental, which is partially collaterized by funds held arrangements, $52.5 million, or 6.8%, was receivable from subsidiaries of London Life, which is fully collateralized by letters of credit, and $42.7 million, or 5.5%, was receivable from Munich Re. Continental is collateralized by a funds held arrangements under which the Company has retained the premium payments due the retrocessionaire, recognized liabilities for such amounts and reduced such liabilities as payments are due from the retrocessionaire. No other retrocessionaire accounted for more than 5% of the Company receivables. LOSS AND LAE RESERVES. Gross loss and LAE reserves totaled $8,840.1 million at December 31, 2006, $9,126.7 million at December 31, 2005 and $7,836.3 million at December 31, 2004. The decrease in 2006 was primarily attributable to the payout in 2006 of catastrophe loss reserves held at December 31, 2005, partially offset by unfavorable net prior period reserve strengthening. The increases in 2005 and 2004 were primarily attributable to increased catastrophe losses, partially offset by favorable net prior period reserve adjustments and reduced premiums earned. The following tables summarize gross outstanding loss and LAE reserves by segment, segregated into case reserves and IBNR reserves, which are managed on a combined basis, for the years indicated: Gross Reserves By Segment As of December 31, 2006 (Dollars in thousands) Case Reserves IBNR Reserves Total Reserves % of Total U.S. Reinsurance $ 1,641,661 $ 2,061,722 $ 3,703,383 41.9 % U.S. Insurance 591,384 1,010,998 1,602,382 18.1 % Specialty Underwriting 338,719 145,646 484,365 5.5 % International 535,135 380,208 915,343 10.3 % Bermuda 817,536 666,997 1,484,533 16.8 % Total excluding A&E 3,924,435 4,265,571 8,190,006 92.6 % A&E 501,387 148,747 650,134 7.4 % Total including A&E $ 4,425,822 $ 4,414,318 $ 8,840,140 100.0 % 74 As of December 31, 2005 (Dollars in thousands) Case Reserves IBNR Reserves Total Reserves % of Total U.S. Reinsurance $ 1,654,597 $ 2,423,192 $ 4,077,789 44.7 % U.S. Insurance 583,729 948,288 1,532,017 16.8 % Specialty Underwriting 273,369 184,719 458,088 5.0 % International 577,276 434,541 1,011,817 11.1 % Bermuda 618,066 779,465 1,397,531 15.3 % Total excluding A&E 3,707,037 4,770,205 8,477,242 92.9 % A&E 526,210 123,250 649,460 7.1 % Total including A&E $ 4,233,247 $ 4,893,455 $ 9,126,702 100.0 % As of December 31, 2004 (Dollars in thousands) Case Reserves IBNR Reserves Total Reserves % of Total U.S. Reinsurance $ 1,354,647 $ 2,174,762 $ 3,529,409 45.0 % U.S. Insurance 599,200 793,451 1,392,651 17.7 % Specialty Underwriting 215,187 158,793 373,980 4.8 % International 421,804 359,073 780,877 10.0 % Bermuda 425,273 605,791 1,031,064 13.2 % Total excluding A&E 3,016,111 4,091,870 7,107,981 90.7 % A&E 571,939 156,386 728,325 9.3 % Total including A&E $ 3,588,050 $ 4,248,256 $ 7,836,306 100.0 % The changes by segment generally reflect changes in earned premium, changes in business mix, the impact of reserve re-estimations and changes in catastrophe loss reserves, together with claim settlement activity. The fluctuations for A&E reflect the impact of reserve re-evaluations and claim settlement activity. The Company loss and LAE reserves are an estimate of the ultimate liability for unpaid claims. Such estimates are re-evaluated on an ongoing basis, including re-estimates of prior period reserves, taking into consideration all available information and, in particular, newly reported loss and claim experience. Such re-evaluations impact incurred losses in the period when the re-evaluation is made. The Company notes that its analytical methods and processes operate at multiple levels including individual contracts, groupings of like contracts, classes and lines of business, internal business units, segments, legal entities, and in the aggregate. The complexities of the Company business and operations require analyses and adjustments, both qualitative and quantitative, at these various levels. Additionally, the attribution of reserves, change in reserves and incurred losses between accident year and underwriting year requires adjustments and allocations, both qualitative and quantitative, at these various levels. All of these processes, methods and practices appropriately balance actuarial science, business expertise and management judgment in a manner intended to assure the accuracy, precision and consistency of the Company reserving practices, which are fundamental to the Company operation. The Company notes however, that the underlying reserves are estimates, which are subject to variation. There can be no assurance that reserves for, and losses from, claim obligations will not increase in the future, possibly by a material amount. However, management believes that the Company existing reserves and reserving methodologies lessen the probability that any such increase would have a material adverse effect on the Company financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In this context, the Company notes that over the past 10 years, its past calendar year operations have been affected variably by effects from prior period reserve re-estimates, with such effects ranging from a favorable $62.1 million in 1997, representing 2.2% of the net prior period reserves for the year in which the adjustment was made, to an unfavorable $249.4 million in 2004, representing 3.7% of the net prior period reserves for the year in which the adjustment was made. The 75 Company has noted that variability had increased for years 1999 to 2003 and has taken actions to attempt to reduce year to year variability prospectively. The Company has included ranges for loss reserve estimates determined by the Company actuaries, which are derived through a combination of objective and subjective criteria. The Company notes that its presentation of this information is not directly comparable to similar presentations of other companies as there are no consistently applied actuarial or accounting standards governing such presentations. The Company further notes that its recorded reserves reflect the Company best point estimate of its liabilities. The Company actuarial methodologies develop point estimates and the ranges are developed subsequently. The following table below represents the reserve levels and ranges as of December 31, 2006 for each of the Company business segments. Outstanding Reserves and Ranges By Segment (1) As of December 31, 2006 (Dollars in thousands) As Reported Low Range % (2) Low Range (2) High Range % (2) High Range (2) Gross Reserves By Segment U.S. Reinsurance $ 3,703,383 -9.7% $ 3,345,617 9.7% $ 4,061,149 U.S. Insurance 1,602,382 -14.8% 1,364,624 14.8% 1,840,140 Specialty Underwriting 484,365 -14.3% 414,993 14.3% 553,736 International 915,343 -8.8% 834,606 8.8% 996,082 Bermuda 1,484,533 -9.0% 1,351,016 9.0% 1,618,018 Total Gross Reserves (excluding A&E) 8,190,006 -8.1% 7,528,021 8.1% 8,851,991 A&E (All Segments) (3) (4) 650,134 NA 650,134 NA 650,134 Total Gross Reserves (4) $ 8,840,140 NA $ 8,178,155 NA $ 9,502,125 ______________ (1) There can be no assurance that reserves will not ultimately exceed the indicated ranges, requiring additional income statement expense. (2) Although totals are displayed for both the low range and high range amounts, it should be noted that statistically the range of the total is not equal to the sum of the ranges of the segments. (3) Given the uncertainties surrounding the settlement of A&E losses, management is unable to establish a range for these obligations. As a result, these reserves which relate principally to the U.S. Reinsurance and Bermuda segments, have been segregated from reserves for which a range has been determined. (4) NA means not applicable Depending on the specific segment, the range derived for the loss reserves, excluding reserves for A&E exposures, ranges from minus 8.8% to minus 14.8% for the low range and from plus 8.8% to plus 14.8% for the high range. Both the higher and lower ranges are associated with the U.S. Insurance segment. The Company notes that the width of the range is dependent on the level of confidence associated with the outcome. Within each range, management best estimate of loss reserves is based on the point estimate derived by the Company actuaries in detailed reserve studies. Such ranges are necessarily subjective due to the lack of generally accepted actuarial standards with respect to their development. For the above presentation, management has assumed what it believes is a reasonable confidence level but notes that there can be no assurance that the Company claim obligations will not vary within and potentially outside of these ranges, requiring incurred loss adjustments in the period the variability is recognized. The Company is not able to establish a meaningful range for A&E reserves. Additional losses, including those relating to latent injuries, and other exposures, which are as yet unrecognized, the type or magnitude of which cannot be foreseen by the Company or the reinsurance and insurance industry generally, may emerge in the future. Such future emergence, to the extent not covered by existing retrocessional 76 contracts, could have material adverse effects on the Company future financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The Company has exposure to A&E losses through its Mt. McKinley operation with respect to insurance policies and through Everest Re with respect to reinsurance contracts. In each case, the Company management and analyses of its exposures take into account a number of features of its business that differentiate the Company exposures from many other insurers and reinsurers that have significant A&E exposures. Mt. McKinley began writing small amounts of A&E exposed insurance in 1975 and increased the volume of its writings in 1977. These writings ceased in 1984, giving Mt. McKinley an approximate 10-year window of potential A&E exposure, which is appreciably shorter than is the case for many companies with significant A&E exposure. Additionally, due to changes in and standardization of policy forms, it is rare for policies in the 1970s and 1980s to have been issued without aggregate limits on the product liability coverage; policies issued in earlier decades were generally more likely to lack aggregate limits. The vast majority of Mt. McKinley A&E exposed insurance policies are excess casualty policies, with aggregate coverage limits, which by definition also have protection afforded by underlying coverage. Mt. McKinley attachment points vary but generally are excess of millions, often tens of millions, of dollars of underlying coverage. The excess nature of most of Mt. McKinley policies also offers insulation against non-product claims (for example, claims arising under general liability coverage). Although under some circumstances an excess policy could be exposed to non-product claims, such claims generally pose more of a risk to primary policies because non-product claims are generally less likely to aggregate. In addition, environmental claims arise under general liability coverage, and generally do not aggregate. Thus, these claims tend to create exposure for primary policies to a greater extent than excess policies. Virtually all of the Mt. McKinley policies that are still potentially exposed to claims have policy language providing that expenses are covered only within limits rather than in addition to limits. This is a substantial difference from primary coverage, which would most often cover expenses in addition to limits. Everest Re was formed in 1973 but was not fully engaged in underwriting casualty business, under which A&E exposures generally arise, until 1974, and it effectively eliminated A&E exposures through contract exclusions effected in 1984. Therefore, Everest Re has an approximate 11-year window of A&E exposure, much shorter than that of many reinsurance companies that have significant A&E exposures. In the earlier years of its existence, Everest Re was not as heavily involved in casualty business as in property business, which generally is not exposed to asbestos claims. Everest Re generally took smaller lines of exposure per contract than many other reinsurers operating in the casualty reinsurance market and those lines were generally also smaller than the excess limits provided by Mt. McKinley policies. This means that the potential adverse development on Everest Re reinsurance business is likely to be smaller than companies having greater exposures per risk. Everest Re reinsured both primary and excess policies. However, its claim experience to date indicates that the majority of its reinsurance was on excess policies. As a result, most of Everest Re exposure derives from excess policies similar to those written by Mt. McKinley. With respect to both the Mt. McKinley and Everest Re operations, the Company was not a member of the Asbestos Claims Facility ( Wellington ) or the Center for Claims Resolution ( CCR ) claim settlement facilities. Insurers supporting those facilities made broad commitments concerning the application of insurance coverage to asbestos claims. With respect to its direct insurance exposures, the fact that the Company has not made those commitments may allow it to resolve insurance exposure to Wellington/CCR insureds more economically than if it had joined these facilities. With respect to its reinsurance exposures, although the Company was not a signatory to the Wellington or CCR facilities, it issued reinsurance contracts to ceding companies that were signatories. Because the insurers supporting these facilities have generally paid their 77 exposures more quickly than non-signatory insurers, the Company believes that this has generally meant that it has paid its reinsurance exposure more quickly than it likely would have if it had not been subject to Wellington/CCR payments. The Company believes that its A&E exposures are unique and differentiated, by the points noted above, from those insurers and reinsurers with appreciable A&E exposure but there can be no assurance that such factors will protect the Company from adverse development, perhaps material, or allow it to secure advantages in the settlement of its claims obligations. The following table summarizes incurred losses with respect to A&E on both a gross and net of retrocessions basis for the years indicated: Asbestos and Environmental Reserves Years Ended December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2006 2005 2004 Gross Basis: Beginning of period reserves $ 649.5 $ 728.3 $ 765.3 Incurred losses and LAE: Reported losses 87.9 110.2 297.1 Change in IBNR 25.5 (33.1 ) (125.4 ) Total incurred losses and LAE 113.4 77.1 171.7 Paid losses (112.7 ) (155.9 ) (208.7 ) End of period reserves $ 650.1 $ 649.5 $ 728.3 Net Basis: Beginning of period reserves $ 450.4 $ 506.7 $ 534.4 Incurred losses and LAE: Reported losses 81.6 102.3 271.8 Change in IBNR 25.0 (20.9 ) (112.4 ) Total incurred losses and LAE 106.6 81.4 159.4 Paid losses (45.5 ) (137.7 ) (187.1 ) End of period reserves $ 511.4 $ 450.4 $ 506.7 (Some amounts may not reconcile due to rounding) At December 31, 2006, the gross reserves for A&E losses were comprised of $135.6 million representing case reserves reported by ceding companies, $152.1 million representing additional case reserves established by the Company on assumed reinsurance claims, $213.7 million representing case reserves established by the Company on direct excess insurance claims, including Mt. McKinley, and $148.7 million representing IBNR reserves. The Company incurred adverse development for A&E exposures of $113.4 million and $77.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. These increases are the result of re-evaluations by management of additional information received from insureds and ceding companies, ongoing litigation, additional claims received and settlement activity. Management closely monitors this additional information and adjusts reserves accordingly. Industry analysts have developed a measurement, known as the survival ratio, to compare the A&E reserves among companies with such liabilities. The survival ratio is typically calculated by dividing a company current net reserves by the three year average of paid losses. Hence, the survival ratio equals the number of 78 years that it would take to exhaust the current reserves based on historical payment levels. Using this measurement, the Company net three year A&E survival ratio was 4.1 years at December 31, 2006. Adjusting for the effect of the reinsurance ceded under the reinsurance agreement with LM, this ratio rises to the equivalent of 5.0 years at December 31, 2006. The cession of $100.9 million to the stop loss reinsurance provided by LM in connection with the acquisition of Mt. McKinley results in unpaid proceeds that are not reflected in past net payments and effectively extends the funding available for future net payments. Because the survival ratio was developed as a comparative measure of reserve strength and not of absolute reserve adequacy, the Company considers, but does not rely on, the survival ratio when evaluating its reserves. In particular, the Company notes that year to year loss payment variability can be material. This is due in part, to the Company orientation to negotiated settlements, particularly on its Mt. McKinley exposures, which significantly impairs the credibility and utility of this measure as an analytical tool. During 2006, the Company made asbestos net claim payments of $16.6 million to Mt McKinley high profile claimants where the claim was either closed or a settlement was reached. Such payments, which are non-repetitive, distort the Company three year survival ratio for 2006 and will continue to do so for 2007 and 2008. Adjusting for such settlements, recognizing total settlements are generally considered fully reserved to an agreed settlement, the Company considers that its adjusted A&E survival ratio for net unsettled claims is 7.7 years, which is closer to prevailing industry norms. Developments in 2006 and 2005 affecting asbestos exposures in general and the Company asbestos exposures in particular, together with enhancements in the Company claim management and analytical processes, resulted in the reserve strengthening noted earlier. These developments and actions have increased the emphasis on asbestos exposures as a separate component of the Company A&E exposures. Despite the Company approach of handling A&E exposures on a combined basis, management believes additional disclosure of the asbestos element of its A&E exposures is appropriate. The following tables summarize reserve and claim activity for asbestos claims, gross and net of ceded reinsurance, for the periods indicated with particular emphasis on the differentiation of insured categories within the Mt. McKinley operation, which the Company believes reflects the most volatile element of its asbestos exposures for the years ended December 31: 79 Gross Asbestos Exposures (1) (Dollars in millions) 2006 2005 2004 Beginning of period reserves: Direct Operations (Mt.

This three year survival ratio, when adjusted for the effect of the reinsurance ceded under the stop loss cover from LM, was 4.9 years and, when adjusted for settlements in place and structured settlements, which are either fully funded by reserves or subject to financial terms that substantially limit the potential variability in the liability, and the stop loss protection from LM, was 7.7 years. SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY. The Company shareholders equity increased to $5,107.7 million as of December 31, 2006 from $4,139.7 million as of December 31, 2005, principally reflecting $840.8 million of net income for 2006, a $54.1 million increase due to net currency translation, a $38.6 million increase in net share-based compensation activity and a $88.3 million increase in net unrealized appreciation on investments, partially offset by $39.0 million of shareholder dividends and an increase of $15.0 million in accumulated other comprehensive income due to FAS 158 for pensions. The Company shareholders equity increased to $4,139.7 million as of December 31, 2005 from $3,712.5 million as of December 31, 2004, principally reflecting $758.2 million in net proceeds from the issuance of common shares, partially offset by $218.7 million of net loss for 2005, a $27.0 million decrease in net currency translation, a $77.8 million decrease in net unrealized appreciation on investments, $25.4 million shareholder dividends and an increase of $2.9 million in the minimum pension liability. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES CAPITAL. The Company business operations are in part dependent on the Company financial strength, and the market perception thereof, as measured by shareholders equity, which was $5,107.7 million and $4,139.7 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The Company possesses significant financial flexibility and access to the debt and equity markets as a result of its perceived financial strength, as evidenced by the financial strength ratings as assigned by independent rating agencies. The Company continuously monitors its capital and financial position, as well as investment and security market conditions and responds accordingly. From time to time, the Company has used open market share repurchases to effectively adjust its capital position. In September 2004, the Company authorization to purchase its shares was amended to authorize the repurchase of up to 5 million shares. It made no such purchases in 2006 or in 2005. The Company notes that, outside of its open market repurchase program, it repurchased 21,384 shares in 2006 and 10,430 shares in 2005 from employees in connection with restricted share vestings where individual employees chose to discharge withholding tax liabilities on vesting shares by the surrender of a portion of such shares. In 2005, 328 shares were surrendered from a non-employee in connection with payment of the option exercise price. At December 31, 2006, there remained 5 million shares under the repurchase authorization. On December 1, 2005, the Company filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC, as a Well Known Seasoned Issuer under the new registration and offering revisions to the Securities Act of 1933. Generally, under this shelf registration statement, Group is authorized to issue common shares, preferred shares, debt securities, warrants and hybrid securities, Holdings is authorized to issue debt securities and Everest Re Capital Trust III ( Capital Trust III ) is authorized to issue trust preferred securities. On December 1, 2005, the Company issued 2,298,000 of its common shares at a price of $102.89 per share, which resulted in $236.4 million of proceeds before expenses and Holdings sold Group shares it acquired in 2002 at a price of $102.89 per share, which resulted in $46.5 million of proceeds before expenses. Expenses incurred for this transaction were approximately $0.3 million. On June 27, 2003, the Company filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC, providing for the issuance of up to $975.0 million of securities. Generally, under this shelf registration statement, Group was authorized to issue common shares, preferred shares, debt securities, warrants and hybrid securities, Holdings was authorized to issue debt securities and Capital Trust II and Capital Trust III were authorized to issue trust preferred securities. This shelf registration statement became effective on December 22, 2003 and was 82 exhausted with the October 6, 2005 transaction described below. The following securities were issued issued pursuant to that registration statement. On March 29, 2004, Capital Trust II, an unconsolidated affiliate, issued trust preferred securities resulting in a takedown from the shelf registration statement of $320.0 million. In conjunction with the issuance of Capital Trust II trust preferred securities, Holdings issued $329.9 million of 6.20% junior subordinated debt securities due March 29, 2034 to Capital Trust II. Part of the proceeds from the issuance of the junior subordinated debt securities was used for capital contributions to Holdings operating subsidiaries. On October 12, 2004, Holdings completed a public offering of $250.0 million principal amount of 5.40% senior notes due October 15, 2014. The net proceeds were used to retire existing debt at Holdings, which was due and retired on March 15, 2005. On October 6, 2005, the Company expanded the size of the remaining shelf registration to $486.0 million by filing under Rule 462(b) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and General Instruction IV of Form S-3 promulgated there under. On the same date, the Company entered into an agreement to issue 5,200,000 of its common shares at a price of $91.50 per share, which resulted in $475.8 million in proceeds received on October 12, 2005, before expenses of approximately $0.3 million. This transaction effectively exhausted the December 22, 2003 shelf registration. On March 14, 2000, Holdings completed a public offering of $200.0 million principal amount of 8.75% senior notes due March 15, 2010 and $250.0 million principal amount of 8.50% senior notes due and retired March 15, 2005. During 2000, the net proceeds of these offerings and additional funds were distributed by Holdings to Group. LIQUIDITY. The Company principal investment objectives are to ensure funds are available to meet its insurance and reinsurance obligations and to maximize after-tax investment income while maintaining a high quality diversified investment portfolio. Considering these objectives, the Company views its investment portfolio as having two components; 1) the investments needed to satisfy outstanding liabilities and 2) investments funded by the Company shareholders equity. For outstanding liabilities, the Company invests in taxable and tax-preferenced fixed income securities with an average credit quality of Aa, as rated by the independent investment rating service of Moody s. The Company mix of taxable and tax-preferenced investments is adjusted continuously, consistent with the Company current and projected operating results, market conditions and the Company tax position. This fixed maturity portfolio is externally managed by an independent, professional investment manager using portfolio guidelines approved by the Company. Over the past few years, the Company has reallocated its shareholders equity investment portfolio to include 1) publicly traded equity securities, primarily exchange traded funds, and 2) private equity limited partnership investments. The objective of this portfolio diversification is to enhance the risk-adjusted total return of the investment portfolio by allocating a prudent portion of the portfolio to higher return asset classes. The Company has limited its allocation to these asset classes because 1) the potential for volatility in their values and 2) the impact of these investments on regulatory and rating agency capital adequacy models. At December 31, 2006, the market value of investments in equity and limited partnership securities approximated 40% of shareholders equity. The Company liquidity requirements are generally met from positive cash flow from operations. Positive cash flow results from reinsurance and insurance premiums being collected prior to disbursements for claims, which disbursements generally take place over an extended period after the collection of premiums, sometimes a period of many years. Collected premiums are generally invested, prior to their use in such disbursements, and 83 investment income provides additional funding for loss payments. The Company net cash flows from operating activities were $636.3 million, $1,070.6 million and $1,490.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Additionally, these cash flows reflected net tax payments of $46.6 million, $110.9 million and $100.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively; net catastrophe loss payments of $896.5 million, $459.7 million and $200.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively; and net A&E settlements of $45.5 million, $137.7 million and $187.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The decrease in net cash flows from operations in 2006 compared with 2005 was primarily due to higher claim payments on catastrophes. The decrease in net cash flows from operations in 2005 compared with 2004 was primarily due to higher claim payments on catastrophes combined with lower premium volume. If disbursements for claims and benefits, policy acquisition costs and other operating expenses exceed premium inflows, cash flow from insurance operations would be negative. The effect on cash flow from operations would be partially offset by cash flow from investment income. Additionally, cash flow from investment maturities and dispositions, both short term investments and longer term maturities, would further mitigate the impact on total cash flow. As the timing of payments for claims and benefits cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company maintains portfolios of long term invested assets with varying maturities, along with short-term investments that provide additional liquidity for payment of claims. At December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005 the Company held cash and short-term investments of $1,556.4 million and $1,551.0 million, respectively. In addition to these cash and short-term investments at December 31, 2006, the Company had $0.6 billion, at fair value, of available for sale fixed maturity securities maturing within one year or less, $2.5 billion maturing within one to five years and $7.2 billion maturing after five years. The Company $1.6 billion of equity securities are comprised primarily of publicly traded securities that can be easily liquidated. These fixed maturity and equity securities, in conjunction with the short-term investments and positive cash flow from operations, provide adequate sources of liquidity for the expected payment of losses in the near future. The Company does not anticipate selling securities or using available credit facilities to pay losses and LAE but has the ability to do so. Sales of securities might result in realized capital gains or losses and the Company notes that at December 31, 2006 it had $471.7 million of net pre-tax unrealized appreciation, comprised of $594.5 million of pre-tax unrealized appreciation and $122.8 million of pre-tax unrealized depreciation. Management expects the trend of positive cash flow from operations, which in general reflects the strength of overall pricing, to persist over the near term; however, cashflow from operations will continue to be negatively impacted by the payout of catastrophe loss reserves. In the intermediate and long term, the trend will be impacted by the extent to which competitive pressures affect overall pricing in the Company markets and the extent to which the Company successfully maintains its strategy of emphasizing underwriting profitability. Effective December 8, 2004, Group, Bermuda Re, and Everest International entered into a three year, $750.0 million senior credit facility with a syndicate of lenders (the Group Credit Facility ). Wachovia Bank is the administrative agent for the Group Credit Facility. The Group Credit Facility consists of two tranches. Tranche one provides up to $250.0 million of revolving credit for liquidity and general corporate purposes, and for the issuance of standby letters of credit. The interest on the revolving loans shall, at the option of each of the borrowers, be either (1) the Base Rate (as defined below) or (2) an adjusted London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ) plus a margin. The Base Rate is the higher of the rate of interest established by Wachovia Bank from time to time as its prime rate or the Federal Funds rate, in each case plus 0.5% per annum. The amount of margin and the fees payable for the Group Credit Facility depend on Group senior unsecured debt rating. Tranche two exclusively provides up to $500.0 million for the issuance of collateralized standby letters of credit. The Group Credit Facility requires Group to maintain a debt to capital ratio of not greater than 0.35 to 1 and to maintain a minimum net worth. Minimum net worth is an amount equal to the sum of (i) $2,898.0 million (base 84 amount) plus (ii) (A) 25% of consolidated net income for each of Group fiscal quarters and (B) 50% of any increase in consolidated net worth attributable to the issuance of ordinary and preferred shares. The base amount is reset at the end of each fiscal year to be the greater of 70% of Group consolidated net worth as of the last day of the fiscal year and the calculated minimum amount of net worth prior to the last day of the fiscal year. As of December 31, 2006, the Company was in compliance with these covenants. During the year ended December 31, 2006, there were no outstanding borrowings under tranche one of the Group Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2006, $185.4 million of the $500.0 million available for tranche two of standby letters of credit was used. In addition, the Company had $274.6 million in letters of credit outstanding at December 31, 2006 under a $350.0 million bilateral agreement with Citibank. All of these letters of credit are collateralized by the Company cash and investments. These letters of credit are generally used to collateralize reinsurance assumed by Bermuda Re from jurisdictions where collateralization is generally required for the ceding company to receive financial statement credit for such reinsurance recoverables from its principal regulator. Bermuda Re and Everest International also used trust arrangements to provide collateralization to ceding companies, including affiliates. The Company generally avoids providing collateral except where required for ceding companies to receive credit from their regulators. Additionally, at December 31, 2006, $135.7 million of assets were deposited in trust accounts, primarily on behalf of Bermuda Re, as security for assumed losses payable to certain non-affiliated ceding companies. Effective August 23, 2006, Holdings entered into a new five year, $150.0 million senior revolving credit facility with a syndicate of lenders, replacing the October 10, 2003 three year senior revolving credit facility, which expired on October 10, 2006. Both the August 23, 2006 and October 10, 2003 senior revolving credit agreements, which have similar terms, are referred to as the Holdings Credit Facility . Citibank N.A. is the administrative agent for the Holdings Credit Facility. The Holdings Credit Facility is used for liquidity and general corporate purposes. The Holdings Credit Facility provides for the borrowing of up to $150.0 million with interest at a rate selected by Holdings equal to either, (1) the Base Rate (as defined below) or (2) a periodic fixed rate equal to the Eurodollar Rate plus an applicable margin. The Base Rate means a fluctuating interest rate per annum in effect from time to time to be equal to the higher of (a) the rate of interest publicly announced by Citibank as its prime rate or 0.5% per annum above the Federal Funds Rate, in each case plus the applicable margin. The amount of margin and the fees payable for the Holdings Credit Facility depends upon Holdings senior unsecured debt rating. The Holdings Credit Facility requires Holdings to maintain a debt to capital ratio of not greater than 0.35 to 1 and Everest Re to maintain its statutory surplus at $1.5 billion plus 25% of future aggregate net income and 25% of future aggregate capital contributions after December 31, 2005. As of December 31, 2006, Holdings was in compliance with these covenants. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, there were no outstanding Holdings Credit Facility borrowings. Interest expense and fees incurred in connection with the Group Credit Facility and the Holdings Credit Facility were $0.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005. Interest expense and fees incurred in connection with the Holdings Credit Facility was $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. EXPOSURE TO CATASTROPHES. Like other insurance and reinsurance companies, the Company is exposed to multiple insured losses arising out of a single occurrence, whether a natural event, such as a hurricane or an earthquake, or other catastrophe, such as an explosion at a major factory. A large catastrophic event can be expected to generate insured losses to multiple reinsurance treaties, facultative certificates and across lines of business. The Company focuses on potential losses that could result from any single event, or series of events as part of its evaluation and monitoring of its aggregate exposures to catastrophic events. Accordingly, the Company employs 85 various techniques to estimate the amount of loss it could sustain from any single catastrophic event in various geographic areas. These techniques range from non-modeled deterministic approaches such as tracking aggregate limits exposed in catastrophe-prone zones and applying historic damage factors to modeled approaches that scientifically measure catastrophe risks using sophisticated Monte Carlo simulation techniques that forecast frequency and severity of expected losses on a probabilistic basis. No single universal model is currenty capable of projecting the amount and probability of loss in all global geographic regions in which the Company conducts business. In addition, the form, quality and granularity of underwriting exposure data furnished by ceding companies is not uniformly compatible with the data requirements for the Company licensed models, which adds to the inherent imprecision in the potential loss projections. Further, the results from multiple models and analytical methods must be combined and interpolated to estimate potential losses by and across business units. The combination of techniques potentially adds to the imprecision of the Company estimates. Also, while most models have been updated in 2006 to better incorporate factors that contributed to unprecedented industry storm losses in 2004 and 2005, such as flood, storm surge and demand surge, catastrophe model projections are inherently imprecise. In addition, uncertainties with respect to future climatic patterns and cycles add to the already significant uncertainty of loss projections from models using historic long-term frequency and severity data. Nevertheless, when combined with traditional risk management techniques and sound underwriting judgment, catastrophe models are a useful tool for underwriters to price catastrophe exposed risks and for providing management with quantitative analyses with which to monitor and manage catastrophic risk exposures by zone and across zones for individual and multiple events. Projected catastrophe losses are generally summarized in terms of the PML. The Company defines PML as its anticipated loss, taking into account contract terms and limits, caused by a single catastrophe affecting a broad contiguous geographic area, such as that caused by a hurricane or earthquake. The PML will vary depending upon the severity of modeled simulated losses and the make-up of the in force book of business. The projected severity levels are described in terms of return periods , such as 100-year events and 250-year events . For example, a 100-year PML corresponds to the estimated loss from a single event which has a 1% probability of being exceeded in a twelve month period. Conversely, it corresponds to a 99% probability that the loss from a single event will fall below the indicated PML. It is important to notes that PMLs are estimates. Modeled events are hypothetical events produced by a stochastic model. As a result, there can be no assurance that any actual event will align with the modeled event or that actual losses from events similar to the modeled events will not vary materially from the modeled event PML. From a risk management perspective, the Company endeavors to manage its catastrophe risk profile such that the projected economic loss from its largest 100-year event does not exceed approximately $500 million. Economic loss is viewed as the gross PML loss reduced by estimated reinstatement premiums to renew coverage and income taxes. The impact of income taxes on the PML depends on the distribution of the losses by corporate entity, which is also affected by inter-affiliate reinsurance. Management also monitors its largest PMLs at multiple points along the loss distribution curve, such as loss amounts at the 20, 50, 100, 250, 500 and 1,000 year return periods. This process enables management to identify exposure accumulations to integrate into enterprise risk, underwriting and capital management processes. The Company catastrophe loss projections, segmented by risk zones, are updated quarterly and reviewed as part of a formal risk management review process. The Company believes that its greatest worldwide 1 in 100 year exposure to a single catastrophic event is to a hurricane affecting the U.S. southeast coast where the Company estimates it has a gross PML exposure of $777 million. See also table under Risk Management and Retrocession Arrangements . 86 If such a single catastrophe loss were to occur, management estimates that the economic loss to the Company would be approximately $471 million. The impact represents approximately 9% of the Company beginning of year capital. The estimate involves multiple variables, including which Everest entity would experience the loss, and as a result there can be no assurance that this amount would not be exceeded. The Company may purchase reinsurance to cover specific business written or the potential accumulation or aggregation of exposures across some or all of the Company operations. Reinsurance purchasing decisions consider both the potential coverage and market conditions including the pricing, terms, conditions and availability of coverage, with the aim of securing cost effective protection. The amount of reinsurance purchased has varied over time, reflecting the Company view of its exposures and the cost of reinsurance. For 2004, 2005 and thus far in 2006, the Company has not purchased corporate retrocessional protection and has generally de-emphasized the purchase of specific reinsurance by its underwriters, reflecting the Company view that its exposures, in the context of its capital, financial position and current market pricing, do not warrant reinsurance purchases at current price levels. For 1999, 2000 and 2001, the Company purchased accident year aggregate excess of loss retrocession coverage, which provided up to $175.0 million of recoveries per accident year if Everest Re consolidated statutory basis accident year loss ratio exceeded a loss ratio attachment point provided in the contract for the respective accident years. Each arrangement provided for an adjustment premium, which reduced the net benefit by approximately 50%, in the event that the coverage was used. The limit has been fully utilized and there are no remaining limits available under these agreements. See ITEM 1, Business Risk Management of Underwriting and Retrocession Arrangements for further details. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS. The following table shows the Company contractual obligations for the year ended December 31, 2006: (Dollars in millions) Payments due by period Contractual obligations Total Less than 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than 5 years 8.75% Senior notes $ 200.0 $ - $ - $ 200.0 $ - 5.4% Senior notes 250.0 - - - 250.0 Junior subordinated debt 546.4 - - - 546.4 Interest expense 1,138.5 67.3 134.7 108.4 828.1 Employee benefit plans 4.0 4.0 - - - Operating lease agreements 32.6 7.7 14.9 8.4 1.6 Gross reserve for losses and LAE (1) 8,840.0 2,156.7 3,108.0 939.4 2,636.0 Total $ 11,011.5 $ 2,235.7 $ 3,257.6 $ 1,256.2 $ 4,262.1 (1) Loss and LAE reserves represent the Company best estimate of losses from claim and related settlement costs. Both the amounts and timing of such payments are estimates, and the inherent variability of resolving claims as well as changes in market conditions make the timing of cash outflows uncertain. Therefore, the ultimate amount and timing of loss and LAE payments could differ from the Company estimates. The contractual obligations for senior notes and junior subordinated debt are the responsibility of Holdings. The Company has sufficient cash flow, liquidity, investments and access to capital markets to satisfy these obligations, Holdings generally depends for its funding upon dividends from Everest Re, its operating insurance subsidiary, capital contributions from Group or access to the capital markets. The Company various operating insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries have sufficient cash flow, liquidity and investments to settle outstanding reserves for losses and LAE. Management believes that the Company, and each of its entities, have sufficient financial resources, or ready access thereto, to meet all obligations. 87 DIVIDENDS During 2006, 2005 and 2004, the Company declared and paid shareholder dividends of $39.0 million, $25.4 million and $22.4 million, respectively. As an insurance holding company, the Company is partially dependent on dividends and other permitted payments from its subsidiaries to pay cash dividends to its shareholders. The payment of dividends to Group by Holdings and to Holdings by Everest Re is subject to Delaware regulatory restrictions and the payment of dividends to Group by Bermuda Re is subject to Bermuda insurance regulatory restrictions. Management expects that, absent extraordinary catastrophe losses, such restrictions should not affect Everest Re ability to declare and pay dividends sufficient to support Holdings general corporate needs and that Holdings and Bermuda Re will have the ability to declare and pay dividends sufficient to support Group general corporate needs. For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, Everest Re paid dividends to Holdings of $100.0 million, $75.0 million and $70.0 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, Bermuda Re paid dividends to Group of $60.0 million, $45.0 million and $15.0 million, respectively. See ITEM 1, Business Regulatory Matters Dividends and Note 14A of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. APPLICATION OF NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Statement 123(R) Share-Based Payment ( FAS 123(R) ), which is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. The Company adopted FAS 123(R) effective January 1, 2006. FAS 123(R) requires all share-based compensation awards, granted, modified or settled after December 15, 1994 to be accounted for using the fair value method of accounting. Under the modified prospective application, compensation cost is recognized for the outstanding, non-vested awards based on the grant date fair value of those awards as calculated under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation ( FAS 123 ). The Company implemented FAS 123 prospectively for grants issued on or after January 1, 2002. The adoption of FAS 123(R) resulted in $169,037 of additional compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2006 for options granted prior to FAS 123. In November 2005, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position ( FSP ) FAS 115-1, The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments ( FAS 115-1 ), which is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2005. FAS 115-1 addresses the determination of when an investment is considered impaired, whether the impairment is other than temporary and the measurement of an impairment loss. FAS 115-1 also includes accounting considerations subsequent to the recognition of an other-than-temporary impairment and requires certain disclosures about unrealized losses not recognized as other-than-temporary impairments. The Company adopted FAS 115-1 prospectively effective January 1, 2006. The Company believes it has appropriately recorded realized losses for all securities owned that have experienced an other-than-temporary impairment, and all unrealized losses in its investment portfolio are temporary in nature. In July 2006, the FASB released FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 ( FIN 48 ), which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise financial statements in accordance with FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes ( FAS 109 ). FIN 48 prescribes the recognition and measurement criteria for the financial statements for tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Further, FIN 48 expands the required disclosures associated with uncertain tax positions. The Company will adopt FIN 48 on January 1, 2007. The Company does not believe the impact of implementing FIN 48 will be material on its consolidated financial statements. In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157 Fair Value Measurements ( FAS 157 ), which is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. FAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value consistently in GAAP and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The Company will adopt FAS 88 157 on January 1, 2008. The Company does not believe the impact of implementing FAS 157 will be material on its consolidated financial statements. In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158 Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans ( FAS 158 ), which is effective for employers with publicly traded equity securities as of the end of the fiscal year ending after December 15, 2006. FAS 158 requires an employer to (a) recognize in its financial statements an asset for a plan over funded status or a liability for a plan under funded status, (b) measure a plan assets and its obligations that determine its funded status as of the end of the employer fiscal year and (c) recognize changes in the funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan in the year in which the changes occur as other comprehensive income. The Company adopted FAS 158 for the reporting period ended December 31, 2006. The impact on the Company consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2006 was a $23.1 million pre-tax, or $15.0 million after-tax, reduction to accumulated other comprehensive income. MARKET SENSITIVE INSTRUMENTS The SEC Financial Reporting Release #48 requires registrants to clarify and expand upon the existing financial statement disclosure requirements for derivative financial instruments, derivative commodity instruments and other financial instruments (collectively, market sensitive instruments ). The Company does not generally enter into market sensitive instruments for trading purposes. The Company current investment strategy seeks to maximize after-tax income through a high quality, diversified, taxable and tax-preferenced fixed maturity portfolio, while maintaining an adequate level of liquidity. The Company mix of taxable and tax-preferenced investments is adjusted continuously, consistent with its current and projected operating results, market conditions and the Company tax position. The fixed maturities in the investment portfolio are comprised of non-trading available for sale securities. Additionally, the Company invests in equity securities, which it believes will enhance the risk-adjusted total return of the investment portfolio. The Company has also written a small number of equity put options. The overall investment strategy considers the scope of present and anticipated Company operations. In particular, estimates of the financial impact resulting from non-investment asset and liability transactions, together with the Company capital structure and other factors, are used to develop a net liability analysis. This analysis includes estimated payout characteristics for which the investments of the Company provide liquidity. This analysis is considered in the development of specific investment strategies for asset allocation, duration and credit quality. The change in overall market sensitive risk exposure principally reflects the asset changes that took place during the period. Interest Rate Risk. The Company $14.0 billion investment portfolio at December 31, 2006 is principally comprised of fixed maturity securities, which are generally subject to interest rate risk and 17.1%, are subject to foreign currency rate risk, and equity securities, which are subject to price fluctuations. The impact of the foreign exchange risks on the investment portfolio is generally mitigated by changes in the dollar value of foreign currency denominated liabilities and their associated income statement impact. Interest rate risk is the potential change in value of the fixed maturity portfolio, including short-term investments, from a change in market interest rates. In a declining interest rate environment, it includes prepayment risk on the $1,594.0 million of mortgage-backed securities in the $10,319.9 million fixed maturity portfolio. Prepayment risk results from potential accelerated principal payments that shorten the average life and thus the expected yield of the security. The tables below display the potential impact of market value fluctuations and after-tax unrealized appreciation on the Company fixed maturity portfolio (including $1.3 billion of short-term investments) as of December 31, 2006 and 2005 based on upward and downward parallel and immediate 100 and 200 basis point shifts in interest 89 rates. For legal entities with a U.S. dollar functional currency, this modeling was performed on each security individually. To generate appropriate price estimates on mortgage-backed securities, changes in prepayment expectations under different interest rate environments were taken into account. For legal entities with a non-U.S. dollar functional currency, the effective duration of the involved portfolio of securities was used as a proxy for the market value change under the various interest rate change scenarios. All amounts are in U.S. dollars and are presented in millions. 2006 Interest Rate Shift in Basis Points -200 -100 0 100 200 Total Market Value $ 12,621.7 $ 12,124.6 $ 11,626.3 $ 11,085.3 $ 10,521.7 Market Value Change from Base (%) 8.6 % 4.3 % 0.0 % -4.7 % -9.5 % Change in Unrealized Appreciation After-tax from Base ($) $ 747.8 $ 374.7 $ - $ (403.5 ) $ (820.6 ) 2005 Interest Rate Shift in Basis Points -200 -100 0 100 200 Total Market Value $ 12,516.8 $ 12,007.4 $ 11,485.9 $ 10,931.9 $ 10,377.0 Market Value Change from Base (%) 9.0 % 4.5 % 0.0 % -4.8% -9.7% Change in Unrealized Appreciation After-tax from Base ($) $ 773.7 $ 390.4 $ - $ (410.7 ) $ (820.7 ) The Company had $8,840.1 million and $9,126.7 million of reserves for losses and LAE as of December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005. These amounts are recorded at their nominal value, as opposed to fair value, which would reflect a discount adjustment to reflect the time value of money. Since losses are paid out over a period of time, the fair value of the reserves is less than the nominal value. As interest rates rise, the fair value of the reserves decreases and, conversely, as interest rates decline, the fair value increases. These movements are the opposite of the interest rate impacts on the fair value of investments. While the difference between fair value and nominal value is not reflected in the Company financial statements, the Company financial results will include investment income over time from the investment portfolio until the claims are paid. The Company loss and loss reserve obligations have an expected duration of approximately 3.8 years, which is reasonably consistent with the Company fixed income portfolio. If the Company were to discount its loss and LAE reserves, net of $0.8 billion of reinsurance receivables on unpaid losses, the discount would be approximately $1.5 billion resulting in a discounted reserve balance of approximately $6.5 billion, representing approximately 56% of the market value of the fixed maturity investment portfolio funds. Equity Risk. Equity risk is the potential change in market value of the common stock and preferred stock portfolios arising from changing equity prices. The Company equity investments are mainly exchange traded and mutual funds, which invest principally in high quality common and preferred stocks that are traded on the major exchanges in the U.S. The primary objective in managing the equity portfolio is to provide capital growth over time through market appreciation and income. 90 The tables below display the impact on market value and after-tax unrealized appreciation of a 10% and 20% change in equity prices up and down as of December 31, 2006 and 2005. The growth in exposure is primarily due to the growth in the equity portfolio. All amounts are in U.S. dollars and are presented in millions. 2006 Change in Equity Values in Percent -20% -10% 0% 10% 20% Market Value of the Equity Portfolio $ 1,290.9 $ 1,452.3 $ 1,613.7 $ 1,775.0 $ 1,936.4 After-tax Change in Unrealized Appreciation $ (239.5 ) $ (119.7 ) $ - $ 119.7 $ 239.5 2005 Change in Equity Values in Percent -20% -10% 0% 10% 20% Market Value of the Equity Portfolio $ 872.7 $ 981.7 $ 1,090.8 $ 1,199.9 $ 1,309.0 After-tax Change in Unrealized Appreciation $ (146.5 ) $ (73.3 ) $ - $ 73.3 $ 146.5 Foreign Currency Risk. Foreign currency risk is the potential change in value, income and cash flow arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Each of the Company non-U.S./Bermuda ( foreign ) operations maintains capital in the currency of the country of its geographic location consistent with local regulatory guidelines. Generally, the Company prefers to maintain the capital of its operations in U.S. dollar assets, although this varies by regulatory jurisdiction in accordance with market needs. Each foreign operation may conduct business in its local currency, as well as the currency of other countries in which it operates. The primary foreign currency exposures for these foreign operations are the Canadian Dollar, the British Pound Sterling and the Euro. The Company mitigates foreign exchange exposure by generally matching the currency and duration of its assets to its corresponding operating liabilities. In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 52, Foreign Currency Translation , the Company translates the assets, liabilities and income of non-U.S. dollar functional currency legal entities to the U.S. dollar. This translation amount is reported as a component of other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2006 there has been no material change in exposure to foreign exchange rates as compared to December 31, 2005. The tables below display the potential impact of a parallel and immediate 10% and 20% increase and decrease in foreign exchange rates on the valuation of invested assets subject to foreign currency exposure as of December 31, 2006 and 2005. This analysis includes the after-tax impact of translation from transactional currency to functional currency as well as the after-tax impact of translation from functional currency to the U.S. dollar reporting currency. All amounts are in U.S. dollars and are presented in millions. 2006 Change in Foreign Exchange Rates in Percent -20% -10% 0% 10% 20% Total After-tax Foreign Exchange Exposure $ (92.3 ) $ (54.6 ) $ - $ 66.8 $ 142.9 2005 Change in Foreign Exchange Rates in Percent -20% -10% 0% 10% 20% Total After-tax Foreign Exchange Exposure $ (101. 0) $ (57.0 ) $ - $ 66.4 $ 139.9 Although not considered material in the context of the Company aggregate exposure to market sensitive instruments, the Company has issued six equity put options based on the S&P 500 index and one equity put 91 option based on the FTSE 100 index, that are market sensitive and sufficiently unique to warrant supplemental disclosure. The Company has sold six equity put options based on the S&P 500 index for total consideration, net of commissions, of $22.5 million. These contracts each have a single exercise date, with original maturities ranging from 12 to 30 years and strike prices ranging from $1,141.21 to $1,540.63. No amounts will be payable under these contracts if the S&P 500 index is at or above the strike price on the exercise dates, which currently fall between June 2017 and March 2031. If the S&P 500 index is lower than the strike price on the applicable exercise date, the amount due will vary proportionately with the percentage by which the index is below the strike price. Based on historical index volatilities and trends and the December 31, 2006 index value, the Company estimates the probability for each contract of the S&P 500 index falling below the strike price on the exercise date to be less than 4.4%. The theoretical maximum payouts under the contracts would occur if on each of the exercise dates the S&P 500 index value were zero. The present value of these theoretical maximum payouts using a 6.0% discount factor is $213.2 million. The Company has sold one equity put option based on the FTSE 100 index for total consideration, net of commissions, of $6.7 million. This contract has an exercise date of July 2020 and a strike price of 5,989.75. No amount will be payable under this contract if the FTSE 100 index is at or above the strike price on the exercise date. If the FTSE 100 index is lower than the strike price on the applicable exercise date, the amount due will vary proportionately with the percentage by which the index is below the strike price. Based on historical index volatilities and trends and the December 31, 2006 index value, the Company estimates the probability that FTSE 100 index contract will be below the strike price on the exercise date to be less than 7.0%. The theoretical maximum payout under the contract would occur if on the exercise date the FTSE 100 index value was zero. The present value of the theoretical maximum payout using a 6.0% discount factor is $29.2 million. Because the equity put options are derivatives within the framework of FAS 133, the Company reports the fair value of these instruments in its balance sheet and records any changes to fair value in its statement of operations. The Company has recorded fair values for its obligations on these equity put options at December 31, 2006 and 2005 of $37.5 million and $36.3 million, respectively; however, the Company does not believe that the ultimate settlement of these transactions is likely to require a payment that would exceed the initial consideration received or any payment at all. As there is no active market for these instruments, the determination of their fair value is based on an industry accepted option pricing model, which requires estimates and assumptions, including those regarding volatility and expected rates of return. 92 The tables below estimate the impact of potential movements in interest rates and the equity indices, which are the principal factors affecting fair value of these instruments, looking forward from the fair value at December 31, 2006 and 2005. These are estimates and there can be no assurance regarding future market performance. The asymmetrical results of the interest rate and S&P 500 and FTSE 100 indices shift reflect that the liability cannot fall below zero whereas it can increase to its theoretical maximum.
