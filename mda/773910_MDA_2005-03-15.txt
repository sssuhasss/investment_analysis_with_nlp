Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview General Anadarko Petroleum Corporation primary line of business is the exploration, development, production and marketing of natural gas, crude oil, condensate and NGLs. The Company major areas of operations are located in the United States, Canada and Algeria. The Company is also active in Venezuela, Qatar and several other countries. The Company focus is on adding high-margin oil and natural gas reserves at competitive costs and continuing to develop more efficient and effective ways of exploring for and producing oil and gas. The primary factors that affect the Company results of operations include, among other things, commodity prices for natural gas, crude oil and NGLs, production volumes, the Company ability to find additional oil and gas reserves, as well as the cost of finding reserves and changes in the levels of costs and expenses required for continuing operations. Refocused Strategy Anadarko announced a refocused strategy in June 2004. Strategy execution included an asset realignment that resulted in the Company completing over $3 billion in pretax asset sales during 2004 through a series of unrelated transactions. Combined, these divestitures represented about 11% of Anadarko year-end 2003 proved reserves and about 20% of 2004 oil and gas production. The Company used proceeds from asset sales to reduce debt, repurchase Anadarko common stock under a $2 billion program authorized by the Company Board of Directors and otherwise to have funds available for reinvestment in other strategic options. The strategy refocuses the Company efforts and capital on the areas where it has consistently produced its best results; institutionalizes a process to manage the Company assets differently; lowers the reinvestment required to maintain existing production levels; and strengthens Anadarko financial discipline and strategic flexibility. The Company properties are separated into two broad categories and managed to serve different roles within the overall portfolio. Foundation assets are those with efficient reinvestment features to hold production flat or to grow production modestly, and that generally have low underlying decline rates over a long period of time. Today, these assets are primarily onshore North America and are expected to generate significant free cash that can be reinvested into growth areas. Growth platforms are expected to become increasingly global in nature and currently include the Gulf of Mexico deepwater, Algeria and Qatar. Growth platform assets are expected to deliver differentiated growth rates by targeting high-potential, exploration-focused investments or new ventures that may include acquisitions as entry vehicles. Properties sold under the refocused strategy during 2004 included about 290 MMBOE of proved reserves on the date of sale. Most of the properties divested were located in the shallow waters of the Gulf of Mexico, the Western Canadian Sedimentary basin and the mid-continent region of the United States. Under full cost accounting rules, gain or loss on the sale or other disposition of oil and gas properties is not recognized, unless the gain or loss would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves of oil and natural gas attributable to a country. The dispositions did not significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves; therefore, the proceeds from these transactions were recognized as an adjustment of capitalized costs in the respective country cost centers. 23 Table of Contents Results for the Year Ended December 31, 2004 Selected Data 2004 2003 2002 millions except per share amounts Financial Results Revenues $ 6,067 $ 5,122 $ 3,845 Costs and expenses 3,186 2,914 2,435 Interest expense and other (income) expense 404 234 203 Income tax expense 871 729 376 Net income available to common stockholders $ 1,601 $ 1,287 $ 825 Earnings per share diluted $ 6.36 $ 5.09 $ 3.21 Operating Results Total proved reserves (MMBOE) 2,367 2,513 2,328 Worldwide proved reserve additions (MMBOE) 335 391 258 Proved reserve sales in place (MMBOE) 290 14 39 Annual sales volumes (MMBOE) 190 192 197 Capital Resources and Liquidity Cash flow from operating activities $ 3,207 $ 3,043 $ 2,196 Capital expenditures 3,090 2,792 2,388 Total debt 3,840 5,058 5,471 Stockholders equity $ 9,285 $ 8,599 $ 6,972 Debt to total capitalization ratio 29 % 37 % 44 % Financial Results Net Income Anadarko net income available to common stockholders for 2004 totaled $1.6 billion, or $6.36 per share (diluted), compared to net income available to common stockholders for 2003 of $1.3 billion, or $5.09 per share (diluted). Anadarko had net income available to common stockholders in 2002 of $825 million or $3.21 per share (diluted). The increases in net income in 2004 and 2003 were primarily due to higher commodity prices, partially offset by higher expenses. In 2003, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, and the related cumulative adjustment in the first quarter of 2003 was an increase of $47 million after income taxes, or $0.18 per share (diluted). Revenues 2004 2003 2002 millions Gas sales $ 3,279 $ 2,851 $ 1,828 Oil and condensate sales 2,219 1,787 1,682 Natural gas liquids sales 460 365 222 Other sales 109 119 113 Total $ 6,067 $ 5,122 $ 3,845 Anadarko total revenues for 2004 increased 18% compared to 2003 and total revenues for 2003 increased 33% compared to 2002. The increase in revenues for both periods is primarily due to significantly higher commodity prices, partially offset by slightly lower sales volumes. The impact of hedges and marketing activities resulted in lower realized prices of $0.27 per Mcf of gas and $4.27 per barrel of oil for 2004 compared to market prices, which decreased revenues $461 million. For 2003, the impact of hedges and marketing activities resulted in lower realized prices of $0.27 per Mcf of gas and $1.42 per barrel of oil compared to market prices, which decreased revenues $267 million. For 2002, the impact of hedges 24 Table of Contents and marketing activities resulted in higher realized prices of $0.14 per Mcf of gas and lower realized prices of $0.32 per barrel of oil compared to market prices, which increased revenues $62 million.

The decrease was primarily due to slightly lower sales volumes in the United States and Canada due to the impact of divestitures in late 2004 and natural production declines in areas that were targeted for divestiture, partially offset by higher volumes associated with production startup in mid-2004 at the Marco Polo deepwater platform and successful drilling in Texas and Louisiana. Daily sales volumes in Algeria were up 17% due to the expansion of production facilities and the timing of cargo liftings. The Company daily sales volumes in 2003 were down 3% compared to 2002. The decrease for 2003 was due to lower volumes from operations in Canada, primarily related to the divestiture of heavy oil properties in late 2002 and from operations in Algeria primarily due to the substantial completion of cost recovery, whereby Anadarko was reimbursed for previous exploration spending with additional barrels of oil production. These decreases were partially offset by higher volumes from operations in the United States, primarily due to higher oil production in the western states as a result of the acquisition of Howell in late 2002. Sales volumes represent actual production volumes adjusted for changes in commodity inventories. Anadarko employs marketing strategies to help manage volumes and mitigate the effect of price volatility, which is likely to continue in the future.

The Company daily natural gas sales volumes for 2003 were 25 Table of Contents essentially flat compared to 2002. An increase in natural gas sales volumes in Texas, Louisiana and Canada due to successful exploration and development activities was offset by a decrease in the Gulf of Mexico, as a result of temporary operational issues and natural production declines. Production of natural gas is generally not directly affected by seasonal swings in demand. The Company average realized natural gas price in 2004 increased 16% compared to 2003. Continued strong demand in North America contributed to higher natural gas prices. These higher prices include commodity price hedges on 36% of natural gas sales volumes during 2004 that reduced the Company exposure to low prices and limited participation in higher prices. The Company average realized natural gas price in 2003 increased 55% compared to 2002. The increase in prices in 2003 was attributed to strong demand in North America due to colder weather and declining gas supply. The higher prices in 2003 included commodity price hedges on 49% of natural gas sales volumes. As of December 31, 2004, the Company has hedged about 21% of its anticipated natural gas wellhead sales volumes for 2005. See Energy Price Risk under Item 7a of this Form 10-K. Crude Oil and Condensate Sales Volumes and Average Prices 2004 2003 2002 United States (MMBbls) 32 34 31 MBbls/d 88 93 85 Price per barrel $ 31.87 $ 26.16 $ 22.90 Canada (MMBbls) 5 6 12 MBbls/d 14 17 33 Price per barrel $ 37.37 $ 27.33 $ 19.09 Algeria (MMBbls) 22 19 24 MBbls/d 61 52 65 Price per barrel $ 34.78 $ 28.43 $ 24.38 Other International (MMBbls) 8 8 8 MBbls/d 22 22 22 Price per barrel $ 27.91 $ 23.15 $ 19.92 Total (MMBbls) 67 67 75 MBbls/d 185 184 205 Price per barrel $ 32.76 $ 26.55 $ 22.44 Anadarko daily crude oil and condensate sales volumes for 2004 were essentially flat with 2003. Higher sales volumes in Algeria and production startup in mid-2004 at the Marco Polo deepwater platform were mostly offset by lower sales volumes in the United States and Canada, due to the impact of divestitures in late 2004 and natural production declines in areas that were targeted for divestitures. Anadarko daily crude oil and condensate sales volumes for 2003 decreased 10% compared to 2002 due to lower volumes in Canada and in Algeria, partially offset by higher volumes in the United States. The lower Canada volumes were due largely to the sale of the Company heavy oil assets in late 2002. The lower Algeria volumes were primarily due to the substantial completion of cost recovery. The higher volumes in the United States were primarily in the western states as a result of the Howell acquisition in late 2002. Production of oil usually is not affected by seasonal swings in demand or in market prices. Anadarko average realized crude oil price in 2004 increased 23% compared to 2003. The higher crude oil prices in 2004 were attributed to continuing political unrest in the Middle East and increased worldwide demand. These higher prices include commodity price hedges on 36% of crude oil and condensate sales volumes during 2004 that reduced the Company exposure to low prices and limited participation in higher prices. The Company average realized crude oil price in 2003 increased 18% compared to 2002. The higher crude oil prices during 2003 were primarily attributed to political unrest in the Middle East, the oil workers strike in Venezuela, low oil inventory levels and increased demand. The higher prices in 2003 included commodity price hedges on 38% of crude oil and condensate sales volumes. As of December 31, 2004, the Company had hedged about 26% of its anticipated oil and condensate volumes for 2005. 26 Table of Contents Natural Gas Liquids Sales Volumes and Average Prices 2004 2003 2002 Total (MMBbls) 17 17 15 MBbls/d 45 47 41 Price per barrel $ 27.76 $ 21.18 $ 14.80 Anadarko daily NGLs sales volumes in 2004 were down slightly compared to 2003, primarily due to a decrease in volumes of natural gas processed. The Company 2003 daily NGLs sales volumes increased 15% compared to 2002 primarily due to additional natural gas volumes processed in central Texas. During 2004, average NGLs prices increased 31% compared to 2003. The 2003 average NGLs prices increased 43% compared to 2002. NGLs production is dependent on natural gas prices and the economics of processing the natural gas to extract NGLs. Costs and Expenses 2004 2003 2002 millions Direct operating $ 682 $ 630 $ 577 Transportation and cost of product 250 198 170 General and administrative 423 392 314 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 1,447 1,297 1,121 Other taxes 312 294 214 Impairments related to oil and gas properties 72 103 39 Total $ 3,186 $ 2,914 $ 2,435 During 2004, Anadarko costs and expenses increased 9% compared to 2003 due to the following factors: Direct operating expense, which was up 8% in 2004, includes $12 million in severance and other costs related to 2004 divestitures and reorganization efforts. Excluding these costs, direct operating expenses increased 6% primarily due to higher enhanced oil recovery activity in the western states, production beginning in mid-2004 at the Marco Polo platform, the acquisition of producing properties in mid-2003 and a general increase in service and gathering costs, partially offset by a decrease associated with property divestitures in late 2004. Transportation and cost of product expense increased 26%. The increase includes a $60 million increase in transportation expense due to higher transportation rates and marketing volumes. This increase was partially offset by a lower cost of product as a result of a decrease in gas volumes processed into NGLs. General and administrative (G&A) expense increased 8%. In 2004, G&A expense includes $19 million in severance and other costs related to 2004 divestitures and reorganization efforts. In 2003, G&A expense includes $40 million in restructuring costs related to a cost reduction plan implemented in July and $32 million in benefits and salaries expenses related to executive transitions. Excluding these costs, G&A expense increased 26% in 2004 primarily due to legal settlements of $37 million and an increase of $30 million in employee bonus plan expense primarily due to the Company exceeding internal performance goals. Depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) expense increased 12%. DD&A expense increases include about $145 million primarily due to higher costs associated with finding and developing oil and gas reserves (including the transfer of excluded costs to the DD&A pool) and $11 million due to higher depreciation of general properties and asset retirement obligation accretion expense, partially offset by a decrease of $6 million related to slightly lower production volumes. Other taxes increased 6% primarily due to higher commodity prices in 2004. Impairments of oil and gas properties in 2004 were due to a $62 million ceiling test impairment for Qatar as a result of lower future production estimates and unsuccessful exploration activities and $10 million related to other international activities. 27 Table of Contents During 2003, Anadarko costs and expenses increased 20% compared to 2002 due to the following factors: Direct operating expense increased 9% primarily due to the acquisition of producing properties in the western states in late 2002 and the Gulf of Mexico in 2003, an increase in electricity, fuel and other lease expenses attributed to the effect of increased commodity prices and the impact of an increase in the Canadian exchange rate. These increases were partially offset by the effect of the sale of heavy oil properties in Canada in late 2002. Transportation and cost of product expense increased 16% primarily due to an increase in volumes of NGLs processed and higher transportation rates. G&A expense increased 25%. G&A expense in 2003 included restructuring costs of $40 million and $32 million in benefits and salaries expenses related to executive transitions during 2003. Excluding restructuring costs and executive transition expenses, G&A expense increased $17 million for the first six months of 2003 and decreased $11 million in the last half of 2003 as a result of the cost reduction plan implemented in July 2003. DD&A expense increased 16%. DD&A increases include about $180 million primarily due to higher costs associated with finding and developing oil and gas reserves (including the transfer of excluded costs to the DD&A pool), $20 million due to asset retirement obligation accretion expense and $8 million related to higher depreciation of general properties. These increases were partially offset by a $32 million decrease due to lower production volumes. Other taxes increased 37% primarily due to significantly higher commodity prices. Impairments of oil and gas properties in 2003 were due to a $68 million ceiling test impairment for Qatar as a result of lower future production estimates and unsuccessful exploration activities and $35 million related to other international activities.

See Debt . Gross interest expense decreased 9% during 2004 compared to 2003 due to lower average outstanding debt. Gross interest expense in 2003 increased 4% compared to 2002 primarily due to slightly higher interest rates. See Capital Resources and Liquidity. In 2004, capitalized interest decreased by 29% compared to 2003. In 2003, capitalized interest decreased by 22% compared to 2002. The 2004 and 2003 decreases were primarily due to lower capitalized costs that qualify for interest capitalization. For additional information about the Company policies regarding costs excluded and capitalized interest see Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Costs Excluded and Capitalized Interest. Other (Income) Expense For 2004, the Company had other expense of $52 million compared to other income of $19 million for 2003. The unfavorable change of $71 million was primarily due to a $63 million loss in 2004 related to an operating lease settlement for the Corpus Christi West Plant Refinery, a $21 million unfavorable 28 Table of Contents change primarily due to a decrease in Canadian foreign currency exchange gains and an $8 million unfavorable change related to the effect of lower market values for firm transportation subject to the keep-whole agreement, partially offset by a $21 million favorable change for ineffectiveness of derivative financial instruments. For 2003, other income was $19 million higher than 2002. The increase was due to a $20 million favorable change in foreign currency exchange gains primarily associated with the strengthening of the Canadian dollar, a $16 million decrease in other expenses primarily related to environmental remediation and litigation expense and a $9 million favorable change for ineffectiveness of derivative financial instruments, partially offset by a $26 million unfavorable change related to the effect of lower market values for firm transportation subject to the keep-whole agreement.

Income Tax Expense 2004 2003 2002 millions except percentages Income tax expense $ 871 $ 729 $ 376 Effective tax rate 35 % 37 % 31 % For 2004, income taxes increased 19% compared to 2003. The increase was primarily due to higher income before income taxes, partially offset by the effect of the reduction in the Alberta provincial tax rate during 2004 and other items. For 2003, income taxes increased 94% compared to 2002. The increase was primarily due to the increase in earnings before income taxes, partially offset by a decrease in Canadian taxes due to a Canadian federal income tax rate reduction from 28% to 21% over a five-year period beginning in 2003. The variances from the 35% statutory rate and the variances between years are caused by income taxes related to foreign activities, state income taxes, credits and other items. Current tax expense related to the estimated taxable gains from the 2004 divestitures was recorded during 2004 with a corresponding reduction to deferred tax expense. As a result, total income tax expense and the effective tax rate for 2004 were not impacted by the divestitures. Operating Results Proved Reserves Anadarko focuses on growth and profitability. Reserve replacement is the key to growth and future profitability depends on the cost of finding oil and gas reserves, among other factors. Reserve growth can be achieved through successful exploration and development drilling, improved recovery or acquisition of producing properties. 2004 2003 2002 MMBOE Proved Reserves Beginning of year 2,513 2,328 2,305 Reserve additions and revisions 335 391 258 Sales in place (290 ) (14 ) (39 ) Production (191 ) (192 ) (196 ) End of year 2,367 2,513 2,328 Proved Developed Reserves Beginning of year 1,727 1,568 1,505 End of year 1,517 1,727 1,568 The Company proved natural gas reserves at year-end 2004 were 7.5 Tcf compared to 7.7 Tcf at year-end 2003 and 7.2 Tcf at year-end 2002. Anadarko proved crude oil, condensate and NGLs reserves at year-end 2004 were 1.1 billion barrels compared to 1.2 billion barrels at year-end 2003 and 1.1 billion barrels at year-end 2002. Crude oil, condensate and NGLs comprised about half of the Company proved reserves at year-end 2004, 2003 and 2002. 29 Table of Contents The Company estimates of proved reserves are made using all available geological and reservoir data as well as production performance data. These estimates, made by the Company engineers, are reviewed annually and revised, either upward or downward, as warranted by additional data. The available data reviewed include, among other things, seismic data, structure and isopach maps, well logs, production tests, material balance calculations, reservoir simulation models, reservoir pressures, individual well and field performance data, individual well and field projections, offset performance data, operating expenses, capital costs and product prices. Revisions are necessary due to changes in, among other things, reservoir performance, prices, economic conditions and governmental restrictions. Decreases in prices, for example, may cause a reduction in some proved reserves due to reaching economic limits sooner. Reserve Additions and Revisions During 2004, the Company added 335 MMBOE of proved reserves as a result of additions (extensions, discoveries, improved recovery and purchases in place) which were partially offset by downward revisions. Additions During 2004, Anadarko added 389 MMBOE of proved reserves as a result of successful drilling in its core onshore North American properties and the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, successful improved recovery operations in Wyoming and minor producing property acquisitions. During 2003, Anadarko added 396 MMBOE of proved reserves through successful drilling in its core North American properties, successful improved recovery operations in Wyoming and producing property acquisitions. In 2002, the Company added 281 MMBOE through successful drilling in its core North American properties, successful improved recovery operations in Wyoming and producing property acquisitions. The Company expects the majority of future reserve additions to come from extensions of current fields and new discoveries onshore in North America and the deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico, as well as through improved recovery operations, purchases of proved properties in strategic areas and successful exploration in international growth areas. The success of these operations will directly impact reserve additions or revisions in the future. For additional information on risks associated with the Company business see Regulatory Matters and Additional Factors Affecting Business. Revisions Total revisions in 2004 were (54) MMBOE or 2% of the beginning of year reserve base. Performance revisions of (51) MMBOE were related to the Company reserves at Marco Polo and several other properties, partially offset by positive revisions in other areas. Price revisions of (3) MMBOE were due to the loss of royalty relief barrels from the Gulf of Mexico and the recalculation of equity barrels under a service fee contract in Venezuela, mostly offset by positive price revisions in U.S. onshore and Algeria due to higher year-end prices. Total revisions for 2003 and 2002 were (5) MMBOE and (23) MMBOE, respectively. An analysis of Anadarko proved reserve revisions split between performance and price revisions and shown as a percentage of the previous year-end proved reserves is presented in the following graph. During the 10-year period 1995 2004, Anadarko annual reserve revisions, up or down, have been below 5% for either type of revision. The Company believes this is an indicator of the validity of the Company processes for estimating reserves. In the aggregate, over the past decade, the average reserve revision has been a negative 0.5% and the average performance-related reserve revision has been a negative 0.4%. History of Reserve Revisions Performance Revision % of Price Revision % of Previous Year-End Reserve Base Previous Year-End Reserve Base 1995 0.5% 1.1% 1996 0.1% 1.5% 1997 3.5% (4.0)% 1998 (2.0)% (4.1)% 1999 (4.0)% 4.9% 2000 2.9% 1.1% 2001 (0.3)% (2.3)% 2002 (1.7)% 0.7% 2003 (0.5)% 0.3% 2004 (2.1)% (0.1)% 30 Table of Contents Sales in Place In 2004, Anadarko sold properties located in the United States and Canada representing 226 MMBOE and 64 MMBOE of proved reserves, respectively. In 2003 and 2002, Anadarko sold properties representing 14 MMBOE and 39 MMBOE of proved reserves, respectively. Proved Undeveloped Reserves To improve investor confidence and provide transparency regarding the Company reserves, Anadarko reports the status of its proved undeveloped reserves (PUDs) annually. The Company annually reviews all PUDs, with a particular focus on those PUDs that have been booked for three or more years, to ensure that there is an appropriate plan for development. Generally, onshore United States PUDs are converted to proved developed reserves within two years. Certain projects, such as improved oil recovery, arctic development, deepwater development and many international programs, may take longer, sometimes beyond five years. Nearly 85% of the Company PUDs booked prior to 2000 are in Algeria and are being developed according to an Algerian government approved plan. The remaining PUDs booked prior to 2000 are primarily associated with ongoing programs in the onshore United States for improved recovery. The following data presents the Company PUDs vintage, geographic location and percentage of total proved reserves as of December 31, 2004: Worldwide Proved Undeveloped Reserves PUDs Cumulative Years from Initial Booking (MMBOE) % of PUDs 0 310 36% 1 221 62% 2 64 70% 3 132 86% 4 47 91% 5+ 76 100% Worldwide Proved Undeveloped Reserves Analysis Percentage of PUDs Percentage of Total Proved (MMBOE) Total PUDs Reserves Country United States 551 65 % 23 % Algeria 174 20 % 7 % Other International 66 8 % 3 % Canada 59 7 % 3 % Total 850 100 % 36 % 31 Table of Contents The following graph shows the change in PUDs for each year by comparing the vintage distribution of December 31, 2004 PUDs to the vintage distribution of December 31, 2003 and 2002 PUDs. It illustrates the Company effectiveness in converting PUDs to developed reserves over the periods shown.

The Company history of production growth relative to proved reserve growth is shown below. This data demonstrates the Company ability to convert proved reserves to production in a timely manner. Reserves Converted to Production Proved Reserves Produced (MMBOE) (MBOE/d) 1994 476 112 1995 526 109 1996 601 104 1997 708 120 1998 935 129 1999 991 135 2000 2,061 306 2001 2,305 546 2002 2,328 539 2003 2,513 525 2004 2,367 522 CAGR 17% 17% 32 Table of Contents Future Net Cash Flows At December 31, 2004, the present value (discounted at 10%) of future net revenues from Anadarko proved reserves was $28.4 billion, before income taxes, and $18.6 billion, after income taxes (stated in accordance with the regulations of the SEC and the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)). This present value was calculated based on prices at year-end held flat for the life of the reserves, adjusted for any contractual provisions. The after income taxes decrease of $134 million or 1% in 2004 compared to 2003 is primarily due to divestitures of properties, offset in part by additions of proved reserves related to successful drilling and development and higher natural gas and oil prices at year-end 2004. See Supplemental Information under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. The present value of future net revenues does not purport to be an estimate of the fair market value of Anadarko proved reserves. An estimate of fair value would also take into account, among other things, anticipated changes in future prices and costs, the expected recovery of reserves in excess of proved reserves and a discount factor more representative of the time value of money and the risks inherent in producing oil and gas. Marketing Strategies Overview The Company marketing department actively manages sales of its natural gas, crude oil and NGLs. The Company markets its production to customers at competitive prices, maximizing realized prices while managing credit exposure. The market knowledge gained through the marketing effort is valuable to the corporate decision making process. The Company sales of natural gas, crude oil, condensate and NGLs are generally made at the market prices of those products at the time of sale. Therefore, even though the Company sells significant volumes to major purchasers, the Company believes other purchasers would be willing to buy the Company natural gas, crude oil, condensate and NGLs at comparable market prices. The Company also purchases natural gas, crude oil and NGLs volumes for resale primarily from partners and producers near Anadarko production. These purchases allow the Company to aggregate larger volumes and attract larger, creditworthy customers, which in turn enhance the value of the Company production. The Company may also engage in trading activities for the purpose of generating profits from exposure to changes in market prices of gas, oil, condensate and NGLs. However, the Company does not engage in market-making practices nor does it trade in any non-energy-related commodities. The Company trading risk position, typically, is a net short position that is offset by the Company natural long position as a producer. Essentially all of the Company trading transactions have a term of less than one year and most are less than three months. See Energy Price Risk under Item 7a of this Form 10-K. Since 2002, all segments of the energy market experienced increased scrutiny of their financial condition, liquidity and credit. This has been reflected in rating agency credit downgrades of many merchant energy trading companies. Anadarko has not experienced any material financial losses associated with credit deterioration of third-party purchasers; however, in certain situations the Company has declined to transact with some counterparties and changed its sales terms to require some counterparties to pay in advance or post letters of credit for purchases. Natural Gas Natural gas continues to supply a significant portion of North America energy needs and the Company believes the importance of natural gas in meeting this energy need will continue. The tightening of the natural gas supply and demand fundamentals has resulted in extremely volatile natural gas prices, which is expected to continue. Anadarko markets its equity natural gas production to maximize the commodity value and reduce the inherent risks of the physical commodity markets. Anadarko Energy Services Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of Anadarko, is a marketing company offering supply assurance, competitive pricing, risk management services and other services tailored to its customers needs. The Company sells natural gas under a variety of contracts and may also receive a service fee related to the level of reliability and service required by the customer. The Company has the marketing capability to move large volumes of gas into and out of the daily gas market to take advantage of any price volatility. Included in this strategy is the use of leased natural gas storage facilities and various derivative instruments. In 2004, 2003 and 2002, approximately 12%, 35% and 39%, respectively, of the Company gas production was sold under long-term contracts to Duke Energy Corporation (Duke). These sales represent 6%, 22% and 18% of total revenues in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The contracts that represented most of these volumes expired during 2004. The Company integrated the marketing of the natural gas previously sold to Duke into its 33 Table of Contents current marketing operations and now sells it to various purchasers at market prices. Volumes sold to Duke under the long-term contracts were at market prices. A company Anadarko acquired in 2000 was a party to several long-term firm gas transportation agreements that supported its gas marketing program within its gathering, processing and marketing (GPM) business segment, which was sold in 1999 to Duke. Most of these agreements were transferred to Duke in the GPM disposition. One agreement was retained, but is managed and operated by Duke. Anadarko is not responsible for the operations of the contracts and does not utilize the associated transportation assets to transport the Company natural gas. As part of the GPM disposition, Anadarko pays Duke if transportation market values fall below the fixed contract transportation rates, while Duke pays Anadarko if the transportation market values exceed the contract transportation rates (keep-whole agreement). This keep-whole agreement will be in effect until the earlier of each contract expiration date or February 2009. The Company may periodically use derivative instruments to reduce its exposure to potential decreases in future transportation market values. While derivatives are intended to reduce the Company exposure to declines in the market value of firm transportation, they also limit the potential to benefit from increases in the market value of firm transportation. The fair value of the short-term portion of the firm transportation keep-whole agreement is calculated based on quoted natural gas basis prices. Basis is the difference in value between gas at various delivery points and the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) gas futures contract price. Management believes that natural gas basis price quotes beyond the next 12 months are not reliable indicators of fair value due to decreasing liquidity. Accordingly, the fair value of the long-term portion is estimated based on historical natural gas basis prices. Crude Oil, Condensate and NGLs Anadarko crude oil, condensate and NGLs revenues are derived from production in the U.S., Canada, Algeria and other international areas. Most of the Company U.S. crude oil and NGLs production is sold under 30-day evergreen contracts with prices based on marketing indices and adjusted for location, quality and transportation. Most of the Company Canadian oil production is sold on a term basis of one year or greater. Oil from Algeria and other international areas is sold by tanker as Saharan Blend to customers primarily in the Mediterranean area. Saharan Blend is a high quality crude that provides refiners with large quantities of premium products like high quality jet and diesel fuel. The Company also purchases and sells third-party produced crude oil, condensate and NGLs in the Company domestic and international market areas. Included in this strategy is the use of various derivative instruments. Gas Gathering Systems and Processing Anadarko investment in gas gathering operations allows the Company to better manage its gas production, improve ultimate recovery of reserves, enhance the value of gas production and expand marketing opportunities. The Company has invested about $204 million to build or acquire gas gathering systems over the last five years. The vast majority of the gas flowing through these systems is from Anadarko operated wells. The Company processes gas at various third-party plants under agreements generally structured to provide for the extraction of NGLs in efficient plants with flexible commitments. Anadarko also processes gas and has interests in two Company-operated plants. Anadarko strategy to aggregate gas through Company-owned and third-party gathering systems allows Anadarko to secure processing arrangements in each of the regions where the Company has significant production. Capital Resources and Liquidity Overview Anadarko primary sources of cash during 2004 included cash flow from operating activities and proceeds from the sale of non-core assets. The Company used these sources primarily to fund its capital spending program, reduce debt, repurchase Anadarko common stock, increase cash and pay dividends to the stockholders. The Company funded its capital investment programs in 2003 primarily through cash flow and in 2002 primarily through cash flow plus increases in long-term debt and proceeds from property sales. 34 Table of Contents Cash Flow from Operating Activities Anadarko cash flow from operating activities in 2004 was $3.2 billion compared to $3.0 billion in 2003 and $2.2 billion in 2002. The increase in 2004 cash flow is primarily attributed to higher commodity prices, partially offset by higher costs and expenses. Also, although the property divestitures resulted in no gain or loss recognition for financial reporting purposes, 2004 cash flow was reduced by about $440 million of current income taxes associated with the divestiture program. This increase in current tax expense was offset by a reduction in deferred tax expense. The increase in 2003 cash flow compared to 2002 is attributed to the significant increase in commodity prices. Fluctuations in commodity prices have been the primary reason for the Company short-term changes in cash flow from operating activities. Anadarko holds derivative instruments to help manage commodity price risk. Sales volume changes can also impact cash flow in the short-term, but have not been as volatile as commodity prices in the past. Sales volume decreases associated with divestitures made during 2004 are expected to result in lower cash flow from operating activities. Anadarko long-term cash flow from operating activities is dependent on commodity prices, reserve replacement and the level of costs and expenses required for continued operations. Divestitures The Company completed over $3 billion in various pretax asset sales during 2004. Income taxes paid in conjunction with these transactions were about $440 million. For additional information see Refocused Strategy. Sale of Future Hard Minerals Royalty Revenues In 2004, the Company entered into an agreement whereby it sold a portion of its future royalties associated with existing coal and trona leases to a third party for $158 million, net of transaction costs. For additional information see Note 10 Sale of Future Hard Minerals Royalty Revenues of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Capital Expenditures The following table shows the Company capital expenditures by category. 2004 2003 2002 millions Development $ 2,348 $ 1,846 $ 1,200 Exploration 513 713 861 Property acquisition Development 3 203 277 Exploration 155 124 377 Total oil and gas costs incurred* 3,019 2,886 2,715 Less: Asset retirement costs (52 ) (187 ) Plus: Asset retirement expenditures 26 20 Less: Corporate acquisitions (405 ) Total oil and gas capital expenditures* 2,993 2,719 2,310 Gathering and other 97 73 78 Total capital expenditures $ 3,090 $ 2,792 $ 2,388 * Oil and gas costs incurred represent capitalized costs related to finding and developing oil and gas reserves. Capital expenditures represent actual cash outlays excluding corporate acquisitions. In 2004, Anadarko capital spending increased 11% compared to 2003 primarily due to increases in service and material costs. The variances in the mix of oil and gas spending reflect the Company available opportunities based on the near-term ranking of projects by net asset value potential. In 2003, Anadarko capital spending increased 17% compared to 2002. The increase in development spending and the decrease in exploration spending reflect the Company decision to direct capital to the areas that have shown the best performance and rate of return, primarily the Lower 48 states, during periods of higher prices. The acquisitions in 2004 primarily relate to exploratory non-producing leases. The acquisitions in 2003 and 2002 primarily relate to the acquisition of producing properties and exploratory non-producing leases. Anadarko participated in a total of 1,069 gross wells in both 2004 and 2003 compared to 949 gross wells in 2002. The increase in activity during 2003 reflected the Company increase in spending for development drilling in response to higher commodity prices in 2003. 35 Table of Contents The following table provides additional detail of the Company drilling activity in 2004 and 2003. Gas Oil Dry Total 2004 Exploratory Gross 66 11 27 104 Net 45.3 6.5 16.9 68.7 2004 Development Gross 710 239 16 965 Net 494.8 159.5 8.3 662.6 2003 Exploratory Gross 87 22 38 147 Net 71.0 18.3 27.3 116.6 2003 Development Gross 620 277 25 922 Net 454.3 189.0 21.2 664.5 Gross: total wells in which there was participation. Net: working interest ownership. The Company 2004 exploration and development drilling program is discussed in Oil and Gas Properties and Activities under Item 1 of this Form 10-K. Debt At year-end 2004, Anadarko total debt was $3.8 billion compared to total debt of $5.1 billion at year-end 2003 and $5.5 billion at year-end 2002. During 2004, Anadarko repurchased $1.2 billion aggregate principal amount of its outstanding debt. The Company used net proceeds from asset divestitures to fund the debt reductions. The decrease in debt in 2003 was funded primarily with excess cash flow and proceeds from asset divestitures. For additional information on the Company debt instruments, such as transactions during the period, years of maturity and interest rates, see Note 8 Debt and Interest Expense of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Common Stock Repurchase Program In 2004, the Company announced a stock buyback program to purchase up to $2 billion in shares of common stock. Shares may be repurchased either in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. During 2004, Anadarko purchased 20.3 million shares of common stock for $1.3 billion under the program. The Company expects to repurchase between $100 million and $200 million of common stock in the first quarter of 2005 and intends to purchase additional shares as excess cash flow is realized and as debt less cash (net debt) per barrel of oil equivalent targets are achieved and maintained. Dividends In January 2005, the Board of Directors of Anadarko declared a quarterly dividend on the Company common stock of 18 cents per share. This represents a 29% increase over the dividend paid in each of the previous five quarters. The amount of future dividends for Anadarko common stock will depend on earnings, financial conditions, capital requirements and other factors, and will be determined by the Board of Directors on a quarterly basis. In 2004, Anadarko paid $139 million in dividends to its common stockholders (14 cents per share per quarter). In 2003, Anadarko paid $109 million in dividends to its common stockholders (10 cents per share in the first, second and third quarters and 14 cents per share in the fourth quarter). The dividend amount paid to its common stockholders in 2002 was $80 million (7.5 cents per share in the first, second and third quarters and 10 cents per share in the fourth quarter). Anadarko has paid a dividend to its common stockholders continuously since becoming an independent company in 1986. The Company credit agreement allows for a maximum capitalization ratio of 60% debt, exclusive of the effect of any noncash writedowns. As of December 31, 2004, Anadarko capitalization ratio was 29% debt. Under the maximum debt capitalization ratio, retained earnings were not restricted as to the payment of dividends at December 31, 2004. In 2004, 2003 and 2002, the Company also paid $5 million, $5 million and $6 million, respectively, in preferred stock dividends. In 2005, preferred stock dividends are expected to be $5 million. 36 Table of Contents Outlook The Company goals include continuing to find high-margin oil and gas reserves at competitive prices, managing commodity price risk and keeping operating costs at efficient levels. The Company 2005 capital expenditure budget has been set between $2.7 billion and $3.0 billion, essentially flat with 2004. The Company has allocated about 65% of the budget to development activities, 25% to exploration activities and the remaining 10% for capitalized interest, overhead and other items. Development spending in 2005 will focus on unconventional tight gas plays in the Vernon field in north Louisiana and Wild River in Alberta, Canada, and on delineating new plays in Texas and Louisiana. In the Gulf of Mexico, Anadarko will focus on delineation drilling and facilities installation in the deepwater. In Alaska, the Company is expanding the Alpine facility to increase capacity. The Company efforts will also focus on development of Block 208 discoveries in Algeria. Exploration spending in 2005 will focus on a number of key areas in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. In addition, the Company will explore for deep gas objectives onshore in the U.S. and in Canada. International exploration will focus on drilling programs in Algeria, Qatar, Tunisia and Indonesia, as well as activities within other targeted new venture areas. The Company expects steady funding of the capital program regardless of oil and gas price volatility. Anadarko refocused strategy is designed to enable a capital program that is self-funding at mid-cycle oil and gas prices. When prices exceed mid-cycle levels, as is currently the case, the excess cash would be systematically used to build additional balance sheet strength through debt reductions, returned to shareholders through stock repurchases, and otherwise be made available for reinvestment in other strategic options. Alternatively, when prices are below the Company mid-cycle targets, Anadarko could draw upon its strengthened debt capacity to fund a steady level of activity. The Company 2005 capital spending noted above was determined at an investment level that is less than cash flow using recent NYMEX prices. Therefore, cash flow in 2005 is expected to be higher than capital spending. The Company intends to use a portion of year-end 2004 cash balances and a portion of expected 2005 excess cash flow to repurchase common stock and pay down debt. If capital expenditures exceed operating cash flow, funds are supplemented as needed by short-term borrowings under commercial paper, money market loans or credit agreement borrowings. To facilitate such borrowings, the Company has in place a $750 million committed credit agreement, which is supplemented by various noncommitted credit lines that may be offered by certain banks from time to time at then-quoted rates. As of December 31, 2004, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under its credit facility. It is the Company policy to limit commercial paper borrowing to levels that are fully back-stopped by unused balances from its committed credit facilities. The Company may choose to refinance certain portions of these short-term borrowings by issuing long-term debt in the public or private debt markets. To facilitate such financings, the Company may file shelf registration statements in advance with the SEC. The Company continuously monitors its debt position and coordinates its capital expenditure program with expected cash flows and projected debt repayment schedules. The Company will continue to evaluate funding alternatives, including property sales and additional borrowings, to secure funds when needed. At this time, Anadarko has no plans to issue common stock other than through its Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan, the Executives and Directors Benefits Trust, the exercise of stock options, the issuance of restricted stock or the Company Employee Savings Plan and Employee Stock Ownership Plan equity funded contributions. See Regulatory Matters and Additional Factors Affecting Business for additional information. 37 Table of Contents Obligations and Commitments Following is a summary of the Company future payments on obligations as of December 31, 2004: Obligations by Period 2-3 4-5 Later 1 Year Years Years Years Total millions Total debt* $ 170 $ 265 $ 457 $ 3,074 $ 3,966 Operating leases 67 133 109 81 390 Transportation and storage 73 97 77 176 423 Oil and gas activities 69 12 81 * Holders of the Zero Yield Puttable Contingent Debt Securities (ZYP-CODES) due 2021 may put the remaining $30 million principal amount of the ZYP-CODES to the Company in 2006. This debt instrument has been reflected in the 2-3 years column in the table above. Operating Leases During 2004, Anadarko and a group of energy companies (Atwater Valley Producers Group) executed agreements with a third party to design, construct, install and own Independence Hub, a semi-submersible platform in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. The platform structure, expected to be mechanically complete in late 2006, will be operated by Anadarko. First production from Anadarko discoveries to be processed on the facility is expected in the latter half of 2007. The agreements require a monthly demand charge of about $2 million for five years beginning at the time of mechanical completion, a processing fee based upon production throughput and a transportation fee based upon pipeline throughput. Since the Company obligation related to the agreements begins at the time of mechanical completion, the table above does not include any amounts related to these agreements. The agreements do not contain any purchase options, purchase obligations or value guarantees. During 2003, the Company two corporate office buildings located in The Woodlands, Texas, were acquired by a wholly-owned subsidiary of a major financial institution from the special purpose entities that had leased the buildings to the Company. The original leases were amended and restated, and, other than the extension of the period of the lease, the terms of the replacement lease between the Company and the real estate development company were essentially unchanged. The total amount funded under the new lease was approximately $214 million. The table above includes lease payment obligations related to this lease under operating leases. In 2002, the Company entered into an agreement under which a floating production platform for its Marco Polo discovery in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico was installed in 2004. The agreement requires a monthly demand charge of slightly over $2 million for five years and a processing fee based upon production throughput. Anadarko began making payments for the monthly demand charges during 2004. The table above includes the payment obligations related to the monthly demand charge for this agreement in operating leases. For additional information see Note 21 Commitments of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Transportation and Storage Anadarko has entered into various transportation and storage agreements in order to access markets and provide flexibility for the sale of its natural gas and crude oil in certain areas. The above table includes transportation and storage commitments of $423 million, comprised of $304 million in the United States and $119 million in Canada. Oil and Gas Activities As is common in the oil and gas industry, Anadarko has various contractual commitments pertaining to exploration, development and production activities. The Company has work related commitments for, among other things, drilling wells, obtaining and processing seismic and fulfilling rig commitments. The above table includes drilling and work related commitments of $81 million comprised of $2 million in the United States, $2 million in Canada, $30 million in Algeria and $47 million in other international locations, that are not included in the 2005 budget. 38 Table of Contents Marketing and Trading Contracts The following tables provide additional information regarding the Company marketing and trading portfolio of physical delivery and financially settled derivative contracts and the firm transportation keep-whole agreement and related financial derivative instruments as of December 31, 2004. See Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates for an explanation of how the fair value for derivatives is calculated.

Margin deposits are required of the Company whenever its unrealized losses with a counterparty exceed predetermined credit limits. Given the Company hedge position and price volatility, the Company may be required from time to time to advance cash to its counterparties in order to satisfy these margin deposit requirements. During 2004, the Company margin deposit requirements have ranged from zero to $10 million. The Company had margin deposits of $9 million outstanding at December 31, 2004. Other In 2004, the Company made contributions of $77 million to its funded pension plans, $39 million to its unfunded pension plans and $7 million to its unfunded other postretirement benefit plans. Contributions to the funded plans increase the plan assets while contributions to unfunded plans are used for current benefit payments. In 2005, the Company expects to contribute about $60 million to its funded pension plans, $4 million to its unfunded pension plans and $7 million to its unfunded other postretirement benefit plans. Future contributions to funded pension plans will be affected by actuarial assumptions, market performance and individual year funding decisions. The Company is unable to accurately predict what contribution levels will be required beyond 2005 for the pension plans; however, they are expected to be at levels lower than those made in 2004. The Company expects future payments for other postretirement benefit plans to continue at slightly increasing levels above those made in 2004. During 2004, proceeds from the sale of future royalty revenues were accounted for as deferred revenues and classified as liabilities on the balance sheet. These deferred revenues will be amortized to other sales on a unit-of-revenue basis over the 11-year term of the related agreement. The third party relies solely on the royalty payments 39 Table of Contents to recover their investment and, as such, has the risk of the royalties not being sufficient to recover their investment over the term of the agreement. Anadarko is also subject to various environmental remediation and reclamation obligations arising from federal, state and local laws and regulations. As of December 31, 2004, the Company balance sheet included a $43 million liability for remediation and reclamation obligations, most of which were incurred by companies that Anadarko has acquired. The Company continually monitors the liability recorded and the remediation and reclamation process, and believes the amount recorded is appropriate. For additional information see Regulatory Matters and Additional Factors Affecting Business Environmental and Safety . For additional information on contracts, obligations and arrangements the Company enters into from time to time, see Note 8 Debt and Interest Expense, Note 9 Financial Instruments, Note 10 Sale of Future Hard Minerals Royalty Revenues, Note 11 Asset Retirement Obligations, Note 22 Pension Plans, Other Postretirement Benefits and Employee Savings Plans and Note 23 Contingencies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Financial Statements and Use of Estimates In preparing financial statements, Management makes informed judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, Management reviews its estimates, including those related to litigation, environmental liabilities, income taxes, fair value and determination of proved reserves. Changes in facts and circumstances may result in revised estimates and actual results may differ from these estimates. Properties and Equipment The Company uses the full cost method of accounting for exploration and development activities as defined by the SEC. Under this method of accounting, the costs of unsuccessful, as well as successful, exploration and development activities are capitalized as properties and equipment. This includes any internal costs that are directly related to exploration and development activities but does not include any costs related to production, general corporate overhead or similar activities. Effective with the adoption of SFAS No. 143 in 2003, the carrying amount of oil and gas properties also includes estimated asset retirement costs recorded based on the fair value of the asset retirement obligation when incurred. Gain or loss on the sale or other disposition of oil and gas properties is not recognized, unless the gain or loss would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves of oil and natural gas attributable to a country. The application of the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas properties generally results in higher capitalized costs and higher DD&A rates compared to the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas properties. Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization The depreciable base for oil and gas properties includes the sum of capitalized costs net of accumulated DD&A, estimated future development costs and asset retirement costs not accrued in oil and gas properties, less costs excluded from amortization and salvage. The depreciable base of oil and gas properties and mineral investments are amortized using the unit-of-production method. All other properties are stated at original cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the useful life of the assets, which ranges from three to 40 years. Properties and equipment carrying values do not purport to represent replacement or market values. Proved Reserves Proved oil and gas reserves, as defined by SEC Regulation S-X Rule 4-10(a) (2i), (2ii), (2iii), (3) and (4), are the estimated quantities of crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions, i.e., prices and costs as of the date the estimate is made. Prices include consideration of changes in existing prices provided only by contractual arrangements, but not on escalations based upon future conditions. The Company estimates of proved reserves are made using all available geological and reservoir data as well as production performance data. These estimates, made by the Company engineers, are reviewed annually and revised, either upward or downward, as warranted by additional data. Revisions are necessary due to changes in, among other things, reservoir performance, prices, economic conditions and governmental restrictions. Decreases in prices, for example, may cause a reduction in some proved reserves due to reaching economic limits 40 Table of Contents sooner. A material change in the estimated volumes of reserves could have an impact on the DD&A rate calculation and the financial statements. Under the terms of Anadarko risk service contract with the national oil company of Venezuela, Anadarko earns a fee that is translated into barrels of oil based on current prices (economic interest method). This means that higher oil prices reduce the Company reported production volumes and reserves from that project and lower oil prices increase reported production volumes and reserves. Production volume and reserve changes due to the prices used to determine the Company economic interest have no impact on the value of the project. Costs Excluded Oil and gas properties include costs that are excluded from capitalized costs being amortized. These amounts represent investments in unproved properties and major development projects. Anadarko excludes these costs on a country-by-country basis until proved reserves are found or until it is determined that the costs are impaired. All costs excluded are reviewed at least quarterly to determine if impairment has occurred. The amount of any impairment is transferred to the capitalized costs being amortized (the DD&A pool) or a charge is made against earnings for those international operations where a reserve base has not yet been established. Impairments transferred to the DD&A pool increase the DD&A rate for that country. For international operations where a reserve base has not yet been established, an impairment requiring a charge to earnings may be indicated through evaluation of drilling results, relinquishing drilling rights or other information. Costs excluded for oil and gas properties are generally classified and evaluated as significant or individually insignificant properties. Significant properties, primarily comprised of costs associated with domestic offshore blocks, Alaska, the Land Grant and other international areas, are individually evaluated each quarter by the Company exploration and engineering staff. Nonproducing leases are evaluated based on the progress of the Company exploration program to date. Exploration costs are transferred to the DD&A pool upon completion of drilling individual wells. The Company has a 10 to 12 year exploration and evaluation program for the Land Grant acreage. Costs are transferred accordingly to the DD&A pool over the length of the program. The Land Grant mineral interests (both working and royalty interests) are owned by the Company in perpetuity. All other significant properties are evaluated over a five- to ten- year period, depending on the lease term. Insignificant properties are comprised primarily of costs associated with onshore properties in the United States and Canada. Nonproducing leases are transferred to the DD&A pool over a three- to five- year period based on the average lease term. Exploration costs are transferred to the DD&A pool upon completion of evaluation. Capitalized Interest SFAS No. 34, Capitalization of Interest Cost, provides standards for the capitalization of interest cost as part of the historical cost of acquiring assets. Under FASB Interpretation No. 33 Applying FASB Statement No. 34 to Oil and Gas Producing Operations Accounted for by the Full Cost Method, costs of investments in unproved properties and major development projects, on which DD&A expense is not currently taken and on which exploration or development activities are in progress, qualify for capitalization of interest. Capitalized interest is calculated by multiplying the Company weighted-average interest rate on debt by the amount of qualifying costs excluded. Capitalized interest cannot exceed gross interest expense. As costs excluded are transferred to the DD&A pool, the associated capitalized interest is also transferred to the DD&A pool. Ceiling Test Companies that use the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas exploration and development activities are required to perform a ceiling test each quarter. The full cost ceiling test is an impairment test prescribed by SEC Regulation S-X Rule 4-10. The ceiling test is performed on a country-by-country basis. The test determines a limit, or ceiling, on the book value of oil and gas properties. That limit is basically the after tax present value of the future net cash flows from proved crude oil and natural gas reserves, including the effect of cash flow hedges and excluding future cash outflows associated with settling asset retirement obligations that have been accrued on the balance sheet. This ceiling is compared to the net book value of the oil and gas properties reduced by any related net deferred income tax liability. If the net book value reduced by the related deferred income taxes exceeds the ceiling, an impairment or noncash writedown is required. A ceiling test impairment can give Anadarko a significant loss for a particular period; however, future DD&A expense would be reduced. For cash flow hedge effect information, see Supplemental Information Discounted Future Net Cash Flows under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. 41 Table of Contents Derivative Instruments The vast majority of the derivative instruments utilized by Anadarko are in conjunction with its marketing and trading activities or to manage the price risk attributed to the Company expected oil and gas production. Anadarko also periodically uses derivatives to manage its exposure associated with the firm transportation keep-whole agreement, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. All derivatives, other than those that meet the normal purchases and sales exception, are carried on the balance sheet at fair value. Anadarko prefers to apply hedge accounting for derivatives utilized to manage price risk associated with the Company oil and gas production, foreign currency exchange rate risk and interest rate risk. However, some of these derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting. In these instances, unrealized gains and losses are recognized currently in earnings. For those derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting, Anadarko formally documents the relationship of each hedge to the hedged item including the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge. Each hedge is also assessed for effectiveness quarterly. Under hedge accounting, the derivatives may be designated as a hedge of exposure to changes in fair values, cash flows or foreign currencies. If the hedge relates to the exposure of fair value changes to a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment, the unrealized gains and losses on the derivative and the unrealized losses and gains on the hedged item are both recognized currently in earnings. If the hedge relates to exposure of variability in the cash flow of a forecasted transaction, the effective portion of the unrealized gains and losses on the derivative is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same period the hedged transaction is recorded. The ineffective portion of unrealized gains and losses attributable to cash flow hedges, if any, is recognized currently in other (income) expense. Hedge ineffectiveness is that portion of the hedge unrealized gains and losses that exceed the hedged item unrealized losses and gains. In those instances where it becomes probable that a hedged forecasted transaction will not occur, the unrealized gain or loss is reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to earnings in the current period. Accounting for unrealized gains and losses attributable to foreign currency hedges that qualify for hedge accounting is dependent on whether the hedge is a fair value or a cash flow hedge. Unrealized gains and losses attributable to derivative instruments used in the Company marketing and trading activities (including both physical delivery and financially settled purchase and sales contracts), the firm transportation keep-whole agreement and derivatives used to manage the exposure of the keep-whole agreement are recognized currently in earnings. The marketing and trading unrealized gains and losses that are attributable to the Company production are recorded to gas sales and oil and condensate sales. The marketing and trading unrealized gains and losses that are attributable to third-party production are recorded to other sales. The gains and losses attributable to the firm transportation keep-whole agreement and associated derivatives are recorded to other (income) expense. The Company derivative instruments are generally either exchange traded or valued by reference to a commodity that is traded in a liquid market. Valuation is determined by reference to readily available public data. Option valuations are based on the Black-Scholes option pricing model and verified against third-party quotations. The fair value of the short-term portion of the firm transportation keep-whole agreement is calculated based on quoted natural gas basis prices. Basis is the difference in value between gas at various delivery points and the NYMEX gas futures contract price. Management believes that natural gas basis price quotes beyond the next 12 months are not reliable indicators of fair value due to decreasing liquidity. Accordingly, the fair value of the long-term portion is estimated based on an internally developed model that utilizes historical natural gas basis prices. Recent Accounting Developments Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Staff Position (FSP) FAS 109-1, Application of FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, to the Tax Deduction on Qualified Production Activities Provided by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, provides guidance on the application of SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, to the tax deduction on qualified production as provided for in the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (Jobs Act). FSP FAS 109-1 provides that the deduction should be treated as a special deduction under paragraph 231 of SFAS No. 109. This deduction takes effect beginning in 2005 and therefore, has no impact on the current year financial statements. FSP FAS 109-2, Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, provides guidance on the application of SFAS No. 109 to the 42 Table of Contents special one-time dividends received deduction on the repatriation of certain foreign earnings to a U.S. taxpayer as provided for in the Jobs Act. Due to the lack of clarification related to this provision of the Jobs Act, this FSP allows additional time beyond the financial reporting period of enactment to evaluate the impact of this provision as it relates to SFAS No. 109. The Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) is considering issues related to whether buy/sell arrangements with the same counterparty for the same commodity should be accounted for at historical cost or fair value. EITF Issue No. 04-13, Accounting for Purchases and Sales of Inventory with the Same Counterparty, does not reach a consensus on these issues and further discussion is planned. In addition, the SEC has questioned the appropriateness of reporting the proceeds and costs of buy/sell arrangements on a gross basis in the income statement. Anadarko accounts for buy/sell arrangements related to its production on a net basis in the income statement. If gross basis reporting were required, both revenues and costs and expenses would increase. Regulatory Matters and Additional Factors Affecting Business Forward Looking Statements The Company has made in this report, and may from time to time otherwise make in other public filings, press releases and discussions with Company management, forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 concerning the Company operations, economic performance and financial condition. These forward looking statements include information concerning future production and reserves, schedules, plans, timing of development, contributions from oil and gas properties, and those statements preceded by, followed by or that otherwise include the words believes, expects, anticipates, intends, estimates, projects, target, goal, plans, objective, should or similar expressions or variations on such expressions. For such statements, the Company claims the protection of the safe harbor for forward looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties, and actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements due to a number of factors in addition to those discussed below and elsewhere in this Form 10-K and in the Company other public filings, press releases and discussions with Company management. Anadarko undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements. Commodity Pricing and Demand Crude oil prices continue to be affected by political developments worldwide, pricing decisions and production quotas of OPEC and the volatile trading patterns in the commodity futures markets. In addition, in OPEC countries in which Anadarko has production such as Algeria, Venezuela and Qatar, when the world oil market is weak, the Company may be subject to periods of decreased production due to government mandated cutbacks. Natural gas prices also continue to be highly volatile. In periods of sharply lower commodity prices, the Company may curtail production and capital spending projects, as well as delay or defer drilling wells in certain areas because of lower cash flows. Changes in crude oil and natural gas prices can impact the Company determination of proved reserves and the Company calculation of the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to oil and gas reserves. In addition, demand for oil and gas in the U.S. and worldwide may affect the Company level of production. Under the full cost method of accounting, a noncash charge to earnings related to the carrying value of the Company oil and gas properties on a country-by-country basis may be required when prices are low. Whether the Company will be required to take such a charge depends on the prices for crude oil and natural gas at the end of any quarter, as well as the effect of both capital expenditures and changes to proved reserves during that quarter. While this noncash charge can give Anadarko a significant reported loss for the period, future expenses for DD&A will be reduced. Environmental and Safety The Company oil and gas operations and properties are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection from the time oil and gas projects commence until abandonment. These laws and regulations govern, among other things, the amounts and types of substances and materials that may be released into the environment, the issuance of permits in connection with exploration, drilling and production activities, the release of emissions into the atmosphere, the discharge and disposition of generated waste materials, offshore oil and gas operations, the reclamation and abandonment of wells and facility sites and the remediation of contaminated sites. In addition, these laws and 43 Table of Contents regulations may impose substantial liabilities for the Company failure to comply with them or for any contamination resulting from the Company operations. The Board of Directors and Management of the Company regularly review the risks facing Anadarko business, including the environmental and regulatory matters associated with the Company operations. The Company has formed a Climate Change Committee (Committee) composed of employees representing disciplines across the Company to address greenhouse gas (GHG) issues. The Committee, through Management, reports annually to the Board of Directors Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee as part of that committee annual review of governance matters so that the Board can play a direct role in assessing how the Company is evaluating and responding to climate change issues and GHG emissions. Additionally, the Company has adopted a GHG management plan, which addresses the management of emissions of CO 2 and methane on all of the Company worldwide operating locations, and provides for the ongoing collection of baseline GHG emissions data. The Company plan describes specific actions that the Company has taken and plans to take in order to meet the goals and objectives of these programs. More information concerning the Company climate change initiatives, including the Committee charter and an executive summary of the GHG management plan, can be found on the Company website, www.anadarko.com, under the Responsibility , Environmental, Health & Safety and Global Climate Change links. Anadarko participates in voluntary GHG programs as a member of certain trade organizations both in the United States and Canada. Through a Canadian subsidiary, Anadarko has since 1995 voluntarily submitted GHG data into the Voluntary Challenge and Registry, Inc. Program sponsored by the Canadian government. The Company is a partner in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Natural Gas STAR Program and is participating in the American Petroleum Institute Climate Challenge Program. Through these programs, the Company is formulating a plan for the assessment of emission sources which will include determination of the protocol for measurement to develop an accurate baseline in the United States. As part of its commitment to protecting the environment, Anadarko is working with the U.S. Department of Energy and the scientific community to study the long-term storage of CO 2 in its enhanced oil recovery projects. CO 2 is produced along with natural gas in certain fields and the CO 2 has historically been vented to the atmosphere. However, through its CO 2 sequestration projects in Wyoming and Canada, reinjecting this CO 2 in the Company projects will reduce the amount of greenhouse gases introduced into the atmosphere. Anadarko expects to sequester about 29 million tons of CO 2 over the lifetime of the Salt Creek and Monell projects in Wyoming. The Alpine field also serves as an excellent example of Anadarko commitment to minimizing the impact of exploration and production operations in environmentally sensitive and logistically challenging areas. The production facilities for the Alpine field are situated on about 100 acres, less than one-half of one percent of the subsurface reservoir area being developed. In addition, Alpine is a zero discharge facility; the waste generated is reused, recycled or disposed of properly. Anadarko is also committed to protecting the environment in its coalbed methane activities by reinjecting the majority of produced water and, where appropriate, proactively working with state and federal agencies to develop new water treatment and handling technologies for the beneficial use of produced coalbed water. Anadarko takes the issue of environmental stewardship very seriously and works diligently to comply with applicable environmental and safety rules and regulations. Wherever Anadarko operates, its policy is to adhere to each individual country applicable laws and regulations as well as Anadarko own environmental standards. Anadarko maintains this same level of compliance in countries that are signatories to the Kyoto Protocol. Neither Anadarko nor any of the Company peers yet know the regulatory obligations that may be imposed with regard to GHG emissions. At this time, attempts to assess impacts on stockholder value can only be speculative. The Company does not expect climate change to be a material strategic business issue for the next five to seven years; however, this assessment may change as Anadarko continues to review the issues surrounding GHG emissions and climate change. Compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations has not had a material effect on the Company operations or financial condition in the past. However, because environmental laws and regulations are becoming increasingly more stringent, there can be no assurances that such laws and regulations or any environmental law or regulation enacted in the future will not have a material effect on the Company operations or financial condition. For a description of certain environmental proceedings in which the Company is involved, see Legal Proceedings under Item 3 of this Form 10-K. 44 Table of Contents Exploration and Operating Risks The Company business is subject to all of the operating risks normally associated with the exploration for and production of oil and gas, including blowouts, cratering and fire, any of which could result in damage to, or destruction of, oil and gas wells or formations or production facilities and other property and injury to persons. As protection against financial loss resulting from these operating hazards, the Company maintains insurance coverage, including certain physical damage, employer liability, comprehensive general liability and worker compensation insurance. Although Anadarko is not insured against all risks in all aspects of its business, such as political risk, business interruption risk and risk of major terrorist attacks, the Company believes that the coverage it maintains is customary for companies engaged in similar operations. The occurrence of a significant event against which the Company is not fully insured could have a material adverse effect on the Company financial position. Development Risks The Company is involved in several large development projects. Key factors that may affect the timing and outcome of such projects include: project approvals by joint venture partners; timely issuance of permits and licenses by governmental agencies; manufacturing and delivery schedules of critical equipment; and commercial arrangements for pipelines and related equipment to transport and market hydrocarbons. In large development projects, these uncertainties are usually resolved, but delays and differences between estimated and actual timing of critical events are commonplace and may, therefore, affect the forward looking statements related to large development projects. Domestic Governmental Risks The domestic operations of the Company have been, and at times in the future may be, affected by political developments and by federal, state and local laws and regulations such as restrictions on production, changes in taxes, royalties and other amounts payable to governments or governmental agencies, price or gathering rate controls and environmental protection regulations. Foreign Operations Risk The Company operations in areas outside the U.S. are subject to various risks inherent in foreign operations. These risks may include, among other things, loss of revenue, property and equipment as a result of hazards such as expropriation, war, insurrection and other political risks, increases in taxes and governmental royalties, renegotiation of contracts with governmental entities, changes in laws and policies governing operations of foreign-based companies, currency restrictions and exchange rate fluctuations and other uncertainties arising out of foreign government sovereignty over the Company international operations. The Company international operations may also be adversely affected by laws and policies of the United States affecting foreign trade and taxation. To date, the Company international operations have not been materially affected by these risks. Competition The oil and gas business is highly competitive in the search for and acquisition of reserves and in the gathering and marketing of oil and gas production. The Company competitors include major oil and gas companies, independent oil and gas companies, individual producers, gas marketers and major pipeline companies, as well as participants in other industries supplying energy and fuel to industrial, commercial and individual consumers. Some of the Company competitors may have greater and more diverse resources upon which to draw than does Anadarko. If the Company is not successful in its competition for oil and gas reserves or in its marketing of production, the Company financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. Other Regulatory agencies in certain states and countries have authority to issue permits for seismic exploration and the drilling of wells, regulate well spacing, prevent the waste of oil and gas resources through proration and regulate environmental matters. Operations conducted by the Company on federal oil and gas leases must comply with numerous regulatory restrictions, including various nondiscrimination statutes. Additionally, certain operations must be conducted pursuant to appropriate permits issued by the Bureau of Land Management and the Minerals Management Service of the U.S. Department of the Interior. In addition to the standard permit process, federal leases and most international concessions require a complete environmental impact assessment prior to authorizing an exploration or development plan. Any significant increase in costs associated with regulatory compliance or restrictions imposed on the Company operations by regulation may adversely affect the Company financial condition and results of operations. 45 Table of Contents Legal Proceedings General The Company is a defendant in a number of lawsuits and is involved in governmental proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business, including, but not limited to, personal injury claims, royalty claims, contract claims and environmental claims. While the ultimate outcome and impact on the Company cannot be predicted with certainty, Management believes that the resolution of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position of the Company, although results of operations and cash flow could be significantly impacted in the reporting periods in which such matters are resolved. For a description of certain legal proceedings in which the Company is involved, see Legal Proceedings under Item 3 of this Form 10-K.
