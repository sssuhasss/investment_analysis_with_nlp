Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with Item 6 Selected Financial Data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this 2017 Form 10-K. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause our actual results to differ materially from management's expectations. Factors that could cause such differences include those set forth under Part I, Item 1 Business and Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors , as well as Forward-Looking Statements discussed earlier in this 2017 Form 10-K. OVERVIEW Introduction WellCare Health Plans, Inc. (the "Company," "we," "us," "our") focuses exclusively on government-sponsored managed care services, primarily through Medicaid, Medicare Advantage ("MA") and Medicare Prescription Drug Plans ("PDP") to families, children, seniors and individuals with complex medical needs. As of December 31, 2017 , we served approximately 4.4 million members. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, we operated Medicaid health plans in Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Kentucky, Missouri, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, South Carolina and Texas. We began serving Medicaid and Medicare members in Arizona, effective December 31, 2016, in connection with the acquisition of Care1st Health Plan Arizona, Inc. and One Care by Care1st Health Plan of Arizona, Inc. (together "Care1st Arizona"). Effective January 1, 2017, we began serving Medicaid members statewide in Nebraska. As of December 31, 2017, we operated MA coordinated care plans ("CCPs") in Arizona, Arkansas, California, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Mississippi, New Jersey, New York, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas, as well as stand-alone Medicare prescription drug plans ("PDP") nationwide. Effective January 1, 2018, we expanded our MA service area into the state of North Carolina. Summary of Consolidated Financial Results Summarized below are the key financial highlights for the year ended December 31, 2017 . For additional information, refer to the "Results of Operations" section, which discusses both consolidated and segment results. Membership increased by 473,000 members or 12.1% in 2017 compared with 2016, as discussed below in " Results of Operations ." The growth was primarily driven by an increase in Medicaid Health Plans organic membership in our Missouri and Nebraska markets; increased Medicare Health Plans membership reflecting the addition of approximately 119,000 MA members from the Universal American Corp. ("Universal American") acquisition discussed in Note 3- Acquisitions to the consolidated financial statements of this 2017 Form 10-K; and increased Medicare Health Plans and Medicare PDP organic membership due to our 2017 bid positioning. These increases were partially offset by the decline in Georgia Medicaid membership. Premiums increased $2.7 billion , or 19.3% , in 2017 compared with 2016, primarily reflecting our acquisitions of Universal American and Care1st Arizona. The increase is also attributed to organic growth across all three lines of business. These increases were partially offset by the effect of the ACA industry fee moratorium for 2017 (discussed in Key Developments and Accomplishments below), which resulted in the elimination of any associated Medicaid ACA industry fee reimbursements from our state government partners. Net Income increased $131.6 million , or 54.4% , in 2017 compared with 2016 driven by continued improvement in operational execution, primarily in the Medicaid Health Plans and Medicare Health Plans segments, as well as the acquisitions of Universal American and Care1st Arizona. The increase is also attributed to the effect of the ACA industry fee moratorium for 2017, and the effect of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (discussed in Note 14- Income Taxes to the consolidated financial statements of this 2017 Form 10-K). These increases were partially offset by $37.5 million in one-time transaction and integration costs related to the acquisition of Universal American, and a $26.1 million loss on extinguishment of debt, primarily related to the early redemption, on April 7, 2017, of our $900.0 million of 5.75% senior notes otherwise due 2020 (the "2020 Notes"). 51 Table of Contents Key Developments and Accomplishments Our current business strategy is achieved by focusing on integrated care management, local markets and community advocacy, regulatory and provider partnerships and delivering prudent, profitable long-term growth. See Part I, Item 1 Business for further discussion of our business strategy. Presented below are key developments and accomplishments relating to progress on our business strategy that have affected, or are expected to affect, our results: As previously announced on October 19, 2017, the company signed a contract with the Illinois Department of Health Care and Family Services ("HFS") to administer the Health Choice Illinois Medicaid managed care program statewide. Services under the new contract began on January 1, 2018. The contract is for four years and may be renewed up to four additional years at the discretion of HFS. Considering the initial premium rate structure, estimated medical benefits and other costs to be incurred during the initial four-year contractual term of the Illinois Medicaid managed care program, we recorded a $45.6 million premium deficiency reserve ("PDR") in the fourth quarter of 2017. Effective July 1, 2017, we commenced services under a new Medicaid contract with the State of Georgia serving Temporary Assistance for Needy Families ("TANF") and Children's Health Insurance Program ("CHIP") beneficiaries. As of December 31, 2017, we served approximately 513,000 Medicaid members in Georgia. Due to the addition of a fourth managed care organization to the program, our membership declined approximately 58,000 members as compared to December 31, 2016. On April 28, 2017 (the "Effective Date"), we completed the acquisition of Universal American. The acquisition of Universal American contributed approximately 119,000 MA members in Texas, New York and Maine, strengthening our business by increasing our MA membership by a third, deepening our presence in two key markets, Texas and New York, and diversifying our business portfolio. The transaction was valued at approximately $770.0 million. On May 1, 2017, we completed the acquisition of certain assets, including Arizona Medicaid membership and certain provider contracts, from Phoenix Health Plan ("PHP"). The transaction included the transfer of approximately 42,000 Medicaid members to Care1st Arizona, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. The transaction was funded with available cash on hand. As of December 31, 2017, we served approximately 153,000 Medicaid members in Arizona. On March 22, 2017, we completed the offering and sale of our 5.25% senior notes due 2025 in the aggregate principal amount of $1,200.0 million (the 2025 Notes ) and increased the amount available under our credit agreement dated January 8, 2016 (the "Credit Agreement") from $850.0 million to $1.0 billion. A portion of the aggregate net proceeds were used to repay the $100.0 million outstanding under the Credit Agreement and to redeem the full $900.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 2020 Notes on April 7, 2017. In connection with the redemption and repurchase of the 2020 Notes, we incurred a one-time loss on extinguishment of debt related to the redemption premium, the write-off of associated deferred financing costs and the write-off of the unamortized portion of associated premiums paid on the 2020 Notes. On January 1, 2017, we began serving Medicaid beneficiaries under Nebraska's Medicaid Managed Care program, Heritage Health. Our Nebraska contract has an initial five-year term and two additional one-year renewal options at the discretion of the Nebraska Department of Administrative Services. As of December 31, 2017, we served approximately 80,000 Medicaid members in Nebraska. Effective January 1, 2017, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 provided for a one-year moratorium on the ACA industry fee, and, as a result, eliminated the associated Medicaid ACA industry fee reimbursements from our state government partners. Accordingly, we did not incur ACA industry fee expense for 2017, compared with $228.4 million for 2016. Additionally, we did not receive any Medicaid ACA industry fee reimbursement revenue during 2017, compared with $244.9 million for 2016. General Economic Environment, Political Environment and Health Care Reform Please refer to Part I, Item 1 Business, General Economic and Political Environment Affecting our Business and Health Care Reform for a further discussion of the current economic and political environment that is affecting our business. Refer to the risks and uncertainties related to health care reform as discussed in Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors. 52 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Consolidated Financial Results The following table sets forth condensed data from our consolidated statements of operations data, as well as other key data used in our results of operations discussions for the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 . For the Years Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2015 Revenues: (Dollars in millions) Premium $ 16,960.3 $ 14,220.9 $ 13,874.8 Investment and other income 46.9 16.2 15.4 Total revenues 17,007.2 14,237.1 13,890.2 Expenses and other: Medical benefits 14,744.8 12,089.4 11,978.5 Selling, general and administrative 1,484.7 1,133.1 1,132.9 ACA industry fee 228.4 227.3 Medicaid premium taxes 119.8 110.0 94.7 Depreciation and amortization 120.4 87.6 72.6 Interest 68.5 59.1 54.2 Gain on divestiture of business (6.1 ) Total expenses, net 16,538.2 13,707.6 13,554.1 Income from operations 469.0 529.5 336.1 Loss on extinguishment of debt 26.1 Income before income taxes and equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries 442.9 529.5 336.1 Equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries 18.7 Income before income taxes 461.6 529.5 336.1 Income tax expense 87.9 287.4 217.5 Net income $ 373.7 $ 242.1 $ 118.6 Effective tax rate 19.0 % 54.3 % 64.7 % Membership by Segment Medicaid Health Plans 2,723,000 2,544,000 2,388,000 Medicare Health Plans 496,000 345,000 354,000 Medicare PDPs 1,152,000 1,009,000 1,025,000 Total 4,371,000 3,898,000 3,767,000 Membership 2017 vs. 2016 As of December 31, 2017 , membership increased approximately 473,000 , or 12.1% , compared with December 31, 2016 . Membership discussion by segment follows: Medicaid Health Plans. Membership increased by 179,000 , or 7.0% , to 2.7 million members as of December 31, 2017 . The increase was primarily driven by our participation in Missouri's Medicaid program statewide expansion, our new Nebraska Medicaid plan, and membership acquired from PHP in our Arizona market. The increase was partially offset by declines in our Georgia health plan membership because the State added a fourth managed care organization, effective July 1, 2017. 53 Table of Contents Medicare Health Plans. Membership increased by 151,000 , or 43.8% , to 496,000 members as of December 31, 2017 . The increase primarily reflects our acquisition of Universal American, our 2017 bid positioning and continued execution on sales and retention initiatives, partially offset by planned service area reductions for the 2017 plan year. Medicare PDPs. Membership increased by 143,000 , or 14.2% , to 1.2 million members as of December 31, 2017 . The increase was primarily the result of our 2017 bid positioning. Our 2017 PDP bids resulted in one of our basic plans being below the benchmarks in 30 of the 34 CMS regions, and within the de minimis range in three other regions. Our 2016 PDP bids resulted in one of our basic plans being below the benchmarks in 17 of the 34 CMS regions, and within the de minimis range in nine other regions. 2016 vs. 2015 As of December 31, 2016, membership increased approximately 131,000, or 3.5%, compared with December 31, 2015. Membership discussion by segment follows: Medicaid Health Plans. Membership increased by 156,000, or 6.5%, compared with December 31, 2015, primarily due to the membership acquired from Care1st Arizona and Advicare during 2016, as well as organic membership growth in New York and Missouri. These increases were partially offset by a membership decline in Georgia. Medicare Health Plans. Membership decreased by 9,000, or 2.5%, compared with December 31, 2015, primarily as a result of our 2016 bid positioning, including planned service area reductions for the 2016 plan year. Medicare PDPs. Membership decreased by 16,000 or 1.6%, compared with December 31, 2015. The decrease was primarily the result of our 2016 bid positioning. Our 2016 PDP bids resulted in one of our basic plans being below the benchmarks in 17 of the 34 CMS regions, and within the de minimis range in nine other regions, compared with our 2015 bids, in which our plans were below the benchmarks in 13 of the 33 CMS regions for which we submitted bids and in the de minimis range in nine regions. Net income 2017 vs. 2016 For the year ended December 31, 2017 , our net income increased by $131.6 million , or 54.4% , compared with the same period in 2016 driven by continued improvement in operational execution, primarily in the Medicaid Health Plans and Medicare Health Plans segments, as well as the acquisitions of Universal American and Care1st Arizona. The increase is also attributed to the effect of the ACA industry fee moratorium for 2017, the effect of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (discussed in Note 14- Income Taxes of this 2017 Form 10-K), and the recognition of certain earnings related to unconsolidated subsidiaries. These increases are partially offset by $37.5 million in one-time transaction and integration costs related to the acquisition of Universal American, and a $26.1 million loss on extinguishment of debt, primarily related to the early redemption, on April 7, 2017, of our 2020 Notes. Refer to Segment Reporting below for a discussion of current developments, operating results and other key performance measures by reportable segment. 2016 vs. 2015 For the year ended December 31, 2016, our net income increased by $123.5 million, or 104.1%, compared with the same period in 2015, primarily attributable to continued improvement, across all of our segments, in operational execution and pharmacy benefits management. Premium revenue 2017 vs. 2016 Premium revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased approximately $2.7 billion , or 19.3% , compared with the same period in 2016, reflecting our acquisitions of Universal American and Care1st Arizona, our participation in the Missouri Medicaid program expansion, net rate increases in certain of our Medicaid markets, and organic growth across all three lines of business. These increases were partially offset by the effect of the ACA industry fee moratorium for 2017, which resulted in the elimination of any associated Medicaid ACA industry fee reimbursements from our state government partners as discussed in " Key Developments and Accomplishments ". 54 Table of Contents 2016 vs. 2015 Premium revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased approximately $346.1 million, or 2.5%, compared with the same period in 2015, reflecting organic membership growth in our Medicaid Health Plans segment, the 2016 Advicare acquisition and net rate increases in certain Medicaid markets. These increases were partially offset by the effect of lower membership in our Medicare PDPs segment and the divestiture of Sterling Life Insurance Company ("Sterling"), our former Medicare Supplement business in 2015. Medical benefits expense 2017 vs. 2016 Medical benefits expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased $2.7 billion , or 22.0% , from 2016 primarily driven by the previously noted 2017 and 2016 acquisitions, our participation in the Missouri Medicaid program expansion, and additional organic membership growth across all lines of business. The increase also includes the previously noted $45.6 million PDR recognized related to the Illinois Medicaid managed care program. The increase was partially offset by the favorable result of continued performance in clinical and pharmacy execution. 2016 vs. 2015 Medical benefits expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased $110.9 million, or 0.9%, compared with the same period in 2015, primarily driven by organic Medicaid membership growth and the Advicare acquisition, partially offset by the favorable result of actions taken relating to our 2016 MA and PDP bids and the divestiture of our Medicare Supplement business in 2015. 55 Table of Contents Selling, general and administrative expense ("SG&A") SG&A expense, under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ("GAAP"), includes aggregate costs related to previously disclosed government investigations and related litigation and resolution costs ("Investigation costs"). Refer to Note 13 Commitments and Contingencies within the consolidated financial statements included in this 2017 Form 10-K for additional discussion of these Investigation costs. SG&A expense also included certain costs associated with our acquisition of Universal American ("Transaction and integration costs"). These costs include severance payments to former executives, advisory, legal and other professional fees that are reflected in SG&A expense in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income. SG&A expense also included certain activities relating to the divestiture of Sterling Life Insurance Company ("Sterling divestiture costs"), our prior Medicare Supplement business; transitory costs related to our decision to change our pharmacy benefit manager ("PBM") as of January 1, 2016 ("PBM transitory costs"); and certain non-recurring Iowa related SG&A expenses relating to readiness costs, certain wind-down costs of WellCare's Iowa operations and certain legal costs ("Iowa SG&A costs"). Although the excluded items may recur, we believe that by providing non-GAAP measurements exclusive of these items, we facilitate period-over-period comparisons and provide additional clarity about events and trends affecting our core operating performance, as well as providing comparability to competitor results. The Investigation costs are related to a discrete incident, which we do not expect to re-occur. The other costs mentioned above are related to specific events, which do not reflect the underlying ongoing performance of our business. The non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Below is a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures with the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. The reconciliation of SG&A expense, including and excluding such costs, is as follows: For the Years Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2015 (In millions) SG&A expense $ 1,484.7 $ 1,133.1 $ 1,132.9 Adjustments: Investigation costs (7.9 ) (16.0 ) (30.4 ) Transaction and integration costs (37.5 ) Sterling divestiture costs (1.7 ) (2.0 ) PBM transitory costs (4.9 ) (18.1 ) Iowa SG&A costs (5.2 ) (11.9 ) Adjusted SG&A Expense $ 1,439.3 $ 1,105.3 $ 1,070.5 SG&A ratio (1) 8.8 % 8.0 % 8.2 % Adjusted SG&A ratio (2) 8.5 % 8.0 % 7.9 % (1) SG&A expense, as a percentage of total premium revenue. (2) Adjusted SG&A expense, as a percentage of total premium revenue, excluding Medicaid premium taxes and Medicaid ACA industry fee reimbursements. Because reimbursements for Medicaid premium tax and ACA industry fee are both included in the premium rates or reimbursement established in certain of our Medicaid contracts and also recognized separately as a component of expense, we exclude these reimbursements from premium revenue when calculating key ratios as we believe that these components are not indicative of operating performance. 56 Table of Contents 2017 vs. 2016 Our SG&A expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 , increased approximately $351.6 million or 31.0% , compared with the same period in 2016 . Additionally, our SG&A ratio increased by 80 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2017 , compared with the same period in 2016 . These increases were primarily the result of our acquisitions of Universal American, including one-time transaction and integration costs, and Care1st Arizona, staffing and infrastructure costs to support organic growth, and variable short-term and long-term management incentive compensation due to improved company performance. The increase in the SG&A ratio is also due to the effect of the ACA industry fee moratorium for 2017, which resulted in the elimination of any associated Medicaid ACA industry fee reimbursements from our state government partners as discussed in " Key Developments and Accomplishments ." Our Adjusted SG&A expense for year ended December 31, 2017 increased approximately $334.0 million , or 30.2% , compared with the same period in 2016 . Additionally, our Adjusted SG&A ratio increased by 50 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2017 , compared with the same period in 2016 . These increases were primarily the result of our acquisitions of Universal American and Care1st Arizona as well as variable short-term and long-term management incentive compensation due to improved company performance. 2016 vs. 2015 Our SG&A expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 remained consistent compared with the same period in 2015. Our Adjusted SG&A expense for year ended December 31, 2016 increased approximately $34.8 million, or 3.3%, compared with the same period in 2015. The increase is primarily due to normal operating and ramp-up costs associated with growth in Medicaid membership and higher short-term and long-term management incentive compensation due to improved Company performance, partially offset by lower members in our Medicare Health Plans and Medicare PDP segments and continued improvements in operational efficiency. Our SG&A ratio for the year ended December 31, 2016 decreased 20 basis points compared with the same period in 2015, primarily driven by continued improvements in operating efficiency and lower investigation and PBM transitory costs, partially offset by the higher short-term and long-term management incentive compensation due to improved Company performance. Our Adjusted SG&A ratio for the year ended December 31, 2016 was consistent with the same period in 2015. ACA Industry Fee 2017 vs. 2016 As discussed under " Key Developments and Accomplishments ," in December 2015, President Obama signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 which, among other provisions, included a one-year moratorium on the ACA industry fee for 2017, and, as a result, eliminated the associated ACA industry fee. Accordingly, we did not incur ACA industry fee expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 , compared with $228.4 million for the same period in 2016 . 2016 vs. 2015 We were assessed $228.4 million for the ACA industry fee for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared with $227.3 million for the same period in 2015, consistent year-over-year as the total fee levied on the industry remained at $11.3 billion in 2016. During both 2016 and 2015, we received amendments, written agreements or other documentation from all of our state Medicaid customers that commit them to reimburse us for the portion of the ACA industry fee attributable to our Medicaid programs, including its non-deductibility for income tax purposes. Interest expense 2017 vs. 2016 Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased approximately $9.4 million compared with the same period in 2016. The increase is primarily driven by the offering and sale of our 5.25% senior notes due 2025 (the "2025 Notes") on March 22, 2017, in the aggregate principal amount of $1,200.0 million, resulting in aggregate net proceeds of $1,182.2 million. A portion of the net proceeds from the offering were used to repay the $100.0 million outstanding under our Credit Agreement, and to redeem the full $900.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 5.75% senior notes due 2020 Notes (the "2020 Notes") on April 7, 2017. 57 Table of Contents 2016 vs. 2015 Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased approximately $4.9 million compared with the same period in 2015, primarily driven by the additional $300.0 million issuance of our 2020 Notes in June 2015. Loss on extinguishment of debt The loss on extinguishment of debt of $26.1 million primarily related to the early redemption on April 7, 2017 of our 2020 Notes. As discussed in Note 10 - Debt to the consolidated financial statements in this 2017 Form 10-K, we redeemed the full $900.0 million in aggregate principal amount outstanding of our 2020 Notes. In connection with the redemption we incurred a one-time loss on extinguishment of debt related to the redemption premium, the write-off of associated deferred financing costs and the write-off of the unamortized portion of associated premiums paid on the 2020 Notes. Equity in Earnings (Losses) of Unconsolidated Subsidiaries As discussed in Note 1 - Organization and Basis Of Presentation to the consolidated financial statements in this 2017 Form 10-K, we work with physicians and other health care professionals to operate Accountable Care Organizations ( ACOs ) under the Medicare Shared Saving Program ("MSSP") and Next Generation ACO Models. We account for our participation in the ACOs using the equity method. Gains and losses are reported as equity in earnings (losses) of unconsolidated subsidiaries in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income. For the year ended December 31, 2017 , we recorded net gains of $18.7 million primarily associated with shared savings for the 2016 MSSP contract year. Income Tax Expense 2017 vs. 2016 Income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased $199.5 million , or 69.4% , compared with the same period in 2016, while the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased to 19.0% compared with 54.3% for the same period in 2016. The decrease in income tax expense was primarily driven by the one-year moratorium on the non-deductible ACA industry fee for 2017, higher excess tax benefits resulting from the settlement of stock-compensation awards in 2017 and the favorable effect of the recognition of certain previously unrecognized tax benefits during 2017. The decrease is also related to the effect of revaluing the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 . Refer to Note 14 - Income Taxes to the consolidated financial statements in this 2017 Form 10-K for further discussion regarding the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits in 2017 and the current year tax effect of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 . 2016 vs. 2015 Income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased $69.9 million, or 32.1%, compared with the same period in 2015, while the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2016 decreased to 54.3% compared with 64.7% for the same period in 2015. The increase in income tax expense and decrease in the effective tax rate were both attributable to higher income before income taxes, as well as the adoption of Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2016-09 "Compensation Stock Compensation (Topic 718)" during 2016. Our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2016 also includes the favorable effect of the recognition of certain previously unrecognized tax benefits. 58 Table of Contents Segment Reporting Reportable operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which discrete financial information is available and evaluated on a regular basis by the enterprise's decision makers to determine how resources should be allocated to an individual segment and to assess performance of those segments. Accordingly, we have three reportable segments: Medicaid Health Plans, Medicare Health Plans and Medicare PDPs. Segment Financial Performance Measures Our primary measurements of profitability for our reportable segments are premium revenue, gross margin and MBR. Gross margin is defined as premium revenue less medical benefits expense and the ACA industry fee expense. MBR measures the ratio of medical benefits expense to premium revenue. Our Adjusted MBR (non-GAAP) measures the ratio of medical benefits expense to premium revenue, excluding Medicaid premium taxes reimbursement and Medicaid ACA industry fee reimbursement. We use gross margin, MBR and, where applicable, Adjusted MBR, to monitor our management of medical benefits and medical benefits expense. These metrics are utilized to make various business decisions, including which health care plans to offer, which geographic areas to enter or exit and which health care providers to include in our networks. For further information regarding premium revenues and medical benefits expense, please refer below to " Premium Revenue Recognition and Premiums Receivable " and " Medical Benefits Expense and Medical Benefits Payable " under " Critical Accounting Estimates. " Reconciling Segment Results The following table reconciles our reportable segment results with our income from operations (before income taxes), as reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ("GAAP"). For the Years Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2015 Gross Margin: (In millions) Medicaid Health Plans $ 1,312.2 $ 1,162.8 $ 1,072.4 Medicare Health Plans 742.9 533.9 428.4 Medicare PDPs 160.4 206.4 168.2 Total gross margin 2,215.5 1,903.1 1,669.0 Investment and other income 46.9 16.2 15.4 Other expenses, net (1) (1,793.4 ) (1,389.8 ) (1,348.3 ) Income from operations $ 469.0 $ 529.5 $ 336.1 (1) Other expenses, net include SG&A expenses, Medicaid premium taxes, depreciation and amortization, and interest. Other expenses, net for 2015 also include the gain on the Sterling divestiture. Medicaid Health Plans Our Medicaid Health Plans segment includes plans for beneficiaries of TANF, Supplemental Security Income ("SSI"), Aged Blind and Disabled ("ABD") and other state-based programs that are not part of the Medicaid program, such as CHIP and the Long-Term Services and Supports ("LTSS") program. As of December 31, 2017, we operated Medicaid health plans in Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Kentucky, Missouri, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, South Carolina and Texas. 59 Table of Contents Medicaid Health Plans Results of Operations The following table sets forth the summarized results of operations and other relevant performance measures for our Medicaid Health Plans segment for the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 : For the Years Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2015 (In millions) Premium revenue (1) $ 10,606.5 $ 9,144.4 $ 8,760.4 Medicaid premium taxes (1) 119.8 110.0 94.7 Medicaid ACA industry fee reimbursement (1) 244.9 219.2 Total premiums 10,726.3 9,499.3 9,074.3 Medical benefits expense 9,414.1 8,188.5 7,866.8 ACA industry fee 148.0 135.1 Gross margin $ 1,312.2 $ 1,162.8 $ 1,072.4 Medicaid Health Plans MBR (1) 87.8 % 86.2 % 86.7 % Effect of: Medicaid premium taxes 1.1 % 1.0 % 1.0 % Medicaid ACA industry fee reimbursement % 2.3 % 2.1 % Medicaid Health Plans Adjusted MBR (1) 88.8 % 89.5 % 89.8 % Medicaid Health Plans Membership: Florida 751,000 780,000 781,000 Georgia 513,000 571,000 585,000 Kentucky 448,000 440,000 440,000 Other states (2) 1,011,000 753,000 582,000 2,723,000 2,544,000 2,388,000 (1) For GAAP reporting purposes, Medicaid premium taxes and Medicaid ACA industry fee reimbursements are included in premium revenue to measure our MBR. Our Medicaid Health Plans Adjusted MBR measures the ratio of our medical benefits expense to premium revenue, excluding Medicaid premium taxes and Medicaid ACA industry fee reimbursement revenue. Because reimbursements for Medicaid premium tax and ACA industry fee are both included in the premium rates or reimbursement established in certain of our Medicaid contracts and also recognized separately as a component of expense, we exclude these reimbursements from premium revenue when calculating key ratios as we believe that these components are not indicative of operating performance. (2) "All other states" consists of Arizona, Hawaii, Illinois, Missouri, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, South Carolina. and Texas. 2017 vs. 2016 Medicaid total premiums increased $1.2 billion , or 12.9% , for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared with the same period in 2016, primarily driven by membership acquired from our Arizona acquisitions, our new Nebraska Medicaid plan and our participation in Missouri's Medicaid program statewide expansion. The increase is also attributable to net rate increases in certain of our existing Medicaid markets. These increases were partially offset by the effect of the previously noted ACA industry fee moratorium for 2017, which resulted in the elimination of any associated Medicaid ACA industry fee reimbursements from our state government partners. Excluding Medicaid premium taxes and Medicaid ACA industry fee reimbursements, Medicaid premium revenue increased $1.5 billion , or 16.0% , for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared with the same period in 2016 . The increase is a result of our previously discussed 2017 and 2016 Medicaid acquisitions, our new Nebraska Medicaid program and our participation in the Missouri Medicaid program statewide expansion. The increase is also attributable to net increases in certain of our existing Medicaid markets. 60 Table of Contents Medical benefits expense increased by approximately $1.2 billion , or 15.0% , for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared with the same period in 2016, primarily resulting from the previously discussed net increase in membership, including growth from acquisitions and organic growth resulting from our new Nebraska market and Missouri's statewide expansion. The increase also includes the previously noted $45.6 million PDR recognized related to the Illinois Medicaid managed care program. Our Medicaid Health Plans segment MBR increased by 160 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared with the same period in 2016. The increase is primarily a result of the effect of the ACA industry fee moratorium, and, as a result the elimination of associated Medicaid reimbursement revenue, the recognition of the previously noted PDR related to our Illinois Medicaid program, the addition of our new Medicaid businesses in Arizona and Nebraska, and new members from the statewide expansion of the Missouri Medicaid program. This increase was partially offset by continued operational execution and net rate increases in certain Medicaid markets. Excluding the effect of Medicaid premium taxes and Medicaid ACA industry fee reimbursements, our Medicaid Health Plans Adjusted MBR decreased by 70 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared with the same period in 2016. The decrease is primarily the result of continued operational execution and net rate increases in certain Medicaid markets, partially offset by the addition of our new Medicaid businesses in Arizona and Nebraska, the recognition of the previously noted PDR related to our Illinois Medicaid program and new members from the statewide expansion of the Missouri Medicaid program. 2016 vs. 2015 Medicaid total premiums increased $425.0 million, or 4.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared with the same period in 2015. Excluding Medicaid premium taxes and Medicaid ACA industry fee reimbursements, Medicaid premium revenue increased $384.0 million, or 4.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared with the same period in 2015. The increases were primarily driven by organic membership growth, net rate increases for the Florida MMA program, and the acquisition of Advicare, effective June 1, 2016. Medical benefits expense increased by approximately $321.7 million, or 4.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared with the same period in 2015, primarily driven by the organic membership growth, the acquisition of Advicare and other factors including net medical trend and mix of membership. Our Medicaid Health Plans MBR decreased by 50 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared with the same period in 2015. Our Medicaid Health Plans Adjusted MBR decreased by 30 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared with the same period in 2015. The decreases in both MBRs were primarily driven by improved operational execution and pharmacy cost structure, as well as higher ACA industry fee reimbursement (affecting the Medicaid Health Plans MBR). Medicare Health Plans We contract with CMS under the Medicare program to provide a comprehensive array of Part C and Part D benefits to Medicare eligible persons provided through our MA plans. Our MA plans are comprised of coordinated care plans ("CCPs"), which are primarily administered through HMOs and generally require members to seek health care services and select a primary care physician from a network of health care providers. Certain MA CCPs are administered through PPOs and PFFS. In addition, we offer Medicare Part D coverage, which provides prescription drug benefits, as a component of most of our MA plans. In 2017, we operated our MA CCPs in 485 counties across 17 states, including Arizona, Arkansas, California, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Mississippi, New Jersey, New York, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas. Effective January 1, 2018, we expanded our MA service area into the state of North Carolina. We cover a wide spectrum of medical services through our MA plans. For many of our plans, we provide additional benefits not covered by Original Medicare, such as vision, dental and hearing services. Through these enhanced benefits, out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our members are generally reduced, which better allows our members to manage their health care costs. 61 Table of Contents We continue to focus on three main areas in MA, including: Execution on healthcare value-added initiatives led by our clinical services group; Continued application of a more disciplined portfolio approach to our MA bids, including a focus on net income; and Improving Star Ratings, both in terms of execution on quality initiatives and our advocacy position to properly match the ratings, rules and economics with the prevalent data that demonstrates the connection between socio-economic status and lower quality ratings. As a result of the Windsor acquisition completed on January 1, 2014, we began offering Medicare Supplement products. Accordingly, we included results for Medicare Supplement operations together with our MA plans within the Medicare Health Plans segment through June 30, 2015. On July 1, 2015, we completed the sale of our Medicare Supplement business through the Sterling divestiture. The operations of our Medicare Supplement business were not material to overall segment results. Medicare Health Plans Results of Operations The following table sets forth the summarized results of operations and other relevant performance measures for our Medicare Health Plans segment for the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 : For the Years Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2015 (In millions) Premium revenue $ 5,320.2 $ 3,876.6 $ 3,898.8 Medical benefits expense 4,577.3 3,278.5 3,401.7 ACA industry fee 64.2 68.7 Gross margin $ 742.9 $ 533.9 $ 428.4 Medicare Health Plans Membership 496,000 345,000 354,000 Medicare Health Plans MBR 86.0 % 84.6 % 87.2 % 2017 vs. 2016 Medicare Health Plans premium revenue increased by $1.4 billion , or 37.2% , for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared with the same period in 2016 , primarily driven by our acquisition of Universal American, our 2017 bid strategy and organic growth. Medicare Health Plans medical benefits expense increased $1.3 billion , or 39.6% , for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared with the same period in 2016 , primarily due to increased membership acquired from the acquisition of Universal American and increased membership as a result of our 2017 bid positioning. The Medicare Health Plans MBR increased by 140 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared with the same period in 2016, primarily resulting from the acquisition of Universal American, bid considerations due to the ACA industry fee moratorium in 2017 and increased investments in quality program initiatives. 2016 vs. 2015 Medicare Health Plans premium revenue decreased marginally by $22.2 million, or 0.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared with the same period in 2015, primarily due to the Sterling divestiture partially offset by our Medicare Advantage 2016 bid positioning. Medicare Health Plans medical benefits expense decreased $123.2 million, or 3.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared with the same period in 2015, primarily due to the lower membership and the Sterling divestiture. The Medicare Health Plans MBR decreased by 260 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared with the same period in 2015, resulting from our 2016 bid strategy and continued clinical and operational improvement. 62 Table of Contents Medicare PDPs We have contracted with CMS to serve as a plan sponsor offering stand-alone Medicare Part D PDPs to Medicare eligible beneficiaries through our Medicare PDPs segment. As of December 31, 2017, we offered PDPs in 50 states and the District of Columbia. The PDP benefit design generally results in our incurring a greater portion of the responsibility for total prescription drug costs in the early stages of a plan year and less in the latter stages of a plan year due to the members' share of cumulative out-of-pocket costs increasing throughout the plan year. As a result, the Medicare PDPs MBR is generally lower in the second half of the year as compared with the first half. In addition, the level and mix of members who are auto-assigned to us and those who actively choose our PDPs will affect the segment MBR pattern across periods. Medicare PDPs Results of Operations The following table sets forth the summarized results of operations and other relevant performance measures for our Medicare PDPs segment for the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 : For the Years Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2015 (In millions) Premium revenue $ 913.8 $ 845.0 $ 901.7 Medical benefits expense 753.4 622.4 710.0 ACA industry fee 16.2 23.5 Gross margin $ 160.4 $ 206.4 $ 168.2 Medicare PDPs membership 1,152,000 1,009,000 1,025,000 Medicare PDPs MBR 82.4 % 73.7 % 78.7 % 2017 vs. 2016 The Medicare PDPs premium revenue increased $68.8 million , or 8.1% , for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared with the same period in 2016 . Medical benefits expense increased $131.0 million , or 21.0% , for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared with the same period in 2016 . The increases were primarily due to the increase in membership resulting from our 2017 bid strategy. The Medicare PDPs MBR increased by 870 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared with the same period in 2016 reflecting the effect of our 2017 bid strategy. 2016 vs. 2015 The Medicare PDPs premium revenue decreased $56.7 million, or 6.3%, in 2016 compared with 2015, primarily due to the decrease in membership resulting from our 2016 bid strategy. The Medicare PDPs MBR for the year ended December 31, 2016 decreased 500 basis points over the same period in 2015, reflecting improvement in our pharmacy cost structure, including rebate management, and continued improved operational execution. Business Trends and Inflation Health care expenditures have grown consistently for many years, and we expect overall health care costs to continue to grow in the future due to inflation, evolving medical technology, pharmaceutical advancement, regulatory requirements, demographic trends in the U.S. population, and national interest in health and well being. We use various strategies to mitigate the negative effects of health care cost inflation. Specifically, our health plans try to control medical costs through our healthcare quality and affordability initiatives and contracts with independent providers of health care services. Through these contracted care providers, our health plans emphasize preventive health care and appropriate use of specialty and hospital services. Additionally, federal regulation requires that our state Medicaid contracts maintain actuarially sound premiums that include health care cost trend. While we currently believe our strategies to mitigate health care cost inflation will continue to be successful, competitive pressures, new health care and pharmaceutical product introductions, demands from health care 63 Table of Contents providers and customers, applicable health care reform regulations, an increase in the expected rate of inflation for health care costs, or other factors may adversely affect our ability to control health care costs. 2018 Outlook Medicaid Health Plans - We expect premium revenue (GAAP) for our Medicaid Health Plans segment to be in the range of $11.3 billion to $11.6 billion for 2018, compared with $10.7 billion for 2017. We expect premium revenue for our Medicaid Health Plans, excluding $120.0 million to $125.0 million in Medicaid premium taxes and $250.0 million to $260.0 million in Medicaid ACA industry fee reimbursements, to be in the range of $10.9 billion to $11.2 billion for 2018, compared with $10.6 billion reported for 2017, excluding $119.8 million in Medicaid premium taxes. The Medicaid Health Plans MBR (GAAP) is expected to be in the range of 85.5% to 86.2% for 2018, compared with 87.8% for 2017. The Medicaid Health Plans Adjusted MBR is expected to be in the range of 88.4% to 89.2%, consistent with 88.8% reported in 2017. Medicare Health Plans - We expect premium revenue for our Medicare Health Plans segment to be in the range of $6.15 billion to $6.3 billion for 2018, compared with $5.3 billion reported for 2017. Medicare Health Plans MBR is expected to be in the range of 84.6% to 85.6% for 2018, compared with 86.0% in 2017, reflecting our 2018 bid strategy and associated considerations due to the ACA industry fee return in 2018. Medicare PDPs - We expect premium revenue for our Medicare PDPs segment to be in the range of $875.0 million to $925.0 million for 2018, consistent with $913.8 million for 2017. Medicare PDPs MBR is expected to be in the range of 80.0% to 82.0% for 2018, compared with 82.4% for 2017 due to our bid positioning for the 2018 plan year. Consolidated SG&A - Our consolidated SG&A ratio (GAAP) is not estimable as we currently are not able to project future amounts associated with Investigation costs as well as the Transaction and Integration costs associated with the Universal American acquisition, as defined earlier. We expect that our consolidated Adjusted SG&A ratio, which excludes the effect of investigation costs, for 2018 will be approximately 8.1% to 8.3%, compared with 8.5% for 2017, resulting from improved operating leverage associated with premium revenue growth and continued synergies from our 2016 and 2017 acquisitions. Income Taxes - Our consolidated effective income tax rate (GAAP) is not estimable as we currently are not able to project future amounts associated with Investigation costs as well as the Transaction and Integration costs associated with the Universal American acquisition, as defined earlier. However, we expect our effective income tax rate to increase in 2018 compared with 2017 due to the reinstatement in 2018 of the ACA industry fee that was subject to a one-year moratorium in 2017, which had the effect of lowering our income tax rate in 2017. The reduction in the federal income tax rate for corporations from 35% to 21% effective on January 1, 2018 as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 will partially offset the effect of the non-deductibility of the ACA industry fee. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Each of our existing and anticipated sources of cash is affected by operational and financial risks that influence the overall amount of cash generated and the capital available to us. Additionally, we operate as a holding company in a highly regulated industry. The parent and other non-regulated companies ("non-regulated subsidiaries") are dependent upon dividends and management fees from our regulated subsidiaries, most of which are subject to regulatory restrictions. For a further discussion of risks that can affect our liquidity, see Part I Item 1A Risk Factors included in this 2017 Form 10-K. Liquidity The Company maintains liquidity at two levels: the regulated subsidiary level and the non-regulated subsidiary level. Regulated subsidiaries Our regulated subsidiaries' primary liquidity requirements include: payment of medical claims and other health care services; payment of certain Part D benefits paid for members on behalf of CMS; SG&A costs directly incurred or paid through a management services agreement to one of our non-regulated 64 Table of Contents administrative and management services subsidiaries; and federal tax payments to the parent company under an intercompany tax sharing agreement. Our regulated subsidiaries meet their liquidity needs by: generating cash flows from operating activities, primarily from premium revenue; receipts of prospective subsidy payments and related final settlements from CMS to reimburse us for certain Part D benefits paid for members on behalf of CMS; cash flows from investing activities, including investment income and sales of investments; and capital contributions received from our non-regulated subsidiaries. We refer collectively to the cash, cash equivalents and investment balances maintained by our regulated subsidiaries as "regulated cash and investments." Our regulated subsidiaries generally receive premiums in advance of payments of claims for medical and other health care services; however, regulated cash, cash equivalents and investments can fluctuate significantly in a particular period depending on the timing of receipts for premiums from our government partners. Our unrestricted regulated cash, cash equivalents and investments was $4.8 billion at December 31, 2017 , compared with $3.2 billion at December 31, 2016, primarily due to cash, cash equivalents and investments acquired with the Universal American acquisition, earnings from operations and contributions received from the parent and non-regulated subsidiaries. These increases were partially offset by dividends paid to the parent and non-regulated subsidiaries. Our regulated subsidiaries are each subject to applicable state regulations that, among other things, require the maintenance of minimum levels of capital and surplus. We continue to maintain significant levels of aggregate excess statutory capital and surplus in our regulated subsidiaries. See further discussion under Regulatory Capital and Dividend Restrictions below. Parent and Non-regulated Subsidiaries Liquidity requirements at the non-regulated parent and subsidiary level generally consist of: payment of administrative costs not directly incurred by our regulated operations, including, but not limited to, staffing costs, business development, rent, branding and certain information technology services; capital contributions paid to our regulated subsidiaries; capital expenditures; acquisition-related funding and transaction expenses; debt service; and federal tax payments. Our non-regulated parent and subsidiaries normally meet their liquidity requirements by: management fees earned by our non-regulated administrator subsidiary under management services agreements; dividends received from our regulated subsidiaries; collecting federal tax payments from the regulated subsidiaries; proceeds from issuance of debt and equity securities; and cash flows from investing activities, including investment income and sales of investments. Unregulated cash, cash equivalents and investments totaled approximately $617.0 million at December 31, 2017 , a decrease of approximately $298.3 million from $915.3 million at December 31, 2016. This decrease is primarily the result of the early redemption in full of our 2020 notes, including the redemption premium, funding for the acquisition of Universal American and a $100.0 million cash payment to repay borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility in March 2017. These decreases were partially offset by the receipt of $1.2 billion net proceeds from the 2025 Notes issuance in March 2017 (see Capital Resources Debt below for further discussion), as well as dividends received from our regulated subsidiaries. We funded the acquisition of Universal American with unrestricted cash available on hand from both WellCare and Universal American. The transaction is valued at approximately $770.0 million , including the cash purchase price of $10.00 per outstanding share ("Per Share Merger Consideration") of Universal American's common stock, the assumption of $145.3 million fair value of Universal American's convertible debt, the cash settlement of Universal American's $40.0 million par value of Series A Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred Shares (the "Preferred Shares") and the cash settlement of outstanding vested and unvested stock-based compensation awards. 65 Table of Contents Universal American Convertible Notes In 2016, Universal American completed the offering of $115.0 million of their 4.00% Convertible Notes due 2021. During the three months ended June 30, 2017, all of the holders of the Convertible Notes elected to convert their notes into the right to receive cash equal to the par value of the notes plus a make whole premium. We paid the noteholders the amounts due and all of the notes were cancelled prior to June 30, 2017. The fair value of the Convertible Notes was $145.3 million on the Effective Date and was included in the purchase consideration for the Universal American acquisition. Universal American Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred Shares In April 2011, Universal American issued an aggregate of $40.0 million of their Preferred Shares, representing 1,600,000 shares with a par value of $0.01 per share and a liquidation preference of $25.00 per share. During the three months ended June 30, 2017, the Preferred Shares were redeemed for $41.0 million, which includes the $40.0 million par value of the Preferred Shares and $1.0 million of accrued dividends. The $41.0 million redemption amount was included in purchase consideration for the Universal American acquisition. Refer to Note 3- Acquisitions to the consolidated financial statements in this 2017 Form 10-K for further discussion of the Universal American acquisition. Medicare Part D Funding and Settlements Funding may be provided to certain regulated subsidiaries from our unregulated subsidiaries to cover any shortfall resulting from the amount of Part D benefits paid for members on behalf of CMS that exceeds the prospective subsidy payments that these regulated subsidiaries receive from CMS. We receive certain Part D prospective subsidy payments from CMS for our MA and PDP members as a fixed monthly per member amount, based on the estimated costs of providing prescription drug benefits over the plan year, as reflected in our bids. A discussion of the subsidy components under Part D is included in Note 2- Significant Accounting Policies to the consolidated financial statements included in this 2017 Form 10-K. The benefits include the catastrophic reinsurance, premium and cost sharing for low income Part D members ("LICS"), for which CMS will fully reimburse these subsidies, or recoup overpaid subsidies made during the plan year, as part of its annual settlement process that typically occurs in the fourth quarter of the subsequent year. Government Investigation and Litigation Under the terms of the settlement agreements entered into by us on April 26, 2011, and finalized on March 23, 2012, to resolve matters under investigation by the Civil Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (the "Civil Division") and certain other federal and state enforcement agencies (the "Settlement"), WellCare agreed to pay the Civil Division a total of $137.5 million in four equal annual principal payments, plus interest accrued at 3.125%. The final payment of $35.4 million, which included accrued interest, was remitted to the Civil Division during March 2015. We currently maintain directors' and officers' liability insurance for matters not addressed above. 66 Table of Contents Cash Flow Activities Our cash flows are summarized as follows: For the Years Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2015 (In millions) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,050.0 $ 748.3 $ 712.6 Net cash used in investing activities (1,641.0 ) (27.0 ) (124.2 ) Net cash provided by financing activities 828.2 833.1 505.1 Increase in cash and cash equivalents $ 237.2 $ 1,554.4 $ 1,093.5 Cash Flows from Operating Activities We generally receive premiums in advance of payments of claims for health care services; however, cash flows related to our operations can fluctuate significantly in a particular period depending on the timing of premium receipts from our government partners. 2017 vs. 2016 Net cash provided by operating activities for 2017 was $1.1 billion , compared with $748.3 million for 2016. The increase is primarily due to improved operating earnings and the timing of claim payments. 2016 vs. 2015 Cash provided by operating activities for 2016 was $748.3 million compared with $712.6 million for 2015, primarily due to improved year-over-year operating performance across all segments and the timing of certain pharmacy rebate receipts and claims payments. Cash flows from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 included a $228.4 million ACA industry fee payment remitted to the IRS in September 2016, compared with $227.3 million remitted for such fee in September 2015. Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 was reduced by the $35.4 million final payment remitted to the Civil Division in March 2015. See further discussion in Government Investigation and Litigation above. Cash Flows from Investing Activities 2017 vs. 2016 Net cash used in investing activities for 2017 was $1.6 billion compared with $27.0 million for the same period in 2016. The increase primarily resulted from higher purchases of investments in 2017 to improve investment income, as well as the acquisitions of Universal American and PHP during the second quarter of 2017. Net cash used in investing activities for 2016 included the acquisition of Care1st Arizona. 2016 vs. 2015 Net cash used in investing activities for 2016 was $27.0 million compared with $124.2 million for the same period in 2015, primarily resulting from higher net proceeds from the sales of investments in 2016, partially offset by the acquisitions of Care1st Arizona and Advicare and the effect of higher additions to capitalized software during 2015 resulting from investments in our information technology infrastructure. Cash flows from financing activities 2017 vs. 2016 67 Table of Contents Cash flows from financing activities are primarily affected by debt-related activity, as well as net funds received or paid for the benefit of members of our MA and PDP plans. Cash provided by financing activities for 2017 was $828.2 million , compared with $833.1 million for the same period in 2016, primarily driven by the following: Net funds received for the benefit of members was approximately $671.6 million for 2017, compared with $1.0 billion during 2016. These funds represent the net amounts of subsidies we received from CMS in connection with the low-income cost sharing, catastrophic reinsurance and coverage gap discount components of the Medicare Part D program related to the government's portion of financial responsibility, net of the amounts we paid for related prescription drug benefits, described above in " Medicare Part D Funding and Settlements ." The decrease in funds received in 2017 compared with the same period in 2016 is due to the effect of our 2017 bids, as well as the timing of pharmacy claims payments in 2016. Aggregate net proceeds of $156.1 million resulting from debt transactions executed during 2017 reflecting net proceeds of $1.2 billion received from the issuance of our 2025 Notes in March 2017, partially offset by the early redemption in full of our $900.0 million principal amount of 2020 notes in April 2017, including the $25.9 million redemption premium, and a $100.0 million repayment of outstanding borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility. Refer to " Capital Resources " below for further discussion of our 2017 debt transactions. Debt-related activity for 2016 reflects $200.0 million drawn from our Revolving Credit Facility, which, along with $100.0 million in cash, was used to repay in full the $300.0 million term loan under our prior credit facility. 2016 vs. 2015 Cash flows from financing activities are primarily affected by net funds received or paid for the benefit of members of our MA and PDP plans as well as debt-related activity. Net funds received for the benefit of members was approximately $1.0 billion in 2016, compared with $201.1 million during the same period in 2015. These funds represent the net amount of prescription drug benefits we paid in connection with the low-income cost sharing, catastrophic reinsurance and coverage gap discount components of the Medicare Part D program related to the government's portion of financial responsibility, net of the related subsidies received from CMS, as described above in "Medicare Part D Funding and Settlements." Additionally, in January 2016, $200.0 million of the Revolving Credit Facility (described below) was drawn upon and, along with $100.0 million in cash, used to repay our $300.0 million Term Loan. In September 2016, we repaid $100.0 million of the $200.0 million borrowed under the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility. Debt-related activity for the year ended December 31, 2015 includes net proceeds of $308.9 million resulting from the issuance of $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of our Senior Notes. Capital Resources Debt 5.25% Senior Notes due 2025 On March 22, 2017, we completed the offering and sale of our 2025 Notes in the aggregate principal amount of $1,200.0 million , resulting in aggregate net proceeds of $1,182.2 million. A portion of the net proceeds from the offering was used to redeem the full $900.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 2020 Notes and to repay the $100.0 million outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility. The remaining net proceeds from the offering of the 2025 Notes were used for general corporate purposes, including organic growth and working capital. The 2025 Notes were issued under an indenture, dated as of March 22, 2017 (the "Base Indenture"), as supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture, dated as of March 22, 2017 (the "First Supplemental Indenture" and, together with the Base Indenture, the "Indenture"), each between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. ( BNY Mellon ), as trustee. The Indenture under which the notes were issued contains covenants that, among other things, limit our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries under certain circumstances to: incur additional indebtedness and issue preferred stock; pay dividends or make other distributions; 68 Table of Contents make other restricted payments and investments; sell assets, including capital stock of restricted subsidiaries; create certain liens; incur restrictions on the ability of restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends, or make other payments, and in the case of our subsidiaries, guarantee indebtedness; engage in transactions with affiliates; and create unrestricted subsidiaries. In addition, the Indenture requires that for the company to merge, consolidate or sell all or substantially all of its assets, (i) either the company must be the surviving entity, or the surviving entity or purchaser must be a U.S. entity; (ii) the surviving entity or purchaser must assume all the obligations of the company under the notes and the indenture; (iii) no default or event of default (as defined under the Indenture) exists and (iv) the surviving entity, after giving pro forma effect to the transaction, (x) may incur at least $1.00 of additional indebtedness pursuant to the fixed charge coverage ratio or (y) have a fixed charge coverage ratio that is no worse than the fixed charge coverage ratio of the Company without giving pro forma effect to the transactions. 5.75% Senior Notes due 2020 In November 2013, we issued $600.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our 2020 Notes. In June 2015, we issued an additional $300.0 million of 2020 Notes, pursuant to a reopening of such notes. Refer to Note 10 - Debt to the consolidated financial statements included in this 2017 Form 10-K for additional information regarding these 2020 Notes. In April 2017, we redeemed the full $900.0 million in aggregate principal amount outstanding of our 2020 Notes at a redemption price of 102.875% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest. Our obligations under the related base indenture, each dated as of November 14, 2013, by and among us and BNY Mellon, as trustee, were satisfied and discharged on April 7, 2017. In connection with the redemption of the 2020 Notes, we incurred a one-time loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately $25.9 million related to the redemption premium, the write-off of associated deferred financing costs and the write-off of the unamortized portion of associated premiums paid on the 2020 Notes. The loss on extinguishment of debt is reflected in our results of operations for 2017. Credit Agreement In January 2016, we entered into the Credit Agreement, which provides for a senior unsecured revolving loan facility (the "Revolving Credit Facility"), which had an initial aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding not to exceed $850.0 million. On March 22, 2017, we increased the amount available under our Credit Agreement from $850.0 million to $1.0 billion. In March 2017, we also repaid the $100.0 million outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility, and as a result, there were no borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility as of December 31, 2017. Revolving Credit Loans designated by us at the time of borrowing as ABR Loans that are outstanding under the Credit Agreement bear interest at a rate per annum equal to (i) the greatest of (a) the Prime Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) in effect on such day; (b) the Federal Reserve Bank of New York Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) in effect on such day plus 1/2 of 1%; and (c) the Adjusted LIBO Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) for a one month interest period on such day plus 1%; plus (ii) the Applicable Rate. Revolving Credit Loans designated by us at the time of borrowing as Eurodollar Loans that are outstanding under the Credit Agreement bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Adjusted LIBO Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) for the interest period in effect for such borrowing plus the Applicable Rate. The Applicable Rate means a percentage ranging from 0.50% to 1.00% per annum for ABR Loans and a percentage ranging from 1.50% to 2.00% per annum for Eurodollar Loans, depending upon our ratio of total debt to cash flow, as calculated in accordance with the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement includes negative and financial covenants that limit certain activities of us and our subsidiaries, including (i) restrictions on our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness; and (ii) financial covenants that require (a) the ratio of total net debt to cash flow not to exceed a maximum; and (b) a minimum interest expense and principal payment coverage ratio. The Credit Agreement also contains customary representations and warranties that must be accurate in order for us to borrow under the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility. In addition, the Credit Agreement contains customary events of default. If an event of default occurs and is continuing, we may be required immediately to repay all amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement. Lenders holding at least 50% of the loans and commitments under the Credit Agreement may elect to accelerate the maturity of the loans and/or terminate the commitments under the Credit Agreement upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an event of default. 69 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2017, we were in compliance with all covenants under both the 2025 Notes and the Credit Agreement. For additional information on our long-term debt, see Note 10 - Debt to the consolidated financial statements included in this 2017 Form 10-K. Shelf Registration Statement In November 2015, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC that became automatically effective covering the registration, issuance and sale of an indeterminate amount of our securities, including common stock, preferred stock, senior or subordinated debt securities, depository shares, securities purchase contracts, units or warrants. We may publicly offer securities in the future at prices and terms to be determined at the time of the offering. Initiatives to Increase Our Unregulated Cash We may pursue alternatives to raise additional unregulated cash. Some of these initiatives may include, but are not limited to, obtaining dividends from certain of our regulated subsidiaries, provided sufficient capital in excess of regulatory requirements exists in these subsidiaries and/or accessing the debt and equity capital markets. However, we cannot provide any assurances that we will obtain applicable state regulatory approvals for additional dividends to our non-regulated subsidiaries by our regulated subsidiaries or be successful in accessing the capital markets if we determine to do so. We believe that we have sufficient capital, or sufficient access to capital, including through the Revolving Credit Facility, to meet our capital needs for at least the next twelve months. Regulatory Capital and Dividend Restrictions Each of our HMO and insurance subsidiaries must maintain a minimum amount of statutory capital determined by statute or regulation. The minimum statutory capital requirements differ by state and are generally based on a percentage of annualized premium revenue, a percentage of annualized health care costs, a percentage of certain liabilities, a statutory minimum, risk-based capital ("RBC") requirements or other financial ratios. The RBC requirements are based on guidelines established by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners ("NAIC") and have been adopted by most states. The statutory framework for our regulated subsidiaries' minimum capital requirements could change over time. For instance, RBC requirements may be adopted by more of the states in which we operate. In addition, regulators could require our subsidiaries to maintain minimum levels of statutory net worth in excess of the amount required under the applicable state laws if the regulators determine that maintaining such additional statutory net worth is in the best interest of our members and other constituencies. Failure to maintain these requirements would trigger regulatory action by the state. To the extent our HMO and insurance subsidiaries must comply with these regulations, they may not have the financial flexibility to transfer funds to us. Based upon current statutes and regulations, the minimum capital and surplus requirement, or net assets, for these subsidiaries that may not be transferable to us in the form of loans, advances, or cash dividends was approximately $1.2 billion at December 31, 2017 , and $871.8 million at December 31, 2016 . The combined statutory capital and surplus of our HMO and insurance subsidiaries was $2.0 billion and $1.7 billion at December 31, 2017 and 2016 . These increases were primarily the result of the Universal American acquisition, as well as organic growth in all of our lines of business. Our HMO and insurance subsidiaries were in compliance with and in excess of the minimum capital requirements as of both December 31, 2017 and 2016. Such statues, regulations and capital requirements also restrict the timing, payment, and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to us as the sole stockholder. Dividend restrictions vary by state, but the maximum amount of dividends which can be paid without prior approval from the applicable state is subject to restrictions relating to statutory capital, surplus and net income for the previous year. Some states require prior approval of all dividends, regardless of amount. States may disapprove any dividend that, together with other dividends paid by a subsidiary in the prior 12 months, exceeds the regulatory maximum as computed for the subsidiary based on its statutory surplus and net income. We received $335.0 million , $241.0 million and $152.0 million in dividends from our regulated subsidiaries during the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 , and 2015 , respectively. The 2017 amount included $150.0 million not requiring prior regulatory approval, and $185.0 million paid after obtaining prior regulatory approval. Under applicable regulatory requirements at December 31, 2017 , the amount of dividends that may be paid through the end of 2018 by our HMO and insurance subsidiaries without prior approval by regulatory authorities is approximately $201.7 million in the aggregate. Actual dividends paid may vary due to consideration of excess statutory capital and surplus and expected future surplus requirements related to, for example, premium volume and product mix. For additional information on regulatory requirements, see Note 17 Regulatory Capital and Dividend Restrictions to the consolidated financial statements in this 2017 Form 10-K. 70 Table of Contents Commitments and Contingencies The following table sets forth information regarding our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2017 .

(3) Represents projected interest on the $1.2 billion principal amount of our 5.25% Senior Notes due 2025. There were no amounts outstanding under our Credit Facility as of December 31, 2017. We are not an obligor under or guarantor of any indebtedness of any other party; however, we may have to pay referral claims of health care providers under contract with us who are not able to pay costs of medical services provided by other providers. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS At December 31, 2017 , we did not have any off-balance sheet financing arrangements except for operating leases as described in the table above. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES In the ordinary course of business, we make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of our results of operations and financial condition in conformity with GAAP. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions. We believe that our accounting estimates relating to premium revenue recognition and premiums receivable, medical benefits expense and medical benefits payable, and goodwill and intangible assets, are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require management's most difficult, subjective and complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Premium Revenue Recognition and Premiums Receivable We earn premium revenue through our participation in Medicaid, Medicaid-related and Medicare programs. Our Medicaid contracts with state agencies generally are multi-year contracts subject to annual renewal provisions, while our Medicare contracts with CMS renew annually. Our Medicare and Medicaid contracts establish fixed, monthly premium rates per member ("PMPM"), which are generally determined at the beginning of each new contract renewal period; however, premiums may be adjusted by CMS and state agencies throughout the terms of the contracts in certain cases. Premium rate changes are recognized in the period the change becomes effective, when the effect of the change in the rate is reasonably estimable and collection is assured. Our contracts also have additional provisions as described in the sections below. 71 Table of Contents We recognize premium revenue in the period in which we are obligated to provide services to our members. We are generally paid by CMS and state agencies in the month in which we provide services. On a monthly basis, we bill members for any premiums for which they are responsible according to their respective plan. We record premiums earned but not received as premiums receivable and record premiums received in advance of the period of service as unearned premiums in the consolidated balance sheets. Unearned premiums are recognized as revenue when we provide the related services. Member premiums are recognized as revenue in the period of service. We estimate, on an on-going basis, the amount of members' billings that may not be collectible, based on our evaluation of historical trends. An allowance is established for the estimated amount that may not be collectible. In addition, we routinely monitor the collectability of specific premiums receivable from CMS and state agencies, including Medicaid receivables for obstetric deliveries and newborns and net receivables for member retroactivity and reduce revenue and premiums receivable by the amount we estimate may not be collectible. Premium payments are based upon eligibility lists produced by CMS and state agencies. We verify these lists to determine whether we have been paid for the correct premium category and program. From time to time, CMS and state agencies require us to reimburse them for premiums that we received for individuals who were subsequently determined to be ineligible for any government-sponsored program or to belong to a plan other than ours. Additionally, the verification of membership may result in additional premiums due to us from CMS and state agencies for individuals who were subsequently determined to belong to our plan for periods in which we received no premium for those members. We estimate the amount of outstanding retroactivity adjustments and adjust premium revenue based on historical trends, premiums billed, the volume of member and contract renewal activity and other information. We record amounts receivable in premiums receivable, net and amounts payable in other accrued expenses and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. Supplemental Medicaid Premiums We earn supplemental premium payments for eligible obstetric deliveries and newborns for our Medicaid members in Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Illinois (through December 31, 2017), Missouri, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York and South Carolina. Each state Medicaid contract specifies how and when these supplemental payments are earned and paid. We also earn supplemental Medicaid premium payments in some states for high cost drugs and other eligible services. We recognize supplemental premium revenue in the period we provide related services to our members. Medicaid ACA Industry Fee Reimbursement The ACA industry fee began in 2014. For 2015 and 2016, we received amendments, written agreements or other documentation from all of our state Medicaid customers that commit them to reimburse us for the portion of the ACA industry fee attributable to our Medicaid plans, including its non-deductibility for income tax purposes. Effective January 1, 2017, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 provided for a one-year moratorium on the ACA industry fee, and, as a result, eliminated the associated Medicaid ACA industry fee reimbursements from our state government partners for 2017. Accordingly, we did not recognize any Medicaid ACA industry fee reimbursement revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017. We recognized $244.9 million and $219.2 million of reimbursement for the ACA industry fee as premium revenue for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Medicaid Risk-Adjusted Premiums and Retroactive Rate Changes As previously discussed, Medicaid premium rate changes are recognized in the period the change becomes effective, when the effect of the change in the rate is reasonably estimable and collection is assured. In some instances, our Medicaid premiums are subject to risk score adjustments based on the health profile of our membership. Generally, the risk score is determined by the state agency's analysis of encounter submissions of processed claims data to determine the acuity of our membership relative to the entire state's Medicaid membership. The frequency of when states adjust premiums varies, but is usually done quarterly or semi-annually on a retrospective basis. We recognize periodic changes to risk-adjusted premiums as revenue when the amounts are determinable and collection is reasonably assured. Historically, we have not experienced significant differences between our estimates and amounts ultimately paid or received. 72 Table of Contents Medicare Risk-Adjusted Premiums CMS provides risk-adjusted payments for MA Plans and PDPs based on the demographics and health severity of enrollees. The risk-adjusted premiums we receive are based on claims and encounter data that we submit to CMS within prescribed deadlines. We develop our estimates for risk-adjusted premiums utilizing historical experience, or other data, and predictive models as sufficient member risk score data becomes available over the course of each CMS plan year. We recognize periodic changes to risk-adjusted premiums as revenue when the amounts are determinable and collection is reasonably assured, which is possible as additional diagnosis code information is reported to CMS, when the ultimate adjustment settlements are received from CMS or we receive notification of such settlement amounts. CMS adjusts premiums on two separate occasions on a retrospective basis. The first retrospective adjustment for a given plan year generally occurs during the third quarter of that year. This initial settlement represents the update of risk scores for the current plan year based on the severity of claims incurred in the prior plan year. CMS then issues a final retrospective risk adjusted premium settlement for that plan year in the following year. We develop our estimates for risk-adjusted premiums utilizing historical experience and predictive models as sufficient member risk score data becomes available over the course of each CMS plan year. We populate our models with available risk score data on our members and base risk-adjusted premiums on risk score data from the previous year. We are not privy to risk score data for members new to our plans in the current plan year; therefore, we include assumptions regarding these members' risk scores. We periodically revise our estimates of risk-adjusted premiums as additional diagnosis code information is reported to CMS and adjust our estimates to actual amounts when the ultimate adjustment settlements are either received from CMS or we receive notification from CMS of such settlement amounts. As a result of the variability of factors that determine our estimates for risk-adjusted premiums, the actual amount of the CMS retroactive payment could be materially more or less than our estimates and could have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. We record any changes in estimates in current operations as adjustments to premium revenue. Historically, we have not experienced significant differences between our estimates and amounts ultimately received. The data provided to CMS to determine members' risk scores is subject to audit by CMS even after the annual settlements occur. An audit may result in the refund of premiums to CMS. While our experience to date has not resulted in a material refund, future refunds could materially reduce premium revenue in the year in which CMS determines a refund is required and could be material to our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Minimum Medical Expense and Risk Corridor Provisions We may be required to refund certain premium revenue to state agencies and CMS under various contractual and plan arrangements. We estimate the effect of the following arrangements on a monthly basis and reflect any adjustments to premium revenues in current operations. We report the estimated net amounts due to state agencies and CMS in other payables to government partners in the consolidated balance sheets. Certain of our Medicaid contracts require us to expend a minimum percentage of premiums on eligible medical benefits expense. To the extent that we expend less than the minimum percentage of the premiums on eligible medical benefits, we are required to refund to the state all or some portion of the difference between the minimum and our actual allowable medical benefits expense. Additionally, certain of our Medicaid contracts include other types of risk sharing arrangements (e.g., profit sharing arrangements) that require return of revenue to the state or receipt of revenue from the state, based on certain pre-tax earnings, net earnings or other results of operations-based calculations. In all arrangements, we estimate the amounts due from or to the state agencies based on the terms of our contracts with the applicable state agency and record the amounts as a change in premium. Historically, we have not experienced material differences between our recorded estimates and the subsequent state agencies settlement amounts. Our MA and PDP premiums are subject to risk sharing through the CMS Medicare Part D risk corridor provisions. The risk corridor calculation compares our actual experience to the target amount of prescription drug costs, limited to costs under the standard coverage as defined by CMS, less rebates included in our submitted plan year bid. We receive additional premium from CMS if our actual experience is more than 5% above the target amount. We refund premiums to CMS if our actual experience is more than 5% below the target amount. Based on the risk corridor provision and PDP activity-to-date, an estimated risk-sharing receivable or payable is recorded as an adjustment to premium revenue. After the close of the annual plan year, CMS performs the risk corridor calculation and any differences are settled between CMS and our plans. Historically, we have not experienced material differences between the subsequent CMS settlement amount and our recorded estimates. Beginning in 2014, the ACA required the establishment of a minimum medical loss ratio ( MLR ) for MA plans and Part D plans, requiring them to spend not less than 85% of premiums on medical benefits. The rules implementing the minimum MLR impose financial and other penalties for failing to achieve the minimum MLR, including requirements to refund to CMS shortfalls in amounts spent on medical benefits and termination of a plan MA contract for prolonged failure to achieve the minimum MLR. MLR is determined by adding a plan spending for clinical services, prescription drugs and other direct 73 Table of Contents patient benefits, plus its total spending on quality improvement activities and dividing the total by earned premiums (after subtracting specific identified taxes and other fees). These provisions did not have a material effect on our results of operations in 2017, 2016 or 2015. A summary of other net payables to government partners is as follows (in millions): As of December 31, 2017 2016 Liability to states under Medicaid risk sharing provisions $ (142.5 ) $ (105.9 ) Liability to CMS under risk corridor provision (179.1 ) (190.5 ) Liability to CMS under MA/PDP minimum MLR provisions of the ACA (1.2 ) (0.3 ) Net payables to government partners (1) $ (322.8 ) $ (296.7 ) (1) The components of net payables to government partners are classified in the consolidated balance sheets as $44.2 million and $367.0 million in current assets and current liabilities, respectively, as of December 31, 2017, and $6.5 million and $303.2 million in current assets and current liabilities, respectively, as of December 31, 2016. Medicare Part D Subsidies For qualifying low income PDP members, CMS pays for some, or all, of the member's monthly premium. We receive certain Part D prospective subsidy payments from CMS for our MA and PDP members as a fixed monthly per member amount, based on the estimated costs of providing prescription drug benefits over the plan year, as reflected in our bids. Approximately nine to ten months subsequent to the end of the plan year, or later in the case of the coverage gap discount subsidy, a settlement payment is made between CMS and our plans based on the difference between the prospective payments and actual claims experience. The subsidy components under Part D are described below. Low-Income Cost Sharing Subsidy ("LICS") - For qualifying low income members, CMS reimburses us for all or a portion of the low income member's deductible, coinsurance and co-payment amounts above the out-of-pocket threshold. Catastrophic Reinsurance Subsidy - CMS reimburses plans for 80% of the drug costs after a member reaches his or her out-of-pocket catastrophic threshold through a catastrophic reinsurance subsidy. Coverage Gap Discount Subsidy ("CGDS") - CMS provides monthly prospective payments for pharmaceutical manufacturer discounts made available to members. Catastrophic reinsurance subsidies and the LICS represent cost reimbursements under the Medicare Part D program. We are fully reimbursed by CMS for costs incurred for these contract elements and, accordingly, there is no insurance risk to us. Therefore, amounts received for these subsidies are not considered premium revenue, and are reported, net of the subsidy benefits paid, as Funds receivable/held for the benefit of members in the consolidated balance sheets. The receipts and payments between us and CMS are presented on a net basis as financing activity in our consolidated statements of cash flows because we are essentially administering and paying the benefit subsidies on behalf of CMS. Historically, the settlement payments between us and CMS have not been materially different from our estimates. CGDS advance payments are recorded within Funds receivable/held for the benefit of members in the consolidated balance sheets. Receivables are set up for manufacturer-invoiced amounts. Manufacturer payments reduce the receivable as payments are received. After the end of the contract year, during the Medicare Part D Payment reconciliation process for the CGD, CMS will perform a cost-based reconciliation to ensure the Medicare Part D sponsor is paid for gap discounts advanced at the point of sale, based on accepted prescription drug event data. 74 Table of Contents Funds payable for the benefit of members, net consisted of the following (in millions): As of December 31, 2017 2016 Low-income cost sharing subsidy $ (47.7 ) $ 47.8 Catastrophic reinsurance subsidy (987.1 ) (418.1 ) Coverage gap discount subsidy (13.6 ) 12.6 Funds payable for the benefit of members, net (1) $ (1,048.4 ) $ (357.7 ) (1) The components of net funds payable for the benefit of members, net are classified in the consolidated balance sheets as $27.5 million and $1,075.9 million in current assets and current liabilities, respectively, as of December 31, 2017, and as $32.6 million and $390.3 million in current assets and current liabilities, respectively, as of December 31, 2016. Estimating Medical Benefits Expense and Medical Benefits Payable We recognize the cost of medical benefits in the period in which services are provided, including an estimate of the cost of medical benefits incurred but not reported ("IBNR"). Medical benefits expense includes direct medical expenses and certain medically-related administrative costs. Direct medical expenses include amounts paid or payable to hospitals, physicians, pharmacy benefit managers and providers of ancillary services. Recorded direct medical expenses are reduced by the amount of pharmacy rebates earned, which are estimated based on historical utilization of specific pharmaceuticals, current utilization and contract terms. Pharmacy rebates earned but not yet received from pharmaceutical manufacturers are included in pharmacy rebates receivable in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Direct medical expenses may also include reserves for estimated referral claims related to health care providers under contract with us who are financially troubled or insolvent and who may not be able to honor their obligations for the costs of medical services provided by other providers. In these instances, we may be required to honor these obligations for legal or business reasons. Based on our current assessment of providers under contract with us, such losses have not been and are not expected to be significant. Also included in direct medical expense are our estimates for provider settlements due to clarification of contract terms, out-of-network reimbursement, claims payment differences and amounts due to contracted providers under risk-sharing and/or value-based arrangements. Consistent with the criteria specified and defined in guidance issued by the Department of Health and Human Services ("HHS") for costs that qualify to be reported as medical benefits under the minimum MLR provision of the ACA, we record certain medically-related administrative costs such as preventive health and wellness, care management, and other quality improvement costs, as medical benefits expense. All other medically-related administrative costs, such as utilization review services, network and provider credentialing and claims handling costs, are recorded in selling, general, and administrative expense. Medical benefits payable represents amounts for claims fully adjudicated but not yet paid and estimates for IBNR. Our estimate of IBNR is the most significant estimate included in our consolidated financial statements. We determine our best estimate of the base liability for IBNR utilizing consistent standard actuarial methodologies based upon key assumptions, which vary by business segment. Our assumptions include current payment experience, trend factors and completion factors. Trend factors in our standard actuarial methodologies include contractual requirements, historic utilization trends, the interval between the date services are rendered and the date claims are paid, denied claims activity, disputed claims activity, benefit changes, expected health care cost inflation, seasonality patterns, maturity of lines of business, changes in membership and other factors. The following table provides a detail of the components of medical benefits payable: December 31, 2017 % of Total December 31, 2016 % of Total (In millions) IBNR $ 1,412.3 66% $ 1,141.9 68% Other medical benefits payable 734.0 34% 548.6 32% Total medical benefits payable $ 2,146.3 100% $ 1,690.5 100% 75 Table of Contents The factors and assumptions that are used to develop our estimate of medical benefits expense and medical benefits payable inherently are subject to greater variability when there is more limited experience or information available to us. The ultimate claims payment amounts, patterns and trends for new products and geographic areas cannot be precisely predicted at their onset since we, the providers and the members do not have experience in these products or geographic areas. Standard accepted actuarial methodologies, discussed above, would allow for this inherent variability. This can result in larger differences between the originally estimated medical benefits payable and the actual claims amounts paid. Conversely, during periods where our products and geographies are more stable and mature, we have more reliable claims payment patterns and trend experience. With more reliable data, we should be able to more closely estimate the ultimate claims payment amounts; therefore, we may experience smaller differences between our original estimate of medical benefits payable and the actual claim amounts paid. In developing our estimates, we apply different estimation methods depending on the month for which incurred claims are being estimated. For the more recent months, which constitute the majority of the amount of the medical benefits payable, we estimate claims incurred by applying observed trend factors to the fixed fee PMPM costs for prior months, which costs have been estimated using completion factors in order to estimate the PMPM costs for the most recent months. We validate our estimates of the most recent PMPM costs by comparing the most recent months' utilization levels to the utilization levels in prior months and actuarial techniques that incorporate a historical analysis of claim payments, including trends in cost of care provided and timeliness of submission and processing of claims. Many aspects of the managed care business are not predictable. Medical cost trends potentially are more volatile than other segments of the economy. Therefore, we must continually monitor our historical experience in determining our trend assumptions to reflect the ever-changing mix, needs and size of our membership. External factors such as government-mandated benefits or other regulatory changes, catastrophes and epidemics may affect medical cost trends. Other internal factors such as system conversions and claims processing changes may affect our ability to accurately predict estimates of historical completion factors or medical cost trends. We believe that the amount of medical benefits payable as of December 31, 2017 is adequate to cover our ultimate liability for unpaid claims as of that date; however, actual payments may differ from established estimates. If the completion factors we used in estimating our IBNR for the year ended December 31, 2017 were decreased by 1%, our medical benefits expense would increase by approximately $192.5 million. If the completion factors were increased by 1%, our medical benefits expense would decrease by approximately $188.1 million. After determining an estimate of the base liability for IBNR, we make an additional estimate, also using standard actuarial techniques, to account for adverse conditions that may cause actual claims to be higher than the estimated base reserve. We refer to this additional liability as the provision for moderately adverse conditions. Our estimate of the provision for moderately adverse conditions captures the potential adverse development from factors such as: our entry into new geographical markets; our provision of services to new populations such as the aged, blind and disabled; variations in utilization of benefits and increasing medical costs, including higher drug costs; changes in provider reimbursement arrangements; variations in claims processing speed and patterns, claims payment and the severity of claims; and health epidemics or outbreaks of disease such as the flu or enterovirus. We evaluate our estimates of medical benefits payable as we obtain more complete claims information and medical expense trend data over time. We record differences between actual experience and estimates used to establish the liability, which we refer to as favorable and unfavorable prior year reserve developments, as increases or decreases to medical benefits expense in the period we identify the differences. 76 Table of Contents The following table provides a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance of our consolidated medical benefits payable: Years Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2015 (In millions) Balances as of beginning of period $ 1,690.5 $ 1,536.0 $ 1,483.8 Acquisitions (divestitures) 128.1 37.3 (9.5 ) Medical benefits incurred related to: Current year (1) 15,112.4 12,374.1 12,189.5 Prior year (367.6 ) (284.7 ) (211.0 ) Total 14,744.8 12,089.4 11,978.5 Medical benefits paid related to: Current year (13,355.9 ) (10,925.0 ) (10,763.0 ) Prior year (1,061.2 ) (1,047.2 ) (1,153.8 ) Total (14,417.1 ) (11,972.2 ) (11,916.8 ) Balances as of end of year $ 2,146.3 $ 1,690.5 $ 1,536.0 (1)-Incurred amounts for 2017 include the $45.6 million Illinois PDR discussed further in Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the consolidated financial statements included in this 2017 Form 10-K. Medical benefits payable recorded developed favorably by approximately $367.6 million , $284.7 million and $211.0 million in 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively. The release of the provision for moderately adverse conditions included in our prior year estimates was substantially offset by the provision for moderately adverse conditions established for claims incurred in the current year. Accordingly, the favorable development in our estimate of medical benefits payable related to claims incurred in prior years does not directly correspond to a decrease in medical benefits expense recognized during the period in which the favorable development is recognized. Excluding the prior year development related to the release of the provision for moderately adverse conditions, our estimates of consolidated medical benefits expense recorded developed favorably by approximately $224.6 million , $154.3 million , and $78.1 million in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. Such amounts are net of the development relating to refunds due to government customers in connection with minimum loss ratio provisions. The net favorable development recognized in both 2017 and 2016 was primarily in our Medicaid Health Plans segment and, to a lesser extent, in our Medicare Health Plans segment. The net favorable development resulted primarily from a number of operational and clinical initiatives planned and executed, throughout both 2015 and 2016, that contributed to lower than expected pharmacy and medical trends, and actual claim submission time being faster than we originally assumed (i.e. our completion factors were higher than we originally assumed) in establishing our medical benefits payable in the prior years. This development does not directly correspond to an increase in our current year operating results as these reductions were offset by estimated current period medical benefits expense when we established our estimate of the current year medical benefits payable. Both completion factor and medical trend assumptions are influenced by utilization levels, unit costs, mix of business, provider reimbursement levels, processing system conversions and changes, claim inventory levels, claim processing patterns, our ability and practices to manage medical and pharmaceutical costs, claim submission patterns and operational changes resulting from business combinations, among others. Our actual costs were ultimately less than expected. The favorable development recognized in 2015 was primarily due to lower than expected utilization in our Medicaid Health Plans segment. Premium Deficiency Reserves We evaluate our contracts to determine if it is probable that a loss will be incurred. We establish a premium deficiency reserve ("PDR") when it is probable that expected future medical benefits and administrative expenses will exceed future premiums and reinsurance recoveries for the remainder of a contract period. For purposes of determining a PDR, we do not consider investment income and contracts are grouped in a manner consistent with our method of acquiring, servicing and measuring the profitability of such contracts. A PDR is recorded as medical benefits expense and in medical benefits payable. Once established, a PDR is reduced over the contract period as an offset to actual losses. We re-evaluate our PDR estimates each reporting period and, if estimated future losses differ from those in the current PDR estimate, we adjust the liability through medical benefits expense, as necessary. 77 Table of Contents During the fourth quarter of 2017, we recorded a $45.6 million PDR in connection with our new Illinois Medicaid managed care contract that was effective on January 1, 2018 (the "Illinois PDR"). In December 2017, we received our initial rate structure and membership roster from the State of Illinois, which were used as the basis for our initial assessment of the contract. The Illinois PDR reflects the initial premium rate structure, estimated medical benefits and other costs expected to be incurred during the initial four-year contractual term of the contract. We had no PDR liabilities recorded in our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2016. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Our acquisitions typically result in goodwill, which represents the excess of the acquisition cost over the fair value of net assets acquired. Goodwill is assigned to reporting units, which we determined to be the same as our operating segments. Goodwill recorded at December 31, 2017 was $660.7 million compared with $392.5 million at December 31, 2016. Goodwill attributable to our Medicaid reporting unit was $274.7 million and $282.1 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Goodwill attributable to our MA reporting unit was $386.0 million and $110.4 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase in goodwill for the MA reporting unit from December 31, 2016 resulted from our acquisition Universal American during 2017. Refer to Note 3 - Acquisitions , included in the consolidated financial statements in this 2017 Form 10-K for additional discussion. We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level at least annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that it would be more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying value. Such events or circumstances could include a significant adverse change in business climate, an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, unanticipated competition and the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit, among others. To determine whether goodwill is impaired, we compare an estimate of the fair value of the applicable reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value, we compare the implied fair value of the applicable goodwill to its carrying value to measure the amount of goodwill impairment, if any. We perform our annual goodwill impairment test based on our financial position and results of operations as of June 30 of each year, which generally coincides with the finalization of federal and state contract negotiations and our initial budgeting and planning process. The annual impairment tests are based on an evaluation of estimated future discounted cash flows. The estimated discounted cash flows are based on the best information available to us at the time, including supportable assumptions and projections we believe are reasonable. Our discounted cash flow estimates use discount rates that correspond to a weighted-average cost of capital consistent with a market-participant view. The discount rates are consistent with those used for investment decisions and take into account the operating plans and strategies of our operating segments. Certain other key assumptions utilized, including changes in membership, premium, health care costs, operating expenses, fees, assessments and taxes and effective tax rates, are based on estimates consistent with those utilized in our annual budgeting and planning process that we believe are reasonable. However, if we do not achieve the results reflected in the assumptions and estimates, our goodwill impairment evaluations could be adversely affected, and we may impair a portion of our goodwill, which would adversely affect our operating results in the period of impairment. Impairments, if any, would be classified as an operating expense. Based on the results of our annual impairment testing in 2017, we determined that the fair value of each reporting unit substantially exceeded its carrying value and no further goodwill impairment assessment was necessary. Other intangible assets resulting from our acquisitions include provider networks, broker networks, trademarks, state contracts, non-compete agreements, licenses and permits. We amortize other intangible assets over their estimated useful lives ranging from approximately one to 15 years. These assets are allocated to reporting units for impairment testing purposes. We review our other intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances occur, which may potentially affect the estimated useful life or recoverability of the remaining balances of our intangible assets. Such events and changes in circumstances would include significant changes in membership, state funding, federal and state government contracts and provider networks. Upon such an occurrence, recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to current forecasts of undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets. Identifiable cash flows are measured at the lowest level for which they are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities. If these assets are determined to be impaired, the amount of impairment recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds their fair value. During 2017, 2016 and 2015, no events or circumstances have occurred, which may potentially affect the estimated useful life or recoverability of the remaining balances of our other intangible assets. Accordingly, there were no impairment losses recognized during these periods. 78 RECENTLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS Refer to Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , included in the consolidated financial statements for information and disclosures related to new accounting standards which are incorporated herein by reference.
