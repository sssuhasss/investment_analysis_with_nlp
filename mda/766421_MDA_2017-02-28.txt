ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OVERVIEW The following Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD&A") is intended to help the reader understand our company, our operations and our present business environment. MD&A is provided as a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. All statements in the following discussion that are not statements of historical information or descriptions of current accounting policy are forward-looking statements. Please consider our forward-looking statements in light of the risks referred to in this report introductory cautionary note and the risks mentioned in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors. This overview summarizes the MD&A, which includes the following sections: Year in Review highlights from 2016 outlining some of the major events that happened during the year and how they affected our financial performance. Results of Operations an in-depth analysis of our revenues by segment and our expenses from a consolidated perspective for the three years presented in our consolidated financial statements. To the extent material to the understanding of segment profitability, we more fully describe the segment expenses per financial statement line item. Financial and statistical data is also included here. This section includes forward-looking statements regarding our view of 2017 . When providing forward-looking statements on future expectations, we will provide the impact of Virgin America as a separate component of expected changes from 2016. Virgin America was acquired on December 14, 2016 and plays a significant role in the year-over-year change. Further information about the acquisition of Virgin America can be found in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. Liquidity and Capital Resources an overview of our financial position, analysis of cash flows, sources and uses of cash, contractual obligations and commitments and off-balance sheet arrangements. Critical Accounting Estimates a discussion of our accounting estimates that involve significant judgment and uncertainties. YEAR IN REVIEW On December 14, 2016 we completed our acquisition of Virgin America, becoming the fifth largest U.S. airline. The combined company now offers nearly 1,200 daily flights to 118 destinations across the United States, Mexico, Canada, Costa Rica and Cuba, with more nonstop destinations from the West Coast than any other airline. By combining loyalty programs and networks, along with our award-winning customer service and the expansion of our international partner portfolio, we believe we will provide greater benefits for our guests and become known as the premier airline for people on the West Coast. In 2016 , we posted our thirteenth consecutive annual profit on an adjusted basis, which is a testament to the hard work of our people and the successful execution of our strategic initiatives. Our 2016 pretax income as reported was $1.3 billion , an increase of 3% over 2015 . Our 2016 pretax income on an adjusted basis (a non-GAAP financial measure) was $1.4 billion , an increase of 8% over 2015 . The adjusted pretax income reflects the exclusion of $117 million of merger-related costs associated with our acquisition of Virgin America and $13 million of mark-to-market fuel hedge adjustments. The improvement in adjusted pretax income was driven by an increase of $333 million in revenues and a decrease of $ 123 million in fuel costs. These benefits were partially offset by an increase in operating expenses, excluding fuel and special items, of $320 million , or 10% , to support the increased capacity of 11% . This increase reflects the addition of Virgin America capacity from the acquisition date through December 31, 2016. The growth in revenues of $333 million was driven by the growth in our business and the inclusion of Virgin America in our results for the period from December 14, 2016 through December 31, 2016. On a combined basis, we launched 17 new markets in 2016 and, in January 2017, we launched historic flights to Havana, Cuba from Los Angeles. On the regional side of our business, we anticipate the delivery of Horizon's Embraer E175 regional jet this spring the first of an order of 33 placed in early 2016. Our network is rapidly expanding with these regional aircraft and the recent acquisition of Virgin America. We believe we have a strong future ahead of us and look forward to the many new opportunities our combined networks will bring our company. 32 See Results of Operations below for further discussion of changes in revenues and operating expenses and our reconciliation of Non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure.

In 2016 , we increased our quarterly dividend 38% from $0.20 per share to $0.275 per share, and, subsequent to December 31, 2016 , we announced a 9% increase to $0.30 per share. Overall, we returned $329 million to shareholders during 2016 . We expect to continue to return capital to shareholders in 2017 , primarily in the form of dividends. Outlook We completed the acquisition of Virgin America on December 14, 2016, positioning us as the fifth largest airline in the U.S., with an unparalleled ability to serve West Coast travelers. The acquisition of Virgin America provides a platform for growth of our low-fare, premium product, a powerful West Coast network for our guests and enhanced international partnerships. Additionally, Virgin America provides access to constrained gates, particularly on the East Coast, creating increased utility for our guests. 34 In 2017 and beyond, we are focused on the successful integration of Virgin America with Alaska Air Group, while continuing to work towards obtaining a Single Operating Certificate ("SOC"). We currently expect to receive an SOC in early 2018. Our priority throughout the integration process is to run two great airlines and maintain a safe and compliant operation, while providing a great experience for our guests. Additionally, we are particularly focused on merging the cultures and brands that have made Alaska and Virgin America respected and trusted over the years by our guests. We intend to minimize any disruption to our guests during our integration efforts by being transparent about the progress we are making and how the changes may affect them. Employee engagement throughout the integration will remain a top priority as well, ensuring that employees remain engaged, informed and excited about the new Alaska Air Group. We plan to bring our teams together through workshops and trainings delivered throughout 2017. Additionally, we will remain focused on capturing the value and synergies created by combining these two great companies. In addition to our integration with Virgin America, one of our biggest initiatives is the launch of our new "Premium Class" service on our B737 aircraft, which provides greater leg room, priority boarding and complimentary cocktails, among other benefits. Premium Class was rolled out in early January 2017 and, so far, the results are exceeding our expectations in both guest response and revenue generation. Currently, we expect to grow our combined network capacity in 2017 by approximately 8.5% . The growth rate compares 2017 system-wide capacity with historical Air Group and Virgin America combined capacity in 2016. This compares to a 10.2% combined growth in 2016 on the same basis. Current schedules indicate competitive capacity will be 5 points higher in the first quarter of 2017 . We believe that our product, our operation, our engaged employees, our award-winning service, and our competitive Mileage Plan and Elevate programs, combined with our strong balance sheet, give us the ability to compete vigorously in our markets. 35 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ADJUSTED (NON-GAAP) RESULTS AND PER-SHARE AMOUNTS We believe disclosure of earnings excluding the impact of merger-related costs, mark-to-market gains or losses or other individual special revenues or expenses is useful information to investors because: By eliminating fuel expense and certain special items (including merger-related costs) from our unit metrics, we believe that we have better visibility into the results of operations and our non-fuel cost-reduction initiatives. Our industry is highly competitive and is characterized by high fixed costs, so even a small reduction in non-fuel operating costs can lead to a significant improvement in operating results. In addition, we believe that all domestic carriers are similarly impacted by changes in jet fuel costs over the long run, so it is important for management (and thus investors) to understand the impact of (and trends in) company-specific cost drivers, such as labor rates and productivity, airport costs, maintenance costs, etc., which are more controllable by management. Cost per ASM ("CASM") excluding fuel and certain special items, such as merger-related costs, is one of the most important measures used by management and by the Air Group Board of Directors in assessing quarterly and annual cost performance. Adjusted income before income tax and CASM excluding fuel (and other items as specified in our plan documents) are important metrics for the employee incentive plan, which covers the majority of Air Group employees. CASM excluding fuel and certain special items is a measure commonly used by industry analysts and we believe it is the basis by which they compare our airlines to others in the industry. The measure is also the subject of frequent questions from investors. Disclosure of the individual impact of certain noted items provides investors the ability to measure and monitor performance both with and without these special items. We believe that disclosing the impact of certain items, such as merger-related costs and mark-to-market hedging adjustments, is important because it provides information on significant items that are not necessarily indicative of future performance. Industry analysts and investors consistently measure our performance without these items for better comparability between periods and among other airlines. Although we disclose our passenger unit revenues, we do not (nor are we able to) evaluate unit revenues excluding the impact that changes in fuel costs have had on ticket prices. Fuel expense represents a large percentage of our total operating expenses. Fluctuations in fuel prices often drive changes in unit revenues in the mid-to-long term. Although we believe it is useful to evaluate non-fuel unit costs for the reasons noted above, we would caution readers of these financial statements not to place undue reliance on unit costs excluding fuel as a measure or predictor of future profitability because of the significant impact of fuel costs on our business. Although we are presenting these non-GAAP amounts for the reasons above, investors and other readers should not necessarily conclude that these amounts are non-recurring, infrequent, or unusual in nature. 2016 COMPARED WITH 2015 Our consolidated net income for 2016 was $814 million , or $6.54 per diluted share, compared to net income of $848 million , or $6.56 per diluted share, in 2015 . Our financial results include results of Virgin America for the period from December 14, 2016 through December 31, 2016 and the impact of purchase accounting as of December 14, 2016. Refer to the "Critical Accounting Estimates" section for further information regarding purchase accounting. Excluding the impact of merger-related costs, mark-to-market fuel hedge adjustments and other special items, our adjusted consolidated net income for 2016 was $911 million , or $7.32 per diluted share, compared to an adjusted consolidated net income of $842 million , or $6.51 per share, in 2015 . The following tables reconcile our adjusted net income and earnings per diluted share ("EPS") during the full year 2016 and 2015 to amounts as reported in accordance with GAAP. 36 Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2016 2015 (in millions, except per-share amounts) Dollars Diluted EPS Dollars Diluted EPS Reported GAAP net income and diluted EPS $ 814 $ 6.54 $ 848 $ 6.56 Mark-to-market fuel hedge adjustments (13 ) (0.11 ) Special items merger-related costs and other (a) 117 0.94 32 0.25 Income tax effect on special items (b) (24 ) (0.19 ) (12 ) (0.10 ) Special tax (benefit)/expense (c) 17 0.14 (26 ) (0.20 ) Non-GAAP adjusted net income and diluted EPS $ 911 $ 7.32 $ 842 $ 6.51 (a) Refer to Note 11 to the consolidated financial statement for the description of special items.

The changes are summarized in the following table: Twelve Months Ended December 31, (in millions) 2016 2015 % Change Passenger Mainline $ 4,098 $ 3,939 4 Regional 908 854 6 Total passenger revenue $ 5,006 $ 4,793 4 Freight and mail 108 108 Other net 817 697 17 Total operating revenues $ 5,931 $ 5,598 6 Passenger Revenue Mainline Mainline passenger revenue for 2016 increased by 4% due to a 9.9% increase in capacity, partially offset by a 5.4% decrease in PRASM compared to 2015 . The increase in capacity was driven by new routes and growth in our operating fleet. Virgin America capacity from the acquisition date through December 31, 2016 represented approximately 2 points of capacity increase from 2015. The decrease in PRASM was driven by a decrease of 5.7% in ticket yield due to competitive pressures and our own growth, offset by a slight increase in load factor. Furthermore, the decline in fuel prices over the last year has contributed to lower ticket prices. We expect competitive pressures on unit revenues to continue into 2017 . However, given our projected capacity growth, we expect total passenger revenue will increase from 2016 on a combined comparative basis that includes full 2016 capacity of Virgin America. Passenger Revenue Regional Regional passenger revenue increased by $54 million , or 6% , compared to 2015 due to a 16.5% increase in capacity, partially offset by an 8.7% decrease in PRASM compared to 2015 . The increase in capacity is due to an increase in departures from new E175 deliveries, an increase in average aircraft stage length and the annualization of new routes introduced over the past twelve months. The decrease in PRASM was due to a 7.4% decrease in ticket yield, as well as a decrease in load factor of 1.1 point s. The decrease in yield was due to an increase in competitive capacity in our regional markets and our own growth as we strengthen our network utility in the Pacific Northwest, as well as an increase in the average trip length of our regional flights. We expect Regional passenger revenue to increase in 2017 , primarily due to the delivery and placement into service of 18 E175s and the annualization of new routes introduced in 2016. Other Net Other net revenue increased $120 million , or 17% , from 2015 , primarily due to increases in Mileage Plan revenue. Mileage Plan revenue increased $100 million or 30% , due to increased miles sold and improved compensation terms with our Mileage Plan affinity credit card partner as a result of a contract extension which became effective January 1, 2016. Additionally, Mileage Plan revenue earned from our partner airlines increased as compared to the prior year. We expect our Other net revenue to experience an increase, on a year over year basis, at a pace higher than the expected increase in passengers in 2017 , due to growth in the Mileage Plan program as we introduce Virgin America Elevate members to the program, as well as continued organic growth amongst new and existing customers. 39 OPERATING EXPENSES Total operating expenses increased $282 million , or 7% , compared to 2015 , primarily as a result of higher wages and benefits and $117 million of merger-related costs, partially offset by lower fuel costs. We believe it is useful to summarize operating expenses as follows, which is consistent with the way expenses are reported internally and evaluated by management: Twelve Months Ended December 31, (in millions) 2016 2015 % Change Fuel expense $ 831 $ 954 (13 ) Non-fuel expenses 3,634 3,314 10 Special items merger-related costs and other 117 32 266 Total Operating Expenses $ 4,582 $ 4,300 7 Significant operating expense variances from 2015 are more fully described below. Wages and Benefits Wages and benefits increased during 2016 by $128 million , or 10% , compared to 2015 . The primary components of wages and benefits are shown in the following table: Twelve Months Ended December 31, (in millions) 2016 2015 % Change Wages $ 1,022 $ 945 8 Medical and other benefits 192 153 25 Defined contribution plans 67 60 12 Pension Defined benefit plans 25 28 (11 ) Payroll taxes 76 68 12 Total wages and benefits $ 1,382 $ 1,254 10 Wages increased 8% on a 6.5% increase in FTEs. The increase in wages was primarily attributable to FTE growth to support expansion of our business and an increase in the average wages per employee. Medical and other benefits increased 25% compared to the prior year. The increase is primarily due to an increase in the number of employees and high-cost medical claims. Defined contribution plans increased 12% due to FTE growth and increased participation throughout all labor groups. Pension expense decreased 11% , compared to the same period in the prior year. The decrease is due to a change in several assumptions used at December 31, 2015, including a higher discount rate, updated retirement age assumptions, future salary increase assumptions and others that resulted in lower expense recognition in 2016. We expect wages and benefits to be 30% to 35% higher in 2017 compared to 2016 . The impact of Virgin America is approximately three quarters of the increase. The remainder is the expected growth in FTEs to support our capacity growth, along with higher wages, pension costs and medical costs. Variable Incentive Pay Variable incentive pay expense increased to $127 million in 2016 from $120 million in 2015 . The increase is due to a higher wage base. 40 Aircraft Fuel Aircraft fuel expense includes both raw fuel expense (as defined below) and the effect of mark-to-market adjustments to our fuel hedge portfolio included in our consolidated statement of operations as the value of that portfolio increases and decreases. Aircraft fuel expense can be volatile, even between quarters, because it includes these gains or losses in the value of the underlying instrument as crude oil prices and refining margins increase or decrease. Raw fuel expense is defined as the price that we generally pay at the airport, or the into-plane price, including taxes and fees. Raw fuel prices are impacted by world oil prices and refining costs, which can vary by region in the U.S. Raw fuel expense approximates cash paid to suppliers and does not reflect the effect of our fuel hedges. Aircraft fuel expense decreased $123 million , or 13% compared to 2015 . The elements of the change are illustrated in the following table: Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2016 2015 (in millions, except for per gallon amounts) Dollars Cost/Gal Dollars Cost/Gal Raw or "into-plane" fuel cost $ 828 $ 1.49 $ 935 $ 1.84 Losses on settled hedges 16 0.03 19 0.04 Consolidated economic fuel expense $ 844 $ 1.52 $ 954 $ 1.88 Mark-to-market fuel hedge adjustments (13 ) (0.02 ) GAAP fuel expense $ 831 $ 1.50 $ 954 $ 1.88 Fuel gallons 554 508 Fuel gallons consumed increased 9.1% on our consolidated 10.6% increase in capacity, partially offset by a 1.4% improvement in fuel efficiency as measured by consolidated ASMs per gallon. The raw fuel price per gallon decreased 19% as a result of lower West Coast jet fuel prices. West Coast jet fuel prices are impacted by the price of crude oil and the refining margins associated with the conversion of crude oil to jet fuel. The decrease in raw fuel price per gallon during 2016 was due to a decline in crude oil prices of 11% and a decrease in refining margins of 36% , when compared to the prior year. We also evaluate economic fuel expense, which we define as raw fuel expense adjusted for the cash we receive from, or pay to, hedge counterparties for hedges that settle during the period, and for the premium expense that we paid for those contracts. A key difference between aircraft fuel expense and economic fuel expense is the timing of gain or loss recognition on our hedge portfolio. When we refer to economic fuel expense, we include gains and losses only when they are realized for those contracts that were settled during the period based on their original contract terms. We believe this is the best measure of the effect that fuel prices are currently having on our business because it most closely approximates the net cash outflow associated with purchasing fuel for our operations. Accordingly, many industry analysts evaluate our results using this measure, and it is the basis for most internal management reporting and incentive pay plans. Losses recognized for hedges that settled during the year were $16 million in 2016 , compared to losses of $19 million in 2015 . These amounts represent cash paid for premium expense, offset by any cash received from those hedges at settlement. As of the date of this filing we expect our economic fuel price per gallon to increase approximately 39% in the first quarter of 2017 as compared to the first quarter of 2016 of Air Group as reported due to higher crude oil prices and refining margins. As both oil prices and refining margins are volatile, we are unable to forecast the full-year cost with any certainty. Aircraft Maintenance Aircraft maintenance costs increased by $17 million , or 7% , compared to the prior year. Maintenance costs increased primarily due to more engine and airframe events than in 2016. Additionally, in the prior year we received vendor credits, which offset expense, for engine maintenance that had been previously completed on the B737 fleet. We expect aircraft maintenance to be approximately 50% to 55% higher in 2017 compared to 2016. The impact of Virgin America represents approximately three quarters of the increase. For Alaska, we expect an increase in engine maintenance costs primarily for our 737-800 aircraft, as we anticipate entering into a power-by-the-hour maintenance arrangement. 41 Aircraft Rent Aircraft rent expense increased by $9 million , or 9% , compared to the prior year, primarily due the addition of the rent expense on the 53 Airbus aircraft leased by Virgin America for the period from December 14, 2016 to December 31, 2016. We expect aircraft rent to be approximately 140% to 145% higher in 2017 compared to 2016 due to the full-year impact of the 53 leased Airbus aircraft, partially offset by a reduction in the number of leased B737-400 aircraft. Landing Fees and Other Rentals Landing fees and other rental expenses increased $24 million , or 8% , primarily due to increased flying in 2016 , as we increased capacity and entered new markets. We expect landing fees and other rental expenses to increase approximately 50% to 55% in 2017 with Virgin America representing about three quarters of the increase. The remainder of the increase relates to our expected capacity growth and rate increases at airports across our network. Contracted Services Contracted services increased $33 million , or 15% , when compared to 2015 . The increase is primarily due to increased flying at stations where we use vendors to assist us. Additionally, wage rates for our vendor employees have increased due in part to higher minimum wage laws in many locations we serve. We also had several information technology and facilities projects that required contracted support. We expect contracted services to be 50% to 55% higher in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to the addition of Virgin America, as well as the additional contracted services to be incurred as the companies are integrated. Selling Expenses Selling expenses increased by $14 million , or 7% , compared to 2015 , mostly due to increased promotional and advertising activities, as well as new sponsorships which became effective in the current year. We expect selling expense to increase approximately 65% to 70% in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to the addition of Virgin America. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expenses increased by $43 million , or 13% , compared to 2015 . The increase is primarily due to the addition of 19 900ERs to our fleet since December 31, 2015 , partially offset by a change in the estimated useful lives of certain B737 operating aircraft and related parts from 20 years to 25 years, which was effective October 1, 2016. We expect depreciation and amortization expense to remain relatively flat in 2017 compared to 2016. The impact of Virgin America and newly delivered aircraft in 2017 is expected to be offset by a full year impact of the change in accounting estimate for useful lives mentioned previously. Food and Beverage Service Food and beverage service expenses increased by $13 million , or 12% , due to the increased number of passengers and upgrades to our onboard menu, offering higher quality food and beverage products. We expect food and beverage expenses to increase 40% to 45% in 2017 , primarily due to the acquisition of Virgin America. Third-party regional carrier expense Third-party regional carrier expense, which represents payments made to SkyWest and PenAir under our CPA agreements, increased $23 million , or 32% , in 2016 compared to 2015 . The increase is primarily due to the significant increase in regional capacity in 2016 through the introduction of E175 flying. We expect third-party regional carrier expense to increase in 2017 as we continue to expand our regional network. 42 Other Operating Expenses Other operating expenses increased $9 million , or 3% , compared to 2015 . The increase is primarily due to increases in property and other taxes, personnel costs for our flight crews and an increase in fines and penalties. We expect other operating expenses to increase approximately 50% to 55% in 2017 compared to 2016. The impact of Virgin America represents approximately half of the increase, while the other half is driven by IT and facilities-related projects. Special Items Merger-Related Costs and Other We recorded special items of $117 million for merger-related costs associated with our acquisition of Virgin America. These costs consisted primarily of legal expenses, investment banking fees and severance costs. We expect to continue to incur merger-related costs in 2017. Our 2015 special items of $32 million consisted of a non-cash pension settlement expense and costs related to ongoing litigation. Consolidated Nonoperating Income (Expense) During 2016 we recorded nonoperating expense of $4 million , compared to nonoperating income of $14 million in 2015 . In the current year, we incurred more interest expense associated with the financing obtained to fund the acquisition of Virgin America. This expense was partially offset by additional interest income earned during the period we held those funds in advance of the acquisition close date. Additional Segment Information Refer to Note 13 of the consolidated financial statements for a detailed description of each segment. Below is a summary of each segment's profitability. Mainline Pretax profit for Mainline was $1.3 billion in 2016 compared to $1.2 billion in 2015 . This segment includes financial results of Virgin America from the date of acquisition through December 31, 2016. The $135 million increase is due to an increase in operating revenues of $277 million , offset by an increase in operating expenses of $126 million . Revenue growth was primarily driven by the $159 million increase in passenger revenues and the $100 million increase in Mileage Plan revenue, both described previously. Growth in operating expenses was due to higher wages to support our network growth, higher ramp and passenger handling due to increased flying and higher wage rates at stations where we use vendors to assist us, higher depreciation related to our fleet growth, and higher selling expenses related to increased advertising. Economic fuel cost, as defined above, decreased due to lower raw fuel costs and increased fuel efficiency, slightly offset by an 8% increase in consumption. Regional Pretax profit for Regional was $93 million in 2016 compared to $105 million in 2015 . The $12 million decrease in pretax profit was driven by a $74 million increase in non-fuel operating expenses in the current year to support additional departures, partially offset by a $56 million increase in revenue and an $6 million decrease in fuel expense when compared to the prior year period. Horizon Pretax profit for Horizon was $14 million in 2016 compared to $28 million in 2015 . CPA Revenues (100% of which are from Alaska and are eliminated in consolidation) increased due to additional capacity added in the last 12 months. The $32 million increase in Horizon's non-fuel operating expenses was largely driven by higher medical costs due to an increased number of large medical claims, increased volume of engine overhaul and heavy airframe work, employee signing bonuses and overhead restructuring costs. 43 2015 COMPARED WITH 2014 Our consolidated net income for 2015 was $848 million , or $6.56 per diluted share, compared to net income of $605 million , or $4.42 per diluted share, in 2014 . Excluding the impact of mark-to-market fuel hedge adjustments and special items, our adjusted consolidated net income for 2015 was $842 million , or $6.51 per diluted share, compared to an adjusted consolidated net income of $571 million , or $4.18 per share, in 2014 . Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2015 2014 (in millions, except per-share amounts) Dollars Diluted EPS Dollars Diluted EPS Reported GAAP net income and diluted EPS $ 848 $ 6.56 $ 605 $ 4.42 Mark-to-market fuel hedge adjustments (23 ) (0.16 ) Special items 32 0.25 $ (30 ) $ (0.22 ) Income tax effect of special items (12 ) (0.10 ) 19 0.14 Special income tax benefit (a) (26 ) (0.20 ) Non-GAAP adjusted net income and diluted EPS $ 842 $ 6.51 $ 571 $ 4.18 (a) Special tax benefit represents the discrete impacts of adjustments to our position on income sourcing in various states.

The changes are summarized in the following table: Twelve Months Ended December 31, (in millions) 2015 2014 % Change Passenger Mainline $ 3,939 $ 3,774 4 Regional 854 805 6 Total passenger revenue $ 4,793 $ 4,579 5 Freight and mail 108 114 (5 ) Other net 697 675 3 Total operating revenues $ 5,598 $ 5,368 4 Passenger Revenue Mainline Mainline passenger revenue for 2015 increased by 4% on a 10.7% increase in capacity, partially offset by a 5.8% decrease in PRASM compared to 2014 . The increase in capacity was driven by new routes, larger aircraft added to our fleet and increased utilization of our aircraft. The decrease in PRASM was driven by a 4.4% decrease in ticket yield, combined with a 1.2-point decrease in load factor compared to the prior year. The decline in ticket yield was primarily due to increased competitive capacity in the markets we serve and our own growth. Yield was further impacted by a significant decline in fuel prices, which has a direct impact on ticket pricing. The decline in load factor was also a result of increased capacity. Passenger Revenue Regional Regional passenger revenue increased by $49 million , or 6% , compared to 2014 due to a 9.7% increase in capacity, partially offset by a 3.4% decrease in PRASM compared to 2014 . The increase in capacity was due to an increase in departures and average aircraft stage length. The decrease in PRASM was due to a 3.8% decrease in ticket yield, partially offset by an increase in load factor of 0.3 point s. The decline in yield was due to an increase in competitive capacity in our regional markets and our own growth as we strengthen our network utility in the Pacific Northwest. Other Net Other net revenue increased $22 million , or 3% , from 2014 , due to increases in Mileage Plan revenue and food and beverage sales, partially offset by lower bag fee revenues. Mileage Plan revenue increased $34 million or 12%, due to increased miles sold. Food and beverage sales were higher due to the 8.9% increase in passengers and selling more premium offerings, such as Tom Douglas signature meals. Bag fee revenue was lower due to promotions launched in 2015 to offer a free first checked bag to our Alaska Airlines Signature Visa credit card holders. This decline was partially offset by incremental revenue from our affinity card bank partner. OPERATING EXPENSES Total operating expenses decreased $106 million , or 2% , compared to 2014 , primarily as a result of lower fuel costs. Twelve Months Ended December 31, (in millions) 2015 2014 % Change Fuel expense $ 954 $ 1,418 (33 ) Non-fuel expenses 3,314 3,018 10 Special items 32 (30 ) NM Total Operating Expenses $ 4,300 $ 4,406 (2 ) Significant operating expense variances from 2014 are more fully described below. 45 Wages and Benefits Wages and benefits increased during 2015 by $118 million , or 10% , compared to 2014 . The primary components of wages and benefits are shown in the following table: Twelve Months Ended December 31, (in millions) 2015 2014 % Change Wages $ 945 $ 862 10 Medical and other benefits 153 150 2 Defined contribution plans 60 53 13 Pension defined benefit plans 28 9 211 Payroll taxes 68 62 10 Total wages and benefits $ 1,254 $ 1,136 10 Wages increased 10% , primarily due to an 8.8% increase in FTEs and the annualization of new labor contracts that included higher rates. The increase in FTEs was to support the growth in our business. Defined contribution plan expense increased 13% due to increased contributions throughout all labor groups and an increased matched percentage as a part of recent labor contracts. Pension expense increased $19 million, compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase is due to higher amortization of actuarial losses from previous years due primarily to a lower discount rate used to value the pension obligation at December 31, 2014. Variable Incentive Pay Variable incentive pay expense increased to $120 million in 2015 from $116 million in 2014. The increase is due to actual results exceeding our targets for financial performance more so than in the prior year, coupled with a higher wage base. Aircraft Fuel Aircraft fuel expense decreased $464 million , or 33% compared to 2014 . The elements of the change are summarized in the following table: Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2015 2014 (in millions, except for per gallon amounts) Dollars Cost/Gal Dollars Cost/Gal Raw or "into-plane" fuel cost $ 935 $ 1.84 $ 1,400 $ 2.99 Losses on settled hedges 19 0.04 41 0.09 Consolidated economic fuel expense $ 954 $ 1.88 $ 1,441 $ 3.08 Mark-to-mark fuel hedge adjustments (23 ) (0.05 ) GAAP fuel expense $ 954 $ 1.88 $ 1,418 $ 3.03 Fuel gallons 508 469 Fuel gallons consumed increased 8.3% in line with the 10.6% increase capacity, partially offset by a 2.2% improvement in fuel efficiency as measured by ASMs per gallon. The raw fuel price per gallon decreased 38.5% as a result of lower West Coast jet fuel prices. West Coast jet fuel prices are impacted by both the price of crude oil, as well as refining margins associated with the conversion of crude oil to jet fuel. The decrease in raw fuel price per gallon during 2015 was due to a decline in crude oil prices of 48% and a decrease in refining margins of 11%, when compared to the prior year. Losses recognized for hedges that settled during the year were $19 million in 2015 , compared to losses of $41 million in 2014 . These amounts represent cash paid for premium expense, offset by any cash received from those hedges at settlement. The 46 decrease in losses on settled hedges was primarily due to our increased use of "out of the money" call options as well as purchasing shorter-dated options, both of which reduce the premium cost we pay. Aircraft Maintenance Aircraft maintenance increased by $24 million , or 10% , compared to the prior year. Maintenance costs increased due to more scheduled engine maintenance events that were more expensive due to replacing life-limited parts and heavier airframe checks. Landing Fees and Other Rentals Landing fees and other rentals increased $17 million , or 6% , primarily due to increased flying in 2015 as we increased capacity and entered into new markets. Selling Expenses Selling expenses increased by $12 million , or 6% , compared to 2014, mostly due to increased promotional and advertising activities in Seattle and increased credit card commissions from higher revenue. Contracted Services Contracted services increased $18 million , or 9% , when compared to 2014. The increase is primarily due to increased flying at stations where we use vendors to assist us with passenger and ramp handling. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expenses increased by $26 million , or 9% , due to the increased number of aircraft in our fleet and cabin upgrades throughout 2014 and 2015. Food and Beverage Service Food and beverage service expenses increased by $20 million , or 22% , due to the increased number of passengers and upgrades to our onboard menu, offering higher quality food and beverage products. Third-party regional carrier expense Third-party regional carrier expense, which represents payments made to SkyWest and PenAir under our CPAs, increased $14 million , or 24% , in 2015 compared to 2014. The increase is primarily due to the five E175 aircraft operated by SkyWest added to our regional operation in 2015. Other Operating Expenses Other operating expenses increased $48 million , or 16% , compared to 2014 . The increase is primarily due to professional services with regard to our brand refresh and network strategy, personnel costs for our flight crews and IT-related costs. Special Items During 2015 we recorded special items of $32 million . This is due to a $14 million non-cash pension settlement expense recorded as a result of lump-sum payments made to terminated, vested participants which removed them from participation in the pension plan therefore reducing our outstanding liability, and an $18 million expense related to ongoing litigation. Consolidated Nonoperating Income (Expense) During 2015 , we recorded nonoperating income of $14 million , compared to an expense of $13 million in 2014 . In 2015, we capitalized more of our interest expense on an increasing balance of prepaid aircraft deposits. Additional Segment Information Refer to Note 13 of the consolidated financial statements for a detailed description of each segment. Below is a summary of each segments' profitability. 47 Mainline Pretax profit for Alaska Mainline was $1.2 billion in 2015 compared to $834 million in 2014 . The $372 million increase is due to increased revenues of $188 million and decreased operating expenses of $192 million , slightly offset by a decrease in non-operating income of $8 million . Revenue growth was largely driven by the $165 million increase in Mainline passenger revenue described previously. Growth in operating expenses was due to higher wages to support our growth, higher ramp and passenger handling associated with increased flying, higher depreciation related to our fleet growth, and increased food and beverage costs. Economic fuel cost, as defined above, decreased due to lower raw fuel costs and increased fuel efficiency, slightly offset by an increase in consumption. Regional Pretax profit for Alaska Regional was $105 million in 2015 compared to $74 million in 2014 . The $31 million increase is due to increased revenues of $43 million , offset by increased operating expense of $13 million . Revenue growth was driven by increased passenger revenue. Operating expenses were higher in 2015 to support additional departures. Horizon Pretax profit for Horizon was $28 million in 2015 compared to $17 million in 2014 . The $11 million increase is due to increased CPA Revenues (100% of which are from Alaska and eliminated in consolidation) of $36 million , offset by increased non-fuel operating expenses of $26 million . The increase in Horizon's non-fuel operating expenses was largely driven by increased engine maintenance and other expenses to support the increase in capacity. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Our primary sources of liquidity are: Our existing cash and marketable securities balance of $1.6 billion and our expected cash from operations; Our 52 unencumbered aircraft in the operating fleet as of December 31, 2016 , that could be financed, if necessary; and Our combined $200 million bank line-of-credit facilities, with none currently outstanding. On December 14, 2016 we completed the acquisition of Virgin America, paying $2.6 billion to stockholders and other equity holders of Virgin America. We funded the acquisition with cash on hand and approximately $2.0 billion of secured debt financing provided by multiple lenders. Approximately $1.6 billion of the loans obtained to fund the acquisition are secured by a total of 56 of Air Group's aircraft, including 37 B737-900ER aircraft and 19 B737-800 aircraft. The remainder is secured by Air Group's interest in certain aircraft purchase agreements. As a result, we have fewer unencumbered aircraft in our operating fleet than in prior periods, which could affect our ability to obtain future financing. In 2016 , we took delivery of 19 B737-900ER aircraft and made debt payments totaling $249 million . We also continued to return capital to our shareholders by paying dividends totaling $136 million and repurchasing $193 million of our common stock. Because of our strong balance sheet and financial performance, we are one of only three airlines in the U.S. with investment grade credit ratings. We believe that our current cash and marketable securities balance combined with future cash flows from operations and other sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund our operations and meet our debt payment obligations for the foreseeable future. In our cash and marketable securities portfolio, we invest only in securities that meet our primary investment strategy of maintaining and securing investment principal. The portfolio is managed by reputable firms that adhere to our investment policy that sets forth investment objectives, approved and prohibited investments, and duration and credit quality guidelines. Our policy and the portfolio managers are continually reviewed to ensure that the investments are aligned with our strategy. The table below presents the major indicators of financial condition and liquidity: 48 (in millions, except per share and debt-to-capital amounts) December 31, 2016 December 31, 2015 Change Cash and marketable securities $1,580 $1,328 $252 Cash, marketable securities and unused lines of credit as a percentage of trailing twelve months revenue 31% 28% 3 pts Long-term debt, net of current portion 2,645 569 2,076 Shareholders equity 2,931 2,411 520 Long-term debt-to-capital ratio (a) 59% 27% 32 pts (a) Calculated using the present value of remaining aircraft lease payments for aircraft that are in our operating fleet as of the balance sheet date. The following discussion summarizes the primary drivers of the increase in our cash and marketable securities balance and our expectation of future cash requirements. ANALYSIS OF OUR CASH FLOWS Cash Provided by Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.4 billion in 2016 compared to $1.6 billion in 2015 . The decrease of $198 million is due to a decline in operating results primarily driven by an increase in non-fuel operating expenses including $ 117 million in merger-related costs associated with the acquisition of Virgin America partially offset by higher revenues and lower fuel costs. In 2015, we generated $1.6 billion in operating cash flows compared to $1.0 billion in 2014. The increase of $554 million was primarily attributable to improved operating results, driven largely by lower jet fuel costs. We typically generate positive cash flows from operations, and expect to use that cash flow to buy aircraft and capital equipment, to make debt payments, and to return capital to shareholders. During 2016, we paused our share repurchase program as we prepared for the acquisition of Virgin America. Cash Used in Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities was $2.6 billion during 2016 , compared to $930 million in 2015 . We used $2.0 billion to acquire Virgin America, representing $2.6 billion consideration paid, offset by $ 645 million of cash acquired. Our capital expenditures were $678 million , or $153 million lower than in 2015 as a result of fewer aircraft purchase deposits made during 2016 as compared to 2015. During 2016 we took delivery of 19 B737-900ERs, and made advance purchase deposits on B737 and E175 aircraft that will be delivered over the next 24 months. This compares to the delivery of 11 B737-900ERs and one Q400 in the prior year. As of December 31, 2016 , we had firm commitments for 54 B737 aircraft through 2023 with options to acquire up to 41 additional B737 NextGen aircraft and MAX aircraft in 2019 through 2024 . We have lease commitments for 10 A321neo aircraft with deliveries in 2017 through 2018 and an order for 30 A320neos with deliveries starting in 2020 through 2022. This order is cancelable with the forfeiture of $15 million of predelivery payments. We have firm commitments to purchase or lease 38 E175 aircraft with deliveries from 2017 through 2019 and options to acquire 30 E175 aircraft with deliveries from 2019 to 2021 and lease an additional 8 with deliveries in 2019. The options for all fleet types give us the flexibility, but not the obligation, to grow the fleet assuming profitability and return on invested capital targets can be met. The table below reflects total expected capital expenditures and the additional expenditures if options were exercised as of February 28, 2017. Additional options will be exercised only if we believe return on invested capital targets can be met: 49 (in millions) 2016 Actuals 2017 2018 2019 2020 Aircraft and aircraft purchase deposits - firm (a) $ 528 $ 805 $ 685 $ 595 $ 290 Other flight equipment 53 145 135 95 55 Other property and equipment 97 215 205 90 75 Total property and equipment additions $ 678 $ 1,165 $ 1,025 $ 780 $ 420 Option aircraft and aircraft deposits, if exercised $ $ 60 $ 235 $ 705 $ 1,415 (a) Excludes orders with cancellation options. Cash used in investing activities was $930 million during 2015, compared to $541 million in 2014. Our capital expenditures were $831 million in 2015, $137 million higher than in 2014. Cash Provided by Financing Activities Cash provided by financing activities was $1.5 billion during 2016 , compared to cash used of $688 million in 2015 . During the year, we secured debt proceeds of $2 billion for the acquisition of Virgin America, made debt payments of $249 million , repurchased $193 million of our common stock and paid cash dividends of $136 million . In 2015 , we made debt payments of $116 million , stock repurchases of $505 million and cash dividend payments of $102 million . In 2014, we made debt payments of $119 million and stock repurchases of $348 million , partially offset by proceeds from debt of $51 million We plan to meet our future capital and operating commitments through our cash and investments on hand, internally generated cash from operations, along with additional debt financing if necessary. Bank Lines of Credit We have two $100 million credit facilities and a $52 million credit facility. We have secured letters of credit against the $52 million facility but have no plans to borrow using either of two remaining facilities. Information about these facilities can be found in Note 6 to consolidated financial statements. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS Aircraft Purchase Commitments As of December 31, 2016 , we had firm orders to purchase or lease 102 aircraft. We also have an order for 30 Airbus A320neo with deliveries from 2020 through 2022 with an option to cancel up to three years in advance of delivery in groups of five aircraft. We could incur a loss of pre-delivery payments and credits as a cancellation fee. We also have options to acquire 41 B737 aircraft with deliveries from 2019 through 2024 and 30 E175 aircraft with deliveries from 2019 through 2021. In addition to the 15 E175 aircraft currently operated by SkyWest in our regional fleet, we have options in future periods to add regional capacity by having SkyWest operate up to 8 more E175 aircraft. The following table summarizes our projected fleet count by year, as of February 28, 2017 : Actual Fleet Count Expected Fleet Activity (a) Aircraft Dec 31, 2015 Dec 31, 2016 2017 Changes Dec 31, 2017 2018 - 2019 Changes Dec 31, 2019 B737 Freighters & Combis (b) 6 6 (3 ) 3 3 B737 Passenger Aircraft (b) 141 149 2 151 15 166 Airbus Passenger Aircraft 63 5 68 4 72 Total Mainline Fleet 147 218 4 222 19 241 Q400 (c) 52 52 52 (15 ) 37 E175 (c) 5 15 18 33 20 53 CRJ700 (c) 8 Total Regional Fleet 65 67 18 85 5 90 Total 212 285 22 307 24 331 (a) The expected fleet counts at December 31, 2017 , 2018 and 2019 are subject to change. 50 (b) 2017 changes in passenger aircraft reflect delivery of 14 Boeing 737-900ER aircraft, retirement of 10 B737-400 aircraft and the conversion of two B737-700 aircraft into freighters. The freighter and combi changes reflect retirement of five combis and one freighter and the reintroduction of three B737-700 aircraft as freighters. (c) Aircraft are either owned or leased by Horizon or operated under capacity purchase agreement with a third party. For future firm orders and option exercises, we may finance the aircraft through internally generated cash, long-term debt, or lease arrangements. Future Fuel Hedge Positions All of our future oil positions are call options, which are designed to effectively cap the cost of the crude oil component of our jet fuel purchases. With call options, we are hedged against volatile crude oil price increases; and, during a period of decline in crude oil prices, we only forfeit cash previously paid for hedge premiums. Our crude oil positions are as follows: Approximate % of Expected Fuel Requirements Weighted-Average Crude Oil Price per Barrel Average Premium Cost per Barrel First Quarter 2017 50% $60 $2 Second Quarter 2017 50% $62 $2 Third Quarter 2017 40% $63 $2 Fourth Quarter 2017 30% $65 $3 Full Year 2017 42% $62 $2 First Quarter 2018 20% $65 $3 Second Quarter 2018 10% $67 $2 Full Year 2018 7% $65 $2 Contractual Obligations The following table provides a summary of our principal payments under current and long-term debt obligations, operating lease commitments, aircraft purchase commitments and other obligations as of December 31, 2016 .

Refer to Note 9 in the consolidated financial statements for further information. Defined Benefit Pensions The table above excludes contributions to our various pension plans, for which there are no minimum required contributions given the funded status of the plans. The unfunded liability for our qualified defined-benefit pension plans was $197 million at December 31, 2016 , compared to a $161 million unfunded position at December 31, 2015 . This results in a 90% funded status on a projected benefit obligation basis compared to 92% funded as of December 31, 2015 . 51 Credit Card Agreements We have agreements with a number of credit card companies to process the sale of tickets and other services. Under these agreements, there are material adverse change clauses that, if triggered, could result in the credit card companies holding back a reserve from our credit card receivables. Under one such agreement, we could be required to maintain a reserve if our credit rating is downgraded to or below a rating specified by the agreement or our cash and marketable securities balance fell below $500 million. Under another such agreement, we could be required to maintain a reserve if our cash and marketable securities balance fell below $500 million. We are not currently required to maintain any reserve under these agreements. Deferred Income Taxes For federal income tax purposes, the majority of our assets, as measured by value, are fully depreciated over a seven-year life using an accelerated depreciation method or bonus depreciation if available. For financial reporting purposes, the majority of our assets are depreciated over 15 to 25 years to an estimated salvage value using the straight-line basis. This difference has created a significant deferred tax liability. At some point in the future the depreciation basis will reverse, potentially resulting in an increase in income taxes paid. While it is possible that we could have material cash obligations for this deferred liability at some point in the future, we cannot estimate the timing of long-term cash flows with reasonable accuracy. Taxable income and cash taxes payable in the short term are impacted by many items, including the amount of book income generated, which can be volatile depending on revenue and fuel prices, usage of net operating losses, whether "bonus depreciation" provisions are available, as well as other legislative changes that are beyond our control. In 2016 , we made tax payments, net of refunds, totaling $459 million , and had an effective tax rate of 39.5% . We expect our effective tax rate to be in the range of 37% to 38% for 2017 and the effective rate of cash paid for income taxes to be in the range of 20% to 25% of book income, although these estimates are subject to change. We believe that we will have the liquidity available to make our future tax payments. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The discussion and analysis of our financial position and results of operations in this MD&A are based upon our consolidated financial statements. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our financial position and results of operations. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of our significant accounting policies. Critical accounting estimates are defined as those that reflect significant management judgment and uncertainties and that potentially may lead to materially different results under varying assumptions and conditions. Management has identified the following critical accounting estimates and has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of these policies with our audit committee. FREQUENT FLYER PROGRAMS Alaska's Mileage Plan loyalty program awards miles to members who fly on our airlines and our airline partners. We also sell services, including miles for transportation, to non-airline partners, such as hotels, car rental agencies and a major bank that offers Alaska affinity credit cards. In either case, the outstanding miles may be redeemed for travel on our airlines or any of our airline partners. As long as the Mileage Plan is in existence, we have an obligation to provide this future travel. Virgin America's Elevate program allows guests to earn points for purchasing travel that are redeemable for travel awards throughout our network and the networks of Virgin America's airline partners. A liability for all points outstanding as of December 14, 2016 was recorded at the estimated fair value as part of our acquisition of Virgin America. The fair value was estimated using the estimated ticket value of points expected to be redeemed as of the date of the acquisition. See "Business Combination Accounting, Goodwill and Intangibles" discussion below for estimates used for purchase accounting. For miles earned by guests who fly on us or our airline partners, we recognize a liability and a corresponding selling expense representing the incremental cost associated with the obligation to provide travel in the future. For services sold through one of our non-airline partners, the sales proceeds that represent award transportation and certificates for discounted companion travel are deferred and recognized when the transportation is delivered, and the remaining components are recorded as commission in other net revenue in the period the services are performed. Commission revenue recognized for the years ended December 31, 52 2016 , 2015 and 2014 was $329 million , $280 million and $261 million , respectively. The deferred revenue is recognized as passenger revenue when the award travel occurs, or the miles expire, and as other net revenue for awards issued and flown on partner airlines. At December 31, 2016 , we had approximately 186.5 billion miles and points outstanding, resulting in an aggregate liability and deferred revenue balance of $1.1 billion . Both the liability and the deferred revenue are determined based on several assumptions that require significant management judgment to estimate and formulate. There are uncertainties inherent in these estimates. Therefore, different assumptions could affect the amount and/or timing of revenue recognition or expenses. The most significant assumptions in accounting for the Mileage Plan are described below. 1. The rate at which we defer sales proceeds related to services sold through non-airline partners: We use the relative selling price method for the deferral of sales proceeds. For contracts that were modified after the effective date of Accounting Standards Update 2009-13, "Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force" ("ASU 2009-13"), we determined our best estimate of selling price by considering multiple inputs and methods including, but not limited to, the estimated selling price of comparable travel, discounted cash flows, brand value, published selling prices, number of miles awarded and the number of miles redeemed. We estimated the selling prices and volumes over the terms of the agreements in order to determine the allocation of proceeds to each of the multiple deliverables. This relative allocation is evaluated annually and updated according to changes in the assumptions of the volume of related deliverables. A 1% shift between the allocation of cash proceeds to travel deliverables from marketing deliverables would defer the timing of revenue recognition by approximately $8 million . 2. The number of miles that will not be redeemed for travel (breakage): The liability for outstanding Mileage Plan mileage credits includes all mileage credits that are expected to be redeemed, including mileage credits earned by members whose mileage account balances have not yet reached the minimum mileage credit level to redeem an award. Our estimate of the number of miles that will not be redeemed (breakage) considers historical activity in our members accounts and other factors. Based on statistical analysis of historical data, our current breakage rate is 17.4%. A hypothetical 1% change in our estimate of breakage has approximately an $8 million effect on the liability. 3. The number of miles used per award: We estimate how many miles will be used per award. For example, our members may redeem credit for award travel to various locations or choose between a highly restricted award and an unrestricted award. Our estimates are based on the current requirements in our Mileage Plan program and historical award redemption patterns. 4. The number of awards redeemed for travel on our airlines versus other airlines: The cost for us to carry an award passenger is typically lower than the cost we will pay to our travel partners. We estimate the number of awards that will be redeemed on our airlines versus on our travel partners and accrue the estimated costs based on historical redemption patterns. If the number of awards redeemed on our travel partner is higher or lower than estimated, we may need to adjust our liability and corresponding expense. 5. The costs that will be incurred to provide award travel for miles earned by guests who fly on us or our airline partners: When a frequent flyer travels on his or her award ticket on one of our airlines, incremental costs such as food, fuel and insurance are incurred to carry that passenger. We estimate what these costs will be (excluding any contribution to overhead and profit) and accrue a liability. If the guest travels on another airline on an award ticket, we often must pay the other airline for carrying the guest. The other airline costs are based on negotiated agreements and are often substantially higher than the costs we would incur to carry that guest. We estimate how much we will pay to other airlines for future travel awards based on historical redemptions and settlements with other carriers and accrue a liability accordingly. The costs actually incurred by us or paid to other airlines may be higher or lower than the costs that were estimated and accrued, and therefore we may need to adjust our liability and recognize a corresponding expense. We regularly review significant Mileage Plan assumptions and change our assumptions if facts and circumstances indicate that a change is necessary. Any such change in assumptions could have a significant effect on our financial position and results of operations. 53 PENSION PLANS Our actuarial estimates of pension liability, the related expense and the associated significant assumptions are discussed in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. The calculation of pension expense and the corresponding liability requires the use of a number of key assumptions, including the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the assumed discount rates to be used in the calculation of the projected benefit obligation and the interest and service cost. Changes in these assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts, and future actual experience can differ from these assumptions. Pension liability and future pension expense decrease as the discount rate used for the obligation increases. We discounted future pension obligations using rates between 4.29% and 4.50% at December 31, 2016 and between 4.55% and 4.69% at December 31, 2015 . The discount rates were determined using current rates earned on high-quality, long-term bonds with maturities that correspond with the estimated cash distributions from each of the four defined-benefit pension plans. The discount rates we use are based on a yield curve that uses a pool of higher-yielding bonds estimated to be more in line with settlement rates, as we have taken steps to ultimately terminate or settle plans that are frozen and move toward freezing benefits in active plans in the future. If the discount rate decreased by 0.5% , our projected benefit obligation at December 31, 2016 would increase by approximately $132 million and our estimated 2017 pension expense would increase by approximately $8 million . Pension liability and future pension expense can increase or decrease as assumptions in the actuarial data changes. For example, in 2015 we engaged our third-party actuary to update demographic assumptions used in the valuation of the defined-benefit pension liabilities. These assumptions included updates such as estimated salary increases, employee turnover and retirement rates, among other items. The changes in these assumptions decreased our projected benefit obligation by approximately $50 million at December 31, 2015. The primary cause of the decline was the change in expected participant retirement rates. The study found that eligible employees are retiring later than they had in our previous assumption update, resulting in lower expected cash flows post retirement. Pension expense normally increases as the expected rate of return on pension plan assets decreases. As of December 31, 2016 , we estimate that the pension plan assets will generate long-term rates of return between 5.50% and 6.00% , which compares to 6.0% and 6.50% at December 31, 2015 . We regularly review the actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance investments as appropriate. This expected long-term rate of return on plan assets at December 31, 2016 is based on an allocation of U.S. and non-U.S. equities, U.S. fixed-income securities, and real estate. A decrease in the expected long-term rate of return of 0.5% would increase our estimated 2017 pension expense by approximately $9 million . All of our defined-benefit pension plans are now closed to new entrants. Additionally, benefits in our non-union defined-benefit plans were frozen January 1, 2014. Future changes in plan asset returns, assumed discount rates and various other factors related to the participants in our pension plans will impact our future pension expense and liabilities. We cannot predict what these factors will be in the future. LONG-LIVED ASSETS As of December 31, 2016 , we had approximately $5.7 billion of property and equipment and related assets, net of accumulated depreciation. In accounting for these long-lived assets, we make estimates about the expected useful lives of the assets, changes in fleet plans, the expected residual values of the assets and the potential for impairment based on the fair value of the assets and the cash flows they generate. Effective October 1, 2016, we changed our estimate of useful lives for certain B737 aircraft from 20 years to 25 years to better align with their operational performance, maintenance experience and industry practice. Factors indicating potential impairment include, but are not limited to, significant decreases in the market value of the long-lived assets, management decisions regarding the future use of the assets, a significant change in the long-lived assets condition, and operating cash flow losses associated with the use of the long-lived asset. There is inherent risk in estimating the fair value of our aircraft and related parts and their salvage values at the time of impairment. Actual proceeds upon disposition of the aircraft or related parts could be materially less than expected, resulting in additional loss. Our estimate of salvage value at the time of disposal could also change, requiring us to increase the depreciation expense on the affected aircraft. 54 BUSINESS COMBINATION ACCOUNTING, GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLES To record the value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as a result of our acquisition of Virgin America on December 14, 2016, we have performed a purchase price allocation utilizing the best information available to management. The purchase price allocation is provisional and is subject to further adjustments as additional information becomes available concerning the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with any adjustments to the purchase price allocation to be made as soon as practicable but no later than December 14, 2017. The fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were determined using market, income or cost methods. Our consolidated balance sheet reflects goodwill in the amount of $ 1.9 billion at December 31, 2016 , representing the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of Virgin America tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities. Identifiable intangible assets recorded totaled approximately $ 143 million at December 31, 2016 and consisted of customer relationships, airport slots and gates. With the exception of airport slots, all of the identified intangible assets are finite-lived and are being amortized over their estimated economic useful lives. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized, but will be tested for impairment at least annually (in the fourth quarter), or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist. Our impairment analysis may include a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit or intangible asset group is impaired. If we do not perform a qualitative assessment, or if we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit or intangible asset group exceeds its carrying amount, we will calculate the estimated fair value of the reporting unit or intangible asset group and an impairment charge would be recorded to reduce the carrying value to the estimated fair value. Qualitative factors that might indicate a need to perform an impairment analysis outside of the regular annual assessment could include, but are not limited to: 1) reduced passenger demand as a result of domestic or global economic conditions; 2) significantly ongoing higher prices for jet fuel; 3) significant ongoing lower fares or passenger yields as a result of increased competition or lower demand; 4) a significant increase in future capital expenditure commitments; and 5) significant disruptions to our operations as a result of both internal and external events such as terrorist activities, actual or threatened war, labor actions by employees, or further industry regulation. Our business combination accounting, as well as future impairment analyses, require management to make assumptions and apply judgment. Key assumptions include, but are not limited to, estimating future cash flows, selecting discount rates and selecting valuation methodologies. These estimates and assumptions are highly subjective and our ability to realize the future cash flows used in our fair value calculations may be affected by changes in economic condition, our economic performance or business strategies.
