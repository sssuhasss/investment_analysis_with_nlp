ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion analyzes the financial condition and results of operations of both MAA and the Operating Partnership, of which MAA is the sole general partner and in which MAA owned a 96.4% limited partner interest as of December 31, 2016 . MAA conducts all of its business through the Operating Partnership and the Operating Partnership various subsidiaries. This discussion should be read in conjunction with all of the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES A critical accounting policy is one that is both important to our financial condition and results of operations and that involves some degree of uncertainty. The following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto, which have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and circumstances. We believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances; however, actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions. We believe that the estimates and assumptions listed below are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations because they require the greatest subjective determinations and form the basis of accounting policies deemed to be most critical. Acquisition of real estate assets We account for our acquisitions of investments in real estate in accordance with ASC 805-10, Business Combinations , which requires the fair value of the real estate acquired to be allocated to the acquired tangible assets, consisting of land, building and furniture, fixtures and equipment, and identified intangible assets, consisting of the value of in-place leases and other contracts. In calculating the fair value of acquired tangible assets, management uses stabilized net operating income (NOI) and market specific capitalization and discount rates. Management analyzed historical stabilized NOI to determine its estimate for forecasted NOI. Management estimates the market capitalization rate by analyzing the market capitalization rates for properties with comparable ages in similar sized markets. Although management's estimates of the fair value of acquired tangible assets have been materially accurate in the past, additional information becoming available could lead to the modification of the initial fair value calculation and purchase price allocation. Subsequent adjustments made to the purchase price allocation, if any, would be made within the allocation period, which typically does not exceed one year. Impairment of long-lived assets, including goodwill We account for long-lived assets in accordance with the provisions of accounting standards for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets and evaluate our goodwill for impairment under accounting standards for goodwill and other intangible assets. We evaluate goodwill for impairment on at least an annual basis, or more frequently if a goodwill impairment indicator is identified. We periodically evaluate long-lived assets, including investments in real estate and goodwill, for indicators that would suggest that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. The judgments regarding the existence of such indicators are based on factors such as operating performance, market conditions and legal factors. If impairment indicators exist for a long-lived asset, management compares the carrying amount of the asset to an estimate of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. Management estimates future cash flows by analyzing historical cash flows generated by the asset. If impairment indicators exist for goodwill, management compares the carrying amount of the asset to an estimate of the implied fair value of the asset. Management calculates the fair value of the asset by dividing historical operating cash flows by a market capitalization rate. Management estimates the market capitalization rate by analyzing the market capitalization rates for properties with comparable ages in similarly sized markets. No impairment losses have been recognized during the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 , and 2014 . Cost capitalization Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred while significant improvements, renovations, and replacements are capitalized. The cost to complete any deferred repairs and maintenance at properties acquired by us in order to elevate the condition of the property to our standards are capitalized as incurred. The carrying costs related to development 44 projects, including interest, property taxes, insurance and allocated direct development salary cost during the construction period, are capitalized. Management uses judgment in determining whether costs should be expensed or capitalized. Loss contingencies The outcomes of claims, disputes and legal proceedings are subject to significant uncertainty. We record an accrual for loss contingencies when a loss is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. We review these accruals quarterly and make revisions based on changes in facts and circumstances. When a loss contingency is not both probable and reasonably estimable, then we do not accrue the loss. However, for material loss contingencies, if the unrecorded loss (or an additional loss in excess of the accrual) is at least a reasonable possibility and material, then we disclose a reasonable estimate of the possible loss, or range of loss, if such reasonable estimate can be made. If we cannot make a reasonable estimate of the possible loss, or range of loss, then that is disclosed. The assessment of whether a loss is probable or a reasonable possibility, and whether the loss or range of loss is reasonably estimable, often involves a series of complex judgments about future events. Among the factors that we consider in this assessment, including with respect to the matters disclosed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, are the nature of existing legal proceedings and claims, the asserted or possible damages or loss contingency (if reasonably estimable), the progress of the matter, existing law and precedent, the opinions or views of legal counsel and other advisers, our experience in similar matters, the facts available to us at the time of assessment, and how we intend to respond, or have responded, to the proceeding or claim. Our assessment of these factors may change over time as individual proceedings or claims progress. For matters where we are not currently able to reasonably estimate a range of reasonably possible loss, the factors that have contributed to this determination include the following: (i) the damages sought are indeterminate; (ii) the proceedings are in the early stages; (iii) the matters involve novel or unsettled legal theories or a large or uncertain number of actual or potential cases or parties; and/or (iv) discussions with the parties in matters that are expected ultimately to be resolved through negotiation and settlement have not reached the point where we believe a reasonable estimate of loss, or range of loss, can be made. In such instances, we believe that there is considerable uncertainty regarding the timing or ultimate resolution of such matters, including a possible eventual loss or business impact, if any. For more information regarding our significant accounting policies, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 1. OVERVIEW OF THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016 As noted earlier, on December 1, 2016, we consummated the Merger and acquired all of Post Properties' net assets. As a result of the Merger, the results of operations for 2016 include 12 months of results for MAA and one month of results for Post Properties. Our December 31, 2016 balance sheet includes the combined assets and liabilities of MAA and Post Properties. All properties acquired from Post Properties have been placed in our "non-same store and other" operating segment, as the properties are recent acquisitions and have not been owned and stabilized for at least 12 months. We experienced a decrease in income from continuing operations in 2016 despite increases in revenues outpacing increases in property operating expenses due to lower gain on sale of depreciable real estate assets and increased merger and integration costs. The increases in revenues came from a 4.9% increase in our large market same store segment, a 3.1% increase in our secondary market same store segment and a 41.7% increase in our non-same store and other segment, which was primarily a result of the Merger. The increase in property operating expenses came from a 3.2% increase in our large market same store segment, a 2.0% increase in our secondary market same store segment and a 30.7% increase in our non-same store and other segment, which was primarily the result of the Merger. Our same store portfolio represents those communities that have been held and have been stabilized for at least 12 months. Communities excluded from the same store portfolio include recent acquisitions, communities being developed or in lease-up, communities undergoing extensive renovations, and communities identified for disposition. Additional information regarding the composition of operating segments is included in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, Note 16 - Segment Information. The drivers of these increases are discussed below in the results of operations section. We have grown externally during the past three years by following our acquisition strategy to invest in large and mid-sized growing markets in the Southeast and Southwest region of the United States. Apart from the Merger, we acquired four apartment communities for our portfolio in 2014 , seven in 2015 and five in 2016 . Offsetting some of this increased revenue stream were four apartment community dispositions in 2014 , twenty-one in 2015 , and twelve in 2016 . 45 The following table shows our apartment real estate assets as of December 31, 2016 , 2015 , and 2014 : 2016 2015 2014 Properties 303 254 268 Units (1) 99,393 79,496 82,316 Development Units 2,816 748 514 Average Effective Monthly Rent/Unit, excluding lease-up and development $ 1,154 $ 1,006 $ 948 Average Physical Occupancy 95.9 % 95.6 % 94.1 % (1) includes units owned by nonconsolidated joint venture Average effective monthly rent per unit is calculated as the average of monthly gross rent amounts for occupied units, after the effect of leasing concessions, plus then-prevailing market rates asked for unoccupied units, divided by the total number of units. Leasing concessions represent discounts to the current market rate. We believe average effective monthly rent is a helpful measurement in evaluating average pricing; however, it does not represent actual rental revenue collected per unit. For additional discussion of same store average rent per unit and occupancy comparisons, see the Trends section below. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS As a result of the Merger, the results of operations for 2016 include twelve months of results for MAA and one month of results for Post Properties. Our December 31, 2016 balance sheet includes the combined assets and liabilities of MAA and Post Properties. Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2016 to the Year Ended December 31, 2015 Property Revenues The following table shows our property revenues by segment for the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 (dollars in thousands): Year ended December 31, 2016 Year ended December 31, 2015 Increase Percentage Increase Large Market Same Store $ 642,679 $ 612,934 $ 29,745 4.9 % Secondary Market Same Store 337,883 327,700 10,183 3.1 % Same Store Portfolio 980,562 940,634 39,928 4.2 % Non-Same Store and Other 144,786 102,145 42,641 41.7 % Total $ 1,125,348 $ 1,042,779 $ 82,569 7.9 % The increase in property revenues from our same store portfolio is primarily a result of increased effective rental revenue per occupied unit of 4.9% and 2.9% for our large and secondary markets, respectively. The increase in property revenues from our non-same store and other portfolio is primarily the result of the Merger, which we classified as non-same store. See discussion of our segment classification methodology at Note 16 (Segment Information). 46 Property Operating Expenses Property operating expenses include costs for property personnel, building repairs and maintenance, real estate taxes and insurance, utilities, landscaping, and depreciation and amortization. The following table shows our property operating expenses by segment excluding depreciation and amortization for the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 (dollars in thousands): Year ended December 31, 2016 Year ended December 31, 2015 Increase Percentage Increase Large Market Same Store $ 243,392 $ 235,909 $ 7,483 3.2 % Secondary Market Same Store 125,830 123,318 2,512 2.0 % Same Store Portfolio 369,222 359,227 9,995 2.8 % Non-Same Store and Other 54,134 41,418 12,716 30.7 % Total $ 423,356 $ 400,645 $ 22,711 5.7 % The increase in property operating expenses from our large market same store group is primarily the result of increases in real estate taxes of $5.3 million, personnel expenses of $1.5 million, and utilities expenses of $1.2 million. The increase in our large market same store operating expenses was slightly offset by a decrease in insurance expense of $0.5 million. The increase in property operating expenses from our secondary market same store group is primarily a result of increases in real estate taxes of $1.3 million, personnel expenses of $0.6 million, and utilities expenses of $0.5 million. The increase in property operating expenses from our non-same store and other portfolio is primarily the result of the Merger, which we classified as non-same store. See discussion of our segment classification methodology at Note 16 (Segment Information). Depreciation and Amortization The following table shows our depreciation and amortization expense by segment for the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 (dollars in thousands): Year ended December 31, 2016 Year ended December 31, 2015 Increase Percentage Increase Large Market Same Store $ 183,131 $ 176,253 $ 6,878 3.9 % Secondary Market Same Store 89,031 85,799 3,232 3.8 % Same Store Portfolio 272,162 262,052 10,110 3.9 % Non-Same Store and Other 50,796 32,468 18,328 56.4 % Total $ 322,958 $ 294,520 $ 28,438 9.7 % The increase in depreciation and amortization expense of $28.4 million is primarily driven by depreciation expense of $17.4 million related to the Merger. Additionally, the amortization of fair market value of in-place leases began in December of 2016 totaling $4.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 . Merger and Integration Costs Merger related expenses for the acquisition of Post Properties were approximately $39.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 . We also incurred integration related expenses of approximately $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 . These expenses primarily consisted of legal, management salaries, and professional fees. There were no merger or integration related expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 because no merger occurred in that year and the expenses associated with our merger with Colonial Properties Trust, or Colonial, had already been incurred. Interest Expense Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 was approximately $129.9 million , an increase of $7.6 million from the year ended December 31, 2015 . The increase was due in part to decreased amortization of fair market value of debt adjustments related to debt acquired and increased interest rates towards the end of 2016. Additionally, we assumed several 47 loans through the acquisition of Post Properties, including a secured loan with a face value of $186.0 million and two unsecured loans with face values of $150.0 million and $250.0 million. Loss on Debt Extinguishment Loss on debt extinguishment was approximately $83,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016 . For the year ended December 31, 2015 , we recorded a loss of $3.6 million . The decrease of $3.5 million was due primarily to the removal of properties from a secured tax-free debt facility for the year ended December 31, 2015 . With the exception of an $83,000 gain on extinguishment, offset by a $166,000 loss for the write-off of deferred financing costs and related fees, there was no activity for the year ended December 31, 2016 . Dispositions of Depreciable Real Estate Assets Excluded from Discontinued Operations We recorded a gain on sale of depreciable assets excluded from discontinued operations of $80.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 , a decrease of approximately $109.6 million from the $190.0 million gain on sale of depreciable assets recorded for the year ended December 31, 2015 . The decrease was primarily the result of a decline in disposition activity year over year. Dispositions decreased from twenty-one multifamily properties for the year ended December 31, 2015 , to twelve multifamily properties for the year ended December 31, 2016 . Dispositions of Non-Depreciable Real Estate Assets Excluded from Discontinued Operations We recorded a gain on sale of non-depreciable assets excluded from discontinued operations of approximately $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 , an increase of $2.0 million from the year ended December 31, 2015 . The increase in gain on sale can be attributed to the rise in non-depreciable asset distributions year over year. Dispositions increased from one property for the year ended December 31, 2015 , to four properties for the year ended December 31, 2016 . Preferred Dividends Distributed As a result of the Merger, for the year ended December 31, 2016 we recorded a dividend distribution to shareholders of preferred stock of $307,000 . As there were no MAA Series I preferred shares issued and outstanding as of the year ended December 31, 2015, we did not record a dividend distribution. Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2015 to the Year Ended December 31, 2014 The comparison of the year ended December 31, 2015 to the year ended December 31, 2014 shows the segment break down based on the 2015 same store portfolios. A comparison using the 2016 same store portfolio would not be comparative due to the nature of the classifications. Property Revenues The following table shows our property revenues by segment for the years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 (dollars in thousands): Year ended December 31, 2015 Year ended December 31, 2014 Increase Percentage Increase Large Market Same Store $ 587,896 $ 553,038 $ 34,858 6.3 % Secondary Market Same Store 324,771 310,281 14,490 4.7 % Same Store Portfolio 912,667 863,319 49,348 5.7 % Non-Same Store and Other 130,112 128,859 1,253 1.0 % Total $ 1,042,779 $ 992,178 $ 50,601 5.1 % The increase in property revenues from our same store portfolio is primarily a result of increased average rental revenue per occupied unit of 5.5% and 3.8% for our large and secondary markets, respectively, and an increased average physical occupancy of 0.8% and 0.9% for our large and secondary markets, respectively. 48 Property Operating Expenses Property operating expenses include costs for property personnel, property personnel bonuses, building repairs and maintenance, real estate taxes and insurance, utilities, landscaping, and depreciation and amortization. The following table shows our property operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization by segment for the years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 (dollars in thousands): Year ended December 31, 2015 Year ended December 31, 2014 Increase/(Decrease) Percentage Increase/(Decrease) Large Market Same Store $ 226,611 $ 218,784 $ 7,827 3.6 % Secondary Market Same Store 123,782 119,934 3,848 3.2 % Same Store Portfolio 350,393 338,718 11,675 3.4 % Non-Same Store and Other 50,252 54,630 (4,378 ) (8.0 )% Total $ 400,645 $ 393,348 $ 7,297 1.9 % The increase in property operating expenses from our large market same store group is primarily the result of increases in real estate taxes of $3.2 million, personnel expenses of $1.9 million, water expenses of approximately $1.0 million, cable expenses of $0.5 million, and waste removal expenses of $0.2 million. The increase in property operating expenses from our secondary market same store group is primarily a result of increases in other operating expenses of $1.5 million, real estate taxes of $1.1 million, and personnel expenses of $1.2 million. The decrease in property operating expenses from our non-same store and other group is primarily the result of decreases in personnel expenses of $2.4 million and utility expenses of $1.7 million. Depreciation and Amortization The following table shows our depreciation and amortization expense by segment for the years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 (dollars in thousands): Year ended December 31, 2015 Year ended December 31, 2014 Decrease Percentage Decrease Large Market Same Store $ 168,872 $ 174,957 $ (6,085 ) (3.5 )% Secondary Market Same Store 85,008 86,058 (1,050 ) (1.2 )% Same Store Portfolio 253,880 261,015 (7,135 ) (2.7 )% Non-Same Store and Other 40,640 40,797 (157 ) (0.4 )% Total $ 294,520 $ 301,812 $ (7,292 ) (2.4 )% The decrease in depreciation and amortization expense is primarily due to a decrease of $19.4 million related to the amortization of the fair value of in-place leases and resident relationships acquired as a result of the merger with Colonial from the year ended December 31, 2014 to the year ended December 31, 2015. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in depreciation expense of $11.7 million driven by an increase in gross real estate assets from the year ended December 31, 2014 to the year ended December 31, 2015. Property Management Expenses Property management expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 were approximately $31.0 million , a decrease of $1.1 million from the year ended December 31, 2014 . The majority of the decrease was related to a decrease in state franchise taxes of $2.1 million, partially offset by an increase in insurance expense of $0.6 million, an increase in payroll expense of $0.3 million, and an increase in incentive expense $0.3 million. General and Administrative Expenses General and Administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 was approximately $25.7 million , an increase of $4.8 million from the year ended December 31, 2014 . The majority of the increase was related to increases in legal fees of $2.7 million and stock option expenses of $1.6 million. 49 Merger and Integration Related Expenses There were no merger or integration related expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 . For the year ended December 31, 2014 , merger and integration related expenses were approximately $3.2 million and $8.4 million, respectively. These expenses related primarily to severance, legal, professional, temporary systems, staffing, and facilities costs incurred for the acquisition and integration of Colonial. Interest Expense Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 was approximately $122.3 million , a decrease of $1.6 million from the year ended December 31, 2014 . The decrease was primarily the result of a decrease in amortization of deferred financing cost from the year ended December 31, 2014 to the year ended December 31, 2015 of approximately $0.9 million. Also, the overall debt balance decreased from $3.5 billion to $3.4 billion, a decrease of $85.1 million. The average effective interest rate remained at 3.7% and the average years to rate maturity increased from 4.4 years to 4.8 years. Dispositions of Depreciable Real Estate Assets Excluded from Discontinued Operations We recorded a gain on sale of depreciable assets excluded from discontinued operations of $190.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 , an increase of approximately $147.3 million from the $42.6 million gain on sale of depreciable assets recorded for the year ended December 31, 2014 . The increase was primarily the result of increased disposition activity. Dispositions increased from eight multifamily properties for the year ended December 31, 2014 , to twenty-one multifamily properties for the year ended December 31, 2015. Gain from Real Estate Joint Ventures We recorded a gain from real estate joint ventures of $6.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 as opposed to no material gain or loss being recorded during the year ended December 31, 2015 . The decrease was primarily a result of recording a $3.4 million gain for the disposition of Ansley Village by Mid-America Multifamily Fund II, or Fund II, as well as a $2.8 million gain for the promote fee received from our Fund II partner during 2014. The promote fee was received as a result of MAA achieving certain performance metrics in its management of the Fund II properties over the life of the joint venture. There were no such gains recorded during the year ended December 31, 2015 . Discontinued Operations We recorded a gain on sale of discontinued operations of $5.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 . We did not record a gain or loss on sale of discontinued operations during the year ended December 31, 2015 , due the adoption of ASU 2014-08, Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity, which resulted in dispositions being included in the gain on sale of depreciable real estate assets excluded from discontinued operations and is discussed further below. Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for the year ended December 31, 2015 was approximately $18.5 million , an increase of $10.2 million from the year ended December 31, 2014 . This increase is consistent with the increase to overall net income and is primarily a result of the items discussed above. Net Income Attributable to MAA Primarily as a result of the foregoing, net income attributable to MAA increased by approximately $184.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 from the year ended December 31, 2014 . Funds from Operations Funds from operations, or FFO, a non-GAAP financial measure, represents net income (computed in accordance with GAAP) excluding extraordinary items, net income attributable to noncontrolling interest, asset impairment, gains or losses on disposition of real estate assets, plus depreciation and amortization of real estate, and adjustments for joint ventures to reflect FFO on the same basis. Disposition of real estate assets includes, but is not limited to, sales of discontinued operations. 50 FFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income, or any other GAAP measurement of performance, as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating, investing, and financing activities as a measure of liquidity. Management believes that FFO is helpful to investors in understanding our operating performance primarily because its calculation excludes depreciation and amortization expense on real estate assets. We believe that GAAP historical cost depreciation of real estate assets is generally not correlated with changes in the value of those assets, whose value does not diminish predictably over time, as historical cost depreciation implies. Our calculation of FFO may differ from the methodology for calculating FFO utilized by other REITs and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other REITs. Core FFO, a non-GAAP financial measure, represents FFO excluding certain non-cash or non-routine items such as acquisition, merger and integration expenses, mark-to-market debt adjustments and loss or gain on debt extinguishment. While our definition of Core FFO is similar to others in our industry, our precise methodology for calculating Core FFO may differ from that utilized by other REITs and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other REITs. Core FFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income or any other GAAP measurement of performance, as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating, investing and financing activities as a measure of liquidity. Management believes that Core FFO is helpful in understanding our operating performance in that it removes certain items that by their nature are not comparable over periods and therefore tend to obscure actual operating performance. The following table is a reconciliation of Core FFO and FFO to consolidated net income for the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 , and 2014 (dollars in thousands): Years ended December 31, 2016 2015 2014 Net income available for MAA common shareholders $ 211,915 $ 332,287 $ 147,980 Depreciation and amortization of real estate assets 319,528 291,572 299,421 Depreciation and amortization of real estate assets of discontinued operations 42 Gain on sales of discontinued operations (5,394 ) Gain on sale of depreciable real estate assets excluded from discontinued operations (80,397 ) (189,958 ) (42,649 ) Loss (gain) on disposition within unconsolidated entities 98 (12 ) (4,007 ) (1) Depreciation and amortization of real estate assets of real estate joint ventures 61 25 397 Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 12,180 18,458 8,297 Funds from operations attributable to the Company 463,385 452,372 404,087 Acquisition expenses 2,928 2,777 2,388 Merger related expenses 39,033 3,152 Integration related expenses 1,790 8,395 Gain on sale of non-depreciable real estate assets (2,300 ) (172 ) (350 ) Mark-to-market debt adjustment (14,610 ) (19,955 ) (25,079 ) Loss on debt extinguishment 83 3,602 3,126 (2) Core funds from operations $ 490,309 $ 438,624 $ 395,719 (1) Gain on disposition within unconsolidated entities excludes the promote fee recognized with the final liquidation of Mid-America Multifamily Fund II (Fund II). (2) The loss on debt extinguishment for the year ended December 31, 2014 includes MAA's share of debt extinguishment costs incurred by our joint venture, Fund II. FFO for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased by approximately $11.0 million from the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily as a result of the increase in property revenues of $82.6 million , which was offset by increases in merger and integration related expenses of $40.8 million , property operating expenses, excluding depreciation, of $22.7 million , property management expenses of $3.1 million , and general and administrative expenses of $3.3 million . 51 FFO for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased by approximately $48.3 million from the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily as a result of the increase in property revenues of $50.6 million and a decrease in merger and integration related expenses of $11.5 million , which were partially offset by increases of $7.3 million in property operating expenses and $4.8 million in general and administrative expenses. Core FFO for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased by approximately $51.7 million from the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily as a result of the increase in total property revenues of $82.6 million , which was offset by increases in property operating expenses, excluding depreciation, of $22.7 million , property management expenses of $3.1 million , and general and administrative expenses of $3.3 million . Core FFO for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased by approximately $42.9 million from the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily as a result of the increase in total property revenues of $50.6 million and the decrease in interest expense, excluding the mark-to-market debt adjustment, of $6.7 million, which was partially offset by the $7.3 million increase in property operating expenses and the $4.8 million in general and administrative expenses. TRENDS During the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, demand for apartments was strong, as it was during the twelve months ended December 31, 2015. This strength was evident on two fronts: occupancy and effective rent per unit. Same store physical occupancy ended December 2016 at a 96.6% and average physical occupancy for the same store portfolio was 96.2% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, up 15 basis points from the twelve months ended December 31, 2015. Same store average effective rent per unit continued to grow, up 4.2% in the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2015. An important part of our portfolio strategy is to maintain a diversity of markets, submarkets, product types and price points across the Southeast and Southwest regions of the United States. This diversity tends to mitigate exposure to economic issues in any one geographic market or area. We believe that a well-balanced portfolio, including both large and select secondary markets; inner loop, suburban, and downtown/CBD locations; and various monthly rent price points will perform well in up cycles as well as weather down cycles better. As of December 31, 2016, including the impact of the Merger, we were invested in approximately 39 defined MSAs, diversified across both large markets and secondary markets, urban and suburban submarkets, and a variety of monthly rent pricing points. According to U.S. Census Bureau data, as of November 30, 2016, multifamily permitting was down over 7% as compared to November 30, 2015. While we believe a return to historical permitting will ultimately lead to a further increase in supply, we also believe the lack of new apartments in recent years, the current downward trend of multifamily permitting, and the demand from new households will help keep supply and demand essentially in balance in most markets. Also, we believe that more disciplined credit terms for residential mortgages should continue to favor rental demand at existing multifamily properties. Furthermore, rental competition from single family homes has not been a major competitive factor impacting our portfolio. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, total move outs attributable to single family home rentals dropped to 7% of total move outs as compared to 8% of total move outs for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015. We have seen significant rental competition from single family homes in only a few of our submarkets. Long term, we expect demographic trends (including the growth of prime age groups for rentals and immigration and population movement to the Southeast and Southwest) will continue to support apartment rental demand for our markets. Our focus is on maintaining strong physical occupancy while increasing pricing where possible through our revenue management system. As noted above, physical occupancy ended December 2016 strong and the average for the twelve months ended December 2016 was 15 basis points above the level we achieved in the twelve months ended December 31, 2015. As we move through the remainder of the typically slower winter leasing season and into the typically stronger spring leasing season, the current level of physical occupancy puts us in a good position to capture solid pricing in the first half of 2017. We continue to develop improved products, operating systems and procedures that we believe enable us to capture more revenues. Benefits of improved practices such as monthly and intra-monthly lease expiration management and collections performance enable us to capture increased revenue. We continue to actively work on improving processes and products to reduce expenses. Furthermore, the Merger provides further opportunity to benefit from economies of scale and to combine best practices across the entire portfolio. 52 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Our cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities, as well as general economic and market conditions, are the principal factors affecting our liquidity and capital resources. The significant changes in cash from the year ended December 31, 2015 to the year ended December 31, 2016 due to operating, investing, and financing activities are as follows: Operating Activities Net cash flow provided by operating activities increased to $484.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $463.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 . This change was a result of various items, including higher revenues, as discussed above. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities increased to $710.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $136.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 . The primary drivers of this change are as follows: Primary drivers of cash (outflow)/inflow during the year ended December 31, Percentage Decrease in Net Cash 2016 2015 Decrease in Net Cash Acquisition of Post, net of cash acquired $ (427,764 ) $ $ (427,764 ) (100.0 )% Purchases of real estate and other assets $ (339,186 ) $ (328,193 ) $ (10,993 ) (3.3 )% Proceeds from disposition of real estate assets $ 296,700 $ 358,017 $ (61,317 ) (17.1 )% Funding of escrow for future acquisitions $ (58,259 ) $ 8 $ (58,267 ) (100.0 )% Development $ (58,931 ) $ (38,730 ) $ (20,201 ) (52.2 )% The increase in cash outflows during the year ended December 31, 2016 , primarily resulted in cash proceeds, net of cash acquired, of $427.8 million being used to satisfy Post Properties' debt, at the time of the Merger and included as consideration provided for the Merger. The increase in cash outflows from purchases of real estate and other assets primarily resulted from the cost of the acquisition of five apartment communities during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the cost of the acquisition of seven apartment communities during the year ended December 31, 2015 . The decrease in proceeds from disposition of real estate assets primarily resulted from the sale of twelve apartment communities, one commercial property, and three land parcels during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the sale of twenty-one apartment communities, one commercial property, and one land parcel during the year ended December 31, 2015 . The decrease in cash inflows from the funding of escrow for future acquisitions resulted from the funding of one anticipated future1031(b) transactions into escrow during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the funding of two 1031(b) transactions during and corresponding return to cash from escrow for those transactions during the year ended December 31, 2015 . The increase in cash outflows for development resulted from the timing of development spending during the year ended December 31, 2016 . 53 Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities increased to $222.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $316.6 million used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 . The primary drivers of this change are as follows: Primary drivers of cash inflow/(outflow) during the year ended December 31, Percentage Increase/(Decrease) in Net Cash 2016 2015 Increase/(Decrease) in Net Cash Net change in credit lines $ 335,000 $ (180,900 ) $ 515,900 285.2 % Proceeds from notes payable $ 300,000 $ 395,960 $ (95,960 ) (24.2 )% Principal payments on notes payable $ (146,026 ) $ (279,077 ) $ 133,051 47.7 % Dividends paid on common shares $ (247,652 ) $ (232,079 ) $ (15,573 ) (6.7 )% The increase in cash inflows related to the net change in credit lines resulted from the increase in borrowings of $335.0 million on the KeyBank Facility (as defined below) during 2016, which included $140.0 million used to pay off Post Properties' line of credit facility, compared to the net decrease of $180.1 million due to net repayments in 2015 of $105.8 million on our Fannie Mae secured credit facility and $91.1 million on our tax free secured property facility, which were partially offset by net increases on our Keybank facility of $16.0 million. The decrease in cash inflows from proceeds from notes payable is primarily due to the fact that during 2015 we issued $400 million in unsecured bonds compared to proceeds of $300 million related to the issuance of the Wells Fargo Term loan received in 2016. The increase in cash outflows from dividends paid on common shares primarily resulted from the increase in the dividend rate to $0.82 per share during the year ended December 31, 2016 from $0.77 per share during the year ended December 31, 2015. Equity As of December 31, 2016 , MAA owned 113,518,212 OP Units, comprising a 96.4% limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership, while the remaining 4,220,403 outstanding OP Units were held by limited partners of the Operating Partnership. Holders of OP Units (other than MAA and its corporate affiliates) may require us to redeem their OP Units from time to time, in which case we may, at our option, pay the redemption price either in cash (in an amount per OP Unit equal, in general, to the average closing price of MAA's common stock on the NYSE over a specified period prior to the redemption date) or by delivering one share of our common stock (subject to adjustment under specified circumstances) for each OP Unit so redeemed. In addition, we have registered under the Securities Act the 4,220,403 shares of our common stock, which as of December 31, 2016 , were issuable upon redemption of OP Units held by the Operating Partnership's limited partners so that those shares can be sold freely in the public markets. To the extent that additional OP Units are issued to limited partners of the Operating Partnership, we will likely register the additional shares of common stock issuable upon redemption of those OP Units under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, so that those shares can also be sold in the public markets. If MAA issues shares of common stock upon the redemption of OP Units in the Operating Partnership, sales of substantial amounts of such shares of common stock, or the perception that these sales could occur, may adversely affect prevailing market prices for MAA common stock or may impair MAA's ability to raise capital through the sale of common stock or other equity securities. In connection with the Merger, we issued to the then-holders of Post Properties capital stock and OP Units approximately 38.0 million shares of MAA common stock, approximately 80,000 OP Units, and approximately 868,000 MAA Series I preferred stock on December 1, 2016. For more information regarding our equity capital resources, see Note 10 and Note 11 in the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 54 Debt The following schedule outlines our fixed and variable rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps and caps, outstanding as of December 31, 2016 (dollars in thousands): Principal Balance Average Years to Rate Maturity Effective Rate SECURED DEBT Conventional - Fixed Rate or Swapped $ 1,128,284 2.6 3.9 % Conventional - Variable Rate - Capped (1) 50,000 1.3 1.1 % Total Fixed or Hedged Rate Maturity $ 1,178,284 2.5 4.0 % Conventional - Variable Rate 110,000 0.1 1.1 % Fair Market Value Adjustments and Debt Issuance Costs 30,804 Total Secured Rate Maturity $ 1,319,088 2.3 3.5 % UNSECURED DEBT Fixed Rate or Swapped $ 2,710,000 4.9 3.7 % Variable Rate 490,000 0.1 1.6 % Fair Market Value Adjustments, Debt Issuance Costs and Discounts (19,376 ) Total Unsecured Rate Maturity $ 3,180,624 4.2 3.4 % TOTAL DEBT $ 4,499,712 3.6 3.5 % TOTAL FIXED OR HEDGED DEBT $ 3,899,712 3.6 3.8 % (1) The effective rate represents the average rate on the underlying variable debt, unless the cap rates are reached, which average 4.5% of the London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, for conventional caps. As of December 31, 2016 , we had entered into interest rate swaps totaling a notional amount of $850.0 million . To date, these swaps have proven to be highly effective hedges. We had also entered into interest rate cap agreements totaling a notional amount of approximately $50.0 million as of December 31, 2016 . The following schedule outlines the contractual maturity dates of our outstanding debt, net of fair market value adjustments, debt issuance costs and discounts, as of December 31, 2016 (in thousands): Key Bank Unsecured Public Bonds Other Unsecured Secured Total 2017 $ $ 152,338 $ 17,980 $ 110,305 $ 280,623 2018 300,616 169,021 469,637 2019 19,950 734,835 754,785 2020 490,000 149,729 166,843 806,572 2021 221,888 126,486 348,374 Thereafter 1,380,479 447,644 11,598 1,839,721 Total $ 490,000 $ 1,532,817 $ 1,157,807 $ 1,319,088 $ 4,499,712 55 The following schedule outlines the interest rate maturities of our outstanding fixed or hedged debt, net of fair market value adjustments, debt issuance costs and discounts, as of December 31, 2016 (dollars in thousands): Fixed Rate Debt Interest Rate Swaps Total Fixed Rate Balances Contract Rate Interest Rate Caps Total Fixed or Hedged 2017 $ 200,623 $ 299,098 $ 499,721 3.1 % $ 25,000 $ 524,721 2018 138,945 250,692 389,637 4.0 % 25,000 414,637 2019 754,785 754,785 5.8 % 754,785 2020 166,843 298,944 465,787 3.3 % 465,787 2021 199,004 199,004 5.2 % 199,004 Thereafter 1,540,778 1,540,778 4.0 % 1,540,778 Total $ 3,000,978 $ 848,734 $ 3,849,712 4.2 % $ 50,000 $ 3,899,712 Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility On October 15, 2015, our Operating Partnership entered into a $750.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility agreement with KeyBank National Association, KeyBank, and fourteen other banks, the KeyBank Facility. The KeyBank Facility replaced our Operating Partnership's previous unsecured credit facility with KeyBank. The interest rate is determined using an investment grade pricing grid using LIBOR plus a spread of 0.85% to 1.55%. On December 1, 2016, we amended the KeyBank Facility by increasing the borrowing capacity to $1.0 billion . As of December 31, 2016 , we had $490.0 million borrowed under this facility. The KeyBank Facility serves as our primary source of short-term liquidity and has an accordion feature that we may use to expand its capacity to $1.5 billion. The KeyBank Facility matures on April 15, 2020. Unsecured Term Loans In addition to our unsecured credit facility, we maintain four unsecured term loans. We had total borrowings of $850.0 million outstanding under these term loan agreements at December 31, 2016 . The $250.0 million term loan with Wells Fargo, N.A., or Wells Fargo, bears interest at a rate of LIBOR plus a spread of 0.90% to 1.90% based on the credit ratings of our unsecured debt. The loan matures on August 1, 2018. As of December 31, 2016 , this loan was bearing interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 0.98%. The $150.0 million term loan with U.S. Bank National Association, or U.S. Bank, bears interest at a rate of LIBOR plus a spread of 0.90% to 1.90% based on the credit ratings of our unsecured debt. The loan matures on March 1, 2020. As of December 31, 2016 , this loan was bearing interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 0.98%. The $150.0 million term loan with Key Bank bears interest at a rate of LIBOR plus a spread of 0.90% to 1.75% based on the credit ratings of our unsecured debt. The loan matures on March 1, 2021. As of December 31, 2016 , this loan was bearing interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 0.95%. The $300.0 million term loan with Wells Fargo bears interest at a rate of LIBOR plus a spread of 0.90% to 1.75% based on the credit ratings of our unsecured debt. The loan matures on March 1, 2022. As of December 31, 2016 , this loan was bearing interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 0.95%. Senior Unsecured Notes We have also issued public and private unsecured notes. As of December 31, 2016 , we have approximately $1.6 billion of publicly issued bonds and $310.0 million of unsecured notes issued in two private placements. In October 2013 we issued $350.0 million senior notes due 2023 with a coupon of 4.30%, paid semi-annually on April 15 and October 15. In June 2014 we issued $400.0 million senior notes due 2024 with a coupon of 3.75%, paid semi-annually on June 15 and December 15. In November 2015 we issued $400.0 million senior notes due 2025 with a coupon of 4.00%, paid semi-annually on May 15 and November 15. We also assumed two senior notes totaling $400.0 million as a result of the Post merger. One senior note assumed as a result of the Merger has a face value of $250.0 million, is due 2022, and has a coupon of 3.38% paid semi-annually on June 1 and December 1. The other senior note assumed as a result of the Merger has a face value of $150.0 million, is due 2018, and has a coupon of 4.75% paid semi-annually on April 15 and October 15. As of December 31, 2016 , all of these amounts remained outstanding. 56 On July 29, 2011, we issued $135.0 million of senior unsecured notes. The notes were offered in a private placement with three maturity tranches: $50.0 million at 4.7% maturing on July 29, 2018, $72.8 million at 5.4% maturing on July 29, 2021; and $12.3 million at 5.6% maturing on July 29, 2023; all of which is outstanding at December 31, 2016 . On August 31, 2012, we issued $175.0 million of senior unsecured notes. The notes were offered in a private placement with four tranches: $18.0 million at 3.15% maturing on November 30, 2017; $20.0 million at 3.61% maturing on November 30, 2019; $117.0 million at 4.17% maturing on November 30, 2022; and $20.0 million at 4.33% maturing on November 30, 2024, all of which is outstanding at December 31, 2016 . Secured Property Mortgages We also maintain secured property mortgages with Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and various life insurance companies. These mortgages are usually fixed rate and can range from five to ten years in maturity. As of December 31, 2016 , we have $1.1 billion of secured property mortgages. Secured Credit Facility Approximately 3.6% of our outstanding obligations at December 31, 2016 were borrowed through a credit facility credit enhanced by Fannie Mae, which we also refer to as the Fannie Mae Facility. The Fannie Mae Facility has a line limit of $160.0 million , of which $160.0 million was collateralized, available to borrow, and borrowed, at December 31, 2016 . Various Fannie Mae rate tranches of the Fannie Mae Facility mature from 2017 through 2018. For more information regarding our debt capital resources, see Note 6 to the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in the Annual Report on Form 10-K. Contractual Obligations The following table reflects our total contractual cash obligations which consist of our long-term debt, development fees and operating leases as of December 31, 2016 (dollars in thousands): Contractual Obligations (1) 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 Thereafter Total Long-Term Debt Obligations (2) $ 289,666 $ 476,449 $ 726,473 $ 798,281 $ 342,903 $ 1,854,512 $ 4,488,284 Fixed Rate or Swapped Interest (3) 150,588 129,516 91,826 76,204 67,854 140,924 656,912 Purchase Obligations (4) 1,901 542 2,443 Operating Lease Obligations (5) 836 703 687 707 719 63,600 67,252 Total $ 442,991 $ 607,210 $ 818,986 $ 875,192 $ 411,476 $ 2,059,036 $ 5,214,891 (1) Fixed rate and swapped interest are shown in this table. The average interest rates of variable rate debt are shown in preceding tables. (2) Represents principal payments gross of discounts, debt issuance costs and fair market value adjustments of debt assumed. (3) Swapped interest is subject to the ineffective portion of cash flow hedges as described in Note 7 to the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in the Annual Report on Form 10-K. (4) Represents development fees. (5) Primarily comprised of a ground lease underlying one apartment community owned by the Company. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements At December 31, 2016 , and 2015 , we did not have any relationships, including those with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. As of December 31, 2016 , we had a 35% ownership interest in the Post Massachusetts Avenue joint venture, which consists of 269 units. Our investment in this real estate joint ventures is unconsolidated and is recorded using the equity method for the joint ventures in which we do not have a controlling interest. 57 In addition, we do not engage in trading activities involving non-exchange traded contracts. As such, we are not materially exposed to any financing, liquidity, market, or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships. We do not have any relationships or transactions with persons or entities that derive benefits from their non-independent relationships with us or our related parties other than those disclosed in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 14. INSURANCE We renegotiated our primary insurance programs effective July 1, 2016 . We believe that the property and casualty insurance program in place provides appropriate insurance coverage for financial protection against insurable risks such that any insurable loss experienced that can be reasonably anticipated would not have a significant impact on our liquidity, financial position or results of operation. INFLATION Our resident leases at the apartment communities allow, at the time of renewal, for adjustments in the rent payable thereunder, and thus may enable us to seek rent increases. Almost all leases are for one year or less. The short-term nature of these leases generally serves to reduce our risk to adverse effects of inflation. IMPACT OF RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS The following table provides a brief description of recent accounting pronouncements that could have a material effect on our financial statements: Standard Description Date of Adoption Effect on the Financial Statements or Other Significant Matters Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2015-02 , Consolidation (Topic 810) ASU 2015-02, affects reporting entities that are required to evaluate whether they should consolidate certain legal entities. All legal entities are subject to reevaluation under the revised consolidation model. Specifically, the amendments: (i) modify the evaluation of whether limited partnerships and similar legal entities are variable interest entities ("VIEs") or voting interest entities, (ii) eliminate the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership, (iii) affect the consolidated analysis of reporting entities that are involved with VIEs, particularly those that have fee arrangements and related party relationships and (iv) provide a scope exception for certain entities. This ASU is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2015. We adopted this ASU effective January 1, 2016. We adopted this ASU effective January 1, 2016, and there was no material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations taken as a whole. While adoption of the new standard did not result in the consolidation of entities not previously consolidated or the de-consolidation of any entities previously consolidated, the Operating Partnership is now classified as a VIE as the limited partners lack substantive kick-out rights and substantive participating rights. Thus, the Company is the primary beneficiary of, and continues to consolidate MAALP. ASU 2015-16 , Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement -Period Adjustments This ASU was issued to simplify the accounting for business combinations, specifically as it relates to measurement-period adjustments. Acquiring entities in a business combination must recognize measurement-period adjustments in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. Also, ASU 2015-16 requires entities to present separately on the face of the income statement (or disclose in the notes to the financial statements) the portion of the amount recorded in the current period earnings, by line item, that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date. This ASU is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2015. We adopted this ASU effective January 1, 2016. Adoption of this ASU did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements; however, as noted in Note 2, Business Combinations, we will continue to monitor these adjustments related to the Post Merger as the measurement period remains open for twelve months following the 12/1/16 Merger date. 58 ASU 2014-16 - Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815), Determining Whether the Host Contract in a Hybrid Financial Instrument Issued in the Form of a Share Is More Akin to Debt or to Equity This ASU clarifies how U.S. GAAP should be applied in determining whether the nature of a host contract in a hybrid financial instrument that is issued in the form of a share is more akin to debt or equity and in evaluating whether the economic characteristics and risks of an embedded feature are "clearly and closely related" to its host contract. This ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after 15 December 2015. We adopted this ASU effective January 1, 2016. Upon initial adoption on January 1, 2016, this ASU did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures. However, as a result of the issuance of the MAA Series I preferred stock resulting from the merger on December 1, 2016, we identified a redemption feature embedded in this preferred stock and determined that we were required to bifurcate the value associated with this feature from its host instrument, the preferred shares, and account for it as a freestanding derivative on the balance sheet at fair value as a result of the call option in accordance with this guidance in ASC 815. (See Note 7 and 8 for details and referenced impact to our consolidated financial statements and disclosures). ASU 2014-15, Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern This ASU requires an entity's management to evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. If substantial doubt exists, the entity must disclose the principal conditions or events that raised the substantial doubt, management's evaluation of the significance of these conditions, and management's plan for alleviating the substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern. This ASU is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016. We adopted this guidance on December 31, 2016. We adopted this guidance on December 31, 2016, and the adoption of this guidance did not have an impact to the consolidated financial statements or material impact on our disclosures. ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers This ASU establishes principles for recognizing revenue upon the transfer of promised goods or services to customers, in an amount that reflects the expected consideration received in exchange for those goods or services as outlined in a five-step model whereby revenue is recognized as performance obligations within a contract are satisfied. Income from lease contracts is specifically excluded from this ASU. This ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, as a result of a deferral of the effective date arising from the issuance of ASU 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers - Deferral of the Effective Date. Early adoption is permitted. The amendments may be applied using the full retrospective transition method resulting in adjustments to each prior period presented as of the date of initial application or by using the modified retrospective transition method with a cumulative effect recognized as of the date of initial application. We currently expect to adopt ASU 2014-09 effective January 1, 2018, using the modified retrospective approach. We have identified our revenue streams and are in the process of evaluating the impact on our consolidated financial statements and internal accounting processes; however, the majority of our revenue is derived from real estate lease contracts. ASU 2016-02, Leases This ASU amends existing accounting standards for lease accounting and establishes the principles for lease accounting for both the lessee and lessor. The amendment requires an entity to recognize a right-of-use asset and lease liability for all leases with terms of more than 12 months. Recognition, measurement and presentation of expenses will depend on classification as a finance or operating lease. The amendment also requires certain quantitative and qualitative disclosures about leasing arrangements. This ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018; however, early adoption is permitted. The standard must be adopted using a modified retrospective transition and provides for certain practical expedients. Transition will require application of the new guidance at the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented. We are currently evaluating the impact this standard may have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures upon adoption. ASU 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting This ASU amends existing accounting standards for certain aspects of share-based payments to employees. The new guidance will require all income tax effects of awards to be recognized in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled. It also will allow an employer to repurchase more of an employee shares than it can today for tax withholding purposes without triggering liability accounting and to make a policy election to account for forfeitures as they occur. This ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016; however, early adoption is permitted. The standard must be adopted using a modified retrospective transition method, with a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings. We are currently evaluating the impact this standard may have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures upon adoption. 59 ASU 2016-15, Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (a consensus of the Emerging Issues Task Force) This ASU clarifies how several specific cash receipts and cash payments are to be presented and classified on the statement of cash flows, including debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs, settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments, contingent consideration made after a business combination, distributions received from equity method investees, beneficial interests in securitization transactions, and separately identifiable cash flows and application of predominance principle. This ASU is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and early adoption is permitted. Each amendment in this standard must be applied prospectively, retrospectively, or as of the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the year of adoption, depending on the type of amendment. We expect to adopt ASU 2016-15 as of January 1, 2018, and we are currently evaluating the impact this standard may have on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption. ASU 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230):Restricted Cash (A Consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force) This ASU requires restricted cash to be presented with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning and ending amounts in the statements of cash flows. This ASU is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and early adoption is permitted. The update should be applied retrospectively to each period presented. We expect to adopt ASU 2016-15 as of January 1, 2018. We currently report the change in restricted cash within the investing activities in our consolidated statement of cash flows. If we were to early adopt in 2017, cash and cash equivalents reported in our consolidated statements of cash flows would increase by approximately $88.3 million and $26.1 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively, to reflect the restricted cash balances. Additionally, net cash used in investing activities would increase by $58.3 million in 2016 and decrease by $8 thousand in 2015. ASU 2017-01, Clarifying the Definition of a Business (Topic 805) This ASU clarifies the definition of a business and provides further guidance for evaluating whether a transaction will be accounted for as an acquisition of an asset or a business. This ASU is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and early adoption is permitted. The update should be applied prospectively. We adopted ASU 2017-01 as of January 1, 2017 and the adoption did not require any additional disclosures. We believe most of our future acquisitions of operating properties will qualify as asset acquisitions and most future transaction costs associated with these acquisitions will be capitalized.
