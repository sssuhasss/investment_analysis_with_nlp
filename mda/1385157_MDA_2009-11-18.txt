ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. The following discussion may contain forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those factors discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report, particularly in "Risk Factors" and "Forward-Looking Information." Change of Domicile Effective June 25, 2009, Tyco Electronics Ltd. ("Tyco Electronics" or the "Company"), which may be referred to as "we," "us," or "our") discontinued its existence as a Bermuda company as provided in the Bermuda Companies Act, and, in accordance with article 161 of the Swiss Federal Code on International Private Law, continued its existence as a Swiss corporation under articles 620 et seq. of the Swiss Code of Obligations. The rights of holders of our shares are now governed by Swiss law, our Swiss articles of association, and our Swiss organizational regulations. The Separation Effective June 29, 2007, we became the parent company of the former electronics businesses of Tyco International Ltd. ("Tyco International"). On June 29, 2007, Tyco International distributed all of its shares of Tyco Electronics, as well as its shares of its former healthcare businesses ("Covidien"), to its common shareholders (the "Separation"). Overview The Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements reflect the consolidated operations of Tyco Electronics Ltd. and its subsidiaries as an independent, publicly-traded entity subsequent to the Separation and a combined reporting entity comprising the assets and liabilities used in managing and operating the electronics businesses of Tyco International, including Tyco Electronics Ltd., for the period prior to the Separation. 36 Table of Contents Our Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements have been prepared in United States Dollars, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"). The Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for the period prior to the Separation may not be indicative of our future performance and do not necessarily reflect what our consolidated and combined results of operations, financial position, and cash flows would have been had we operated as an independent, publicly-traded company prior to June 29, 2007. Certain general corporate overhead, net class action settlement costs, net interest expense, and other expenses for the period prior to the Separation were allocated to us by Tyco International. Management believes such allocations were reasonable; however, they may not be indicative of our actual results had we been operating as an independent, publicly-traded company for the period prior to the Separation. See Note 17 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for further information regarding allocations. We are a leading global provider of engineered electronic components, network solutions, specialty products, and undersea telecommunication systems. We design, manufacture, and market approximately 450,000 different products for customers in a broad array of industries including automotive; data communication systems and consumer electronics; telecommunications; aerospace, defense, and marine; medical; energy; and lighting. We believe the end markets that we sell into are balanced with the total end market demand for our products. We operate through four reporting segments: Electronic Components, Network Solutions, Specialty Products, and Undersea Telecommunications. In May 2009, we sold our Wireless Systems business which has been reclassified as discontinued operations. Prior to reclassification to held for sale and discontinued operations, this business was reported as our former Wireless Systems segment. Also, effective January 1, 2009, we established the Specialty Products Group from our existing businesses. The results of this new organization are reported as a separate reporting segment. This new segment is comprised of the Aerospace, Defense, and Marine; Touch Systems; Medical; and Circuit Protection businesses which were formerly reported in the Electronic Components segment. Prior period segment information has been revised to conform to the current segment reporting structure in all periods presented. See Notes 1 and 24 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for additional information regarding our segments. We service our customers primarily through our direct sales force that serves customers in over 150 countries. The sales force is supported by approximately 7,000 engineers, as well as globally deployed manufacturing sites. Through our sales force and engineering resources, we are able to collaborate with our customers throughout the world to provide highly engineered products and solutions to meet their needs. Our strategic objective is to increase our revenue and profitability across all of our segments in the markets we serve. This strategy is dependent upon the following strategic priorities: leverage our market leadership position to increase our market share; achieve market leadership in attractive and under-penetrated industries; extend our leadership in key emerging markets; supplement organic growth with strategic acquisitions; improve operating margins; and accelerate new product development through research and development excellence. 37 Table of Contents Key business factors that influenced our results of operations for the periods discussed in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations include: Raw material price increases. We purchased approximately 125 million pounds of copper and 125,000 troy ounces of gold in fiscal 2009. During the periods shown, gold prices, as well as the prices of certain other raw materials, have been volatile and current year prices have increased from prior year levels. Copper prices remain high relative to historic levels but have declined over the past year. The following table sets forth the average prices incurred related to copper and gold during the periods presented: Fiscal Measure 2009 2008 2007 Copper Lb. $ 2.75 $ 3.40 $ 3.20 Gold Troy oz. $ 878 $ 870 $ 653 In fiscal 2010, we expect to purchase approximately 125 million pounds of copper and 150,000 troy ounces of gold. Foreign exchange. Approximately 50% of our net sales are invoiced in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Our results of operations are influenced by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. Dollar, compared to other currencies, will directly affect our reported results as we translate those currencies into U.S. Dollars at the end of each fiscal period. The percentage of net sales in fiscal 2009 by major currencies invoiced was as follows: U.S. Dollar 50 % Euro 28 Japanese Yen 7 Chinese Renminbi 4 Brazilian Real 2 British Pound Sterling 2 Korean Won 2 All others 5 Total 100 % Economic Conditions Our business and operating results have been and will continue to be affected by worldwide economic conditions. Our sales are dependent on certain end markets that are impacted by consumer as well as industrial and infrastructure spending, and our operating results can be adversely affected by reduced demand in those markets. As a result of economic trends, we experienced a 28.6% decrease in net sales in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008. We expect net sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 to be $2.7 billion to $2.8 billion, a flat to 4% increase from fourth quarter fiscal 2009 levels, as a result of continued improvements in consumer end markets, partially offset by a decline in net sales in our Undersea Telecommunications segment. We are monitoring the current environment and its potential effects on our customers and on the end markets we serve. Additionally, we continue to closely manage our costs in order to respond to changing conditions. We are also managing our capital resources and monitoring capital availability to ensure that we have sufficient resources to fund our future capital needs. (See further discussion in "Liquidity and Capital Resources.") 38 Table of Contents We test goodwill allocated to reporting units for impairment annually during the fiscal fourth quarter, or more frequently if events occur or circumstances exist that indicate that a reporting unit's carrying value may exceed its fair value. We completed our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 and determined that no impairment existed. As a result of declines in sales and profitability of the Automotive and Communications and Industrial Solutions reporting units of the Electronic Components segment and the Circuit Protection reporting unit of the Specialty Products segment during the second quarter of fiscal 2009, we determined that an indicator of impairment had occurred and goodwill impairment testing of these reporting units was required. Significant judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred. In making this assessment, we rely on a number of factors including, among others, operating results, business plans, economic projections, and anticipated future cash flows. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management's judgment in applying each to the analysis of the recoverability of goodwill. The testing for goodwill impairment is a two step process. In performing step I of impairment testing, we determined the fair value of the Automotive, Communications and Industrial Solutions, and Circuit Protection reporting units based on a discounted cash flows analysis incorporating our estimate of future operating performance. The results of the step I goodwill impairment tests indicated that the book value of each of the reporting units exceeded its fair value. The failure of the step I goodwill impairment tests triggered step II goodwill impairment tests in which we determined the implied fair value of the reporting units' goodwill by comparing the reporting units' fair value determined in step I to the fair value of the reporting units' net assets, including unrecognized intangible assets. The step II goodwill impairment tests resulted in a full impairment charge of $2,088 million for the Automotive reporting unit and partial impairment charges of $1,347 million and $112 million for the Communications and Industrial Solutions and Circuit Protection reporting units, respectively, in the second quarter of fiscal 2009. Discontinued Operations During fiscal 2009, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our Wireless Systems business. In May 2009, we completed the sale for $664 million in net cash proceeds and recognized a pre-tax gain of $59 million on this transaction. The divestiture of the Wireless Systems business substantially completes the streamlining of our portfolio that we began two years ago. In September 2008, we completed the sale of the Radio Frequency Components and Subsystem business for net cash proceeds of $427 million and recorded a $184 million pre-tax gain on the sale. In September 2008, we also completed the sale of the Automotive Radar Sensors business for net cash proceeds of $42 million and recorded a $31 million pre-tax gain on the sale. In fiscal 2009, we recorded an additional pre-tax gain on sale of $4 million in connection with the finalization of working capital adjustments relating to the sale of the Radio Frequency Components and Subsystem and Automotive Radar Sensors businesses. Also during fiscal 2009, we received additional cash proceeds related to working capital of $29 million in connection with the fiscal 2008 sale of the Radio Frequency Components and Subsystem and Automotive Radar Sensors businesses. The Consolidated Balance Sheet reflected the $29 million in prepaid expenses and other current assets at September 26, 2008. The divestiture of our Power Systems business was authorized during fiscal 2007. As a result, we assessed Power Systems' assets for impairment and determined that the book value of the Power Systems business exceeded its estimated fair value. We recorded a $585 million pre-tax impairment charge in fiscal 2007 in income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of income taxes on the Consolidated and Combined Statement of Operations. In fiscal 2008, we completed the sale of the Power Systems business for $102 million in net cash proceeds and recorded a $51 million pre-tax gain on the sale. 39 Table of Contents In fiscal 2007, we completed the sale of the Printed Circuit Group business for $227 million in net cash proceeds and recorded a $45 million pre-tax gain on the sale. The Wireless Systems, Radio Frequency Components and Subsystem, Automotive Radar Sensors, Power Systems, and Printed Circuit Group businesses have been included in discontinued operations in all periods presented on our Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements. Prior to reclassification to held for sale and discontinued operations, the Wireless Systems, Radio Frequency Components and Subsystem, and Automotive Radar Sensors businesses were components of the former Wireless Systems segment. Both the Power Systems and Printed Circuit Group businesses were components of the Other segment, which was subsequently renamed the Undersea Telecommunications segment. See Note 5 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for additional information regarding discontinued operations. Other Divestitures During fiscal 2009, we completed the sale of the Battery Systems business, which was part of the Electronic Components segment, for net cash proceeds of $14 million after working capital adjustments. The divestiture resulted in a $7 million pre-tax loss on sale which is reflected in restructuring and other charges, net on the Consolidated and Combined Statement of Operations. We have presented the loss on sale and the operations of the Battery Systems business in continuing operations due to immateriality. See Note 4 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for additional information regarding the divestiture of the Battery Systems business. Subsequent to fiscal year end 2009, we signed an agreement with a third party to sell the Dulmison connectors and fittings product line within our energy business for $16 million in cash, subject to final working capital adjustments. We expect the sale to be completed in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. A pre-tax impairment charge of $12 million was recorded in fiscal 2009 to write the carrying value of the assets and liabilities down to fair value. The charge is reflected in restructuring and other charges, net on the Consolidated and Combined Statement of Operations. The product line, which was part of our Network Solutions segment, generated sales of $53 million in fiscal 2009. See Note 4 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for additional information regarding the impairment charge. Manufacturing Simplification and Cost Actions due to Current Economic Environment We plan to continue to simplify our global manufacturing footprint, by migrating facilities from higher-cost to lower-cost countries, consolidating within countries, and transferring product lines to lower-cost countries. These initiatives are designed to help us maintain our competitiveness in the industry, improve our operating leverage, and position us for profitability growth in the years ahead. We have closed a number of manufacturing facilities since we began our simplification program in 2007. As of fiscal year end 2009, we had fewer than 100 manufacturing sites as compared to over 130 at the end of fiscal 2006. As a result of the current economic environment, we have accelerated workforce reductions through the elimination of temporary workers, attrition, and reductions in force. In fiscal 2009, we reduced our headcount by 17%, or approximately 16,000 positions. In connection with our manufacturing simplification plan and in response to the current economic environment, we expect to incur restructuring charges of approximately $350 million from fiscal 2010 through 2011. In fiscal 2009, cash spending related to restructuring was approximately $260 million, and we anticipate spending approximately $300 million in fiscal 2010. Cost savings related to these actions were $200 million in fiscal 2009. Thereafter, annualized savings are expected to be $300 million, consisting of $200 million of manufacturing cost reductions and $100 million of savings in selling, general, and administrative expenses. 40 Table of Contents Non-GAAP Financial Measures Organic net sales growth, which is included in the discussion below, is a non-GAAP financial measure. The difference between reported net sales growth (the most comparable GAAP measure) and organic net sales growth (the non-GAAP measure) consists of the impact from foreign currency exchange rates, acquisitions, and divestitures. Organic net sales growth is a useful measure of the underlying results and trends in our business. It excludes items that are not completely under management's control, such as the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and items that do not reflect the underlying growth of the company, such as acquisition and divestiture activity. We believe organic net sales growth provides useful information to investors because it reflects the underlying growth from the ongoing activities of our business. Furthermore, it provides investors with a view of our operations from management's perspective. We use organic net sales growth to monitor and evaluate performance, as it is an important measure of the underlying results of our operations. Management uses organic net sales growth together with GAAP measures such as net sales growth and operating income in its decision making processes related to the operations of our reporting segments and our overall company. We believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that management uses in evaluating operations. The discussion and analysis of organic net sales growth in Results of Operations below utilizes organic net sales growth as management does internally. Because organic net sales growth calculations may vary among other companies, organic net sales growth amounts presented below may not be comparable with similarly titled measures of other companies. Organic net sales growth is a non-GAAP financial measure that is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP measures. The primary limitation of this measure is that it excludes items that have an impact on our net sales. This limitation is best addressed by evaluating organic net sales growth in combination with our GAAP net sales. The tables presented in Results of Operations below provide reconciliations of organic net sales growth to net sales growth calculated under GAAP. 41 Table of Contents Results of Operations Consolidated and Combined Operations The following table sets forth certain items from our Consolidated and Combined Statements of Operations and the percentage of net sales that such items represent for the periods shown. Fiscal 2009 2008 2007 ($ in millions) Net sales $ 10,256 100.0 % $ 14,373 100.0 % $ 12,574 100.0 % Cost of sales 7,720 75.3 10,200 71.0 8,855 70.4 Gross income 2,536 24.7 4,173 29.0 3,719 29.6 Selling, general, and administrative expenses 1,408 13.7 1,573 10.9 1,509 12.0 Research, development, and engineering expenses 536 5.2 593 4.1 532 4.2 Pre-Separation litigation charges, net 144 1.4 22 0.2 887 7.1 Separation costs 44 0.3 Restructuring and other charges, net 375 3.7 219 1.5 92 0.7 Impairment of goodwill 3,547 34.6 103 0.7 Operating income (loss) (3,474 ) (33.9 ) 1,663 11.6 655 5.2 Interest income 17 0.2 32 0.2 53 0.4 Interest expense (165 ) (1.6 ) (190 ) (1.3 ) (232 ) (1.8 ) Other income (expense), net (48 ) (0.5 ) 567 3.9 (219 ) (1.7 ) Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interest (3,670 ) (35.8 ) 2,072 14.4 257 2.0 Income tax (expense) benefit 576 5.6 (540 ) (3.8 ) (465 ) (3.7 ) Income (loss) from continuing operations (3,100 ) (30.2 ) 1,527 10.6 (214 ) (1.7 ) Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of income taxes (156 ) (1.5 ) 255 1.8 (340 ) (2.7 ) Net income (loss) $ (3,256 ) (31.7 )% $ 1,782 12.4 % $ (554 ) (4.4 )% Net Sales. Net sales decreased $4,117 million, or 28.6%, to $10,256 million in fiscal 2009 from $14,373 million in fiscal 2008. In fiscal 2008, net sales increased $1,799 million, or 14.3%, to $14,373 million from $12,574 million in fiscal 2007. On an organic basis, net sales decreased $3,542 million, or 24.6%, in fiscal 2009, primarily as a result of declines in our Electronic Components, Specialty Products, and Network Solutions segments. Organic net sales increased $944 million, or 7.5%, in fiscal 2008 as a result of strong growth in our Undersea Telecommunications segment and sales in international markets. Foreign currency exchange rates, primarily the Euro, negatively impacted net sales by $482 million, or 3.4%, in fiscal 2009 and favorably impacted net sales by $823 million, or 6.5%, in fiscal 2008. Price erosion adversely affected net sales by $187 million in fiscal 2009, $187 million in fiscal 2008, and $197 million in fiscal 2007. See further discussion below under Results of Operations by Segment. The following table sets forth the percentage of our total net sales by geographic region: Fiscal 2009 2008 2007 Americas 37 % 34 % 33 % Europe/Middle East/Africa (EMEA) 34 38 38 Asia-Pacific 29 28 29 Total 100 % 100 % 100 % 42 Table of Contents The following table provides an analysis of the change in our net sales compared to the prior fiscal year by geographic region: Fiscal 2009 2008 Change in Net Sales versus Prior Fiscal Year Change in Net Sales versus Prior Fiscal Year Organic (1) Translation (2) Divestiture Total Organic (1) Translation (2) Divestiture Total ($ in millions) Americas (3) $ (892 ) (18.5 )% $ (59 ) $ (55 ) $ (1,006 ) (20.9 )% $ 611 15.0 % $ 65 $ 45 $ 721 17.7 % EMEA (1,581 ) (28.6 ) (403 ) (3 ) (1,987 ) (36.0 ) 116 2.4 583 699 14.5 Asia-Pacific (1,069 ) (26.3 ) (20 ) (35 ) (1,124 ) (27.7 ) 217 5.9 175 (13 ) 379 10.3 Total $ (3,542 ) (24.6 )% $ (482 ) $ (93 ) $ (4,117 ) (28.6 )% $ 944 7.5 % $ 823 $ 32 $ 1,799 14.3 % (1) Represents the change in net sales resulting from volume and price changes, before consideration of acquisitions, divestitures, and the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.

(2) Represents the change in net sales resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Gross Income. Gross income decreased $1,637 million in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 and gross income as a percentage of net sales decreased by 430 basis points in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008. The decrease was due to sales declines and unfavorable absorption of manufacturing costs associated with reduced production levels related to lower sales and our efforts to reduce inventory levels, partially offset by cost reductions from restructuring actions. 43 Table of Contents In fiscal 2008, gross income increased $454 million over fiscal 2007; however, gross income as a percentage of net sales decreased by 60 basis points. We were negatively impacted by lower volume growth in certain consumer related end markets in our Electronic Components segment and significant growth in our Undersea Telecommunications segment which has a margin below our Company average. Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general, and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 13.7% in fiscal 2009 as compared to 10.9% in fiscal 2008. In fiscal 2009, results included a net loss of approximately $50 million primarily associated with economic hedges of certain anticipated future transactions and resulting primarily from the devaluation of certain eastern European currencies. In fiscal 2008, selling, general, and administrative expenses included a $36 million gain on the sale of real estate related to our Electronic Components segment. Excluding these items, selling, general, and administrative expenses decreased in fiscal 2009 from fiscal 2008, but increased as a percentage of sales due to decreases in sales volume. Selling, general, and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were 10.9% and 12.0% in fiscal 2008 and 2007, respectively. As discussed above, in fiscal 2008, selling, general, and administrative expenses included a $36 million gain on the sale of real estate. Excluding this gain, selling, general, and administrative expenses were lower as a percentage of sales in fiscal 2008 due to sales volume leverage of our overhead structure. In 2007, selling, general, and administrative expenses included allocated overhead expenses from Tyco International of $152 million. Also, we incurred costs of $41 million in fiscal 2007 related to building separate company functions. A portion of these costs were duplicative in fiscal 2007 as we were also allocated costs related to these functions from Tyco International until the Separation date. Research, Development, and Engineering Expenses. Research, development, and engineering expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 5.2% in fiscal 2009 from 4.1% in fiscal 2008 and 4.2% in fiscal 2007. The increase as a percentage of net sales in fiscal 2009 was due to decreases in sales volume as well as our continued focus on future technologies within all four of our operating segments. Pre-Separation Litigation Charges, Net. In fiscal 2009, we recorded charges of $144 million related to pre-Separation securities litigation. During the first six months of fiscal 2009, we, Tyco International, and Covidien entered into definitive agreements to settle actions captioned Hess v. Tyco International Ltd., et al. and Sciallo v. Tyco International Ltd., et al . and opt-out cases brought by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts Pension Reserves Investment Management Board, Franklin Mutual Advisers, LLC and related plaintiffs, and the Public Employees' Retirement Association of Colorado. Pursuant to the sharing formula in the Separation and Distribution Agreement, we recorded charges of $28 million for which no tax benefit was available. Additionally, in the second quarter of fiscal 2009, we recorded reserves totaling $375 million representing the best estimate of probable loss for the remaining securities litigation claims subject to the Separation and Distribution Agreement, including remaining opt-out cases and cases arising under ERISA. As a result, we recorded a pre-tax charge in the first six months of fiscal 2009 of $116 million for our share of the reserves. Upon final settlement of the ERISA cases in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, we recorded a $25 million tax benefit. There were no tax benefits attributable for the other cases. During the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2009, we, Tyco International, and Covidien, settled the remaining opt-out cases for $201 million and eight consolidated class actions brought under ERISA against Tyco International and certain of our current and former employees, officers and directors for a total of $70 million. Pursuant to the sharing formula, our share of the settlement amounts was $85 million. As we had previously established reserves for these opt-out cases and consolidated actions during the second quarter of fiscal 2009, the settlements did not impact our Consolidated and Combined Statement of Operations. 44 Table of Contents In fiscal 2008, we recorded a net charge of $22 million related to pre-Separation securities litigation. A charge of $11 million, for which no tax benefit was available, was recorded in connection with Tyco International's settlement of previously disclosed securities litigation captioned Ballard v. Tyco International Ltd., et al. for $36 million. Also, in connection with Tyco International's settlement of securities litigation with the State of New Jersey for $73 million, we recorded a charge of $23 million, for which no tax benefit was available. These charges represent our share of the settlement costs in accordance with the sharing percentages included in the Separation and Distribution Agreement. Also, we recorded income of $12 million in fiscal 2008 related to Tyco International's recovery of certain costs from insurers. In fiscal 2007, we were allocated a charge from Tyco International of $922 million for the class action settlement, for which no tax benefit was available. In addition, in fiscal 2007, we were allocated $35 million of income relating to Tyco International's expected recovery of certain costs from insurers. See "Part I. Item 3. Legal Proceedings" and Note 15 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for additional information regarding the class action settlement and the settlement of pre-Separation securities litigation. Separation Costs. In connection with the Separation, we incurred costs of $44 million in fiscal 2007, primarily related to employee costs, including non-cash compensation expense of $11 million related to the modification of share option awards at Separation and $12 million related to the acceleration of restricted share award vesting as a result of Separation. See Note 23 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for further information on the conversion of Tyco International share option awards into Tyco Electronics share option awards. Restructuring and Other Charges, Net. Net restructuring and other charges were $375 million in fiscal 2009 as compared to $219 million in fiscal 2008. Total charges, including amounts reflected in cost of sales, increased $145 million to $373 million in fiscal 2009 from $228 million in fiscal 2008. Increases resulted primarily from new actions initiated in fiscal 2009 to reduce costs in response to market conditions and primarily related to headcount reductions and manufacturing site closures in the Electronic Components, Network Solutions, and Specialty Products segments. Fiscal 2009 charges included a long-lived asset impairment in our Network Solutions segment of $14 million primarily related to the divestiture of the Dulmison connectors and fittings product line within our energy business. As discussed above, subsequent to fiscal year end 2009, we signed an agreement with a third party to sell this product line. Fiscal 2008 charges included long-lived asset impairments in our Electronic Components segment of $34 million, consisting of $22 million related to the divestiture of our Battery Systems business and $12 million related to certain dedicated manufacturing lines serving the North American automotive market. In fiscal 2008, net restructuring and other charges were $219 million as compared to $92 million in fiscal 2007. Total charges, including amounts reflected in cost of sales, were $228 million and $97 million in fiscal 2008 and 2007, respectively. As discussed above, fiscal 2008 charges included long-lived asset impairments of $34 million. Additional increases in fiscal 2008 over fiscal 2007 resulted from our strategic priority to simplify our manufacturing footprint. During fiscal 2008 and 2007, we initiated restructuring actions primarily relating to the migration of product lines to lower-cost countries and the exit of certain manufacturing operations in the Electronic Components and Network Solutions segments. Restructuring charges recorded in both fiscal 2008 and 2007 primarily related to employee severance and benefits. See Note 4 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for additional information regarding net restructuring and other charges. Impairment of Goodwill. During fiscal 2009, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $3,435 million in our Electronic Components segment, of which $2,088 million and $1,347 million 45 Table of Contents related to the Automotive and Communications and Industrial Solutions reporting units, respectively. We also recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $112 million in our Specialty Products segment related to the Circuit Protection reporting unit. During fiscal 2008, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $103 million which related to the Global Application Tooling Division reporting unit of our Electronic Components segment. See Note 8 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for further information regarding the impairment of goodwill. Operating Income (Loss). Operating loss was $3,474 million in fiscal 2009 as compared to operating income of $1,663 million in fiscal 2008. Fiscal 2009 results included goodwill impairment charges, restructuring and other charges, and pre-Separation litigation charges of $3,547 million, $373 million, and $144 million, respectively. In addition, fiscal 2009 results included a net loss of approximately $50 million primarily associated with economic hedges of certain anticipated future transaction and resulting primarily from the devaluation of certain eastern European currencies. In fiscal 2008, operating income included restructuring and other charges of $228 million, goodwill impairment charges of $103 million, a gain on the sale of real estate of $36 million, and pre-Separation litigation charges of $22 million. Excluding these items, the decreases in operating income resulted from lower sales levels and unfavorable absorption of manufacturing costs associated with reduced production levels and the focus on reducing inventories, which were partially offset by cost reduction programs. Operating income was $1,663 million, or 11.6% of net sales, in fiscal 2008 as compared to $655 million, or 5.2% of net sales, in fiscal 2007. As discussed above, fiscal 2008 results included restructuring and other charges of $228 million, goodwill impairment charges of $103 million, a gain on the sale of real estate of $36 million, and pre-Separation litigation charges of $22 million. Fiscal 2007 results included $887 million of allocated pre-Separation litigation charges, $97 million of restructuring related and other charges, $44 million of separation costs, and $41 million of costs related to building separate company functions. Excluding these items, higher sales levels in fiscal 2008 drove the increases in operating income. The increase as a percentage of net sales resulted from increased operating margin in our Undersea Telecommunications segment, primarily due to sales volume leverage of our overhead structure.

Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008 In fiscal 2009 Electronic Components' net sales decreased $3,316 million, or 35.7%, to $5,961 million from $9,277 million in fiscal 2008. The weakening of certain foreign currencies negatively affected net sales by $287 million, or 3.1%, in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008. Organic net sales decreased by $2,936 million, or 31.7%, in fiscal 2009 primarily due to declines in volume in all of the end markets we serve. Electronic Components organic net sales decreased 33.1% in the automotive market in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008. The decrease was broad-based and resulted from declines of 36.8% in North America region, 36.9% in the EMEA region, and 25.6% in the Asia-Pacific region that were driven by reductions in production by automotive manufacturers as well as inventory reductions throughout the automotive supply chain. Our organic net sales decline of 35.9% in the computer 47 Table of Contents market in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 was attributable to general market weakness, inventory corrections in the supply chain, and reductions in market share related to our strategy to improve margins by exiting certain low-margin portions of this market. In the communications market, our organic net sales decline of 26.4% in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 was driven by declines of 25.9% and 27.4% in our sales of interconnect components to communication equipment manufacturers and mobile phone manufacturers, respectively. In the appliance market, our organic net sales decreased 29.1% in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 due to reduced consumer demand, weak housing starts, and retailer inventory reductions. In fiscal 2009, our organic net sales decreased 35.2% in the industrial market as compared to fiscal 2008 primarily as a result of reduced demand for factory automation and other industrial equipment due to declines in capital investments by our customers. Electronic Components had an operating loss of $3,716 million in fiscal 2009 as compared to income of $978 million in fiscal 2008. As discussed above, segment results included goodwill impairment charges of $3,435 million and $103 million in fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008, respectively. Also, segment results included a $36 million gain on the sale of real estate in fiscal 2008. Excluding these items, the remaining decrease in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 resulted from the sales decline and unfavorable absorption of manufacturing costs associated with reduced production levels and inventory reductions, partially offset by cost savings from restructuring actions. In addition, fiscal 2009 segment results were negatively impacted by an increase in restructuring and other charges of $80 million and a net foreign currency loss of approximately $50 million primarily associated with economic hedges of certain anticipated future transactions and resulting primarily from the devaluation of certain eastern European currencies. Fiscal 2008 Compared to Fiscal 2007 In fiscal 2008, Electronic Components' net sales increased $746 million, or 8.7%, to $9,277 million from $8,531 million in fiscal 2007. The strengthening of certain foreign currencies favorably affected net sales by $593 million, or 6.9%, in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007. Organic net sales growth of $121 million, or 1.4%, in fiscal 2008 resulted from increases in volume partially offset by price erosion. Electronic Components' organic net sales growth by industry end market was strongest in the industrial and communications markets in fiscal 2008. Our organic net sales growth of 18.5% in the industrial market in fiscal 2008 over fiscal 2007 was due to global demand for products in the solar market and investment in industrial equipment for emerging markets. In the communications market, our organic net sales growth of 12.0% in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 was primarily due to 30.3% growth in our sales of interconnect components to mobile phone manufacturers resulting from our strategic efforts to increase our market share as well as end market unit growth. In the automotive market, our organic net sales growth of 2.7% in fiscal 2008 over fiscal 2007 resulted from growth in the Asia-Pacific region of 12.4% and the EMEA region of 3.7% partially offset by a 16.1% decline in the North America region that was driven by continued reductions in production by automotive manufacturers. In the computer market, our organic net sales decline of 6.0% in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 resulted from a strategic decision to exit certain low-margin products, which negatively impacted net sales by approximately $57 million, and to be more selective in the new projects in which we participate. Electronic Components' operating income decreased $85 million, or 8.0%, to $978 million in fiscal 2008 from $1,063 million in fiscal 2007. In fiscal 2008, segment results included goodwill impairment charges of $103 million and a gain on the sale of real estate of $36 million. In addition, Electronic Components incurred $28 million of costs in fiscal 2007 that related to our Separation from Tyco International. Excluding these items, higher sales were partially offset by higher raw material costs as well as an increase in restructuring costs of $146 million in fiscal 2008 over fiscal 2007. 48 Table of Contents Network Solutions Fiscal 2009 2008 2007 ($ in millions) Net sales $ 1,719 $ 2,162 $ 1,897 Operating income $ 133 $ 251 $ 229 Operating margin 7.7 % 11.6 % 12.1 % The following table sets forth Network Solutions' percentage of total net sales by primary industry end market (1) : Fiscal 2009 2008 2007 Energy 47 % 45 % 44 % Service Providers 28 29 30 Enterprise Networks 24 25 25 Other 1 1 1 Total 100 % 100 % 100 % (1) Industry end market information about net sales is presented consistently with our internal management reporting and may be periodically revised as management deems necessary.

Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008 Network Solutions' net sales decreased $443 million, or 20.5%, to $1,719 million in fiscal 2009 from $2,162 million in fiscal 2008. The weakening of certain foreign currencies negatively affected net sales by $173 million, or 8.0%, in fiscal 2009 over fiscal 2008. Organic net sales decreased $270 million, or 12.5%, in fiscal 2009 over fiscal 2008. Our organic net sales decreased 9.0% in the energy industry end market in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 primarily due to declines in Europe. Sales in Europe were negatively impacted by slower investment levels by utilities and reduced customer inventory levels. In the service providers market, our organic net sales decrease of 12.3% in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 was largely 49 Table of Contents due to a general slowing of capital spending by telecommunications companies. Our organic sales in the enterprise networks market decreased 19.1% in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 as a result of global declines in commercial construction and delayed investment in network upgrades. Network Solutions' operating income decreased $118 million, or 47.0%, to $133 million in fiscal 2009 from $251 million in fiscal 2008. The decrease was the result of decreased sales, unfavorable absorption of manufacturing costs associated with reduced production levels and our targeted inventory reductions, and an increase in restructuring and other charges of $34 million in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008. Fiscal 2008 Compared to Fiscal 2007 Network Solutions' net sales increased $265 million, or 14.0%, to $2,162 million in fiscal 2008 from $1,897 million in fiscal 2007. The strengthening of certain foreign currencies favorably affected net sales by $148 million, or 7.9%, in fiscal 2008 over fiscal 2007. Organic net sales growth was $117 million, or 6.1%, in fiscal 2008 over fiscal 2007. On an organic basis, Network Solutions' net sales growth was strongest in the enterprise networks industry end market in fiscal 2008 over fiscal 2007 with growth of 10.6% attributable to strong global demand for faster, higher capacity, and more secure networks. In the energy market, our organic net sales growth of 6.0% in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 was attributable to solid growth in EMEA, Asia, and North America. In western Europe and North America, growth resulted from the upgrade of aging power grids and the demand for alternate energy sources. In emerging markets within Asia and eastern Europe, growth was due to the build-out of energy infrastructure. In the service providers market, our organic net sales growth of 3.5% in fiscal 2008 over fiscal 2007 reflects increased spending levels at certain U.S. telecommunications carriers that more than offset declines in EMEA. Network Solutions' operating income increased $22 million, or 9.6%, to $251 million in fiscal 2008 from $229 million in fiscal 2007. The operating income increase resulted from increases in volume and a decrease in restructuring costs of $14 million partially offset by a lower margin product mix and lower productivity levels in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007. In addition, Network Solutions incurred $5 million of costs in fiscal 2007 that related to our Separation from Tyco International.

Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008 In fiscal 2009, Specialty Products' net sales decreased $354 million, or 20.0%, to $1,415 million from $1,769 million in fiscal 2008. The weakening of certain foreign currencies negatively affected net sales by $22 million, or 1.2%, in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008. Organic net sales decreased $332 million, or 18.8%, in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008. Our organic net sales declined 14.0% in the aerospace, defense, and marine market in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 as a result of slowing demand for commercial aircraft and inventory corrections in the supply chain. In the touch systems market, our organic net sales decreased 23.7% in fiscal 2009 from fiscal 2008 due to global weakness in demand from the retail market. In the medical market, our organic net sales decrease of 8.6% in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 was due to inventory corrections in the supply chain and delayed capital spending by most healthcare providers. On an organic basis, our net sales decline of 32.1% in the circuit protection market in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 was due to reduced original equipment manufacturer production levels as well as significant inventory corrections in the supply chain. Specialty Products' operating results decreased $262 million to $34 million in fiscal 2009 from $296 million in fiscal 2008. As discussed above, segment results included a goodwill impairment charge of $112 million in fiscal 2009. The remaining decrease in operating results was due to lower sales, unfavorable absorption of manufacturing costs associated with reduced production levels and our targeted inventory reductions, and an increase in restructuring and other charges of $28 million in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008. Fiscal 2008 Compared to Fiscal 2007 In fiscal 2008, Specialty Products' net sales increased $188 million, or 11.9%, to $1,769 million from $1,581 million in fiscal 2007. The strengthening of certain foreign currencies favorably affected net sales by $81 million, or 5.2%, in fiscal 2008 over fiscal 2007. Organic net sales growth of $107 million, or 6.7%, in fiscal 2008 over fiscal 2007 primarily related to sales of products to the aerospace, defense, and marine and touch systems markets. In the aerospace, defense, and marine market, our organic net sales growth of 9.9% in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 was primarily attributable to strong demand in the commercial aviation 51 Table of Contents market and spending for certain defense programs. Our organic net sales in the touch systems market increased 8.5% in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 largely due to the growing use of touch screen interfaces in numerous markets, particularly in the retail, gaming, medical, and industrial markets. In the circuit protection market, our organic net sales growth slowed to 2.3% in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 as a result of slowing growth in demand in the lithium-ion battery market for much of fiscal 2008 and the supply chain inventory correction in this market in late fiscal 2008. In the medical market, our organic net sales increase of 1.0% in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 reflected higher demand in surgical and imaging applications that was largely offset by the exit of certain low margin business in patient monitoring applications. Specialty Products' operating results increased $38 million to $296 million in fiscal 2008 from $258 million in fiscal 2007. The operating income increase resulted from increases in volume and a higher margin product mix in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007. These increases were partially offset by an increase in research, development, and engineering of $16 million. In addition, Specialty Products incurred $8 million of costs in fiscal 2008 related to a customs settlement. In fiscal 2007, Specialty Products also incurred $7 million of costs that related to our Separation from Tyco International. Undersea Telecommunications Fiscal 2009 2008 2007 ($ in millions) Net sales $ 1,161 $ 1,165 $ 565 Operating income $ 219 $ 160 $ 36 Operating margin 18.9 % 13.7 % 6.4 % Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008 In fiscal 2009, Undersea Telecommunications' net sales decreased $4 million, or 0.3%, to $1,161 million from $1,165 million in fiscal 2008. Undersea Telecommunications' organic net sales decreased 0.4% in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 as revenue from existing and new projects offset the reduction caused by the completion, in fiscal 2008, of a transoceanic system that connects U.S. and China. In fiscal 2009, Undersea Telecommunications' operating income increased $59 million to $219 million from $160 million in fiscal 2008. The decrease in income from the transoceanic system and an increase in restructuring and other charges of $3 million were more than offset by income from existing and new projects and favorable project mix in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008. Fiscal 2008 Compared to Fiscal 2007 In fiscal 2008, Undersea Telecommunications' net sales increased $600 million, or 106.2%, to $1,165 million from $565 million in fiscal 2007. This growth was attributable to our execution of the construction of a transoceanic system that connects the U.S. and China, as well as several other projects, including large projects in Asia, Africa, North America, and Europe. In fiscal 2008, Undersea Telecommunications' operating income increased $124 million to $160 million from $36 million in fiscal 2007 as a result of increased volumes and improved operating leverage. Segment results included $1 million of costs in fiscal 2007 that related to our Separation from Tyco International. 52 Table of Contents Non-Operating Items Interest Expense, Net Net interest expense was $148 million in fiscal 2009 as compared to $158 million in fiscal 2008 and $179 million in fiscal 2007. The decrease of $10 million, or 6.3%, in fiscal 2009 from fiscal 2008 as well as the decrease of $21 million, or 11.7%, in fiscal 2008 from fiscal 2007 was driven by lower average debt levels resulting in lower interest expense partially offset by lower interest income. A portion of Tyco International's net interest expense was allocated to us through June 1, 2007. During fiscal 2007, we were allocated net interest expense of $130 million, which included the impact of Tyco International's interest rate swaps. Management believes the net interest expense allocation basis was reasonable; however, these amounts may not be indicative of the actual amounts that we would have incurred had we been operating as an independent, publicly-traded company for the period prior to Separation. Other Income (Expense), Net In fiscal 2009, we recorded net other expense of $48 million, consisting of $68 million of expense pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement with Tyco International and Covidien, a $22 million gain on the retirement of debt, and $2 million of unrealized losses on rabbi trust assets. The $68 million of expense is attributable to a net reduction of an indemnification asset primarily as a result of the settlement of various matters with the IRS. See Note 15 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for further information regarding the Tax Sharing Agreement. See Note 11 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for additional information regarding the gain on retirement of debt. In fiscal 2008, we recorded other income of $567 million, pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement with Tyco International and Covidien, of which $545 million related to certain incremental tax liabilities recorded in connection with the adoption of the uncertain tax position provisions of Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 740 (Income Taxes). See Note 18 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for additional information regarding the adoption of the uncertain tax position provisions of ASC 740. Net other expense of $219 million in fiscal 2007 includes an allocation from Tyco International of $232 million for loss on retirement of debt. See Note 11 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for additional information. Additionally, in fiscal 2007, we recorded other income of $13 million pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement with Tyco International and Covidien. Income Taxes Our operations are conducted through our various subsidiaries in a number of countries throughout the world. We have provided for income taxes based upon the tax laws and rates in the countries in which our operations are conducted and income and loss from operations is subject to taxation. In fiscal 2009, we changed our place of incorporation from Bermuda to Switzerland. We do not expect the change to materially impact our tax provision or cash tax burden. Our effective tax rate was 15.7% for fiscal 2009 and includes the effects of the $3,547 million pre-tax impairment of goodwill for which a partial tax benefit of $523 million was recorded, a $28 million charge related to the settlement of a tax matter, a $144 million pre-tax charge related to pre-Separation securities litigation for which a partial tax benefit of $25 million was recorded, and a $24 million detriment related to a $68 million pre-tax expense recognized pursuant to our Tax Sharing Agreement with Tyco International and Covidien. Additionally, the effective tax rate for fiscal 2009 reflects adjustments related to prior years tax returns, including a $49 million tax benefit. Our effective income tax rate was 26.1% for fiscal 2008 and includes a benefit of $198 million primarily related to the pre-tax income of $545 million recognized in connection with our adoption of the uncertain tax position provisions of ASC 740, for which no tax was provided. The effective tax rate 53 Table of Contents was also impacted by increased accruals in fiscal 2008 of interest related to uncertain tax positions partially offset by a $42 million benefit associated with a favorable settlement with a taxing authority for certain pre-Separation tax issues. In addition, the effective tax rate for fiscal 2008 reflects the benefits of increased profitability in operations in lower tax rate jurisdictions, a $33 million benefit related to adjustments to tax account balances, a $25 million increase in the valuation allowance related to restructuring charges, and a $22 million tax detriment recorded in connection with the goodwill impairment charge for which a tax benefit was not fully realized. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2007 includes the effects of the pre-tax charges recorded in connection with the allocated class action settlement and loss on retirement of debt for which no tax benefits were recorded. These impacts on the effective tax rate in fiscal 2007 were $312 million and $81 million, respectively. In addition, the fiscal 2007 effective tax rate reflects tax detriments related to increased borrowings in order to fund the class action settlement escrow and our Separation from Tyco International. The valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of $2,487 million and $873 million at fiscal year end 2009 and 2008, respectively, relates principally to the uncertainty of the utilization of certain deferred tax assets, primarily tax loss, capital loss, and credit carryforwards in various jurisdictions. We believe that we will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the tax benefits related to the remaining net deferred tax assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The valuation allowance was calculated in accordance with the provisions of ASC 740 which require that a valuation allowance be established or maintained when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. The calculation of our tax liabilities includes estimates for uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations across multiple global jurisdictions where we conduct our operations. Under the uncertain tax position provisions of ASC 740, we recognize liabilities for tax as well as related interest for issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and related interest will be due. These tax liabilities and related interest are reflected net of the impact of related tax loss carryforwards as such tax loss carryforwards will be applied against these tax liabilities and will reduce the amount of cash tax payments due upon the eventual settlement with the tax authorities. These estimates may change due to changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a settlement that differs from our current estimate of the tax liabilities and related interest. Further, management has reviewed with tax counsel the issues raised by certain taxing authorities and the adequacy of these recorded amounts. If our current estimate of tax and interest liabilities is less than the ultimate settlement, an additional charge to income tax expense may result. If our current estimate of tax and interest liabilities is more than the ultimate settlement, income tax benefits may be recognized. Substantially all of these tax liabilities and related interest are recorded in income taxes on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as payment is not expected within one year. We have provided income taxes for earnings that are currently distributed as well as the taxes associated with several subsidiaries' earnings that are expected to be distributed in fiscal 2010. No additional provision has been made for U.S. or non-U.S. income taxes on the undistributed earnings of subsidiaries or for unrecognized deferred tax liabilities for temporary differences related to basis differences in investments in subsidiaries, as such earnings are expected to be permanently reinvested, the investments are essentially permanent in duration, or we have concluded that no additional tax liability will arise as a result of the distribution of such earnings. As of September 25, 2009, certain subsidiaries had approximately $14 billion of undistributed earnings that we intend to permanently reinvest. A liability could arise if our intentions to permanently reinvest such earnings were to change and amounts are distributed by such subsidiaries or if such subsidiaries are ultimately disposed. It is not practicable to estimate the additional income taxes related to permanently reinvested earnings or the basis differences related to investments in subsidiaries. 54 Table of Contents Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations, Net of Income Taxes Loss from discontinued operations was $156 million in fiscal 2009 compared to income from discontinued operations of $255 million in fiscal 2008. In fiscal 2007, loss from discontinued operations was $340 million. During fiscal 2009, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our Wireless Systems business. In May 2009, we completed the sale for $664 million in net cash proceeds and recognized a pre-tax gain of $59 million on this transaction. Pre-tax loss from discontinued operations for fiscal 2009 included pre-tax charges of $111 million related to the Wireless Systems business's contract with the State of New York. See Note 15 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for additional information regarding the State of New York contract. The income tax provision on discontinued operations for fiscal 2009 included $68 million relating to the impact of $319 million of goodwill written off in connection with the divestiture of the Wireless Systems business, for which a tax benefit was not fully realized, as well as $35 million of adjustments to the estimated tax provision on the Power Systems business as a result of the finalization of the tax basis of assets sold upon the filing of the fiscal 2008 income tax returns. In September 2008, we completed the sale of the Radio Frequency Components and Subsystem business for net cash proceeds of $427 million and recorded a $184 million pre-tax gain on the sale. In September 2008, we also completed the sale of the Automotive Radar Sensors business for net cash proceeds of $42 million and recorded a $31 million pre-tax gain on the sale. In fiscal 2009, we recorded an additional pre-tax gain on sale of $4 million in connection with the finalization of working capital adjustments relating to the sale of the Radio Frequency Components and Subsystem and Automotive Radar Sensors businesses. The total pre-tax gain on the sale of the Radio Frequency Components and Subsystem and Automotive Radar Sensors businesses was $187 million and $32 million, respectively. Also during fiscal 2009, we received additional cash proceeds related to working capital of $29 million in connection with the fiscal 2008 sale of the Radio Frequency Components and Subsystem and Automotive Radar Sensors businesses. During fiscal 2008, we completed the sale of our Power Systems business for $102 million in net cash proceeds and recorded a $51 million pre-tax gain on the sale. During fiscal 2007, the divestiture of our Power Systems business was authorized, and in connection with the approval, we recorded a $585 million pre-tax impairment charge. Also, in fiscal 2007, we completed the sale of the Printed Circuit Group business for $227 million in net cash proceeds and recorded a $45 million pre-tax gain on the sale. See Note 5 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for additional information regarding discontinued operations. Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table summarizes our cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities, as reflected on the Consolidated and Combined Statements of Cash Flows, for fiscal 2009, 2008, and 2007: Fiscal 2009 2008 2007 (in millions) Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ 1,329 $ 989 $ 1,525 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities 391 895 (1,528 ) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities (1,254 ) (1,739 ) 431 Effect of currency translation on cash (31 ) 1 46 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 435 $ 146 $ 474 55 Table of Contents Our ability to fund our future capital needs will be affected by our ability to continue to generate cash from operations and our ability to access the capital markets, money markets, or other sources of financing, as well as the capacity and terms of our financing arrangements. We believe that cash generated from operations and, to the extent necessary, these other sources of potential funding are sufficient to meet our anticipated capital needs for the foreseeable future. Also, we may use excess capital to reduce our outstanding debt levels, including the possible repurchase of our public debt in accordance with applicable law, and purchase a portion of our outstanding common shares pursuant to our authorized share repurchase program. Current economic conditions have negatively impacted cash generated from operations; however, we continue to believe that actions taken by management to reduce costs and working capital, along with other sources of liquidity, will enable us to meet our future capital needs. There can be no assurance, however, that the cost or availability of future financing will not be impacted by continued financial market instability. We will continue to monitor financial markets, to respond as necessary to changing conditions. Cash Flows from Operating Activities The following table summarizes the sources and uses of our cash flows from operating activities for fiscal 2009, 2008, and 2007: Fiscal 2009 2008 2007 (in millions) Operating income (loss) $ (3,474 ) $ 1,663 $ 655 Impairment of goodwill 3,547 103 Class action settlement (936 ) 887 Non-cash restructuring and other charges, net 49 81 23 Depreciation and amortization 515 539 496 Deferred income taxes (583 ) 164 144 Provisions for losses on accounts receivable and inventory 74 42 74 Other, net 67 37 (18 ) Income tax advance payment (163 ) Changes in assets and liabilities, net: Accounts receivable, net 651 (107 ) (97 ) Inventories 638 (221 ) (76 ) Accounts payable (420 ) 41 79 Other (114 ) 214 87 Interest income 17 32 53 Interest expense (165 ) (190 ) (232 ) Income tax (expense) benefit 576 (540 ) (465 ) Net cash provided by (used in) continuing operating activities 1,378 922 1,447 Net cash provided by (used in) discontinued operating activities (49 ) 67 78 Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ 1,329 $ 989 $ 1,525 Net cash provided by continuing operating activities was $1,378 million in fiscal 2009 as compared to $922 million in fiscal 2008 and $1,447 million in fiscal 2007. The finalization of the class action settlement in February 2008 negatively impacted cash flows from operating activities during 2008. It resulted in a decrease to cash flows from operating activities and an increase to cash flows from investing activities of $936 million. It did not affect the cash balance on the Consolidated Balance Sheet because we had fully funded our portion of the class action settlement into an escrow account intended to be used to settle the liability during fiscal 2007. Related net class action settlement costs of $887 million were recognized in fiscal 2007. 56 Table of Contents Excluding the class action settlement, net cash provided by continuing operating activities was lower in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 primarily due to lower income levels partially offset by working capital improvements. Inventory levels decreased in the current year, with days on hand decreasing from 78 at fiscal year end 2008 to 68 at fiscal year end 2009. The amount of pension and postretirement benefit contributions reflected in fiscal 2009, 2008, and 2007, were $145 million, $77 million, and $71 million, respectively. These amounts included voluntary pension contributions of $61 million in fiscal 2009. We expect pension contributions to be $85 million in fiscal 2010, before consideration of voluntary contributions. The amount of income taxes paid, net of refunds, during fiscal 2009, 2008, and 2007, was $121 million, $359 million, $446 million, respectively. The decrease in fiscal 2009 reflects lower taxable earnings levels. The amount of income taxes paid, net of refunds, during fiscal 2007 included a $163 million advance payment to the IRS for pre-Separation tax liabilities. Cash Flows from Investing Activities The following table summarizes the sources and uses of our cash flows from investing activities for fiscal 2009, 2008, and 2007: Fiscal 2009 2008 2007 (in millions) Capital expenditures $ (328 ) $ (610 ) $ (863 ) Proceeds from sale of property, plant, and equipment 13 42 41 Class action settlement escrow 936 (928 ) Proceeds from divestiture of discontinued operations, net of cash retained by operations sold 693 571 227 Proceeds from divestiture of businesses, net of cash retained by businesses sold 17 Other (1 ) (29 ) (3 ) Net cash provided by (used in) continuing investing activities 394 910 (1,526 ) Net cash provided by (used in) discontinued investing activities (3 ) (15 ) (2 ) Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities $ 391 $ 895 $ (1,528 ) We continue to fund capital expenditures to support new programs and to invest in machinery and our manufacturing facilities to further enhance productivity and manufacturing capabilities. Capital spending decreased $282 million in fiscal 2009 to $328 million as compared to $610 million in fiscal 2008. We expect fiscal 2010 capital spending levels to be approximately $425 million. During fiscal 2007, we exercised our option to buy five cable-laying sea vessels that were previously leased to us and used by the Undersea Telecommunications segment at a cost of $280 million, which was reflected as a capital expenditure. In fiscal 2009, we received net cash proceeds of $664 million related to the sale of our Wireless Systems business. Also, in fiscal 2009, we received additional cash proceeds related to working capital of $29 million in connection with the sale of the Radio Frequency Components and Subsystems and Automotive Radar Sensors businesses which occurred in fiscal 2008 and $17 million primarily related to the divestiture of the Battery Systems business. In fiscal 2008, we received net cash proceeds of $102 million, $427 million, and $42 million related to the sale of the Power Systems, Radio Frequency Components and Subsystem, and Automotive Radar Sensors businesses, respectively. In fiscal 2007, we received $227 million in net cash proceeds related to the sale of the Printed Circuit Group business. 57 Table of Contents As discussed above, during fiscal 2007, we funded our portion of the class action settlement escrow for $928 million. The finalization of the class action settlement in fiscal 2008 resulted in an increase to cash flows from investing activities of $936 million, but did not affect the cash balance on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Cash Flows from Financing Activities and Capitalization The following table summarizes the sources and uses of our cash flows from financing activities for fiscal 2009, 2008, and 2007: Fiscal 2009 2008 2007 (in millions) Net (decrease) increase in commercial paper $ (649 ) $ 630 $ Proceeds from long-term debt 448 900 5,676 Repayment of long-term debt (602 ) (1,751 ) (2,455 ) Allocated debt activity (3,743 ) Net transactions with former parent 1,112 Repurchase of common shares (152 ) (1,242 ) Payment of common share dividends and cash distributions to shareholders (294 ) (271 ) Other (61 ) 47 (86 ) Net cash provided by (used in) continuing financing activities (1,310 ) (1,687 ) 504 Net cash provided by (used in) discontinued financing activities 56 (52 ) (73 ) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities $ (1,254 ) $ (1,739 ) $ 431 Total debt at fiscal year end 2009 and 2008 was $2,417 million and $3,181 million, respectively. See Note 11 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for additional information regarding debt. During June 2009, Tyco Electronics Group S.A. ("TEGSA"), our wholly-owned subsidiary, commenced a tender offer to purchase up to $150 million principal amount of its 6.00% senior notes due 2012, up to $100 million principal amount of its 6.55% senior notes due 2017, and up to $100 million principal amount of its 7.125% senior notes due 2037. On July 7, 2009, the tender offer expired and on July 9, 2009, TEGSA purchased and cancelled $86 million principal amount of its 6.00% senior notes due 2012, $42 million principal amount of its 6.55% senior notes due 2017, and $23 million principal amount of its 7.125% senior notes due 2037 for an aggregate payment of $141 million, plus paid accrued interest through July 7, 2009 of $3 million to the sellers of the notes. As a result of the transaction, in fiscal 2009, we recorded a pre-tax gain of $22 million, which is included in other income, including the write-off of unamortized discounts and fees of $1 million and the recognition of a gain of $12 million associated with terminated interest rate swaps previously designated as fair value hedges. Additionally, as a result of the re-purchase and cancellation, unamortized losses in accumulated other comprehensive income of $3 million related to terminated starting forward interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges were recognized as interest expense. In April 2007, TEGSA entered into a five-year unsecured senior revolving credit facility ("Credit Facility"). In fiscal 2009, $75 million of the commitment was assigned by Lehman Brothers Bank, FSB to TEGSA, reducing the total effective commitment to $1,425 million. Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest, at TEGSA's option, at a base rate or the London interbank offered rate plus a margin dependent on TEGSA's credit ratings and the amount drawn under the facility. TEGSA is required to pay an annual facility fee ranging from 4.5 to 12.5 basis points depending on its credit ratings. As of fiscal year end 2009 and 2008, TEGSA had no borrowings under the Credit Facility. Borrowings under the commercial paper program are backed by the Credit Facility. 58 Table of Contents As of fiscal year end 2008, TEGSA had $647 million of commercial paper outstanding at an average interest rate of 4.01%. We have repaid and suspended our borrowings under the commercial paper program as a result of unfavorable market conditions in fiscal 2009. Our Credit Facility contains a financial ratio covenant providing that if our ratio of Consolidated Total Debt (as defined in the Credit Facility) to Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Facility) for the then most recently concluded period of four consecutive fiscal quarters exceeds 3.5 to 1.0, an Event of Default (as defined in the Credit Facility) is triggered under the Credit Facility. The Credit Facility and our other debt agreements contain other customary covenants. None of our covenants are presently considered restrictive to our operations. As of September 25, 2009, we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants and believe that we will continue to be in compliance with our existing covenants for the foreseeable future. TEGSA's payment obligations under its senior notes, Credit Facility, commercial paper, and profit sharing notes issued by a subsidiary are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Tyco Electronics Ltd. Payments of common share dividends and cash distributions to shareholders were $294 million and $271 million in fiscal 2009 and 2008, respectively. In October 2009, our shareholders approved a cash distribution to shareholders in the form of a capital reduction to the par value of our common shares of CHF 0.17 per share for each of the first and second quarters of fiscal 2010. This capital reduction will reduce the par value of our common shares from CHF 2.43 (equivalent to $2.24) to CHF 2.09 (equivalent to $1.92). The distribution will be paid in U.S. Dollars at a rate of $0.16 per share for each of the first and second quarters of fiscal 2010. Future distributions or dividends on our common shares, if any, must be approved by our shareholders. In exercising their discretion to recommend to the shareholders that such distributions or dividends be approved, our board of directors will consider our results of operations, cash requirements and surplus, financial condition, statutory requirements of applicable law, contractual restrictions, and other factors that they may deem relevant. During fiscal 2009, we purchased approximately 6 million of our common shares for $125 million under our share repurchase program. Also, during fiscal 2009, we settled purchases of $27 million of our common shares which occurred prior to the end of fiscal 2008. In fiscal 2008, we repurchased approximately 37 million common shares for $1,269 million under this program, of which $1,242 million was paid as of September 26, 2008. No common shares were repurchased under this program in fiscal 2007. Since inception of the share repurchase program, which has a current authorization of $2,000 million, we have purchased approximately 43 million shares for $1,394 million. 59 Table of Contents Commitments and Contingencies The following table provides a summary of our contractual obligations and commitments for debt, minimum lease payments obligations under non-cancelable leases, and other obligations at fiscal year end 2009. Payments due by fiscal year Total 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 There- after (in millions) Debt (1) $ 2,417 $ 101 $ 7 $ 1 $ 786 $ 301 $ 1,221 Operating leases 406 108 76 56 37 32 97 Purchase obligations (2) 76 71 4 1 Total contractual cash obligations (3) (4) (5) $ 2,899 $ 280 $ 87 $ 58 $ 823 $ 333 $ 1,318 (1) Excludes interest. (2) Purchase obligations consist of commitments for purchases of goods and services. (3) The table above does not reflect unrecognized tax benefits of $1,799 million and related accrued interest and penalties of $1,215 million, the timing of which is uncertain. See Note 18 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for additional information regarding unrecognized tax benefits, interest, and penalties. (4) The table above does not reflect pension and postretirement benefit obligations to certain employees and former employees. We are obligated to make contributions to our pension plans and postretirement benefit plans; however, we are unable to determine the amount of plan contributions due to the inherent uncertainties of obligations of this type, including timing, interest rate charges, investment performance, and amounts of benefit payments. We expect to contribute $85 million to pension and postretirement benefit plans in fiscal 2010, before consideration of voluntary contributions. These plans and our estimates of future contributions and benefit payments are more fully described in Note 14 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements. (5) Other long-term liabilities of $634 million, of which $339 million related to our ASC 460 (Guarantees) liability, are excluded from the table above as we are unable to estimate the timing of payment for these items. See Note 12 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for more information regarding ASC 460. Income Tax Matters In connection with the Separation, we entered into a Tax Sharing Agreement that generally governs Covidien's, Tyco Electronics', and Tyco International's respective rights, responsibilities, and obligations after the distribution with respect to taxes, including ordinary course of business taxes and taxes, if any, incurred as a result of any failure of the distribution of all of the shares of Covidien or Tyco Electronics to qualify as a tax-free distribution for U.S. federal income tax purposes within the meaning of Section 355 of the Code or certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the spin-offs to qualify for tax-favored treatment under the Code. Pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement and Tax Sharing Agreement, upon Separation, we entered into certain guarantee commitments and indemnifications with Tyco International and Covidien. Under these agreements, principally the Tax Sharing Agreement, Tyco International, Covidien, and Tyco Electronics share 27%, 42%, and 31%, respectively, of certain contingent liabilities relating to unresolved pre-Separation tax matters of Tyco International. The effect of the Tax Sharing Agreement is to indemnify us for 69% of certain liabilities settled in cash by Tyco Electronics with respect to unresolved pre-Separation tax matters. Pursuant to that indemnification, we have made similar indemnifications to Tyco International and Covidien with respect to 31% of certain liabilities settled in cash by the companies with respect to unresolved pre-Separation tax matters. If any of the companies responsible for all or a portion of such liabilities were to default in its payment of costs or expenses related to any such liability, we would be responsible for a portion of the defaulting party or parties' obligation. 60 Table of Contents Prior to Separation, certain of our subsidiaries filed combined tax returns with Tyco International. Those and other of our income tax returns are periodically examined by various tax authorities. In connection with these examinations, tax authorities, including the IRS, have raised issues and proposed tax adjustments. Tyco International, as the U.S. income tax audit controlling party under the Tax Sharing Agreement, is reviewing and contesting certain of the proposed tax adjustments. Amounts related to these tax adjustments and other tax contingencies and related interest that management has assessed under the uncertain tax position provisions of ASC 740, which relate specifically to Tyco Electronics entities, have been recorded on the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements. In addition, we may be required to fund portions of Covidien and Tyco International's tax obligations. Estimates about these guarantees have also been recognized on the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements. See Note 12 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for additional information. In prior years, in connection with the IRS audit of various fiscal years, Tyco International submitted to the IRS proposed adjustments to these prior period U.S. federal income tax returns resulting in a reduction in the taxable income previously filed. The IRS accepted substantially all of the proposed adjustments for fiscal 1997 through 2000 for which the IRS had completed its field work. On the basis of previously accepted amendments, we have determined that acceptance of adjustments presented for additional periods through fiscal 2005 is probable and, accordingly, have recorded them, as well as the impacts of the adjustments accepted by the IRS, on the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements. Tyco International continues to complete proposed adjustments to the remainder of its U.S. federal income tax returns. In fiscal 2009, certain proposed adjustments to U.S. federal income tax returns were completed by Tyco International and in connection with these adjustments, we recorded a $97 million increase in income tax liabilities, a $10 million increase in deferred tax assets, a $60 million increase in the receivable from Tyco International and Covidien in connection with the Tax Sharing Agreement, and a $27 million charge to contributed surplus. In fiscal 2008, certain proposed adjustments to U.S. federal income tax returns were completed by Tyco International and presented to the IRS. As a result, in fiscal 2008, we recorded a $225 million decrease in income tax liabilities, a $42 million decrease in deferred tax assets, a $140 million decrease in the receivable from Tyco International and Covidien in connection with the Tax Sharing Agreement, a $57 million increase in the indemnification liability to Tyco International and Covidien, and a $14 million charge to contributed surplus. See Note 12 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for additional information regarding the indemnification liability to Tyco International and Covidien. In fiscal 2008, Tyco International, Covidien, and we completed and filed certain fiscal 2007 U.S. consolidated federal and state income tax returns which included a combination of Tyco International, Covidien, and our subsidiaries. As a result, we recorded a $66 million decrease in income tax liabilities with a corresponding offset to the income tax receivable, a $44 million decrease in the receivable from Tyco International and Covidien and a $42 million decrease in the payable to Tyco International and Covidien pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement, a $30 million increase in contributed surplus, and a $32 million net adjustment to other related tax accounts. As our tax return positions continue to be updated for periods prior to Separation, additional adjustments may be identified and recorded on the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements. While the final adjustments cannot be determined until the income tax return amendment process is completed, we believe that any resulting adjustments will not have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. Additionally, adjustments may be recorded to shareholders' equity in the future for the impact of filing final or amended income tax returns in certain jurisdictions where those returns include a combination of Tyco International, Covidien, and/or our subsidiaries for the periods prior to the Separation. 61 Table of Contents During fiscal 2007, the IRS concluded its field examination of certain of Tyco International's U.S. federal income tax returns for the years 1997 through 2000 and issued anticipated Revenue Agent Reports which reflect the IRS' determination of proposed tax adjustments for the periods under audit. Tyco International has agreed with the IRS on adjustments totaling $498 million, with an estimated cash impact of $458 million which was paid by Tyco International during fiscal 2007. Our portion of this payment was $163 million. It is our understanding that Tyco International has appealed other proposed adjustments totaling approximately $1 billion and is vigorously defending its prior filed tax return positions. Additionally, the IRS proposed civil fraud penalties against Tyco International arising from alleged actions of former executives in connection with certain intercompany transfers of stock in 1998 and 1999. Any penalty imposed would be subject to sharing with Tyco International and Covidien under the Tax Sharing Agreement. It is our understanding that Tyco International is vigorously opposing the assertion of any such penalties. It is our understanding that Tyco International has made progress during fiscal 2009 towards resolving several of the disputed tax issues for the years 1997 through 2000 and it could reach agreement with the IRS on these matters within the next twelve months. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, Tyco International settled a matter with the IRS concerning certain tax deductions claimed on Tyco International's income tax returns for the years 2001 through 2004. As a result of this settlement, we recorded a $28 million income tax charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 to reflect the disallowance of a portion of these deductions. The IRS continues to audit certain Tyco International income tax returns for the years 2001 through 2004. We continue to believe that the amounts recorded on our Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements relating to the matters discussed above are appropriate. However, the ultimate resolution is uncertain and could result in a material impact to our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. Legal Matters In the ordinary course of business, we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims, including patent infringement claims, antitrust claims, product liability matters, environmental matters, employment disputes, disputes on agreements, and other commercial disputes. Management believes that these legal proceedings and claims likely will be resolved over an extended period of time. Although it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these proceedings, based upon our experience, current information, and applicable law, we do not expect that these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. However, one or more of the proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows in a future period. See "Part I. Item 3. Legal Proceedings" and Note 15 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for further information regarding legal proceedings. As previously reported, prior to the Separation Tyco International and certain of its former directors and officers were named as defendants in over 40 purported securities class action lawsuits, including ERISA-related litigation. As a part of the Separation and Distribution Agreement, any existing or potential liabilities related to the securities actions were allocated among Tyco International, Covidien, and us. We are responsible for 31% of potential liabilities that may arise upon the resolution of the remaining pending litigation. If Tyco International or Covidien were to default on their obligation to pay their allocated share of these liabilities, however, we would be required to pay additional amounts. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Separation and Distribution Agreement, Tyco International manages and controls all the legal matters related to the shared contingent liabilities, including the defense or settlement thereof, subject to certain limitations. The liability sharing provisions regarding these securities actions are set forth in the Separation and Distribution Agreement among Tyco International, Covidien, and us. 62 Table of Contents Class Action Settlement As previously reported, Tyco International settled 32 of the purported securities class action lawsuits arising from the actions alleged to have been taken by its prior management. All legal contingencies that could have affected the final order approving the settlement expired on February 21, 2008. The settlement did not resolve all securities cases. Additional settlements of remaining securities actions have been reached subsequently as discussed below. As of the opt-out deadline for the settlement, Tyco International received opt-out notices from individuals and entities totaling approximately 4% of the shares owned by class members. A number of these individuals and entities filed actions separately against Tyco International and/or Tyco International, Covidien, and us, all of which have been settled subsequently as discussed below. See "Part I. Item 3. Legal Proceedings" and Note 15 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for additional information about these proceedings. In fiscal 2007, we were allocated a charge from Tyco International of $922 million for the class action settlement, for which no tax benefit was available. In addition, in fiscal 2007, we were allocated $35 million of income relating to Tyco International's expected recovery of certain costs from insurers. The net charge of $887 million was recorded on the Consolidated and Combined Statement of Operations as pre-Separation litigation charges, net. The portion allocated to us was consistent with the sharing percentage included in the Separation and Distribution Agreement. Tyco International placed funds in escrow for the benefit of the class. The escrow account earned interest that was payable to the class. In addition, interest was accrued on the class action settlement liability. The finalization of the class action settlement in February 2008 resulted in the extinguishment of our class action settlement liability of $3,020 million, interest in the escrow of $936 million, and class action settlement receivable of $2,084 million from the Consolidated Balance Sheet in fiscal 2008. The finalization of the settlement resulted in a decrease to cash flows from operating activities and an increase to cash flows from investing activities during fiscal 2008. It did not affect the cash balance on the Consolidated Balance Sheet because we had previously fully funded our portion of the class action settlement into an escrow account intended to be used to settle the liability, as mentioned above. Settlement of Securities Proceedings Not Covered by the Class Action Settlement In fiscal 2008, Tyco International settled securities litigation captioned New Jersey v. Tyco International Ltd., et al. and Ballard v. Tyco International Ltd., et al. for $73 million and $36 million, respectively. Pursuant to the sharing formula in the Separation and Distribution Agreement, we recorded charges of $34 million, for which no tax benefit was available, in fiscal 2008. In addition, we recorded income of $12 million in fiscal 2008 related to Tyco International's recovery of certain costs from insurers. During the first quarter of fiscal 2009, we, Tyco International, and Covidien entered into definitive agreements to settle actions captioned Hess v. Tyco International Ltd., et al. and Sciallo v. Tyco International Ltd., et al. and an opt-out case brought by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts Pension Reserves Investment Management Board. Pursuant to the sharing formula in the Separation and Distribution Agreement, we recorded charges of $9 million, for which no tax benefit was available. During the second quarter of fiscal 2009, we, Tyco International, and Covidien settled opt-out cases with Franklin Mutual Advisers, LLC and related plaintiffs and the Public Employees' Retirement Association of Colorado. Pursuant to the sharing formula, we recorded charges of $19 million, for which no tax benefit was available. Additionally, we recorded reserves totaling $375 million representing the best estimate of probable loss for the remaining securities litigation claims subject to the Separation and Distribution Agreement, including remaining opt-out cases and cases arising under ERISA. As a result, we recorded a pre-tax charge in the second quarter of fiscal 2009 of $116 million 63 Table of Contents for our share of the reserves. Upon final settlement of the ERISA cases in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, we recorded a $25 million tax benefit. There were no tax benefits attributable for the other cases. During the third quarter of fiscal 2009, we, Tyco International, and Covidien settled five of the remaining opt-out cases for $199 million. Pursuant to the sharing formula, our share of the settlement amounts was $62 million. As we had previously established reserves for these opt-out cases during the second quarter of fiscal 2009, the settlements did not impact our Consolidated and Combined Statement of Operations. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, we, Tyco International, and Covidien settled for a total of $70 million eight consolidated class actions brought under ERISA against Tyco International and certain of its current and former employees, officers and directors. Pursuant to the sharing formula, our share of the settlement amount was $22 million. Also, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, we, Tyco International, and Covidien agreed to settle the remaining opt-out case for $2 million. Pursuant to the sharing formula, our share of the settlement amount was $1 million. As we had previously established reserves for these consolidated actions and this opt-out case during the second quarter of fiscal 2009, the settlements did not impact our Consolidated and Combined Statement of Operations. Only three of the securities cases remain outstanding. Matters Related to Our Former Wireless Systems Business Certain liabilities and contingencies related to our former Wireless Systems business were retained by us when this business was sold in the third quarter of fiscal 2009. These include certain retained liabilities related to the State of New York contract and a contingent purchase price commitment related to the acquisition of Com-Net by the Wireless Systems business in 2001. See additional information below. Also, see Note 5 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for additional information regarding the divestiture of the Wireless Systems business. State of New York Contract On September 19, 2005, we were awarded a twenty-year lease contract with the State of New York to construct, operate, and maintain a statewide wireless communications network for use by state and municipal first responders. On August 29, 2008, we were served by the State with a default notice related to the first regional network, pursuant to the contract. Under the terms of the contract, we had 45 days to rectify the purported deficiencies noted by the State. On October 16, 2008, we informed the State that all technical deficiencies had been remediated and the system was operating in accordance with the contract specifications and certified the system ready for testing. The State conducted further testing during November and December 2008. On January 15, 2009, the State notified us that, in the State's opinion, we had not fully remediated the issues cited by the State and it had determined that we were in default of the contract and that it had exercised its right to terminate the contract. The State contends that it has the right under the contract to recoup costs incurred by the State in conjunction with the implementation of the network, and as a result of this contention, on January 16, 2009, the State drew down $50 million against an irrevocable standby letter of credit funded by us. The State has the ability to draw up to an additional $50 million against the standby letter of credit, although we dispute that the State has any basis to do so. On February 13, 2009, we filed a claim in the New York Court of Claims, seeking over $100 million in damages, and alleging a number of causes of action, including breach of contract, unjust enrichment, defamation, conversion, breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, the imposition of a constructive trust, and seeking a declaration that the State terminated the contract "for convenience." On September 25, 2009, the Court granted the State's motion to dismiss all counts of the complaint, with the exception of the breach of contract claims. On November 16, 2009, the State filed an answer to the complaint and counterclaim. The counterclaim asserts a claim for breach of contract 64 Table of Contents and alleges that the State has incurred damages in excess of $275 million. We believe that the counterclaim is without merit and intend to vigorously pursue our claims in this matter. The parties are now proceeding with discovery. As a result of these actions, in the first quarter of fiscal 2009, we recorded pre-tax charges totaling $111 million associated with this contract. These charges are reflected in income (loss) from discontinued operations on the Consolidated and Combined Statement of Operations as a result of our sale of the Wireless Systems business. See Note 5 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for further discussion of discontinued operations and the sale of the Wireless Systems business. The charges included an impairment charge of $61 million to write-off all costs incurred in constructing the network as well as a charge equal to the amount drawn by the State against the standby letter of credit of $50 million. The assets related to the impairment charge were previously reflected primarily as inventory on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. We have not recognized any revenue related to the lease contract. Com-Net At September 25, 2009, we had a contingent purchase price commitment of $80 million related to our fiscal 2001 acquisition of Com-Net. This represents the maximum amount payable to the former shareholders of Com-Net only after the construction and installation of a communications system for the State of Florida is finished and the State of Florida has approved the system based on the guidelines set forth in the contract. Under the terms of the purchase and sale agreement, we do not believe we have any obligation to the sellers. However, the sellers have contested our position and initiated a lawsuit in June 2006 in the Court of Common Pleas in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, which is in the motion pleading and discovery phase. A liability for this contingency has not been recorded on the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements as we do not believe that any payment is probable or estimable at this time. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Certain of our segments have guaranteed the performance of third parties and provided financial guarantees for uncompleted work and financial commitments. The terms of these guarantees vary with end dates ranging from fiscal 2010 through the completion of such transactions. The guarantees would be triggered in the event of nonperformance, and the potential exposure for nonperformance under the guarantees would not have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. In disposing of assets or businesses, we often provide representations, warranties, and/or indemnities to cover various risks including unknown damage to the assets, environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate, liability for investigation and remediation of environmental contamination at waste disposal sites and manufacturing facilities, and unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to disposition. We do not have the ability to estimate the potential liability from such indemnities because they relate to unknown conditions. However, we have no reason to believe that these uncertainties would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. As of September 25, 2009, we had outstanding letters of credit and letters of guarantee in the amount of $395 million, of which $50 million was related to our contract with the State of New York. See Note 15 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for additional information regarding the State of New York contract. We have recorded liabilities for known indemnifications included as part of environmental liabilities. See Note 15 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for a discussion of these liabilities. 65 Table of Contents In the normal course of business, we are liable for contract completion and product performance. In the opinion of management, except for the charges related to the contract with the State of New York discussed below, such obligations will not significantly affect our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. As disclosed in Note 15 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements, in January 2009, the State of New York drew down $50 million against an irrevocable standby letter of credit funded by us. As a result, we recorded a pre-tax charge equal to the draw. The State has the ability to draw up to an additional $50 million against the standby letter of credit which could result in additional charges and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. Pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement and Tax Sharing Agreement, upon Separation, we entered into certain guarantee commitments and indemnifications with Tyco International and Covidien. Under these agreements, principally the Tax Sharing Agreement, Tyco International, Covidien, and Tyco Electronics share 27%, 42%, and 31%, respectively, of certain contingent liabilities relating to unresolved pre-Separation tax matters of Tyco International. The effect of the Tax Sharing Agreement is to indemnify us for 69% of certain liabilities settled in cash by us with respect to unresolved pre-Separation tax matters. Pursuant to that indemnification, we have made similar indemnifications to Tyco International and Covidien with respect to 31% of certain liabilities settled in cash by the companies with respect to unresolved pre-Separation tax matters. If any of the companies responsible for all or a portion of such liabilities were to default in its payment of costs or expenses related to any such liability, we would be responsible for a portion of the defaulting party or parties' obligation. These arrangements have been valued upon our separation from Tyco International in accordance with ASC 460 and, accordingly, liabilities amounting to $339 million were recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at September 25, 2009. See Notes 12 and 15 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for additional information. We generally record estimated product warranty costs at the time of sale. See Note 12 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for further information regarding estimated product warranty. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses. Our significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 2 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements. The following noted accounting policies are based on, among other things, judgments and assumptions made by management that include inherent risks and uncertainties. Management's estimates are based on the relevant information available at the end of each period. Revenue Recognition Our revenue recognition policies are in accordance with ASC 605 (Revenue Recognition) and SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin Nos. 101 and 104. Our revenues are generated principally from the sale of our products. Revenue from the sale of products is recognized at the time title and the risks and rewards of ownership pass to the customer. This generally occurs when the products reach the free-on-board shipping point, the sales price is fixed and determinable, and collection is reasonably assured. For those items where title has not yet transferred, we have deferred the recognition of revenue. A reserve for estimated returns is established at the time of sale based on historical return experience and is recorded as a reduction of sales. Other allowances include customer quantity and price discrepancies. A reserve for other allowances is established at the time of sale based on historical experience and is recorded as a reduction of sales. 66 Table of Contents Contract sales for construction related projects are recorded primarily on the percentage-of-completion method. Profits recognized on contracts in process are based upon estimated contract revenue and related cost to complete. Percentage-of-completion is measured based on the ratio of actual costs incurred to total estimated costs. Revisions in cost estimates as contracts progress have the effect of increasing or decreasing profits in the current period. Provisions for anticipated losses are made in the period in which they first become determinable. Contract sales for construction related projects are generated primarily within our Undersea Telecommunications segment. Inventories Inventories are recorded at the lower of cost or market value, except for inventoried costs which are costs incurred in the performance of long-term contracts primarily by our Undersea Telecommunications segment. Provisions for slow moving and obsolete inventory are made based upon product demand and historical experience. Should future product demand change, existing inventory could become slow moving or obsolete and provisions would be increased accordingly. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Intangible assets acquired include both those that have a determinable life and residual goodwill. Intangible assets with a determinable life include primarily intellectual property consisting of patents, trademarks, and unpatented technology with estimates of recoverability ranging from 1 to 50 years that are amortized on a straight-line basis. An evaluation of the remaining useful life of intangible assets with a determinable life is performed on a periodic basis and when events and circumstances warrant an evaluation. We assess intangible assets with a determinable life for impairment consistent with our policy for assessing other long-lived assets. Goodwill is assessed for impairment separately from other intangible assets with a determinable life by comparing the carrying value of each reporting unit to its fair value on the first day of the fourth quarter of each year or whenever we believe a triggering event requiring a more frequent assessment has occurred. In making this assessment, management relies on a number of factors including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, transactions, and market place data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management's judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment. When testing for goodwill impairment, we follow the guidance prescribed in ASC 350-20 (Intangibles Goodwill and Other: Goodwill). First, we perform a step I goodwill impairment test to identify a potential impairment. In doing so, we compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, goodwill may be impaired and a step II goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of any impairment loss. In the step II goodwill impairment test, we compare the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner that the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination is determined. We allocate the fair value of a reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit, including intangible assets, as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. Any excess of the value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill. Estimates about fair value used in the step I goodwill impairment tests have been calculated using an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows of each reporting unit. The income approach has been supported by additional transaction and guideline analyses. These approaches incorporate a number of assumptions including future growth rates, discount factors, and income tax rates in assessing fair value. Changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in goodwill impairments in future periods. 67 Table of Contents Income Taxes In determining income for financial statement purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments. These estimates and judgments affect the calculation of certain tax liabilities and the determination of the recoverability of certain of the deferred tax assets, which arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results, the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent years, and our forecast of future taxable income. In estimating future taxable income, we develop assumptions including the amount of future state, federal, and international pre-tax operating income, the reversal of temporary differences, and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses. We currently have recorded significant valuation allowances that we intend to maintain until it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will be realized. Our income tax expense recorded in the future will be reduced to the extent of decreases in our valuation allowances. The realization of our remaining deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on future taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction. Any reduction in future taxable income including any future restructuring activities may require that we record an additional valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. An increase in the valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in such period and could have a significant impact on our future earnings. Prior to September 26, 2009, if a change in a valuation allowance occurred, which was established in connection with an acquisition, the adjustment of such allowance may have affected goodwill rather than the income tax provision. Subsequent to the adoption of the business combination provisions of ASC 805 (Business Combinations) on September 26, 2009, any changes in a valuation allowance that was established in connection with an acquisition, regardless of when the acquisition occurred, will be reflected in the income tax provision. Changes in tax laws and rates also could affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. Management is not aware of any such changes that would have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities includes estimates for uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations across multiple global jurisdictions where we conduct our operations. Under the uncertain tax position provisions of ASC 740 (Income Taxes), we recognize liabilities for tax as well as related interest for issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and related interest will be due. These tax liabilities and related interest are reflected net of the impact of related tax loss carryforwards as such tax loss carryforwards will be applied against these tax liabilities and will reduce the amount of cash tax payments due upon the eventual settlement with the tax authorities. These estimates may change due to changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a settlement that differs from our current estimate of the tax liabilities and related interest. Further, management has reviewed with tax counsel the issues raised by certain taxing authorities and the adequacy of these recorded amounts. If our current estimate of tax and interest liabilities is less than the ultimate settlement, an additional charge to income tax expense may result. If our current estimate of tax and interest liabilities is more than the ultimate settlement, income tax benefits may be recognized. Substantially all of these tax liabilities and related interest are recorded in income taxes on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as payment is not expected within one year. 68 Table of Contents Pension and Postretirement Benefit Our pension expense and obligations are developed from actuarial assumptions. Two critical assumptions in determining pension expense and obligations are the discount rate and expected long-term return on plan assets. We evaluate these assumptions at least annually. Other assumptions reflect demographic factors such as retirement, mortality, and turnover and are evaluated periodically and updated to reflect our actual experience. Actual results may differ from actuarial assumptions. The discount rate represents the market rate for high-quality fixed income investments and is used to calculate the present value of the expected future cash flows for benefit obligations to be paid under our pension plans. A decrease in the discount rate increases the present value of pension benefit obligations. A 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate would increase our present value of pension obligations by $110 million, while a 25 basis point increase in the discount rate would decrease our present value of pension obligations by $105 million. We consider the current and expected asset allocations of our pension plans, as well as historical and expected long-term rates of return on those types of plan assets, in determining the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. During fiscal 2008, our Investment Committee made the decision to change the target asset allocation of the U.S. Plans' Master Trust from 60% equity and 40% fixed income to 30% equity and 70% fixed income in an effort to better align asset risk with the anticipated payment of benefit obligations. The target asset allocation transition began in fiscal 2008. As a result of economic conditions during 2009, we have slowed the transition of the Master Trust asset allocation change. Asset reallocation will continue over a multi-year period based on the funded status of the U.S. Plans' Master Trust. A 50 basis point decrease in the expected long-term return on plan assets would increase our pension expense by $9 million, while a 50 basis point increase in the expected long-term return on plan assets would decrease our pension expense by $9 million. Share-Based Compensation Under ASC 718 (Compensation Stock Compensation), we determine the fair value of share awards on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton valuation model. The Black-Scholes-Merton model requires certain assumptions that involve judgment. Such assumptions are the expected share price volatility, expected annual dividend yield, expected life of options, and risk-free interest rate. (See Note 23 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for additional information related to share-based compensation.) An increase in the volatility of the Company's stock will increase the amount of compensation expense on new awards. An increase in the holding period of options will also cause an increase in compensation expense. Dividend yields and risk-free interest rates are less difficult to estimate, but an increase in the dividend yield will cause a decrease in expense and an increase in the risk-free interest rate will increase compensation expense. Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued the Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") to serve as the single source of authoritative GAAP. We adopted the ASC in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. Adoption did not have an impact on our Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements. In May 2009, the FASB issued guidance in ASC 855 (Subsequent Events). ASC 855 establishes general standards for accounting and disclosure of events occurring subsequent to the balance sheet date but prior to issuance of the financial statements. We adopted ASC 855 in the third quarter of fiscal 2009. See Note 26 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for the required disclosures related to subsequent events. 69 Table of Contents In March 2008, the FASB issued updates to guidance in ASC 815 (Derivatives and Hedging), amending and expanding the disclosure requirements related to the use of derivative instruments and hedging activities to provide improved transparency into the uses and financial statement impact of derivative instruments and hedging activities. The new disclosure provisions of ASC 815 were adopted by us in the second quarter of fiscal 2009. See Note 13 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for the required disclosures related to derivative instruments and hedging activities. In March 2007, the FASB issued guidance in ASC 715-60 (Compensation Retirement Benefits: Defined Benefit Plans Other Postretirement) related to the accounting for collateral assignment split-dollar life insurance arrangements. We adopted the guidance in ASC 715-60 in the first quarter of fiscal 2009. Accordingly, we recognized accrued and other current liabilities of $1 million and other liabilities of $4 million on our Consolidated Balance Sheet at the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal 2009 with a corresponding decrease in the opening balance of accumulated deficit of $5 million. In September 2006, the FASB issued guidance in ASC 820 (Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures) that defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, expands disclosure about fair value measurements, and introduces the fair value option for certain financial assets and liabilities. ASC 820 was adopted by us in the first quarter of fiscal 2009. We did not elect to value any existing assets or liabilities at fair value upon adoption, nor did we apply the fair value option to any eligible assets acquired or liabilities incurred during the quarter. We will adopt the non-financial asset and liability fair value provisions in fiscal 2010. See Note 16 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for additional information related to fair value measurements. In September 2006, the FASB issued guidance in ASC 715 (Compensation Retirement Benefits) that requires that employers recognize the funded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans as a net asset or liability on the balance sheet and recognize as a component of other comprehensive income, net of tax, the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise during the period but are not recognized as a component of net periodic benefit cost. Under ASC 715, companies are required to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of their fiscal year end. We adopted the presentation requirements of ASC 715 on September 28, 2007 and the measurement date provisions in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. As a result of the change in measurement date, we recorded a charge of $7 million to accumulated deficit. See Note 14 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for additional information related to the change in measurement date provisions. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In June 2009, the FASB issued updates to guidance in ASC 810 (Consolidation) that address accounting for variable interest entities. These updates to ASC 810 are effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2011. We are currently assessing the impact that adoption will have on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. In April 2009 and December 2007, the FASB issued guidance in ASC 805 (Business Combinations). ASC 805 addresses the recognition and accounting for identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and noncontrolling interests in business combinations. ASC 805 is effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. Adoption is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. In December 2008, the FASB issued updates to the guidance in ASC 715 (Compensation Retirement Benefits) that enhance disclosures regarding assets in defined benefit pension or other postretirement plans. The updates to ASC 715 are effective for us in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. We are currently assessing the impact that adoption will have on our Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements. 70 Table of Contents In December 2007, the FASB issued updates to guidance in ASC 810 (Consolidation) that address the accounting and reporting framework for minority interests by a parent company. These updates to ASC 810 are effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. Adoption is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.
