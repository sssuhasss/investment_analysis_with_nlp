In addition, we, or others on our behalf, may make forward looking statements in press releases or written statements, or in our communications and discussions with investors and analysts in the normal course of business through meetings, webcasts, phone calls and conference calls. Words such as expect, anticipate, outlook, could, target, project, intend, plan, believe, seek, estimate, should, may, assume, continue, variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. We describe our respective risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could affect the outcome or results of operations in Item 1A. Risk Factors. We have based our forward looking statements on our management beliefs and assumptions based on information available to our management at the time the statements are made. We caution you that actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed, implied or forecast by our forward looking statements. Reference is made in particular to forward looking statements regarding product sales, reimbursement, expenses, earnings per share ( EPS ), liquidity and capital resources and trends. Except as required under the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations of the SEC, we do not have any intention or obligation to update publicly any forward looking statements after the distribution of this report, whether as a result of new information, future events, changes in assumptions or otherwise. Overview The following management discussion and analysis ( MD&A ) is intended to assist the reader in understanding the business of Amgen Inc., including its subsidiaries (referred to as Amgen, we, our and us ). MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We are a global biotechnology company that discovers, develops, manufactures and markets human therapeutics based on advances in cellular and molecular biology. Our mission is to serve patients. As a science-based, patient-focused organization, we discover and develop innovative therapies to treat grievous illness. We operate in one business segment human therapeutics. Therefore, our results of operations are discussed on a consolidated basis. We primarily earn revenues and income and generate cash from sales of human therapeutic products in the areas of supportive cancer care, nephrology and inflammation. Our principal products include Aranesp , Neulasta /NEUPOGEN , EPOGEN and ENBREL. ENBREL is marketed under a co-promotion agreement with Wyeth in the United States and Canada. (See Item 1. Business Principal Products for additional information about our principal products, their approved indications and where they are marketed.) In October 2006, we launched Vectibix , our first cancer therapeutic, after receiving FDA approval in late September. Product sales of Vectibix were not significant for 2006. For the year ended December 31, 2006, total revenues were $14,268 million and net income was $2,950 million, or $2.48 per share on a diluted basis. The results of our operations for the year ended December 31, 2006 reflect the $130 million and $1.1 billion write-offs of acquired IPR&D costs associated with the Avidia and Abgenix acquisitions, respectively. As of December 31, 2006, cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $6.3 billion, of which approximately $4.2 billion was generated from operations in foreign tax jurisdictions and is intended for use outside the United States. Our total debt outstanding was $9.0 billion as of December 31, 2006. For both years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, product sales represented 97% of total revenues, which was mainly comprised of our principal products. Over the last several years, our product sales growth has been 61 Table of Contents primarily driven by sales of Aranesp , Neulasta and ENBREL, which have benefited primarily from share gains and/or segment growth. We expect these products to continue to drive year-over-year sales growth in the near term and that Vectibix will also contribute to this growth. However, we believe that maintaining or increasing share will be more of a challenge than in previous years as we experienced share loss with ENBREL in 2006 compared to 2005 and we operate in an increasingly competitive environment. For example, Roche is developing a peg-EPO product for the United States for which they have filed a BLA with the FDA and have announced plans to launch in the nephrology segment in 2007 despite our ongoing lawsuit and their acknowledgement of our U.S. erythropoietin patents (see Item 3. Legal Proceedings Roche Matters Amgen Inc. v. F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd., et al. ). (See Item 1. Business Competition for further information on the impact of competition on our business.) In addition, as discussed below, we also anticipate increased competition internationally from biosimilar and other competing products. Going forward, we will focus on growing our segments, including increasing our penetration in the therapeutic areas in which our products are used, while also continuing to focus on maintaining or increasing share. Over the last few years, our principal products have attained significant sales levels and have experienced strong year-over-year sales growth. However, the rate of growth has declined in each of the past several years and, in the near term, we expect this trend will continue. Most patients receiving Aranesp and Neulasta /NEUPOGEN for approved indications are covered by both government and private payer healthcare programs. In the United States, approved dialysis providers are primarily reimbursed for EPOGEN by the federal government through the ESRD Program of Medicare. The ESRD program reimburses 80% of allowed dialysis costs, with the remainder being paid by other sources including patients, state Medicaid programs, private insurance and, to a lesser extent, state kidney patient programs. Beginning in the first quarter of 2006, ENBREL and Sensipar also became eligible for coverage from the U.S. Government under Medicare Program Part D. Generally, in Europe and other countries outside the U.S., the government sponsored healthcare system is the primary payer of healthcare costs of patients. Governments may regulate access to, prices or reimbursement levels of our products to control costs. Worldwide use of our products may be affected by these cost containment pressures and cost shifting from governments and private insurers to healthcare providers in response to ongoing initiatives to reduce healthcare expenditures. Therefore, sales of our principal products and sales growth are, and will be, affected by the availability and extent of reimbursement from third-party payers, including government and private insurance plans. While we believe that our product sales for 2006 and 2005 have not been nor, for 2007, are expected to be significantly impacted by the reimbursement changes resulting from the MMA enacted in 2005, additional provisions of the MMA and other regulations affecting reimbursement that have gone, or may go, into effect could affect our product sales and related sales growth in the future. For additional information on reimbursement and its impact on our business, see Item 1. Business Reimbursement. International product sales for both years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 represented 18% of total product sales and consisted principally of European sales. International product sales have grown significantly over the last several years driven by Aranesp and Neulasta reflecting continued penetration. However, we anticipate facing greater competition in Europe from the availability of biosimilar and other competing products. Although we cannot predict with certainty when the first biosimilar products could appear on the market in the EU, we believe that the first biosimilar G-CSF product, which would compete with Neulasta and NEUPOGEN , and that the first biosimilar erythropoietin products, which would compete with Aranesp , may be approved in 2007 and could be available in the EU shortly after approval. Based on an announcement by Shire, we expect that a competing erythropoietin product, manufactured by Shire, may appear on the market in the EU in 2007. In addition, Roche is developing its peg-EPO product which, upon regulatory approval, we expect they will launch in the EU nephrology segment in 2007. We cannot predict whether or to what extent the entry of biosimilar or other competing products would impact future Aranesp , Neulasta or NEUPOGEN sales in the EU. (See Item 1. Business Competition for further information regarding biosimilar products.) Our international product sales are impacted by foreign currency changes (see Results of Operations discussion below). International product sales growth during 2006 was unfavorably impacted by $13 million, while 2005 was favorably impacted by $46 million, from foreign currency exchange rate changes. However, both the 62 Table of Contents positive and negative impacts that movements in foreign exchange rates have on our international product sales are mitigated, in part, by the natural, opposite impact these exchange rate movements have on our international operating expenses and as a result of our foreign currency hedging activities. Our hedging activities seek to offset the impact, both positive and negative, that foreign exchange rate changes may have on our net income. As such, the impact to our net results of operations from changes in foreign currency exchange rates has been largely mitigated. For the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, operating income was as follows (amounts in millions): 2006 Change 2005 Operating Income $ 3,840 (21)% $ 4,848 Operating income as a percentage of product sales was 28% for 2006 and 40% for 2005. The decline in operating income as a percentage of product sales for the year ended 2006 compared to the year ended 2005 primarily reflects the impact of the acquired IPR&D charges related to the Abgenix and Avidia acquisitions in 2006, the increase in R&D expenses to expand our R&D activities as discussed below, higher selling, general and administrative ( SG&A ) expenses to support our growing organization and the expensing of stock options, which commenced January 1, 2006. We focus our R&D on novel human therapeutics for the treatment of grievous illness. (See Item 1. Business Research and Development and Selected Product Candidates for further information on our R&D vision and product pipeline.) We have substantially expanded our R&D capabilities and plan to continue increasing our investments to expand these capabilities to manage and execute increasingly larger and more complex clinical trials and to build the capacity to advance more compounds into and through the clinic. We began nine mega-site trials (involving 200 or more sites) in 2006 to support denosumab and our other late-stage programs. For 2007, we expect R&D expense to increase, although not to the extent experienced in 2006, due to the continuance of the mega-site trials previously started, including the nine started in 2006, beginning additional studies in 2007 in support of our late-stage programs, including studies for panitumumab and motesanib diphosphate, and advancing a number of additional molecules into phase 2. The nine mega-site trials, which we began in 2006, will continue to require significant time, resources and expense to execute. (See Item 1A. Risk Factors Before we commercialize and sell any of our product candidates, we must conduct clinical trials in humans; if we fail to adequately manage these trials we may not be able to sell future products and our sales could be adversely affected. ) To execute our clinical trial programs, we need to continue the growth of our development organization and associated R&D support organizations, implement new management structures and approaches and continue to partner with third-party contract clinical trial providers. Further, to increase the number of patients available for enrollment for our clinical trials, we partnered with third-party contract clinical trial providers to open clinical sites and are enrolling patients in a number of new geographic locations where our experience conducting clinical trials is more limited, including Russia, Mexico and some South American countries. In 2007, we plan to expand into Southeast Asia and India. On April 1, 2006, we paid shareholders of Abgenix $22.50 in cash per common share for a total value of approximately $2.1 billion to acquire all of the outstanding shares and assumed Abgenix outstanding debt with a fair value of approximately $686 million. Abgenix was a company with expertise in the discovery and development of monoclonal antibodies and was our co-development partner for Vectibix . The results of Abgenix operations have been included in our consolidated financial statements commencing April 1, 2006. On October 24, 2006, we completed our acquisition of Avidia. Pursuant to the merger agreement, we paid in cash approximately $275 million, net of cash acquired and our existing equity stake in Avidia, and may be subject to pay additional amounts upon the achievement of certain future events. Avidia focused on the discovery and development of a new class of human therapeutic known as Avimer proteins. The transaction provides Amgen with Avidia's lead product candidate, an inhibitor of interleukin 6 (IL-6) for the treatment of inflammation and autoimmune diseases, which is in phase 1 clinical trials. The results of Avidia operations have been included in our consolidated financial statements commencing October 25, 2006. In December 2006, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Cytokinetics Incorporated ( Cytokinetics ) to discover, develop and commercialize novel small-molecule therapeutics that activate cardiac 63 Table of Contents muscle contractility for potential application in the treatment of heart failure. In addition, we obtained an option to participate in future developments and commercialization of Cytokinetics lead drug candidate arising from this program, CK-1827452, which recently entered two phase 1 clinical trials. The collaboration is worldwide, excluding Japan. There are many economic and industry-wide factors that affect our business generally and uniquely, including, among others, those relating to increased complexity and cost of R&D due, in part, to greater scrutiny of clinical trials with respect to safety which may lead to fewer treatments being approved by the FDA; increasingly intense competition for marketed products and product candidates; broad reimbursement changes; complex and expanding regulatory requirements; and intellectual property protection. (See Item 1. Business and Item 1A. Risk Factors for further information on these economic and industry-wide factors and their impact and potential impact on our business.) In addition to these economic and industry-wide factors, we, as a company, face certain additional challenges and have a number of opportunities as well. Our principal products have established leadership positions attaining significant sales levels over the last few years and have experienced strong year-over-year sales growth. However, the rate of growth has declined in each of the past several years and, in the near term, we expect this trend to continue. We believe that future sales growth for certain of our principal products should benefit from segment growth, including increased penetration through new areas of treatment and/or greater awareness. At the same time in 2007, however, they will be subject to increasing competition, which includes the expected introduction of biosimilars in Europe. In addition, future sales growth may be impacted by healthcare provider prescribing behavior or use of our products, or regulatory or private healthcare organization medical guidelines and reimbursement of our products. Also, with the promise of our growing pipeline comes the challenge of delivering on the pipeline, including executing on large and complex clinical trials. To execute on these clinical trial programs we will need to increase the growth of our R&D organization, open clinical sites and enroll patients in new geographic locations and continue reliance on third-party contractors. Further, the growth of our clinical and commercial operations will require increased manufacturing capacity, which is a lengthy and costly process. In the near term, our 2007 objectives to assist in meeting these challenges and to be successful in taking advantage of our opportunities are to: i) balance short term financial performance with increased R&D investment to allow us to execute key clinical trials for our late-stage product candidates and advance a number of additional molecules further along the development process; ii) grow our markets and hold or increase share; iii) vigorously defend our intellectual property and increase our leadership in anemia management; and iv) proactively expand production capacity as we grow. Results of Operations Product sales For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, worldwide product sales and total product sales by geographic region were as follows (amounts in millions): 2006 Change 2005 Change 2004 Aranesp $ 4,121 26% $ 3,273 32% $ 2,473 Neulasta /NEUPOGEN 3,923 12% 3,504 20% 2,915 EPOGEN 2,511 2% 2,455 (6)% 2,601 ENBREL 2,879 12% 2,573 35% 1,900 Sensipar 321 104% 157 324% 37 Vectibix 39 n/a n/a Other 64 7% 60 18% 51 Total product sales $ 13,858 15% $ 12,022 20% $ 9,977 Total U.S. $ 11,397 15% $ 9,892 19% $ 8,279 Total International 2,461 16% 2,130 25% 1,698 Total product sales $ 13,858 15% $ 12,022 20% $ 9,977 64 Table of Contents Product sales are influenced by a number of factors, including demand, third-party reimbursement availability and policies, regulatory developments, clinical trial outcomes, clinical practice, pricing strategies, wholesaler and end-user inventory management practices, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, new product launches and indications, competitive products, product supply and acquisitions. (See Item 1. Business Principal Products for a discussion of our principal products and their approved indications.) Sales growth in 2006 and 2005 was principally driven by demand for Aranesp , Neulasta and ENBREL, which benefited from share gains and/or market growth. International product sales growth in 2005 benefited by $46 million from foreign currency exchange rate changes. We expect Aranesp , Neulasta and ENBREL to continue to drive year-over-year sales growth in 2007 and that Vectibix will also contribute to that growth. However, we expect that maintaining or increasing share will be more of a challenge than in previous years as we experienced share loss with ENBREL in 2006 compared to 2005 and we operate in an increasingly competitive environment. Going forward, we will focus on growing our segments, including increasing our penetration in the therapeutic areas in which our products are used, while also continuing to focus on maintaining or increasing share. We believe that our product sales for 2005 and 2006 were not significantly impacted by the reimbursement changes resulting from the MMA implemented in 2005. We believe this was, in part, due to the effects of CMS 2005 and 2006 oncology demonstration projects on sales of our products used in supportive cancer care, especially Aranesp . However, we believe it is unlikely that CMS will implement an oncology demonstration project for 2007. Furthermore, we believe that our sales for 2005 and 2006 were not significantly impacted, in part, due to increased reimbursement rates to physicians from CMS for services associated with drug administration. The 2006 Medicare Physician Fee Schedule Payment Final Rule reduced payments for physician services in 2006 by approximately 4.4% on average, although subsequent legislation eliminated this reduction for 2006. The Medicare Physician Fee Schedule Payment Final Rule for 2007 would have reduced payments for physician services in 2007 by approximately 5.0% on average, however, as in 2006, new legislation eliminated the reduction in payments for 2007. Because we cannot accurately predict the impact of any such changes on how, or under what circumstances, healthcare providers will prescribe or administer our products, we cannot estimate the full impact of the MMA on our business, although we believe that it is not likely to be significant to our business in 2007. However, additional provisions of the MMA and other regulations affecting reimbursement that have gone or may go into effect could affect our product sales and related sales growth in the future. For additional information on reimbursement and its impact on our business, see Item 1. Business Reimbursement. Aranesp For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, total Aranesp sales by geographic region were as follows (amounts in millions): 2006 Change 2005 Change 2004 Aranesp U.S. $ 2,790 33 % $ 2,104 37 % $ 1,533 Aranesp International 1,331 14 % 1,169 24 % 940 Total Aranesp $ 4,121 26 % $ 3,273 32 % $ 2,473 The increase in U.S. Aranesp sales for the year ended December 31, 2006 was primarily driven by demand reflecting segment growth and share gains. The growth in U.S. Aranesp sales also reflects increased Aranesp usage in U.S. hospital dialysis clinics from continued conversion from EPOGEN , which we believe stabilized in mid-2006. The increase in international Aranesp sales for the year ended December 31, 2006 was also principally driven by demand. The increase in U.S. Aranesp sales for the year ended December 31, 2005 was primarily driven by market growth and share gains. Sales growth for 2005 was slightly impacted by higher incentives earned by customers attaining higher sales volumes and growth under performance-based contracts. Although ASPs for U.S. Aranesp trended downward during 2005, they began to stabilize during the fourth quarter of 2005. In 2005, 65 Table of Contents Aranesp usage in U.S. hospital dialysis clinics increased, reflecting a conversion from EPOGEN . International Aranesp sales growth for 2005 was principally driven by demand, benefiting only slightly, $20 million, from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. For 2007, we believe that Aranesp sales growth will be driven primarily by segment growth. Further, sales of Aranesp have benefited, and may continue to benefit, by its use in U.S. hospital dialysis clinics to treat anemia associated with chronic renal failure instead of EPOGEN , however, we believe this conversion stabilized as of mid-2006. In addition, we believe future worldwide Aranesp sales growth may also be dependent, in part, on such factors as reimbursement by third-party payers (including governments and private insurance plans); cost containment pressures from governments and private insurers on healthcare providers; governmental or private organization regulations or guidelines relating to the use of our products; government programs; adverse events or results from clinical trials or studies performed by us or by others which may expand safety labeling and may negatively impact healthcare provider prescribing behavior, use of our product, regulatory or private healthcare organization medical guidelines and reimbursement practices; penetration of existing and new segments, including potential new indications; patient population growth; the effects of pricing strategies; an increasingly competitive environment of products or therapies, which in 2007 in the United States could potentially include competition in the nephrology segment from Roche peg-EPO, which Roche has indicated they intend to bring to the U.S. market in 2007 despite our ongoing lawsuit and their acknowledgement of our U.S. erythropoietin patents (see Item 3. Legal Proceedings Roche Matters Amgen Inc. v. F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd., et al. ) and in the EU in 2007 could potentially include biosimilars, Shire erythropoietin product, Roche peg-EPO product and other competing products (see Item 1. Business Competition for further information on the impact of competition on our business); our ability to differentiate Aranesp from current and potential future competition; and changes in foreign currency exchange rates (see Item 1A. Risk Factors Our sales depend on payment and reimbursement from third-party payers, and, to the extent that reimbursement for our products is reduced, this could negatively impact the utilization of our products. ). Neulasta /NEUPOGEN For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, total Neulasta /NEUPOGEN sales by geographic region were as follows (amounts in millions): 2006 Change 2005 Change 2004 Neulasta U.S. $ 2,217 17 % $ 1,900 29 % $ 1,476 NEUPOGEN U.S. 830 3 % 805 3 % 778 U.S. Neulasta /NEUPOGEN Total 3,047 13 % 2,705 20 % 2,254 Neulasta International 493 27 % 388 47 % 264 NEUPOGEN International 383 (7)% 411 4 % 397 International Neulasta /NEUPOGEN Total 876 10 % 799 21 % 661 Total Worldwide Neulasta /NEUPOGEN $ 3,923 12 % $ 3,504 20 % $ 2,915 The increase in U.S. Neulasta /NEUPOGEN sales for the year ended December 31, 2006 was driven primarily by demand for Neulasta , reflecting segment growth. In addition, the increase in demand for Neulasta for the year ended December 31, 2006 also includes the impact of a 2 percent U.S. price increase in April 2006. U.S. demand for Neulasta continued to benefit from a product label extension based on clinical data demonstrating the value of first cycle utilization in moderate-high risk chemotherapy regimens. The increase in international Neulasta /NEUPOGEN sales for the year ended December 31, 2006 was driven primarily by demand for Neulasta . The increase in U.S. Neulasta /NEUPOGEN sales for the year ended December 31, 2005 was driven primarily by demand for Neulasta , which benefited from guidelines recommending earlier use. U.S. Neulasta /NEUPOGEN sales, Neulasta in particular, also benefited from a label extension based on clinical data demonstrating the value of first cycle use in moderate risk chemotherapy regimens. In addition, U.S. sales growth was 66 Table of Contents slightly impacted by higher incentives earned by customers attaining higher sales volumes and growth under performance-based contracts. Although ASPs for U.S. Neulasta trended downward during 2005, they began to stabilize during the fourth quarter of 2005. The increase in international Neulasta /NEUPOGEN sales for the year ended December 31, 2005, was driven primarily by demand for Neulasta . International Neulasta /NEUPOGEN sales for 2005 also benefited by $18 million from foreign currency exchange rate changes. We believe that 2007 sales growth for Neulasta /NEUPOGEN will depend on further segment penetration of Neulasta in the moderate-risk population that would benefit from its earlier use and by focusing on the value of its treatment in first and subsequent chemotherapy cycles. In addition, future worldwide Neulasta /NEUPOGEN sales growth will be dependent, in part, on such factors as reimbursement by third-party payers (including governments and private insurance plans); cost containment pressures from governments and private insurers on healthcare providers; adverse events or results from clinical trials or studies performed by us or by others which may expand safety labeling and may negatively impact healthcare provider prescribing behavior, use of our product, regulatory or private healthcare organization medical guidelines and reimbursement practices; governmental or private organization regulations or guidelines relating to the use of our products; government programs (see Item 1A. Risk Factors Our sales depend on payment and reimbursement from third-party payers, and, to the extent that reimbursement for our products is reduced, this could negatively impact the utilization of our products. ); penetration of existing segments; patient population growth; the effects of pricing strategies; competitive products or therapies, including biosimilar products that may be approved in 2007 in the EU and be available shortly thereafter; changes in foreign currency exchange rates and the development of new treatments for cancer. Future chemotherapy treatments that are less myelosuppressive may require less Neulasta /NEUPOGEN , however, other future chemotherapy treatments that are more myelosuppressive, such as dose dense chemotherapy, could require more Neulasta /NEUPOGEN . NEUPOGEN competes with Neulasta in the United States and Europe. U.S. and International NEUPOGEN sales have been adversely impacted by conversion to Neulasta . However, we believe that most of the conversion in the United States and in Europe has occurred. EPOGEN For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, total EPOGEN sales were as follows (amounts in millions): 2006 Change 2005 Change 2004 EPOGEN U.S. $ 2,511 2% $ 2,455 (6)% $ 2,601 Reported EPOGEN sales for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased modestly primarily due to the increased demand in the free-standing dialysis centers partially offset by the increased use of Aranesp in the hospital setting. We believe that conversion to Aranesp in the hospital setting stabilized in mid-2006. We believe demand for EPOGEN in the free-standing dialysis centers, which account for the majority of the EPOGEN sales, remained consistent with patient population growth at approximately 3 to 4 percent. EPOGEN sales for the year ended December 31, 2005 decreased primarily due to lower demand, unfavorable changes in wholesaler inventory levels and an unfavorable revised estimate of dialysis demand, primarily spillover, for prior quarters. Demand for 2005 was affected by conversion to Aranesp in the U.S. hospital dialysis clinics, which represented approximately 10% of the EPOGEN business, and reflected higher sales incentives. Demand for EPOGEN in the free-standing dialysis clinics remained consistent with patient population growth at approximately 3 to 4 percent. Spillover is a result of our contractual relationship with Johnson & Johnson (see Summary of Critical Accounting Policies EPOGEN revenue recognition below and Note 1, Summary of significant accounting policies Product sales to the Consolidated Financial Statements). EPOGEN sales in 2007 may be negatively impacted by certain external developments such as the possibility of competition from Roche peg-EPO, which Roche has indicated they intend to bring to the U.S. market in 2007 despite our ongoing lawsuit and their acknowledgement of our U.S. erythropoietin patents (see Item 3. Legal Proceedings Roche Matters Amgen Inc. v. F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd., et al. ) (see Item 1. Business Competition for further information on the impact of competition on our business) as well as adverse events or results from clinical trials or studies performed by us or by others which may expand safety labeling 67 Table of Contents and may negatively impact healthcare provider prescribing behavior, use of our product, regulatory or private healthcare organization medical guidelines and reimbursement practices. Sales for EPOGEN in 2007 could, however, be favorably impacted to a certain degree by underlying demand in the free-standing dialysis centers, which we believe will remain consistent with the annual patient population growth of 3 to 4 percent, and the lessened impact of conversion to Aranesp in the U.S. hospital dialysis clinics, which we believe stabilized in mid-2006. Dialysis patients receiving treatment for anemia associated with end stage renal disease with EPOGEN are covered primarily under medical programs provided by the federal government. Therefore, going forward, we believe EPOGEN sales growth will further depend on changes in reimbursement rates or a change in the basis for reimbursement by the federal government. We believe EPOGEN sales growth will also be dependent, in part, on future governmental or private organization regulations or guidelines relating to the use of our products, cost containment pressures from the federal government on healthcare providers and the effects of pricing strategies (see Item 1A. Risk Factors Our sales depend on payment and reimbursement from third-party payers, and, to the extent that reimbursement for our products is reduced, this could negatively impact the utilization of our products. ). ENBREL For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, total ENBREL sales by geographic region were as follows (amounts in millions): 2006 Change 2005 Change 2004 ENBREL U.S. $ 2,736 11 % $ 2,470 35 % $ 1,827 ENBREL International 143 39 % 103 41 % 73 Total ENBREL $ 2,879 12 % $ 2,573 35 % $ 1,900 ENBREL sales growth for the year ended December 31, 2006 was driven by increased demand in both the rheumatology and dermatology segments. The increase in demand for the year ended December 31, 2006 also includes the impact of a 4.9 percent U.S. price increase that went into effect May 1, 2006. While ENBREL continued to maintain a leading position in both rheumatology and dermatology, we have experienced moderate share loss in both segments in 2006 compared to 2005. ENBREL sales growth was also affected in 2006 by slowing segment growth in dermatology and by increased competitive activities in both segments. ENBREL sales growth for the year ended December 31, 2005 was driven by demand, reflecting strong growth in both rheumatology and dermatology. ENBREL sales growth benefited from its competitive profile and significant growth of biologics in both the rheumatology and dermatology segments. Sales growth for ENBREL in 2007 will depend on growing both the rheumatology and dermatology segments. In addition, future ENBREL sales growth will be dependent on such factors as the effects of competing products or therapies and, in part, our ability to differentiate ENBREL based on safety and efficacy; segment growth; the availability, extent and access to reimbursement by government and third-party payers; cost containment pressures from governments and private insurers on healthcare providers; adverse events or results from clinical trials or studies performed by us or by others which may expand safety labeling and may negatively impact healthcare provider prescribing behavior, use of our product, regulatory or private healthcare organization medical guidelines and reimbursement practices; governmental or private organization regulations or guidelines relating to the use of our products; and the effects of pricing strategies (see Item 1A. Risk Factors Our sales depend on payment and reimbursement from third-party payers, and, to the extent that reimbursement for our products is reduced, this could negatively impact the utilization of our products. ). 68 Table of Contents Selected operating expenses The following table summarizes selected operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 (amounts in millions): 2006 Change 2005 Change 2004 Product sales $ 13,858 15% $ 12,022 20% $ 9,977 Operating expenses: Cost of sales (excludes amortization of acquired intangible assets) $ 2,095 1% $ 2,082 20% $ 1,731 % of product sales 15% 17% 17% Research and development $ 3,366 45% $ 2,314 14% $ 2,028 % of product sales 24% 19% 20% Selling, general and administrative $ 3,366 21% $ 2,790 9% $ 2,556 % of product sales 24% 23% 26% Write-off of acquired in-process research and development $ 1,231 $ $ 554 Amortization of acquired intangible assets $ 370 $ 347 $ 333 Cost of sales Cost of sales, which excludes the amortization of acquired intangible assets (see Consolidated Statements of Operations ), increased 1% for the year ended December 31, 2006. Cost of sales grew much slower than revenue for the year ended December 31, 2006 due primarily to lower royalties as well as a more favorable product mix and cost efficiencies at our factories. Royalty expenses were lower due to the expiration of certain contractual royalty obligations on Neulasta and NEUPOGEN sales and the acquisition of certain royalty rights on sales of ENBREL and EU Neulasta and NEUPOGEN sales. Cost of sales increased 20% for the year ended December 31, 2005, primarily due to higher sales volumes. Costs of sales for 2005 were also impacted by the $47 million write-off of a semi-completed manufacturing asset that was determined to be unusable due to a change in manufacturing strategy. Research and development R&D expenses are primarily comprised of costs and expenses for salaries and benefits associated with R&D personnel, overhead and occupancy, clinical trial and related clinical manufacturing, including contract services and other outside costs, process development, quality assurance, information systems and amortization of acquired technology used in R&D with alternative future uses. R&D expenses also include such costs related to activities performed on behalf of corporate partners. R&D expenses increased 45% for the year ended December 31, 2006, primarily due to higher staff levels and increased funding necessary to support clinical trials for our late-stage programs, which include denosomab, our late-stage investigational product for osteoporosis and metastatic bone cancer, and the continued expansion of our research and pre-clinical organization to build the capacity to advance more compounds into and through the clinic. We began nine mega-site trials (involving 200 or more sites) in 2006 to support denosumab and our other late-stage programs. In addition, R&D for the year ended December 31, 2006, includes approximately $104 million in stock option expense, which was not reflected in our Consolidated Results of Operations prior to January 1, 2006 (see Recent accounting pronouncements below) and approximately $48 million in non-cash amortization expense for the intangible asset, XenoMouse technology, acquired in the Abgenix acquisition. In 2006, staff-related costs, including stock option compensation, and clinical trial and clinical manufacturing costs increased approximately $467 million and $355 million, respectively. In 2005, R&D expenses increased 14% over the prior year, primarily driven by higher staff-related costs, which included the full year integration of the Tularik operations and the buildup of our R&D organization to support the growth in our pipeline. The 2005 growth also reflected higher costs relating to key clinical trials and clinical manufacturing, including the continued ramp up of large-scale phase 3 trials for denosumab, Amgen investigational therapy for bone loss. In 2005, staff-related costs and clinical manufacturing and clinical trial costs increased approximately $171 million and $118 million, respectively. 69 Table of Contents Selling, general and administrative SG&A expenses are primarily comprised of salaries and benefits associated with sales and marketing, finance, legal and other administrative personnel; outside marketing expenses; overhead and occupancy costs; other legal costs; and other general and administrative costs. SG&A increased 21% for the year ended December 31, 2006, reflecting higher staff levels and additional infrastructure costs to support the growing organization, in particular our Global Enterprise Resource Planning ( ERP ) system, higher Wyeth profit share expenses related to ENBREL sales and higher legal costs associated with ongoing litigation. In addition, SG&A costs for the year ended December 31, 2006 included approximately $120 million in stock option expense, which was not reflected in our Consolidated Results of Operations prior to January 1, 2006 (see Recent accounting pronouncements below). In 2006, staff-related costs, including stock option compensation, and additional infrastructure costs increased over 2005 by $323 million and $59 million, respectively. In addition, we incurred $38 million for the above-noted higher outside legal costs and $198 million in increased outside marketing expenses in support of our principal products, including the Wyeth profit share related to ENBREL in 2006 as compared to 2005. Outside marketing expenses include the Wyeth profit share related to ENBREL, which has increased due to ENBREL sales growth. In 2005, SG&A increased 9% for the year ended December 31, 2005, primarily due to higher outside marketing expenses in support of our principal products. Outside marketing expenses include the Wyeth profit share related to ENBREL, which has increased due to ENBREL sales growth. During 2005, outside marketing expenses and staff-related costs increased approximately $241 million and $42 million, respectively. Write-off of acquired in-process research and development The fair value of acquired IPR&D projects and technologies which have no alternative future use and which have not reached technological feasibility at the date of acquisition are immediately expensed. In 2006, we incurred charges of $1,101 million and $130 million, associated with writing off the fair value of IPR&D acquired in the Abgenix and Avidia acquisitions, respectively (see Note 7, Acquisitions to the Consolidated Financial Statements). In 2004, we incurred a charge of $554 million, associated with writing off the fair value of IPR&D acquired in the Tularik acquisition (see Note 7, Acquisitions to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Amortization of acquired intangible assets Amortization of acquired intangible assets relates to the acquired products technology rights acquired in connection with the Immunex acquisition. In 2006, this amortization also included $49 million related to the impairment of a non-ENBREL related intangible asset previously acquired in the Immunex acquisition. Other items, net In 2005, other items, net consisted of a $49 million charge, net of amounts previously accrued, for settling certain legal matters associated with a patent legal proceeding. (See Note 12, Other to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.) Income taxes Our effective tax rate was 26.6%, 24.5% and 30.4% for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Our effective tax rate for 2006 increased primarily due to the write-off of acquired IPR&D costs in connection with the acquisitions of Abgenix and Avidia, which is not deductible for tax purposes. The increase in the rate was partially offset by an increase in the amount of foreign earnings intended to be invested indefinitely outside of the United States and favorable audit settlements. In addition, the 2005 tax rate was negatively impacted by the tax on the repatriation of foreign earnings in 2005 under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. As permitted in Accounting Principles Board Opinion ( APB ) No. 23, Accounting for Income Taxes Special Areas, we do not provide for U.S. income taxes on undistributed earnings of our foreign operations that are intended to be invested indefinitely outside the United States. 70 Table of Contents The 2005 effective tax rate was lower than the 2004 effective tax rate due to the favorable resolution of prior year foreign tax credit claims and R&D tax credits with the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ), and the absence of the write-off of non-deductible IPR&D costs in connection with the acquisition of Tularik in 2004. This decrease was partially offset by the tax on the repatriation of foreign earnings in 2005 under the American Jobs Creation Act. In the fourth quarter of 2005, we repatriated $500 million of foreign earnings, which was the maximum amount of foreign earnings qualifying for the reduced tax rate. The tax expense incurred on the repatriation was approximately $43 million. (See Note 4, Income taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.) Recent accounting pronouncements On January 1, 2006 we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ( SFAS ) No. 123(R), Share-Based Payment. SFAS No. 123(R) requires us to account for our stock options using a fair-value-based method as described in such statement and recognize the resulting compensation expense in our financial statements. Prior to January 1, 2006, we accounted for our employee stock options using the intrinsic value method under APB No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and related interpretations, as permitted by SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, which generally did not result in any employee stock option expense. We adopted SFAS No. 123(R) using the modified-prospective-transition method. Under this transition method, compensation expense recognized subsequent to adoption includes (a) compensation cost for all share-based payments granted prior to, but not yet vested as of January 1, 2006, based on the values estimated in accordance with the original provisions of SFAS No. 123, and (b) compensation cost for all share-based payments granted subsequent to January 1, 2006, based on the grant-date fair values estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R). The modified-prospective-transition method did not require recognition of related compensation expense in our financial statements for prior periods. Comparability, therefore, of the current period financial statements to prior periods has been and will be impacted. The adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) had a material impact on our results of operations for 2006. The annual stock option expense is dependent on a number of factors including the number of stock options granted, our common stock price and related expected volatility and other inputs utilized in estimating the fair value of the stock options at the time of grant. As a result of recognizing compensation expense for stock options pursuant to the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R), our income before income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2006, was $233 million lower, and our net income was $152 million lower than if we had continued to account for stock options under APB No. 25. In addition, both basic and diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2006 were $0.14 lower, than if we had continued to account for stock options under APB No. 25. In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued FASB Interpretation No. ( FIN ) 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes by prescribing rules for recognition, measurement, classification and disclosure in our financial statements of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Based on our evaluations, we currently believe that the only impact to us of adopting this new standard is to reclassify certain liabilities for uncertain tax positions from current to non-current liabilities in our accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet. We adopted this new standard effective January 1, 2007. Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table summarizes selected financial data (amounts in millions): December 31, 2006 2005 Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities $ 6,277 $ 5,255 Total assets 33,788 29,297 Current debt 1,878 Non-current debt 7,134 3,957 Stockholders' equity 18,964 20,451 71 Table of Contents We believe that existing funds, cash generated from operations and existing sources of and access to financing are adequate to satisfy our working capital, capital expenditure and debt service requirements for the foreseeable future, as well as to support our stock repurchase programs and other business initiatives, including acquisitions and licensing activities. However, in order to provide for greater financial flexibility and liquidity, we are currently reviewing additional borrowing opportunities. We would expect to use any proceeds raised by such borrowing primarily for purchases of shares under our stock repurchase program and for general corporate purposes, including satisfying our obligation to repay borrowings under our 2032 Modified Convertible Notes if the note holders elect to put the notes to us for payment on March 1, 2007, capital expenditures and other working capital needs. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities Of the total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at December 31, 2006, approximately $4.2 billion was generated from operations in foreign tax jurisdictions and is intended for use outside the United States. If these funds are repatriated for use in our U.S. operations, substantial additional taxes on certain of these amounts would be required to be paid. In the fourth quarter of 2005, we repatriated $500 million of foreign earnings, which was the maximum amount of foreign earnings qualifying for the reduced tax rate under the American Jobs Act. The repatriation of these funds resulted in an increase in our 2005 tax provision of $43 million. The primary objectives for our investment portfolio are liquidity and safety of principal. Investments are made with the objective of achieving the highest rate of return, consistent with these two objectives. Our investment policy limits investments to certain types of instruments issued by institutions primarily with investment grade credit ratings and places restrictions on maturities and concentration by type and issuer. Financing arrangements In February 2006, we issued $2.5 billion principal amount of convertible notes due in 2011 (the 2011 Convertible Notes ) and $2.5 billion principal amount of convertible notes due in 2013 (the 2013 Convertible Notes ) in a private placement. The 2011 Convertible Notes and the 2013 Convertible Notes were issued at par and pay interest at a rate of 0.125% and 0.375%, respectively. The 2011 Convertible Notes and the 2013 Convertible Notes may be convertible based on an initial conversion rate of 12.5247 shares and 12.5814 shares, respectively, per $1,000 principal amount of notes (which represents an initial conversion price of approximately $79.84 and $79.48 per share, respectively). The 2011 Convertible Notes and the 2013 Convertible Notes may only be converted 1) during any calendar quarter beginning after June 30, 2006 if the closing price of our common stock exceeds 130% of the respective conversion price per share during a defined period at the end of the previous quarter, 2) if we make specified distributions to holders of our common stock or specified corporate transactions occur or 3) one month prior to the respective maturity date. Upon conversion, a holder would receive 1) cash equal to the lesser of the principal amount of the note or the conversion value, as defined, and 2) to the extent the conversion value exceeds the principal amount of the note, shares of our common stock, cash or a combination of common stock and cash, at our option (the excess conversion value ). In addition, upon a change in control, as defined, the holders may require us to purchase for cash all or a portion of their notes for 100% of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. Moody and Standard & Poor rate our outstanding convertible notes A2 and A+, respectively. In connection with the issuance of these convertible notes, a total of $3.0 billion of our common stock was repurchased under our stock repurchase program. Also concurrent with the issuance of the 2011 Convertible Notes and the 2013 Convertible Notes, we purchased convertible note hedges in private transactions. The convertible note hedges allow us to receive shares of our common stock and/or cash from the counterparties to the transactions equal to the amounts of common stock and/or cash related to the excess conversion value that we would pay to the holders of the 2011 Convertible Notes and the 2013 Convertible Notes upon conversion. These transactions will terminate the earlier of the maturity dates of the related notes or the first day none of the related notes remain outstanding due to conversion or otherwise. The cost of the convertible note hedges, which aggregated approximately $1.5 billion, was recorded as a reduction of equity. The net proceeds from the issuance of the 2011 and 2013 Convertible Notes, the repurchase of common stock and the purchase of the convertible note hedges was $439 million. 72 Table of Contents Also concurrent with the issuance of the 2011 Convertible Notes and the 2013 Convertible Notes, we sold warrants to acquire shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $107.90 per share in a private placement. Pursuant to these transactions, warrants for approximately 31.3 million shares of our common stock may be settled in May 2011 and warrants for approximately 31.5 million shares of our common stock may be settled in May 2013 (the settlement dates ). If the average price of our common stock during a defined period ending on or about the respective settlement dates exceeds the exercise price of the warrants, the warrants will be settled, at our option, in cash or shares of our common stock. Proceeds received from the issuance of the warrants totaled approximately $774 million. As of December 31, 2006 we had zero coupon convertible notes due in 2032 with an accreted value of $1.8 billion outstanding and having an aggregate face amount of $2.36 billion and yield to maturity of 1.125%. The holders of these convertible notes may require us to purchase, for cash, all or a portion of their convertible notes on specified dates (the Put Option ), at a price equal to the original issuance price plus the accrued original issue discount through the purchase date. The next available Put Option date is on March 1, 2007. Accordingly, the convertible notes were classified as current liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2006. Moody and Standard & Poor rate our outstanding convertible notes A2 and A+, respectively. As of December 31, 2006 we had $2.0 billion of long-term notes outstanding. These long-term notes consisted of 1) $1.0 billion of notes that bear interest at a fixed rate of 4.00% and mature in 2009 and 2) $1.0 billion of notes that bear interest at a fixed rate of 4.85% and mature in 2014. Moody and Standard & Poor rate our outstanding long-term senior notes A2 and A+, respectively. As of December 31, 2006, we had $235 million of additional debt securities outstanding. These debt securities consisted of 1) $100 million of debt securities that bear interest at a fixed rate of 6.5% and mature in 2007 under a $500 million debt shelf registration statement (the $500 Million Shelf ), 2) $100 million of long-term debt securities that bear interest at a fixed rate of 8.1% and mature in 2097 and 3) $35 million in long-term notes due in 2013 with an effective rate of 5.35% assumed in the Abgenix acquisition. Our outstanding long-term debt is rated A2 by Moody and A+ by Standard & Poor s. Under the $500 Million Shelf, all of the remaining $400 million of debt securities available for issuance may be offered from time to time under our medium-term note program with terms to be determined at the time of issuance. We have a $1.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility to be used for general corporate purposes, including commercial paper support, which matures in November 2010. Additionally, we have a commercial paper program, which provides for unsecured, short-term borrowings of up to an aggregate of $1.2 billion. No amounts were outstanding under the credit facility or commercial paper program as of December 31, 2006. We have a $1.0 billion shelf registration statement (the $1 Billion Shelf ) which allows us to issue debt securities, common stock and associated preferred share purchase rights, preferred stock, warrants to purchase debt securities, common stock or preferred stock, securities purchase contracts, securities purchase units and depositary shares. The $1 Billion Shelf was established to provide for further financial flexibility and the securities available for issuance may be offered from time to time with terms to be determined at the time of issuance. As of December 31, 2006, no securities had been issued under the $1 Billion Shelf. To protect against the potential increase in the fair value of our non-convertible, fixed interest rate notes due to a decline in interest rates, we entered into interest rate swap agreements that effectively convert the payment of our fixed rate notes to LIBOR-based variable interest payments over the life of the respective notes. These interest rate swap agreements qualify and are designated as fair value hedges. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, $2.2 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively, aggregate face amount of our outstanding non-convertible, fixed interest rate debt was covered by these interest rate swap agreements. Certain of our financing arrangements contain non-financial covenants and as of December 31, 2006, we were in compliance with all applicable covenants. 73 Table of Contents Cash flows The following table summarizes our cash flow activity for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 (amounts in millions): 2006 2005 2004 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 5,389 $ 4,911 $ 3,697 Net cash used in investing activities (5,131 ) (59 ) (1,399 ) Net cash used in financing activities (815 ) (4,538 ) (1,609 ) Operating Cash provided by operating activities has been and is expected to continue to be our primary recurring source of funds. The increase in cash provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2006 resulted primarily from higher cash receipts from customers driven by the growth in product sales and the timing of payments in the ordinary course of business (see Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows). The increase in cash provided by operations for 2005 resulted primarily from higher cash receipts from customers driven by growth in product sales and timing differences of cash payments relating to our tax and other accrued liabilities (see Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows). Investing On October 24, 2006, we completed our acquisition of Avidia and paid $275 million in cash, net of cash acquired and our existing equity stake in Avidia. In addition, we may be subject to pay additional amounts upon the achievement of certain future events. On April, 1, 2006, we completed our acquisition of Abgenix and paid $2.1 billion in cash to the shareholders of Abgenix to acquire all outstanding shares. In addition, we acquired $252 million in cash, and subsequent to the completion of the acquisition, we paid off $653 million of debt assumed in this transaction. Capital expenditures totaled $1.2 billion in 2006 compared with $867 million in 2005 and $1.3 billion in 2004. Capital expenditures in 2006 were primarily associated with ongoing manufacturing capacity and site expansions in Ireland, Puerto Rico and other locations and costs associated with implementing our ERP system. Capital expenditures in 2005 primarily related to the Puerto Rico manufacturing expansion which included a new manufacturing plant for the commercial production of Neulasta and NEUPOGEN approved by the FDA in September 2005, Thousand Oaks site expansion, Colorado manufacturing expansion and site development to support the new ENBREL manufacturing plant in Rhode Island, also approved by the FDA in September 2005. Capital expenditures in 2004 primarily related to the Thousand Oaks site expansion, the new ENBREL manufacturing plant in Rhode Island and the Puerto Rico manufacturing expansion. We currently estimate 2007 spending on capital projects and equipment to be in the range of $1.9 to $2.2 billion as we continue to increase our manufacturing and R&D operations globally and proceed with the implementation of our ERP system. The most significant of these expenditures are expected to be incurred with the further expansion of the Puerto Rico bulk manufacturing, formulation, fill and finish facilities, the start of construction of a new bulk manufacturing, formulation, fill and finish facility and other site infrastructure support in Ireland and the expansion of R&D operations in the United States. For additional information on our planned capital projects, see Item 1. Business Manufacturing and Raw Materials. Financing In December 2006, the Board authorized us to repurchase up to an additional $5.0 billion of common stock. As of December 31, 2006, we had $6.5 billion available for stock repurchases under this and the previously authorized stock repurchase programs. The manner of purchases, the amount we spend and the number of shares repurchased will vary based on a variety of factors, including the stock price and blackout periods in which we are restricted from repurchasing shares, and may include private block purchases as well as market transactions. 74 Table of Contents Repurchases under our stock repurchase program reflect, in part, our confidence in the long-term value of Amgen common stock. Additionally, we believe that it is an effective way of returning cash to our stockholders. A summary of our repurchase activity under our stock repurchase programs for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 is as follows (amounts in millions): 2006 2005 2004 Shares Dollars Shares Dollars Shares Dollars First quarter 46.6 $ 3,374 26.8 $ 1,675 10.1 $ 650 Second quarter 13.0 876 12.1 750 17.4 1,000 Third quarter 7.3 505 9.5 769 24.0 1,398 Fourth quarter 3.3 245 14.8 1,236 17.6 1,024 Total 70.2 $ 5,000 63.2 $ 4,430 69.1 $ 4,072 (See Item 5(c). Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities, Use of Proceeds and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities for additional information regarding our stock repurchase programs.) In February 2006, we issued $5.0 billion convertible notes, of which $2.5 billion pay interest at 0.125% and are due in 2011 and $2.5 billion pay interest at 0.375% and are due in 2013. In connection with the issuance of these convertible notes, a total of $3.0 billion of our common stock was repurchased under our stock repurchase program. Also concurrent with the issuance of these convertible notes, we purchased convertible note hedges at a cost of approximately $1.5 billion. The net proceeds received from the issuance of the 2011 and 2013 Convertible Notes, the repurchase of common stock and the purchase of the convertible note hedges was $439 million. Also concurrent with the issuance of the convertible notes, we sold 62.8 million warrants to acquire shares of our common stock for proceeds of $774 million, 31.3 million of which may be settled in May 2011 and 31.5 million of which may be settled in May 2013. For further information on these transactions, see Financing arrangements above. On March 2, 2005, as a result of certain holders of the zero coupon convertible notes due in 2032 exercising their March 1, 2005 Put Option, we repurchased $1.59 billion aggregate principal amount or approximately 40% of the then outstanding convertible notes at their then-accreted value for $1,175 million in cash. We receive cash from the exercise of employee stock options and proceeds from the sale of stock pursuant to the employee stock purchase plan. Employee stock option exercises and proceeds from the sale of stock by us pursuant to the employee stock purchase plans provided $528 million, $1.1 billion and $453 million of cash during the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 respectively. Proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options will vary from period to period based upon, among other factors, fluctuations in the market value of our stock relative to the exercise price of such options. In November 2004, we issued $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.00% senior notes due 2009 and $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.85% senior notes due 2014. The net proceeds totaled $1,989 million and were intended for purchases of stock under the stock repurchase program then in affect and for general corporate purposes, including capital expenditures and working capital. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are currently material or reasonably likely to be material to our financial position or results of operations. Contractual Obligations Contractual obligations represent future cash commitments and liabilities under agreements with third parties, and exclude contingent liabilities for which we cannot reasonably predict future payment. Accordingly, the table below excludes contractual obligations relating to milestone and royalty payments due to third parties, all of which are contingent upon certain future events. Such events could include, but are not limited to, development 75 Table of Contents milestones, regulatory approvals and product sales. Additionally, the expected timing of payment of the obligations presented below is estimated based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed-upon terms or amounts for some obligations. The following chart represents our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2006, aggregated by type (amounts in millions): Payments due by period Contractual obligations Total Less than 1 year 1-3 years 4-5 years More than 5 years Long-term debt obligations(1) $ 10,328 $ 1,997 (2) $ 1,215 $ 2,635 $ 4,481 Operating lease obligations 1,230 96 197 185 752 Purchase obligations(3) 3,724 1,911 1,209 435 169 Total contractual obligations $ 15,282 $ 4,004 $ 2,621 $ 3,255 $ 5,402 (1) The long-term obligation amounts in the above table differ from the related carrying amounts on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2006 due to the accretion of the original issue discount on the 2032 Convertible Notes and 2032 Modified Convertible Notes and the inclusion of future interest payments. Future interest payments are included on the 2007 Notes, the 2009 Notes, the 2011 Convertible Notes, the 2013 Convertible Notes, the 2014 Notes and the Century Notes at fixed rates of 6.5%, 4.00%, 0.125%, 0.375%, 4.85% and 8.1%, respectively, through maturity in 2007, 2009, 2011, 2013, 2014 and 2097, respectively. (2) Holders of the 2032 Modified Convertible Notes may require us to purchase all or a portion of the notes on specific dates the next of which is March 1, 2007 at the original issuance price plus accrued original issue discount ( accreted value ) through the purchase dates. Consequently, the amounts above reflect the 2032 Modified Convertible Notes accreted value on March 1, 2007, the next put date. (See Note 5, Financing arrangements to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the terms of the convertible notes.) (3) Purchase obligations primarily relate to (1) our long-term supply agreement with BI Pharma for the manufacture of commercial quantities of ENBREL, which are based on firm commitments for the purchase of production capacity for ENBREL and reflect certain estimates such as production run success rates and bulk drug yields achieved; (2) R&D commitments (including those related to clinical trials) for new and existing products; (3) capital expenditures for further expansion of the Puerto Rico bulk manufacturing, formulation, fill and finish facilities, the start of construction of a new bulk manufacturing, formulation, fill and finish facility and other site infrastructure support in Ireland, the expansion of R&D operations in the United States; and (4) open purchase orders for the acquisition of goods and services in the ordinary course of business. Our obligation to pay certain of these amounts may be reduced based on certain future events. Summary of Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the notes to the financial statements. Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex, and therefore, actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 76 Table of Contents Product sales, sales incentives and returns Sales of our products are recognized when shipped and title and risk of loss have passed. Product sales are recorded net of accruals for estimated rebates, wholesaler chargebacks, discounts and other incentives (collectively sales incentives ) and returns. For additional discussion regarding revenue recognition, see EPOGEN revenue recognition below. In the United States, we utilize wholesalers as the principal means of distributing our products to healthcare providers such as clinics, hospitals and pharmacies. Products we sell outside the United States are principally distributed to hospitals and/or wholesalers depending upon the distribution practice in each country for which the product has been launched. We monitor the inventory levels of our products at our wholesale distributors using third-party data and we believe that wholesaler inventories have been maintained at appropriate levels (generally two to three weeks) given end-user demand. Accordingly, historical fluctuations in wholesaler inventory levels have not significantly impacted our method of estimating sales incentives and returns. Accruals for sales incentives are recorded in the same period that the related sales are recorded and are recognized as a reduction in product sales. Sales incentive accruals are based on reasonable estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales. These estimates take into consideration current contractual and statutory requirements, specific known market events and trends, internal and external historical data and forecasted customer buying patterns. Sales incentives are product-specific and, therefore, for any given year, can be impacted by the mix of products sold. For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, reductions in product sales relating to sales incentives are comprised of the following (amounts in millions): 2006 2005 2004 Rebates $ 2,164 $ 1,344 $ 1,033 Wholesaler chargebacks 1,636 1,559 1,069 Discounts and other incentives 653 891 490 Total sales incentives $ 4,453 $ 3,794 $ 2,592 Percent of gross product sales 24% 24% 20% Rebates earned by healthcare providers such as clinics, hospitals and pharmacies in the United States are the sales incentives that are most difficult to estimate. These rebates are performance-based offers that are primarily based on attaining contractually-specified sales volumes and growth. As a result, the calculation of the accrual for these rebates is complicated by the need to estimate customer buying patterns and the resulting applicable contractual rebate rate(s) to be earned over a contractual period. These rebates totaled $2,164 million in 2006, $1,344 million in 2005 and $1,033 million in 2004. We believe that the methodology we use to accrue for rebates is reasonable and appropriate given current facts and circumstances. However, actual results may differ. Based on our recent experience, changes in annual estimates related to prior annual periods have been less than 1.5% of the estimated rebate amounts charged against product sales for such periods. These changes in annual estimates substantially relate to sales made in the immediately preceding annual period. A 1.5% change in our rebate estimate attributable to rebates recognized in 2006 would have had an impact of approximately $32 million on our 2006 product sales and a corresponding impact on our financial condition and liquidity. Wholesaler chargebacks are another type of arrangement included in sales incentives that relate to our contractual agreements to sell products to healthcare providers in the United States at fixed prices that are lower than the list prices we charge wholesalers. When the healthcare providers purchase our products through wholesalers at these reduced prices, the wholesaler charges us for the difference between the prices they pay us and the prices they sold the products to the healthcare providers. These chargebacks from wholesalers totaled $1,636 million in 2006, $1,559 million in 2005 and $1,069 million in 2004. Accruals for wholesaler chargebacks are less difficult to estimate than rebates and closely approximate actual results since chargeback amounts are fixed at the date of purchase by the healthcare provider and we settle these deductions generally within a few weeks of incurring the liability. 77 Table of Contents Amounts accrued for sales incentives are adjusted when trends or significant events indicate that adjustment is appropriate. Accruals are also adjusted to reflect actual results. However, such adjustments to date have not been material to our results of operations or financial position. The following table summarizes amounts recorded in accrued liabilities regarding sales incentives (amounts in millions): Balance at Beginning of Period Amounts Charged Against Product Sales* Payments Balance at End of Period Year ended: December 31, 2006 $ 864 $ 4,453 $ 4,238 $ 1,079 December 31, 2005 $ 589 $ 3,794 $ 3,519 $ 864 * Includes immaterial amounts related to prior year product sales based on changes in estimates. Such amounts represented approximately 1% of incentive amounts charged against product sales for both 2006 and 2005. Accruals for estimated sales returns are recorded in the same period that the related product sales are recorded and are recognized as reductions in product sales. Returns are estimated through comparison of historical return data to their related sales on a production lot basis. Historical rates of return are determined for each product and are adjusted for known or expected changes in the marketplace specific to each product when appropriate. Historically, sales returns have been insignificant, amounting to approximately 1% of gross product sales. EPOGEN revenue recognition We have the exclusive right to sell Epoetin alfa for dialysis, certain diagnostics and all non-human, non-research uses in the United States. We sell Epoetin alfa under the brand name EPOGEN . We granted to Johnson & Johnson a license relating to Epoetin alfa for sales in the United States for all human uses except dialysis and diagnostics. This license agreement, which is perpetual, may be terminated for various reasons, including upon mutual agreement of the parties or default. The parties are required to compensate each other for Epoetin alfa sales that either party makes into the other party exclusive market, sometimes referred to as spillover. Accordingly, we do not recognize product sales we make into the exclusive market of Johnson & Johnson and do recognize the product sales made by Johnson & Johnson into our exclusive market. The amount of EPOGEN product sales we recognize each period consists of: (i) the amount of EPOGEN we ship to our customers who are wholesale distributors of pharmaceutical products and (ii) adjustments for spillover, as described below. Sales to our customers are evidenced by binding written agreements and purchase orders, and accordingly, the amounts are fixed and determinable. The calculated spillover amount has no impact on the amounts owed to us by our customers. We are employing an arbitrated audit methodology to measure each party spillover based on independent third-party data on shipments to end users and their estimated usage. Data on end user usage is derived in part using market sampling techniques, and accordingly, the results of such sampling can produce variability in the amount of recognized spillover. We initially recognize spillover based on estimates of shipments to end users and their usage, utilizing historical third-party data and subsequently adjust such amounts based on revised third-party data as received. Differences between initial estimates of spillover and amounts based on revised third-party data could produce materially different amounts for recognized EPOGEN sales. However, such differences to date have not been material. Deferred income taxes Our effective tax rate reflects the impact of undistributed foreign earnings for which no U.S. taxes have been provided because such earnings are intended to be invested indefinitely outside the United States based on our projected cash flow, working capital and long-term investment requirements of our U.S. and foreign operations. If future events, including material changes in estimates of cash, working capital and long-term investment requirements necessitate that certain assets associated with these earnings be repatriated to the United States, an additional tax provision and related liability would be required which could materially impact our future effective tax rate. 78 Table of Contents The American Jobs Creation Act was enacted on October 22, 2004. One provision of the American Jobs Creation Act effectively reduced the tax rate on a qualifying repatriation of earnings by providing for an 85% dividend-received deduction. In the fourth quarter of 2005, we repatriated $500 million under the American Jobs Creation Act, which was the maximum amount of foreign earnings qualifying for the reduced rate. The tax expense incurred on this repatriation was approximately $43 million. We intend to continue to indefinitely reinvest any undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that were not repatriated under the American Jobs Creation Act. Contingencies In the ordinary course of business, we are involved in various legal proceedings such as intellectual property disputes, contractual disputes, tax claims and governmental investigations. Certain of these proceedings are discussed in Item 3. Legal Proceedings. We record accruals for such contingencies to the extent we conclude their occurrence is both probable and estimable. We consider all relevant factors when making assessments regarding these contingencies. Our income tax returns are routinely audited by the IRS and various state and foreign tax authorities. Significant disputes may arise with these tax authorities involving issues of the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions because of differing interpretations of tax laws and regulations. We periodically evaluate our exposures associated with tax filing positions. While we believe our positions comply with applicable laws, we record liabilities based upon estimates of the ultimate outcomes of these matters. While it is not possible to accurately predict or determine the eventual outcome of these items, we do not believe any such items currently pending will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or liquidity, although an adverse resolution in any quarterly or annual reporting period of one or more of these items could have a material impact on the consolidated results of operations for that period. Valuation of acquired intangible assets We have acquired and continue to acquire intangible assets primarily via the acquisition of biotechnology companies. These intangible assets primarily consist of technology associated with human therapeutic products and in-process product candidates as well as goodwill arising in business combinations. When significant identifiable intangible assets are acquired, an independent third-party valuation firm is engaged to assist in determining the fair values of these assets as of the acquisition date. Discounted cash flow models are typically used in these valuations, and these models require the use of significant estimates and assumptions including but not limited to: determining the timing and expected costs to complete the in-process projects, projecting regulatory approvals, estimating future cash flows from product sales resulting from completed products and in-process projects and developing appropriate discount rates and probability rates by project. We believe the fair values assigned to the intangible assets acquired are based upon reasonable estimates and assumptions given available facts and circumstances as of the acquisition dates.
