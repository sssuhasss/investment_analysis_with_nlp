Net Interest Expense Net interest expense increased $23 million in 2016 compared with 2015 due primarily to new debt issuances for renewable electric production projects. Income Tax Expense Income taxes increased $31 million in 2016 compared with 2015 due primarily to higher income before income tax expense ($38 million), an increase to deferred state income taxes as a result of the sale of the retail electric supply business ($4 million) and an increase in valuation allowances against state net operating loss carryforwards ($3 million), offset in part by higher production tax credits ($10 million) and the reversal of uncertain tax positions ($4 million). CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2017 69 Con Edison Transmission Other Income (Deductions) Other income (deductions) increased $43 million in 2016 compared with 2015 due primarily to earnings from equity investments in 2016 (see Note U to the financial statements in Item 8). Income Tax Expense Income taxes increased $14 million in 2016 compared with 2015 due primarily to higher income before income tax expense. Other For Con Edison, Other also includes intercompany eliminations relating to operating revenues and operating expenses. Liquidity and Capital Resources The Companies liquidity reflects cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as shown on their respective consolidated statements of cash flows and as discussed below. The principal factors affecting Con Edison liquidity are its investments in the Utilities, the Clean Energy Businesses and Con Edison Transmission, the dividends it pays to its shareholders and the dividends it receives from the Utilities and cash flows from financing activities discussed below. The principal factors affecting CECONY liquidity are its cash flows from operating activities, cash used in investing activities (including construction expenditures), the dividends it pays to Con Edison and cash flows from financing activities discussed below. The Companies generally maintain minimal cash balances and use short-term borrowings to meet their working capital needs and other cash requirements. The Companies repay their short-term borrowings using funds from long-term financings and operating activities. The Utilities cost of capital, including working capital, is reflected in the rates they charge to their customers. Each of the Companies believes that it will be able to meet its reasonably likely short-term and long-term cash requirements. See The Companies Require Access to Capital Markets to Satisfy Funding Requirements, "Changes To Tax Laws Could Adversely Affect the Companies" and The Companies Also Face Other Risks That Are Beyond Their Control in Item 1A, and Capital Requirements and Resources in Item 1. Changes in the Companies cash and temporary cash investments resulting from operating, investing and financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 are summarized as follows: Con Edison (Millions of Dollars) 2017 2016 Variance 2017 vs. 2016 2015 Variance 2016 vs. 2015 Operating activities $3,367 $3,459 $(92) $3,277 $182 Investing activities (3,703) (4,976) 1,273 (3,657) (1,319) Financing activities 357 1,345 (988) 629 716 Net change for the period 21 (172) 193 249 (421) Balance at beginning of period 776 944 (168) 699 245 Balance at end of period 797 772 25 948 (176) Less: Change in cash balances held for sale (4) 4 4 (8) Balance at end of period excluding held for sale $797 $776 $21 $944 $(168) 70 CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2017 CECONY (Millions of Dollars) 2017 2016 Variance 2017 vs. 2016 2015 Variance 2016 vs. 2015 Operating activities $2,866 $3,038 $(172) $2,819 $219 Investing activities (3,078) (2,739) (339) (2,638) (101) Financing activities 240 (440) 680 17 (457) Net change for the period 28 (141) 169 198 (339) Balance at beginning of period 702 843 (141) 645 198 Balance at end of period $730 $702 $28 $843 $(141) Cash Flows from Operating Activities The Utilities cash flows from operating activities reflect primarily their energy sales and deliveries and cost of operations. The volume of energy sales and deliveries is affected primarily by factors external to the Utilities, such as growth of customer demand, weather, market prices for energy and economic conditions. Measures that promote distributed energy resources, such as distributed generation, demand reduction and energy efficiency, also affect the volume of energy sales and deliveries. See "Utility Regulation State Utility Regulation New York Utility Industry Reforming the Energy Vision," "Competition" and "Environmental Matters Climate Change" in Item 1. Under the revenue decoupling mechanisms in the Utilities New York electric and gas rate plans, changes in delivery volumes from levels assumed when rates were approved may affect the timing of cash flows, but generally not net income. The prices at which the Utilities provide energy to their customers are determined in accordance with their rate plans. In general, changes in the Utilities cost of purchased power, fuel and gas may affect the timing of cash flows, but not net income, because the costs are recovered in accordance with rate plans. See Recoverable Energy Costs in Note A to the financial statements in Item 8. Pursuant to their rate plans, the Utilities have recovered from customers a portion of the tax liability they will pay in the future as a result of temporary differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities. These temporary differences affect the timing of cash flows, but not net income, as the Companies are required to record deferred tax assets and liabilities at the current corporate tax rate for the temporary differences. For the Utilities, the reduction of the corporate tax rate to 21 percent under the TCJA is expected to result in decreased cash flows from operating activities as and when the rates the Utilities charge their customers are adjusted to reflect the reduction. See Changes To Tax Laws Could Adversely Affect the Companies, in Item 1A, Federal Income Tax in Note A, Rate Plans in Note B, Other Regulatory Matters in Note B and Note L to the financial statements in Item 8. Net income is the result of cash and non-cash (or accrual) transactions. Only cash transactions affect the Companies cash flows from operating activities. Principal non-cash charges or credits include depreciation, deferred income tax expense and amortizations of certain regulatory assets and liabilities. Non-cash charges or credits may also be accrued under the revenue decoupling and cost reconciliation mechanisms in the Utilities New York electric and gas rate plans. See Rate Plans CECONY Electric and Gas" and "Rate Plans O&R New York Electric and Gas in Note B to the financial statements in Item 8. Net cash flows from operating activities in 2017 for Con Edison and CECONY were $92 million and $172 million lower, respectively, than in 2016 . The change in net cash flows for Con Edison and CECONY reflects primarily higher cash paid for income taxes, net of refunds received, in 2017 as compared with 2016 of $151 million and $270 million , respectively. The income tax refund received in 2016 reflected the extension of bonus depreciation in late 2015, resulting in a refund of the 2015 estimated federal tax payments. See Note L to the financial statements in Item 8. The change in net cash flows for Con Edison and CECONY also reflects higher construction expenditures in accounts payable of $44 million and $56 million , respectively. Net cash flows from operating activities in 2016 for Con Edison and CECONY were $182 million and $219 million higher, respectively, than in 2015. The increase in net cash flows for Con Edison and CECONY reflects primarily lower income taxes paid, net of refunds received in 2016 as compared with 2015 ($144 million and $325 million, respectively), offset by higher interest payments ($67 million and $27 million, respectively) in 2016. The amount and timing of income tax payments and refunds received reflect, among other things, the extension of bonus depreciation tax provisions. See Note L to the financial statements in Item 8. The change in net cash flows also reflects the timing of payments for and recovery of energy costs. This timing is reflected within changes to accounts receivable customers, recoverable and refundable energy costs within other regulatory assets and liabilities and accounts payable balances. CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2017 71 Cash Flows Used in Investing Activities Net cash flows used in investing activities for Con Edison and CECONY were $1,273 million lower and $339 million higher, respectively, in 2017 than in 2016 . The change for Con Edison reflects primarily lower new investments in electric and gas transmission projects ( $1,031 million ) and renewable electric production projects ( $357 million ) and a decrease in non-utility construction expenditures ( $430 million ), offset in part by lower proceeds from the sale and transfer of assets ($340 million) and increased utility construction expenditures ( $193 million ). The change for CECONY primarily reflects increased utility construction expenditures ( $168 million ) and the absence of proceeds from the transfer of assets to NY Transco in 2016 ( $122 million ). Net cash flows used in investing activities for Con Edison and CECONY were $1,319 million and $101 million higher, respectively, in 2016 than in 2015. The change for Con Edison reflects primarily increased investments in electric and gas transmission projects ($1,076 million), increased utility construction expenditures in 2016 ($273 million) and increased non-utility construction expenditures related to development of renewable electric production projects ($353 million), offset in part by the proceeds from the sale and transfer of assets ($374 million). The change for CECONY reflects primarily increased utility construction expenditures in 2016 ($262 million), offset in part by the proceeds from the transfer of assets to NY Transco ($122 million). Cash Flows From Financing Activities Net cash flows from financing activities in 2017 for Con Edison and CECONY were $988 million lower and $680 million higher, respectively, than in 2016 . Net cash flows from financing activities in 2016 for Con Edison and CECONY were $716 million higher and $457 million lower, respectively, than in 2015 . Net cash flows from financing activities during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 reflect the following Con Edison transactions: 2017 Issued 4.1 million common shares resulting in net proceeds of $343 million, after issuance expenses, that were invested by Con Edison in its subsidiaries, principally CECONY and the Clean Energy Businesses, for funding of their construction expenditures and for other general corporate purposes; and Issued $400 million aggregate principal amount of 2.00 percent debentures, due 2020, and prepaid the June 2016 $400 million variable rate term loan that was to mature in 2018. 2016 Issued approximately 10 million common shares resulting in net proceeds of $702 million, after issuance expenses, and $500 million aggregate principal amount of 2.00 percent debentures, due 2021, the net proceeds from the sale of which were used in connection with the acquisition by a CET Gas subsidiary of a 50 percent equity interest in Stagecoach, a gas pipeline and storage joint venture (see "Con Edison Transmission" in Item 1), and for general corporate purposes. Con Edison had no issuances of long-term debt in 2015. Con Edison cash flows from financing activities in 2017, 2016 and 2015 also reflect the proceeds, and reduction in cash used for reinvested dividends, resulting from the issuance of common shares under the company dividend reinvestment, stock purchase and long-term incentive plans of $97 million , $97 million and $29 million , respectively, net of repurchases in 2015.

Other Deferred Charges and Noncurrent Assets The increase in other deferred charges and noncurrent assets for Con Edison reflects deferred costs of $33 million related to aid provided by the Utilities in the restoration of power in Puerto Rico in the aftermath of September 2017 hurricanes. 74 CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2017 Regulatory Asset for Unrecognized Pension and Other Postretirement Costs and Liability for Pension and Retiree Benefits The decrease in the regulatory asset for unrecognized pension and other postretirement costs and the liability for pension and retiree benefits reflects the final actuarial valuation of the pension and other retiree benefit plans as measured at December 31, 2017 , in accordance with the accounting rules for retirement benefits. The change in the regulatory asset also reflects the year's amortization of accounting costs. The change in the liability for pension and retiree benefits reflects in part contributions to the plans made by the Utilities in 2017 . See Notes B, E and F to the financial statements in Item 8. Deferred Income Taxes and Unamortized Investment Tax Credits, Regulatory Asset and Liability for Future Income Tax The decrease in deferred income taxes and unamortized investment tax credits, decrease in regulatory asset for future income tax and increase in regulatory liability for future income tax reflects the re-measurement of the Companies deferred tax assets and liabilities based upon the 21 percent corporate income tax rate under the TCJA. See Federal Income Taxes in Note A, Other Regulatory Matters in Note B and Note L to the financial statements in Item 8. System Benefit Charge The increase in the liability for the system benefit charge reflects amounts collected by the Utilities from their customers that will be required to be paid to NYSERDA. See Environmental Matters Climate Change in Item 1. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements None of the Companies transactions, agreements or other contractual arrangements meet the SEC definition of off-balance sheet arrangements. Regulatory Matters For information about the Utilities rate plans and other regulatory matters affecting the Companies, see Utility Regulation in Item 1 and Note B to the financial statements in Item 8. Risk Factors The Companies businesses are influenced by many factors that are difficult to predict, and that involve uncertainties that may materially affect actual operating results, cash flows and financial condition. See Risk Factors in Item 1A. Application of Critical Accounting Policies The Companies financial statements reflect the application of their accounting policies, which conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The Companies critical accounting policies include industry-specific accounting applicable to regulated public utilities and accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits, contingencies, long-lived assets, goodwill and derivative instruments. Accounting for Regulated Public Utilities The Utilities are subject to the accounting rules for regulated operations and the accounting requirements of the FERC and the state public utility regulatory commissions having jurisdiction. The accounting rules for regulated operations specify the economic effects that result from the causal relationship of costs and revenues in the rate-regulated environment and how these effects are to be accounted for by a regulated enterprise. Revenues intended to cover some costs may be recorded either before or after the costs are incurred. If regulation provides assurance that incurred costs will be recovered in the future, these costs would be recorded as deferred charges, or regulatory assets, under the accounting rules for regulated operations. If revenues are recorded for costs that are expected to be incurred in the future, these revenues would be recorded as deferred credits, or regulatory liabilities, under the accounting rules for regulated operations. The Utilities principal regulatory assets and liabilities are listed in Note B to the financial statements in Item 8. The Utilities are each receiving or being credited with a return on all regulatory assets for which a cash outflow has been made. The Utilities are each paying or being charged with a return on all regulatory liabilities for which a cash inflow has been received. The regulatory assets and liabilities will be recovered from customers, or applied for customer benefit, in accordance with rate provisions approved by the applicable public utility regulatory commission. CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2017 75 In the event that regulatory assets of the Utilities were no longer probable of recovery, as required by the accounting rules for regulated operations, these regulatory assets would be charged to earnings. At December 31, 2017 , the regulatory assets for Con Edison and CECONY were $4,333 million and $3,925 million , respectively. Accounting for Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits The Utilities provide pensions and other postretirement benefits to substantially all of their employees and retirees. The Clean Energy Businesses and Con Edison Transmission also provide such benefits to certain employees. The Companies account for these benefits in accordance with the accounting rules for retirement benefits. In addition, the Utilities apply the accounting rules for regulated operations to account for the regulatory treatment of these obligations (which, as described in Note B to the financial statements in Item 8, reconciles the amounts reflected in rates for the costs of the benefit to the costs actually incurred). In applying these accounting policies, the Companies have made critical estimates related to actuarial assumptions, including assumptions of expected returns on plan assets, discount rates, health care cost trends and future compensation. See Notes A, E and F to the financial statements in Item 8 for information about the Companies pension and other postretirement benefits, the actuarial assumptions, actual performance, amortization of investment and other actuarial gains and losses and calculated plan costs for 2017 , 2016 and 2015 . The discount rate for determining the present value of future period benefit payments is determined using a model to match the durations of highly-rated (Aa or higher by either Moody or S&P) corporate bonds with the projected stream of benefit payments. In determining the health care cost trend rate, the Companies review actual recent cost trends and projected future trends. The cost of pension and other postretirement benefits in future periods will depend on actual returns on plan assets, assumptions for future periods, contributions and benefit experience. Con Edison and CECONY current estimates for 2018 are increases, compared with 2017 , in their pension and other postretirement benefits costs of $59 million and $51 million, respectively. The following table illustrates the effect on 2018 pension and other postretirement costs of changing the critical actuarial assumptions, while holding all other actuarial assumptions constant: Actuarial Assumption Change in Assumption Pension Other Postretirement Benefits Total (Millions of Dollars) Increase in accounting cost: Discount rate Con Edison (0.25 )% $57 $3 $60 CECONY (0.25 )% $54 $2 $56 Expected return on plan assets Con Edison (0.25 )% $33 $2 $35 CECONY (0.25 )% $31 $2 $33 Health care trend rate Con Edison 1.00 % $ $3 $3 CECONY 1.00 % $ $(3) $(3) Increase in projected benefit obligation: Discount rate Con Edison (0.25 )% $591 $37 $628 CECONY (0.25 )% $557 $28 $585 Health care trend rate Con Edison 1.00 % $ $13 $13 CECONY 1.00 % $ $(20) $(20) A 5.0 percentage point variation in the actual annual return in 2018 , as compared with the expected annual asset return of 7.50 percent, would change pension and other postretirement benefit costs for Con Edison and CECONY by approximately $42 million and $39 million, respectively, in 2019 . 76 CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2017 Pension benefits are provided through a pension plan maintained by Con Edison to which CECONY, O&R, the Clean Energy Businesses and Con Edison Transmission make contributions for their participating employees. Pension accounting by the Utilities includes an allocation of plan assets. The Companies policy is to fund their pension and other postretirement benefit accounting costs to the extent tax deductible, and for the Utilities, to the extent these costs are recovered under their rate plans. The Companies were not required to make cash contributions to the pension plan in 2017 under funding regulations and tax laws. However, CECONY and O&R made discretionary contributions to the pension plan in 2017 of $412 million and $38 million, respectively. In 2018 , CECONY and O&R expect to make contributions to the pension plan of $435 million and $37 million, respectively. See Expected Contributions in Notes E and F to the financial statements in Item 8. Accounting for Contingencies The accounting rules for contingencies apply to an existing condition, situation or set of circumstances involving uncertainty as to possible loss that will ultimately be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. Known material contingencies, which are described in the notes to the financial statements, include certain regulatory matters (Note B), the Utilities responsibility for hazardous substances, such as asbestos, PCBs and coal tar that have been used or generated in the course of operations (Note G) and other contingencies (Note H). In accordance with the accounting rules, the Companies have accrued estimates of losses relating to the contingencies as to which loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated and no liability has been accrued for contingencies as to which loss is not probable or cannot be reasonably estimated. The Utilities recover costs for asbestos lawsuits, workers compensation and environmental remediation pursuant to their current rate plans. Generally, changes during the terms of the rate plans to the amounts accrued for these contingencies would not impact earnings. Accounting for Long-Lived and Intangible Assets The accounting rules for certain long-lived assets and intangible assets with definite lives require testing for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. The carrying amount of a long-lived asset or intangible asset with a definite life is deemed not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. Under the accounting rules, an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount is not recoverable from such cash flows, and exceeds its fair value, which approximates market value. In 2015, Con Edison recorded a $5 million impairment charge on Pike assets held for sale. See Note U to the financial statements in Item 8. No impairment charges on long-lived assets were recognized in 2017 or 2016. No impairment charges on intangible assets with definite lives were recognized in 2017, 2016 or 2015. For information about the Companies' intangible assets, see Note K to the financial statements in Item 8. Accounting for Goodwill In accordance with the accounting rules for goodwill and intangible assets, Con Edison is required to test goodwill for impairment annually or whenever there is a triggering event. See Goodwill in Note A and Note K to the financial statements in Item 8. The company has an option to first make a qualitative assessment that evaluates relevant events and circumstances, such as industry and market conditions, regulatory environment and financial performance. If, after applying the optional qualitative assessment, it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the company then applies a two-step, quantitative goodwill impairment test. The first step of the quantitative goodwill impairment test compares the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value, including goodwill. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired. If the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The second step requires a calculation of the implied fair value of goodwill. Goodwill was $428 million at December 31, 2017 , which consists of $406 million related to the 1999 O&R merger, $8 million related to a gas storage company owned by CET Gas and $14 million related to a residential solar company owned by the Clean Energy Businesses. CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2017 77 During 2017, Con Edison elected to perform the optional qualitative assessment for goodwill related to the O&R merger and the gas storage company and determined no quantitative analysis was required and no goodwill impairment was recorded. The first step of the quantitative analysis was performed for the residential solar company owned by the Clean Energy Businesses. Based on the results, it was determined that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded the carrying value, and as such, the second step was not required and no goodwill impairment was recorded. The most significant assumptions for the goodwill impairment test relate to the estimates of reporting unit fair values. The company estimated fair values using primarily discounted cash flows. Estimates of future cash flows, projected growth rates and discount rates inherent in the cash flow estimates for Con Edison subsidiaries other than the Utilities may vary significantly from actual results, which could result in a future impairment of goodwill. During 2016, the impairment tests required a second-step assessment to be performed on goodwill of $15 million related to two energy service companies owned by the Clean Energy Businesses. Based on the results of step two of the impairment test, the Clean Energy Businesses recorded an impairment charge of $15 million ($12 million, net of tax). A second-step assessment of goodwill related to the O&R merger, residential solar company and gas storage company was not required. Accounting for Derivative Instruments The Companies apply the accounting rules for derivatives and hedging to their derivative financial instruments. The Companies use derivative financial instruments to hedge market price fluctuations in related underlying transactions for the physical purchase and sale of electricity and gas. The Utilities are permitted by their respective regulators to reflect in rates all reasonably incurred gains and losses on these instruments. The Clean Energy Businesses have also hedged interest rate risk on certain debt securities. See Financial and Commodity Market Risks, below and Note O to the financial statements in Item 8. Where the Companies are required to make mark-to-market estimates pursuant to the accounting rules, the estimates of gains and losses at a particular period end do not reflect the end results of particular transactions, and will most likely not reflect the actual gain or loss at the conclusion of a transaction. Substantially all of the estimated gains or losses are based on prices supplied by external sources such as the fair value of exchange-traded futures and options and the fair value of positions for which price quotations are available through or derived from brokers or other market sources. Financial and Commodity Market Risks The Companies are subject to various risks and uncertainties associated with financial and commodity markets. The most significant market risks include interest rate risk, commodity price risk, credit risk and investment risk. Interest Rate Risk The Companies' interest rate risk relates primarily to variable rate debt and to new debt financing needed to fund capital requirements, including the construction expenditures of the Utilities and maturing debt securities. Con Edison and its businesses manage interest rate risk through the issuance of mostly fixed-rate debt with varying maturities and through opportunistic refinancing of debt. Con Edison and CECONY estimate that at December 31, 2017 , a 10 percent increase in interest rates applicable to its variable rate debt would result in an increase in annual interest expense of $3 million. Under CECONY current electric, gas and steam rate plans, variations in actual variable rate tax-exempt debt interest expense are reconciled to levels reflected in rates. Commodity Price Risk Con Edison commodity price risk relates primarily to the purchase and sale of electricity, gas and related derivative instruments. The Utilities and the Clean Energy Businesses apply risk management strategies to mitigate their related exposures. See Note O to the financial statements in Item 8. Con Edison estimates that, as of December 31, 2017 , a 10 percent decline in market prices would result in a decline in fair value of $82 million for the derivative instruments used by the Utilities to hedge purchases of electricity and gas, of which $74 million is for CECONY and $8 million is for O&R. Con Edison expects that any such change in fair value would be largely offset by directionally opposite changes in the cost of the electricity and gas purchased. In accordance with provisions approved by state regulators, the Utilities generally recover from customers the costs they incur for energy purchased for their customers, including gains and losses on certain 78 CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2017 derivative instruments used to hedge energy purchased and related costs. See Recoverable Energy Costs in Note A to the financial statements in Item 8. The Clean Energy Businesses use a value-at-risk (VaR) model to assess the market price risk of their portfolio of electricity and gas commodity fixed-price purchase and sales commitments, physical forward contracts, generating assets and commodity derivative instruments. VaR represents the potential change in fair value of the portfolio due to changes in market prices for a specified time period and confidence level. These businesses estimate VaR across their portfolio using a delta-normal variance/covariance model with a 95 percent confidence level, compare the measured VaR results against performance due to actual prices and stress test the portfolio each quarter using an assumed 30 percent price change from forecast. Since the VaR calculation involves complex methodologies and estimates and assumptions that are based on past experience, it is not necessarily indicative of future results. VaR for the portfolio, assuming a one-day holding period, for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively, was as follows: 95% Confidence Level, One-Day Holding Period 2017 2016 (Millions of Dollars) Average for the period $ $2 High 1 4 Low 1 Credit Risk The Companies are exposed to credit risk related to transactions entered into primarily for the various energy supply and hedging activities by the Utilities and the Clean Energy Businesses. See the discussion of credit exposure in Note O to the financial statements in Item 8. Investment Risk The Companies investment risk relates to the investment of plan assets for their pension and other postretirement benefit plans and to the investments of the Clean Energy Businesses and Con Edison Transmission that are accounted for under the equity method. See Application of Critical Accounting Policies Accounting for Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits, above and Notes A, E and F to the financial statements in Item 8. The Companies current investment policy for pension plan assets includes investment targets of 53 to 63 percent equities and 35 to 49 percent fixed income and other securities. At December 31, 2017 , the pension plan investments consisted of 58 percent equity and 42 percent fixed income and other securities. For the Utilities pension and other postretirement benefit plans, regulatory accounting treatment is generally applied in accordance with the accounting rules for regulated operations. In accordance with the Statement of Policy issued by the NYSPSC and its current electric, gas and steam rate plans, CECONY defers for payment to or recovery from customers the difference between the pension and other postretirement benefit expenses and the amounts for such expenses reflected in rates. Generally, O&R also defers such difference pursuant to its rate plans. Environmental Matters For information concerning climate change, environmental sustainability, potential liabilities arising from laws and regulations protecting the environment and other environmental matters, see Environmental Matters in Item 1 and Note G to the financial statements in Item 8. Impact of Inflation The Companies are affected by the decline in the purchasing power of the dollar caused by inflation. Regulation permits the Utilities to recover through depreciation only the historical cost of their plant assets even though in an inflationary economy the cost to replace the assets upon their retirement will substantially exceed historical costs. The impact is, however, partially offset by the repayment of the Companies long-term debt in dollars of lesser value than the dollars originally borrowed. Material Contingencies For information concerning potential liabilities arising from the Companies material contingencies, see Application of Critical Accounting Policies Accounting for Contingencies, above, and Notes B, G and H to the financial statements in Item 8.
