Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Note numbers refer to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS We discuss below the results of our operations for fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008 and the results of our operations for fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. We discuss our cash flows and current financial condition under Capital Resources and Liquidity. Outlook Overall, we remain optimistic about the long-term prospects for the worldwide contact lens and women healthcare markets. However, recent events affecting the economy as a whole, including the uncertainty and instability of the United States and international credit markets and ongoing recessionary pressures in the United States and globally, continue to represent a risk to our forecasted performance for fiscal year 2010 and beyond. We believe that CVI will continue to compete successfully in the worldwide contact lens market with its disposable spherical, toric and multifocal contact lenses offered in a variety of materials including using phosphorylcholine (PC) Technology and silicone hydrogel Aquaform technology. We believe that there will be lower contact lens wearer dropout rates as technology improves and the shift in practitioner preferences from low-featured commodity lenses to higher-value specialty and single-use lenses continue to support a favorable world market outlook. CVI expects greater market penetration in Europe and Asia as we roll out new products and continue to expand our presence in those regions. Sales of contact lenses utilizing silicone hydrogel materials, a major product material in the industry, have grown significantly. The Company launched Biofinity sphere in 2007 and Avaira sphere in 2008, both silicone hydrogel contact lens products. While customer reaction for these products has been favorable, our future growth may be limited by our late entry into the silicone hydrogel segment of the market. In addition to spheres, competitive silicone hydrogel toric products are making substantial gains in market share and represent a risk to our toric business. We launched a monthly silicone hydrogel toric lens, under the Biofinity label, in the first calendar quarter of 2009 and plan to launch a two-week silicone hydrogel toric, under the Avaira label, in fiscal year 2010. We believe that these products will allow us to compete in this market shift to silicone hydrogel torics. Our ability to succeed with silicone hydrogel products is an important factor to achieving our projected future levels of sales growth and profitability. We launched Proclear 1 Day in Japan in the first calendar quarter of 2009. We are also in the process of developing a number of new contact lens products to enhance CVI broad and competitive worldwide product lines. New products planned for introduction over the next two years include additional lenses utilizing silicone hydrogel and PC Technology materials and new lens designs, including toric and multifocal lenses. 40 Table of Contents THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) CSI is a leader in the fragmented medical device segment of women healthcare with strong brand awareness and market focused product offerings that appeal to an extensive customer base. CSI has been successful in identifying and acquiring selected smaller companies and product lines that improve its existing market position or serve new clinical areas. We intend to continue to invest in CSI business through acquisitions of companies and product lines. Regarding capital resources, we believe that cash and cash equivalents on hand of $3.9 million plus cash from operating activities and existing credit facilities will fund future operations, capital expenditures, cash dividends and acquisitions. 2009 Compared with 2008 Highlights: 2009 vs. 2008 Net sales up 3% to $1.08 billion from $1.05 billion in fiscal year 2008. Gross margin 55% of net sales down from 58%. Operating income up 18% to $149.9 million from $127.0 million. We recorded interest expense of $44.1 million for fiscal year 2009 compared to $50.8 million for 2008. Diluted earnings per share up 55% to $2.21 from $1.43. Operating cash flow $223.1 million up 131% from $96.5 million.

CVI develops, manufactures and markets a broad range of soft contact lenses for the worldwide vision care market. CSI develops, manufactures and markets medical devices, diagnostic products and surgical instruments and accessories used primarily by gynecologists and obstetricians. 41 Table of Contents THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Our consolidated net sales grew by 3% in 2009 and 11% in 2008. CVI achieved 3% net sales growth primarily on growth of disposable lenses, including single-use lenses, and the sale of our silicone hydrogel lenses, Biofinity and Avaira. CSI achieved 2% net sales growth in 2009 primarily due to 14% growth on products marketed directly to hospitals. Net Sales Growth ($ in millions) 2009 vs. 2008 2008 vs. 2007 Business unit CVI $ 30.5 3% $ 88.6 11% CSI $ 2.6 2% $ 13.6 9% CVI Net Sales Practitioner and patient preferences in the worldwide contact lens market continue to change. The major shifts are from: Commodity spherical lenses to value-added spherical lenses such as continuous wear lenses and lenses to alleviate dry eye symptoms as well as lenses with aspherical optical properties or higher oxygen permeable lenses such as silicone hydrogels. Commodity lenses to toric and multifocal lenses. Conventional lenses replaced annually to disposable and frequently replaced lenses. Disposable lenses are designed for either daily, two-week or monthly replacement; frequently replaced lenses are designed for replacement after one to three months. CVI product lines of toric and multifocal lenses, PC Technology brand spherical lenses, silicone hydrogel spherical lenses and single-use spherical lenses position us to take advantage of these trends. CVI silicone hydrogel spherical lens products, Biofinity and Avaira, are marketed in the United States, Europe and Asia Pacific, excluding Japan. However, we believe that it is important to develop a full range of toric and multifocal silicone hydrogel products due to increased pressure from silicone hydrogel toric products offered by our major competitors. CVI launched Biofinity toric, a silicone hydrogel toric lens in the first calendar quarter of 2009. CVI also plans to launch a second silicone hydrogel toric lens, Avaira toric, in fiscal year 2010. CVI introduced the following products during fiscal 2009: Proclear 1 Day in Japan Biofinity toric in the United States, Europe and Asia Pacific, excluding Japan Contact lens revenue includes sales of conventional, disposable, long-term extended wear lenses and single-use lenses, some of which are aspherically designed, and toric, multifocal and cosmetic lenses. Proclear aspheric, toric and multifocal lenses, manufactured using proprietary phosphorylcholine (PC) Technology, help enhance tissue/device compatibility and offer improved lens comfort. Biofinity and Avaira aspheric and toric lenses, manufactured using proprietary silicone hydrogel Aquaform Technology, increase oxygen transmissibility for longer wear. 42 Table of Contents THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Aspheric lenses correct for near- and farsightedness and have additional optical properties that help improve visual acuity in low light conditions and can correct low levels of astigmatism and low levels of presbyopia, an age-related vision defect. Toric lenses correct astigmatism by adding the additional optical properties of cylinder and axis, which correct for irregularities in the shape of the cornea. Multifocal lens designs correct presbyopia. Cosmetic lenses are opaque and color enhancing lenses that alter the natural appearance of the eye. CVI Net Sales by Region ($ in millions) 2009 2008 Growth Americas $ 392.8 $ 387.8 1 % EMEA 345.1 337.8 2 % Asia Pacific 171.6 153.4 12 % $ 909.5 $ 879.0 3 % CVI worldwide net sales grew 3%, 4% in constant currency. Americas sales grew 1%, 2% in constant currency, primarily due to market gains of CVI silicone hydrogel spherical and toric lenses, Biofinity and Avaira, PC Technology lenses and single-use lenses. EMEA sales grew 2%, 7% in constant currency, driven by increases in sales of Biofinity spherical and toric lenses and PC Technology lenses, including Proclear 1 Day lenses. Sales to the Asia Pacific region grew 12%, 6% in constant currency, primarily due to sales growth of single-use spherical and toric products and Biofinity lenses. Net sales growth includes increases in single-use spheres up 15%, at $190.2 million, all disposable spheres up 4% and total spheres up 3%. Silicone hydrogel spheres had sales of $99.7 million primarily in the United States and Europe. Our newly introduced silicone hydrogel toric lenses had sales of $12.4 million and single-use torics grew 71%, but total torics declined 7% primarily due to a continuing trend in the market toward silicone hydrogel toric lenses. Disposable multifocal lens sales grew 9% to $59.8 million. Older conventional lens products declined 20%, and cosmetic lenses declined 10%. Proclear products continued global market share gains as Proclear toric sales increased 5%, Proclear 1 Day spheres increased 59% and Proclear multifocal lenses increased 14%. CVI sales growth is driven primarily through increases in the volume of lenses sold as the market continues to move to more frequent replacement. While unit growth and product mix have influenced CVI sales growth, average realized prices by product have not materially influenced sales growth. CSI Net Sales CSI net sales increased 2% to $170.9 million. Sales of products marketed directly to hospitals grew 14% and now represent 33% of CSI sales. Women healthcare products used primarily by obstetricians and gynecologists generate 96% of CSI sales. The balance are sales of medical devices outside of women healthcare which CSI does not actively market. While unit growth and product mix have influenced organic sales growth, average realized prices by product have not materially influenced organic sales growth. 43 Table of Contents THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) 2008 Compared with 2007 Highlights: 2008 vs. 2007 Net sales up 11% to $1.05 billion from $945.2 million in fiscal year 2007. Gross profit up 17%; gross margin increased to 58% of net sales from 55%. Operating income up to $127.0 million from $45.9 million. We recorded tax expense of $10.7 million for fiscal year 2008 compared to $11.9 million for fiscal year 2007. Diluted earnings per share $1.43 up from a loss per share of 25 cents. Results for 2008 include $30.6 million of production start up costs, $1.9 million of distribution rationalization costs, $2.5 million of other restructuring and integration costs, $3.4 million of intellectual property and securities litigation costs and $2.9 million write-off of the debt issuance costs of our amended and restated credit agreement. Results from 2007 included $119.1 million of similar items.

AND SUBSIDIARIES Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) In 2008, CVI launched Biofinity and Avaira, its silicone hydrogel spherical lens products in the United States, Europe and Asia Pacific, excluding Japan. CVI toric products are facing increased pressure due to the launch of silicone hydrogel toric products by its major competitors. CVI began production of Biofinity toric, a silicone hydrogel toric lens, and launched this product in fiscal 2009. CVI introduced the following products during 2008: Avaira, a two-week silicone hydrogel spherical lens. Expanded power ranges for Biofinity, a monthly silicone hydrogel spherical lens. Expanded power ranges for Proclear 1 Day, a PC Technology, single-use spherical lens.

Americas sales grew 8%, 7% in constant currency, primarily due to market gains of CVI silicone hydrogel lenses, Biofinity and Avaira, PC Technology lenses and single-use lenses. EMEA sales grew 13%, 6% in constant currency, driven by increases in sales of Biofinity, disposable toric and disposable sphere products, including Proclear 1 Day lenses. Sales to the Asia Pacific region grew 18%, 14% in constant currency, primarily due to significant sales growth of single-use and other disposable sphere products, disposable toric products and Biofinity lenses. Net sales growth includes increases in single-use spheres up 45%, at $165.3 million, all disposable spheres up 18% and total spheres up 16%. Biofinity had sales of $50.7 million primarily in Europe and the United States, and Avaira had sales of $7.6 million in the United States. Disposable toric sales grew 11% with total toric sales up 8% and disposable multifocal sales up 26%. CVI line of specialty lenses grew 10%. Older conventional lens products declined 14%, and cosmetic lenses declined 2%. Proclear products continued global market share gains as Proclear toric sales increased 39% to $72.2 million, Proclear spheres, including Biomedics XC and Proclear 1 Day, increased 22% to $124.6 million and Proclear multifocal lenses, including Biomedics XC, increased 40% to $44.4 million. CVI sales growth was driven primarily through increases in the volume of lenses sold as the market continues to move to more frequent replacement. While unit growth and product mix have influenced CVI sales growth, average realized prices by product have not materially influenced sales growth. CSI Net Sales CSI net sales increased 9% to $168.3 million with organic sales growth of about 6%. Sales of products marketed directly to hospitals grew 19% and now represent 30% of CSI sales. Women healthcare products used primarily by obstetricians and gynecologists generate 95% of CSI sales. 45 Table of Contents THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) The balance are sales of medical devices outside of women healthcare which CSI does not actively market. While unit growth and product mix have influenced organic sales growth, average realized prices by product have not materially influenced organic sales growth. 2009 Compared to 2008 and 2008 Compared to 2007 Cost of Sales/Gross Profit Gross Profit Percentage of Net Sales 2009 2008 2007 CVI 54% 58% 54% CSI 60% 59% 59% Consolidated 55% 58% 55% CVI margin was 54% in fiscal 2009 compared with 58% in fiscal 2008. The decline is largely attributed to costs associated with inventory and equipment write-offs and idle equipment. Also, in our fiscal third quarter of 2009, we initiated the 2009 CooperVision Manufacturing restructuring plan to move contact lens manufacturing primarily from Norfolk, Virginia, to existing manufacturing operations in Juana Diaz, Puerto Rico, and Hamble, UK. In fiscal 2009, $5.0 million of costs associated with this manufacturing restructuring plan, primarily severance charges and accelerated depreciation, were recorded as costs of sales. As discussed below, we expect to incur similar costs related to this manufacturing restructuring plan through the fiscal first quarter of 2011. CSI margin was 60% in fiscal 2009 and 59% in fiscal 2008. Gross margin reflects CSI emphasis on organic growth, and the increase is a result of manufacturing efficiencies along with a changing product mix including higher margin products marketed directly to hospitals that represent 33% of net sales in fiscal 2009 compared to 30% in fiscal 2008. Selling, General and Administrative Expense (SGA) (In millions) 2009 2008 2007 CVI $ 309.9 $ 342.5 $ 322.0 CSI 53.7 57.7 54.5 Headquarters 28.0 29.1 31.5 $ 391.6 $ 429.3 $ 408.0 Consolidated SGA decreased by 9% in 2009 and increased 5% in 2008 and 14% in 2007. As a percentage of net sales, consolidated SGA decreased to 36% in 2009 from 41% in fiscal 2008 and 43% in 2007. The decrease in SGA is primarily due to recessionary cost control measures partially offset by costs supporting increased sales levels and lenses used in marketing programs. CVI SGA decreased 10% in fiscal 2009, primarily due to increased efficiencies as a result of the rationalization of distribution centers completed in fiscal 2008 and decreased marketing expenses from the prior year that included several new product launches. SGA costs also decreased as a result of the Critical Activity restructuring plan, discussed below, initiated in the fiscal first quarter of 2009. SGA as a percentage of net sales decreased to 34% in 2009 from 39% in 2008 and 41% in 2007. 46 Table of Contents THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) CSI SGA decreased 7% at 31% of net sales in fiscal 2009 from 34% of net sales in fiscal 2008. Marketing, distribution and other general and administration costs decreased primarily due to improved efficiencies from a recent acquisition and decreased legal and share-based compensation expenses. Fiscal 2008 SGA increased 6% over 2007 on increased selling and distribution costs to support the emphasis on organic sales growth. Corporate headquarters SGA, which decreased 4% to $28.0 million in 2009 and decreased 8% to $29.1 million in 2008, were 3% of consolidated net sales in both periods. The decrease in 2009 was primarily due to the $1.9 million reduction of accrued legal costs related to our acquisition of Ocular Sciences, Inc. based on a settlement agreement reached in our fiscal second quarter of 2009. The decrease in 2008 was primarily due to expense recovery related to forfeitures of share-based awards. Research and Development Expense Research and development (R&D) expense decreased 6% in 2009 and 11% in 2008 and was 3% of sales in 2009 and 2008, and 4% of sales in 2007. R&D expense was $33.3 million in 2009, $35.5 million in 2008 and $39.9 million in 2007. R&D expense included acquired in-process research and development of $3.0 million in 2009 for CVI and $7.2 million in 2007 for CSI. CVI 2009 research and development expenditures were $25.9 million, net of acquired in-process R&D, down 16% from $30.7 million in 2008, which represented an 11% increase over 2007. In fiscal 2009, CVI recorded a $3.0 million in-process research and development charge related to the acquisition of certain distribution rights. CVI research and development activities include programs to develop disposable silicone hydrogel products and product lines utilizing PC technology. CSI research and development expenditures were $4.4 million, down 8% in 2009 and $4.7 million, down 7% in 2008, net of acquired in-process R&D, representing 3% of net sales in each period. In 2007, R&D expense included acquired in-process research and development of $7.2 million. CSI research and development activities include the upgrade and redesign of many CSI incontinence, assisted reproductive technology and uterine manipulation products and other gynecological and obstetrical product development activities. Restructuring Costs 2009 CooperVision Manufacturing Restructuring Plan In the fiscal third quarter of 2009, CooperVision initiated a restructuring plan to relocate contact lens manufacturing from Norfolk, Virginia, and transfer part of its contact lens manufacturing from Adelaide, Australia, to existing manufacturing operations in Juana Diaz, Puerto Rico, and Hamble, UK (2009 CooperVision Manufacturing restructuring plan). This plan is intended to better utilize CVI manufacturing efficiencies and reduce its manufacturing expenses through a reduction in workforce of approximately 480 employees. The Norfolk plant manufactures about 7% of CooperVision annual lens production; however, no additional hires are anticipated in Puerto Rico or the UK, as part of this plan, due to recent gains in manufacturing efficiencies. The Company expects to complete restructuring activities in Adelaide, Australia, in our fiscal first quarter of 2010 and in Norfolk, Virginia, in our fiscal first quarter of 2011. 47 Table of Contents THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) We estimate that the total restructuring costs under this plan will be approximately $24 million, with about $17 million associated with assets, including accelerated depreciation and facility lease and contract termination costs, and about $7 million associated with employee benefit costs, including anticipated severance payments, termination benefit costs, retention bonus payouts and other similar costs. These costs are reported as cost of sales or restructuring costs in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. In the year ended October 31, 2009, total costs $5.1 million including $3.6 million of employee benefit costs and $1.5 million of non-cash costs associated with assets are reported as $5.0 million in cost of sales and $0.1 million in restructuring costs. At October 31, 2009, the total accrued restructuring liability, recorded in other accrued liabilities, was $3.0 million. Critical Activity Restructuring Plan In the fiscal first quarter of 2009, CooperVision began a global restructuring plan to focus the organization on our most critical activities, refine our work processes and align costs with prevailing market conditions (Critical Activity restructuring plan). This restructuring plan involved the assessment of all locations activities, exclusive of direct manufacturing, and changes to streamline work processes. As a result of the Critical Activity restructuring plan, a number of positions were eliminated across certain business functions and geographic regions. The Company substantially completed the Critical Activity restructuring plan in our fiscal fourth quarter of 2009. The total restructuring costs under this plan were $4.3 million, primarily severance and benefit costs, and are reported as cost of sales or restructuring costs in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. In the year ended October 31, 2009, we reported $0.5 million in cost of sales and $3.8 million in restructuring costs. At October 31, 2009, the total accrued restructuring liability, recorded in other accrued liabilities was $0.6 million. The Company may, from time to time, decide to pursue additional restructuring activities that involve charges in future periods. Amortization of Intangibles Amortization of intangibles was $17.9 million in 2009, $16.8 million in 2008 and $16.2 million in 2007. Amortization expense in fiscal 2009 includes a $1.5 million charge for a CSI license that no longer has value. Operating Income Operating income grew $104.0 million, or 227%, between 2007 and 2009, increasing 18% or $22.9 million in 2009, and 177% or $81.1 million in 2008.

AND SUBSIDIARIES Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Interest Expense Interest expense decreased 13% to $44.1 million in 2009, following an increase of 19% to $50.8 million in 2008 from $42.7 million in 2007. The fiscal 2009 decrease primarily reflects a decrease in our long-term borrowings used for capital expenditures and lower interest rates. The fiscal 2008 increase included the write-off of $3.0 million of unamortized costs related to the repurchase of our 2.625% Convertible Senior Debentures, and excluding such costs, interest expense increased 12% in 2008. We had $764.0 million in loans on our credit facility on October 31, 2009, compared to $861.4 million outstanding on October 31, 2008. Other Income (Expense), Net Years Ended October 31, (In millions) 2009 2008 2007 Interest income $ 0.4 $ 0.3 $ 0.4 Gain on extinguishment of debt 1.8 Foreign exchange gain (loss) 7.0 0.4 (3.0 ) Other (expense) income (0.1 ) (0.7 ) 0.1 $ 9.1 $ $ (2.5 ) Provision for Income Taxes We recorded tax expense of $14.3 million for fiscal year 2009 compared to $10.7 million for fiscal year 2008 based on effective tax rates of 12.4% and 14.0% for 2009 and 2008, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate is driven by changes in our geographic mix of income. Share-Based Compensation Plans The Company grants various share-based compensation awards, including stock options, performance shares, restricted stock and restricted stock units. The share-based compensation and related income tax benefit recognized in the consolidated financial statements in fiscal year 2009 was $13.0 million and $4.2 million, respectively, compared to $14.9 million and $4.0 million, respectively, in fiscal year 2008. As of October 31, 2009, there was $12.8 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to share-based compensation, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average remaining vesting period of 1.4 years for nonvested stock options and restricted stock units. Cash received from options exercised under all share-based compensation arrangements for fiscal 2009 and 2008 was $1.1 million and $6.3 million, respectively. The Company estimates the fair value of each stock option award on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes valuation model, which requires management to make estimates regarding expected option life, stock price volatility and other assumptions. Groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes. The Company estimates stock option forfeitures based on historical data for each employee grouping, and adjusts the rate to expected forfeitures periodically. The adjustment of the forfeiture rate will result in a cumulative catch-up adjustment in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed. These adjustments totaled $2.9 million in fiscal year 2009 and $3.2 million in fiscal year 2008. 49 Table of Contents THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY 2009 Highlights Operating cash flow $223.1 million, compared to $96.5 million in 2008. Expenditures for purchases of property, plant and equipment $93.9 million, compared to $124.9 million in 2008. Total debt decreased to $781.5 million from $904.8 million in 2008. Comparative Statistics Years Ended October 31, ($ in millions) 2009 2008 Cash and cash equivalents $ 3.9 $ 1.9 Total assets $ 2,551.9 $ 2,587.6 Working capital $ 328.5 $ 270.6 Total debt $ 781.5 $ 904.8 Stockholders equity $ 1,540.3 $ 1,417.1 Ratio of debt to equity 0.51:1 0.64:1 Debt as a percentage of total capitalization 34% 39% Working Capital The increase in working capital in fiscal 2009 was primarily due to decreases in short-term debt, accounts payable and other current liabilities. An increase in our trade accounts receivable also contributed to the increase. The increase in working capital was partially offset by the decrease in inventory. Operating Cash Flows Cash flow provided from operating activities continued as Cooper major source of liquidity, totaling $223.1 million in fiscal 2009 and $96.5 million in 2008. Operating cash flow increased primarily due to higher net income. At the end of fiscal 2009, Cooper inventory months on hand (MOH) were 6.3 compared to 8.1 at fiscal year-end 2008. Our days sales outstanding (DSO) decreased to 55 days at October 31, 2009, from 59 days at October 31, 2008. Based on our experience and knowledge of our customers and our analysis of inventoried products and product levels, we believe that our accounts receivable and inventories are recoverable. Investing Cash Flows The cash outflow of $98.6 million from investing activities in fiscal 2009 was for capital expenditures of $93.9 million primarily to improve manufacturing capacity and payments of $4.7 million related to acquisitions. 50 Table of Contents THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Financing Cash Flows The cash outflow of $122.7 million from financing activities in fiscal 2009 was driven by net repayments of long-term debt of $85.3 million and short-term debt of $36.0 million, along with dividends on our common stock of $2.7 million. The outflow was partially offset by proceeds of $1.1 million from the exercise of stock options. Risk Management Most of our operations outside the United States have their local currency as their functional currency. We are exposed to risks caused by changes in foreign exchange, principally our British pound sterling, euro, Japanese yen, Swedish krona and Canadian dollar-denominated debt and receivables, and from operations in foreign currencies. We have taken steps to minimize our balance sheet exposure. Although we enter into foreign exchange agreements with financial institutions to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency values relative to our debt or receivables obligations, these hedging transactions do not eliminate that risk entirely. We are also exposed to risks associated with changes in interest rates, as the interest rate on our Senior Unsecured Revolving Line of Credit varies with the London Interbank Offered Rate. Our significant increase in debt following the acquisition of Ocular has significantly increased the risk associated with changes in interest rates. We have decreased this interest rate risk by hedging a significant portion of variable rate debt effectively converting it to fixed rate debt for varying periods through May 2011. For additional detail, see Item 1A. Risk Factors and Note 1 and Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. On January 31, 2007, Cooper entered into a $650 million syndicated Senior Unsecured Revolving Line of Credit (Revolver) and $350 million aggregate principal amount of 7.125% senior notes due 2015 of which $339 million are outstanding. (See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements). KeyBank led the Revolver refinancing, and the Revolver matures on January 31, 2012. In connection with the normal management of our financial liabilities, we may from time to time seek to retire or purchase our Senior Notes through open market cash purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material. Outlook Global Market and Economic Conditions In the United States and globally, recent market and economic conditions continue to be challenging with tighter credit conditions and slower economic growth during 2009. For our fiscal year ended October 31, 2009, continued concerns about the systemic impact of inflation, energy costs, geopolitical issues, the availability and cost of credit, bank failures and a declining real estate market in the U.S. have contributed to increased market volatility and diminished expectations for the United States and the global economy. These conditions, combined with declining business and consumer confidence and increased unemployment, have contributed to substantial declines in capital markets and consumer confidence. As a result of these market conditions, the cost and availability of credit continues to be adversely affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads. Concern about the stability of the markets generally and the strength of counterparties specifically has led many lenders and institutional 51 Table of Contents THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) investors to reduce, and in some cases, cease to provide funding to borrowers. Ongoing turbulence in the United States and international markets and economies may adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition, and the liquidity and financial condition of our customers. If these market conditions do not improve, they may limit our ability, and the ability of our customers, to timely replace maturing liabilities, and access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs, resulting in potential adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations. These conditions appear to have affected the markets for our products as consumer spending decreased resulting in slower growth in 2009. We believe that cash and cash equivalents on hand of $3.9 million plus cash generated by operating activities and borrowing capacity under our existing credit facilities will fund future operations, capital expenditures, cash dividends and acquisitions. Over the past two fiscal years, the Company has made a significant investment in manufacturing capacity to support our silicone hydrogel and daily disposable contact lens product lines and improved capacity utilization. As a result, we plan to reduce overall capital expenditures related to manufacturing. Management believes that our projected outlook on sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our projected liquidity needs for the next 12 months. At October 31, 2009, we had $290.6 million of available credit, and we are in compliance with financial covenants related to our credit facilities. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS None. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS As of October 31, 2009, we had the following contractual obligations and commercial commitments: Payments Due by Period (In millions) Total 2010 2011 & 2012 2013 & 2014 2015 & Beyond Contractual obligations: Long-term debt $ 764.4 $ $ 425.0 $ $ 339.4 Capital lease 10.0 2.8 7.2 Interest payments 155.2 38.5 58.3 48.4 10.0 Operating leases 172.7 30.1 52.7 23.0 66.9 Total contractual obligations 1,102.3 71.4 543.2 71.4 416.3 Commercial commitments: Stand-by letters of credit 0.2 0.2 Total $ 1,102.5 $ 71.6 $ 543.2 $ 71.4 $ 416.3 The expected future benefit payments for pension plans through 2019 are disclosed in Note 11. Employee Benefits. Inflation and Changing Prices Inflation has had no appreciable effect on our operations in the last three fiscal years. 52 Table of Contents THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) New Accounting Pronouncements In December 2007, the Financial Accounting standards Board (FASB) issued new accounting standards for business combinations under Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 805, which establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree and the goodwill acquired. The new standards also establish disclosure requirements to enable the evaluation of the nature and financial effects of the business combination. In April 2009, the FASB issued additional standards under ASC 805-20 to clarify initial recognition and measurement, subsequent measurement and accounting, and disclosure of assets and liabilities arising from contingencies in a business combination. We adopted the requirements of this standard on November 1, 2009, the first day of our fiscal year ending October 31, 2010. The impact of the adoption of these new standards will depend on the nature and extent of business combinations occurring on or after November 1, 2009. In December 2008, the FASB issued new standards under ASC 715-20, which provides guidance on an employer disclosure about the major categories of plan assets and concentrations of risk for these plan assets of a defined benefit pension or other postretirement plan. Further, it requires employers to disclose information about fair value measurements of plan assets. The new standards under ASC 715-20 will be adopted by the Company in its consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ending October 31, 2010, on a prospective basis. The Company does not anticipate the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In June 2009, the FASB issued an amendment to the derecognition guidance in ASC 860 and eliminates the exemption from consolidation for qualifying special-purpose entities. The Company does not anticipate the adoption, which is effective for the Company for the fiscal year beginning on November 1, 2010, will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In June 2009, the FASB issued the consolidation guidance for variable-interest entities to replace the quantitative-based risks and rewards calculation for determining which enterprise, if any, has a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity with an approach focused on identifying which enterprise has the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entity economic performance. The Company does not anticipate the adoption, which is effective for the Company for the fiscal year beginning on November 1, 2010, will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In June 2009, the FASB established that the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (Codification) would become the single official source of authoritative U.S. GAAP (other than guidance issued by the SEC), superseding existing FASB, American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, Emerging Issues Task Force and related accounting literature. After that date, only one level of authoritative U.S. GAAP exists. All other literature is now considered non-authoritative. The Codification did not change U.S. GAAP. The Codification became effective for interim and annual periods ended on or after September 15, 2009. We adopted this standard as of September 15, 2009, with the only impact being the update to and removal of certain references in our consolidated financial statements to technical accounting literature. 53 Table of Contents THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) In August 2009, the FASB issued an update to ASC 820 regarding fair value measurement. This Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2009-5(ASU 2009-5) amends the provisions in ASC 820 related to the fair value measurement of liabilities and clarifies for circumstances in which a quoted price in an active market for the identical liability is not available. ASU 2009-5 is intended to reduce potential ambiguity in financial reporting when measuring the fair value of liabilities. We adopted the requirements of this standard on November 1, 2009, the first day of our fiscal year ending October 31, 2010. ASU 2009-5 concerns disclosure only and will not have an impact on the Company consolidated financial statements. In October 2009, the FASB issued an update to ASC 605 regarding revenue recognition. This ASU No. 2009-13 (ASU 2009-13), provides guidance on whether multiple deliverables in a revenue arrangement exist, how the arrangement should be separated, and the consideration allocated. ASU 2009-13 eliminates the requirement to establish the fair value of undelivered products and services and instead provides for separate revenue recognition based upon management estimate of the selling price for an undelivered item when there is no other means to determine the fair value of that undelivered item. ASU 2009-13 is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010 or our fiscal year 2011. Early adoption is permitted if the Company elects to adopt ASU No. 2009-14 concurrently. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of ASU 2009-13 on its consolidated financial statements. In October 2009, the FASB issued an update to ASC 985-605. This ASU 2009-14, amends the scope of the software revenue guidance in ASC 985-605 to exclude tangible products containing software components and non-software components that function together to deliver the tangible product essential functionality. ASU 2009-14 is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010 or our fiscal year 2011. Early adoption is permitted if the Company elects to adopt ASU 2009-13 concurrently. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of ASU 2009-14 on its consolidated financial statements. Estimates and Critical Accounting Policies Management estimates and judgments are an integral part of financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). We believe that the critical accounting policies described in this section address the more significant estimates required of management when preparing our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. We consider an accounting estimate critical if changes in the estimate may have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. We believe that the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and resulting balances are reasonable; however, actual results could differ from the original estimates, requiring adjustment to these balances in future periods. Revenue recognition We recognize product net sales, net of discounts, returns, and rebates in accordance with related accounting standards and SEC Staff Accounting Bulletins. As required by these standards, we recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned, based on terms of sale with the customer, where persuasive evidence of an agreement exists, delivery has occurred, the seller price is fixed and determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. For contact lenses as well as CSI medical devices, diagnostic products and surgical instruments and accessories, this primarily occurs upon product shipment, when risk of ownership transfers to our 54 Table of Contents THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) customers. We believe our revenue recognition policies are appropriate in all circumstances, and that our policies are reflective of our customer arrangements. We record, based on historical statistics, estimated reductions to revenue for customer incentive programs offered including cash discounts, promotional and advertising allowances, volume discounts, contractual pricing allowances, rebates and specifically established customer product return programs. While estimates are involved, historically, most of these programs have not been material to our business, since a high percentage of our revenue is from direct sales to doctors. The Company records taxes collected from customers on a net basis, as these taxes are not included in net sales. Allowance for doubtful accounts Our reported balance of accounts receivable, net of the allowance for doubtful accounts, represents our estimate of the amount that ultimately will be realized in cash. We review the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts on an ongoing basis, using historical payment trends and the age of the receivables and knowledge of our individual customers. When our analyses indicate, we increase or decrease our allowance accordingly. However, if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, additional allowances may be required. While estimates are involved, bad debts historically have not been a significant factor given the diversity of our customer base, well established historical payment patterns and the fact that patients require satisfaction of healthcare needs in both strong and weak economies. Net realizable value of inventory In assessing the value of inventories, we must make estimates and judgments regarding aging of inventories and other relevant issues potentially affecting the saleable condition of products and estimated prices at which those products will sell. On an ongoing basis, we review the carrying value of our inventory, measuring number of months on hand and other indications of salability, and reduce the value of inventory if there are indications that the carrying value is greater than market. At the point of the loss recognition, a new, lower-cost basis for that inventory is established, and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis. While estimates are involved, historically, obsolescence has not been a significant factor due to long product dating and lengthy product life cycles. We target to keep, on average, about six to seven months of inventory on hand to maintain high customer service levels given the complexity of our specialty lens product portfolio. Valuation of goodwill We account for goodwill and evaluate our goodwill balances and test them for impairment in accordance with related accounting standards. We no longer amortize goodwill. The goodwill impairment test is a two-step process. Initially, we compare the book value of net assets to the fair value of each reporting unit that has goodwill assigned to it. If the fair value is determined to be less than the book value, a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment. A reporting unit is the level of reporting at which goodwill is tested for impairment. Our reporting units are the same as our business segments CVI and CSI reflecting the way that we manage our business. We test goodwill for impairment annually during the fiscal third quarter and when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is reasonably possible that impairment may exist. We performed our annual impairment test in our fiscal third quarter 2009, and our analysis indicated that we had no impairment of goodwill. The fair value of our reporting units is 55 Table of Contents THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) determined using either the income or the market valuation approach or a combination thereof. Under the income approach, specifically the discounted cash flow method, the fair value of the reporting unit is based on the present value of estimated future cash flows that the reporting unit is expected to generate over its remaining life. Under the market approach, the value of the reporting unit is based on an analysis that compares the value of the reporting unit to values of publicly traded companies in similar lines of business. In the application of the income and market valuation approaches, the Company is required to make estimates of future operating trends and judgments on discount rates and other variables. Discount rates are based on a weighted average cost of capital, which represents the average rate a business must pay its providers of debt and equity capital. We used discount rates which are the representative weighted average cost of capital for each of our reporting units in comparison with guideline companies, with consideration given to the current condition of the global economy. The discount rates used in the current year are about 200 basis points lower than our prior interim analysis completed as of October 31, 2008 due to changes in credit markets and the current condition of the U.S. and the global economy. Management determines net sales forecasts based on our best estimate of near term revenue expectations and long term projections which include review of published independent industry analyst reports. The net sales forecasts used in the annual goodwill impairment test for 2009 were consistent with our prior interim analysis completed as of October 31, 2008. For the current year, management determined that applying equal weight to both our income and market analyses provided the most reliable indications of fair value of our reporting units. In reconciling the combined fair value of our reporting units to our market capitalization, we used the closing price of our common stock at April 30, 2009, the end of our fiscal second quarter, and we applied a premium for control based on our review of premiums paid by third parties in comparable recent transactions. We determined an appropriate premium for control by analyzing individual transactions in our markets and selected target companies whose operations were comparable to our two reporting units. Management will continue to monitor the relationship of Cooper market capitalization to both its book value and tangible book value and to evaluate the carrying value of goodwill. Actual future results related to assumed variables could differ from these estimates. Goodwill impairment analysis and measurement is a process that requires significant judgment. If our common stock price trades below book value per share, there are changes in market conditions or a future downturn in our business, or the annual goodwill impairment test indicates an impairment of our goodwill, the Company may have to recognize a non-cash impairment of its goodwill that could be material, and could adversely affect our results of operations in the period recognized and also adversely affect our total assets, stockholders equity and financial condition. Business combinations We routinely consummate business combinations. Results of operations for acquired companies are included in our consolidated results of operations from the date of acquisition. In fiscal 2009 and prior periods, we allocated the purchase price of acquisitions based on our estimates and judgments of the fair value of net assets purchased, direct acquisition costs incurred and intangibles other than goodwill. In December 2007, the FASB issued a revision to the accounting standard for business combinations that replaces the prior cost allocation process. We 56 Table of Contents THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) will adopt the new standard in fiscal 2010 and for any future business combination, we will recognize separately from goodwill, the identifiable assets acquired, including acquired in-process research and development, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree generally at the acquisition date fair values as defined by accounting standards related to fair value measurements. As of the acquisition date, goodwill is measured as the excess of consideration given, generally measured at fair value, and the net of the acquisition date fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. Direct acquisition costs will be expensed as incurred. Income taxes We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and for tax losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we must estimate our income tax expense for each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This process requires significant management judgments and involves estimating our current tax exposures in each jurisdiction including the impact, if any, of additional taxes resulting from tax examinations as well as judging the recoverability of deferred tax assets. To the extent recovery of deferred tax assets is not likely based on our estimation of future taxable income in each jurisdiction, a valuation allowance is established. Tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve. Frequent changes in tax laws in each jurisdiction complicate future estimates. To determine the tax rate, we are required to estimate full-year income and the related income tax expense in each jurisdiction. We update the estimated effective tax rate for the effect of significant unusual items as they are identified. Changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual pre-tax income can affect the overall effective tax rate, and such changes could be material. Regarding accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, we recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. We measure the income tax benefits from the tax positions that are recognized, assess the timing of the derecognition of previously recognized tax benefits and classify and disclose the liabilities within the consolidated financial statements for any unrecognized tax benefits based on the guidance in the interpretation of ASC 740 Accounting for Income Taxes . The interpretation also provides guidance on how the interest and penalties related to tax positions may be recorded and classified within our Consolidated Statement of Operations and presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. We classify interest expense and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as additional income tax expense. Share-Based Compensation Effective November 1, 2005, we adopted the accounting standard revision for share-based payment as interpreted by SEC SAB No. 107, using the modified prospective transition method. Prior periods have not been restated. 57 Table of Contents THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Under these fair value recognition provisions, share-based compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period. Determining the fair value of share-based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating Cooper stock price volatility, employee stock option exercise behaviors and employee option forfeiture rates. The expected life of the share-based awards is based on the observed and expected time to post-vesting forfeiture and/or exercise. Groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes. The expected volatility is based on implied volatility from publicly-traded options on the Company stock at the date of grant, historical volatility and other factors. The risk-free interest rate is based on the continuous rates provided by the U.S. Treasury with a term equal to the expected life of the award. The dividend yield is based on the projected annual dividend payment per share, divided by the stock price at the date of grant. As share-based compensation expense recognized in our Consolidated Statements of Operations is based on awards ultimately expected to vest, the amount of expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant, based on historical experience, and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. If factors change and the Company employs different assumptions in the application of ASC 718, the compensation expense that it records in future periods may differ significantly from what it has recorded in the current period. In 2005, prior to the adoption of the accounting standard revision, the Company valued its share-based compensation using the intrinsic value method. 58 Table of Contents
