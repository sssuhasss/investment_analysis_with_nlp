ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview of Our Business AES is a global power company. We own or operate a portfolio of electricity generation and distribution businesses with generation capacity totaling approximately 43,000 MW and distribution networks serving over 11 million people. In addition, we have more than 3,000 MW under construction in ten countries. Our global footprint includes operations in 29 countries on five continents with 83% of our revenue in 2008 generated outside the United States. We operate two primary lines of business. The first is our Generation business, where we own and/or operate power plants to generate and sell power to wholesale customers such as utilities and other intermediaries. The second is our Utilities business, where we own and/or operate utilities to distribute, transmit and sell electricity to end-user customers in the residential, commercial, industrial and governmental sectors within a defined service area. Each of our primary lines of business generates approximately half of our revenues. We are also continuing to expand our wind generation business and are pursuing additional renewables projects in solar, climate solutions, biomass and energy storage. These initiatives are not material contributors to our revenue, gross margin or income, but we believe that they may become material in the future. Generation. We currently own or operate a portfolio of approximately 38,000 MW, consisting of 93 facilities in 26 countries on five continents at our generation businesses. We also have approximately 2,900 MW of capacity currently under construction in six countries. Our core Generation businesses use a wide range of technologies and fuel types including coal, combined-cycle gas turbines, hydroelectric power and biomass. The majority of the electricity produced by our Generation businesses is sold under long-term contracts, or PPAs, to wholesale customers. Approximately 61% of the revenues from our Generation businesses during 2008 was derived from plants that operate under PPAs of five years or longer for 75% or more of their output capacity. These businesses often reduce their exposure to fuel supply risks by entering into long-term fuel supply contracts or fuel tolling contracts where the customer assumes full responsibility for purchasing and supplying the fuel to the power plant. These long-term contractual agreements result in relatively predictable cash flow and earnings and reduce exposure to volatility in the market price for electricity and fuel; however, the amount of earnings and cash flow predictability varies from business to business based on the degree to which its exposure is limited by the contracts that it has negotiated. The balance of our Generation businesses sell power through competitive markets under short-term contracts or directly in the spot market. As a result, the cash flows and earnings associated with these businesses are more sensitive to fluctuations in the market price for electricity, natural gas, coal and other fuels. However, for a number of these facilities, including our plants in New York, which include a fleet of coal fired plants, we have hedged the majority of our exposure to fuel, energy and emissions pricing for 2009. Utilities. Our Utilities businesses distribute power to more than 11 million people in seven countries on five continents. Our Utilities business consists primarily of 14 companies owned and/or operated under management agreements, all of which operate in a defined service area. These businesses also include 15 generation plants in two countries totaling approximately 4,400 MW. In addition, we have one generation plant under construction totaling 86 MW. These businesses have a variety of structures ranging from pure distribution businesses to fully integrated utilities, which generate, transmit and distribute power. 90 Table of Contents Renewables and Other Initiatives. In recent years, as demand for renewable sources of energy has grown, we have placed increasing emphasis on developing projects in wind, solar, energy storage and the creation of carbon offsets. We have also developed projects and investments in climate solutions and energy storage. AES Wind Generation, which is one of the largest producers of wind power in the U.S., has 16 wind generation facilities in three countries with over 1,200 MW in operation and 11 wind generation facilities under construction in four countries. AES Solar, our joint venture with Riverstone Holdings, was formed to develop, own and operate utility-scale photo voltaic (PV) solar installations. Since its launch, AES Solar has developed eight plants totaling 24 MW of solar projects in Spain. In climate solutions, we have developed and are implementing projects to produce GHG Credits. In the U.S., we formed Greenhouse Gas Services, LLC as a joint venture with GE Energy Financial Services to create high quality verifiable offsets for the voluntary U.S. market. We also have formed an initiative to develop and implement utility scale energy systems (such as batteries), which store and release power when needed. While these renewables and other initiatives are not currently material to our operations, we believe that in the future, they may become a material contributor to our revenue and gross margin. However, there are risks associated with these initiatives, which are further disclosed in Item 1A Risk Factors of this Form 10-K. Our Organization and Segments. As of the end of 2008, our Generation and Utilities businesses were organized within four defined geographic regions: (1) Latin America, (2) North America, (3) Europe & Africa, and (4) Asia and the Middle East, ("Asia"). Three regions, North America, Latin America and Europe & Africa, are engaged in both Generation and Utility businesses while the Asia region operates only Generation businesses. Accordingly, these businesses and regions account for seven reportable segments. "Corporate and Other" includes corporate overhead costs which are not directly associated with the operations of our seven primary reportable segments; interest income and expense; other inter-company charges such as management fees and self-insurance premiums which are fully eliminated in consolidation; and revenue, development costs and the operational results related to AES Wind Generation and our other renewables projects, which are currently not material to our operations. Beginning in 2009, the Company began to implement certain organizational changes in an effort to streamline the organization. The new structure will continue to be organized along our two lines of business, but within three regions instead of four: (1) North America, (2) Latin America & Africa and (3) Europe, Middle East & Asia ("EMEA"). In addition, we will no longer have an alternative energy group, the operation of which was previously reported under "Corporate and other." Instead, AES Wind Generation, will be managed as part of our North America region (even though some projects are not in North America) while climate solutions projects will be managed in the region in which they are located. Management is currently evaluating the impact of the reorganization on the Company's externally reported segments in accordance with SFAS No. 131. AES Solar is accounted for using the equity method and will continue to be reflected in Corporate and Other in 2009. Key Drivers of Our Results of Operations. Our Utilities and Generation businesses are distinguished by the nature of their customers, operational differences, cost structure, regulatory environment and risk exposure. As a result, each line of business has slightly different drivers which affect operating results. Performance drivers for our Generation businesses include, among other things, plant availability and reliability, management of fixed and operational costs and the extent to which our plants have hedged their exposure to fuel cost volatility. For our Generation businesses which sell power under short-term contract or in the spot market one of the most crucial factors is the market price of electricity and the plant's ability to generate electricity at a cost below that price. Growth in our Generation business is largely tied to securing new PPAs, expanding capacity in our existing facilities and building new power plants. Performance drivers for our Utilities businesses include, but are not limited to, reliability of service; negotiation of tariff adjustments; compliance with extensive regulatory requirements; management of working capital; and in developing countries, reduction of 91 Table of Contents commercial and technical losses. The results of operations of our Utilities businesses are sensitive to changes in economic growth and weather conditions in the area in which they operate. One of the key factors which affect both our revenue and costs of sales is changes in the cost of fuel. When fuel costs increase, many of our Generation businesses with long-term contracts and our Utilities are able to pass these costs on to the customer through fuel pass-through or fuel indexing arrangements in their contracts or through increases in tariff rates. Therefore, in a rising fuel cost environment as was the case in 2007 and much of 2008, increases in fuel costs for these businesses often resulted in increases in revenue (though not necessarily on a one-for-one basis). While these circumstances may not have a large impact on gross margin, they can significantly affect gross margin as a percentage of revenue. Other factors that can affect gross margin include our ability to expand the number of facilities we own; and in our existing plants, to sign up new customers and/or purchasing parties, collect receivables from existing customers and operate our plants more efficiently. Another key driver of our results is the management of risk. Our assets are diverse with respect to fuel source and type of market, which helps reduce certain types of operating risk. Our portfolio employs a broad range of fuels, including coal, gas, fuel oil and renewable sources such as hydroelectric power, wind and solar, which reduces the risks associated with dependence on any one fuel source. For additional information regarding our facilities see Item 1 Our Organization and Segments. Our presence in mature markets helps reduce the volatility associated with our businesses in faster-growing emerging markets. In addition, as noted above, our Generation portfolio is largely contracted, which reduces the risk related to the market prices of electricity and fuel. We also attempt to limit risk by hedging much of our currency and commodity risk, and by matching the currency of most of our subsidiary debt to the revenue of the business that issued that debt. However, our businesses are still subject to these risks, as further described in Item 1A Risk Factors, " We may not be adequately hedged against our exposure to changes in commodity prices or interest rates. " Highlights of 2008 Results of Operations. In 2008, management continued to focus its efforts on increasing shareholder value by improving operations, executing our growth strategy and strategically managing our portfolio of businesses. Our 2008 results of operations were positively impacted by a number of factors including the gain on the sale of Ekibastuz and Maikuben in Kazakhstan, higher generation rates, utilities tariffs and favorable foreign currency translation. revenues of $16.1 billion and gross margin of $3.7 billion, or 23% of revenue; income from continuing operations of $1.2 billion, or $1.80 per diluted share; and cash flow from operating activities of $2.2 billion. Our results were negatively impacted by higher fuel costs in Asia and the unfavorable impact of mark-to-market adjustments on derivative instruments. We also saw an increase in fixed costs, primarily in Brazil and Cameroon, related to maintenance, higher provisions for bad debt, contractor services and higher purchased energy costs. In the fourth quarter of 2008, and in response to the financial market crisis, we reviewed and prioritized projects in our development pipeline. As a result, we recognized an impairment charge of approximately $75 million ($34 million, net of minority interest and income taxes). The projects determined to be impaired primarily included two liquefied natural gas projects in North America and a non-power development project at one of our facilities in North America. As the Company continues to review and streamline its project pipeline, it is possible that further impairments could be identified in the future, some of which could be material. During 2008, we also recognized additional impairment charges of $36 million related to long-lived assets at Uruguaiana, our gas-powered generation plant in Brazil. The impairment was triggered by the combination of gas curtailments and increases in the spot 92 Table of Contents market price of energy in 2007 that continued in 2008. Following an initial impairment charge in the fourth quarter of 2007, further charges were incurred in 2008 due to fixed asset purchase agreements in place. During the first half of 2008, we withdrew from projects in South Africa and Israel which resulted in impairment charges of $36 million. We also recognized an impairment of $18 million related to the shutdown of the Hefei plant in China. Investment and Financing Activities. In addition to the financial results presented above, the additional highlights for the year ended December 31, 2008 include the following: Financing activities We were able to refinance recourse debt at lower interest rates and with extended maturities, reducing our 2009 recourse debt maturities from $467 million at December 31, 2007 to $154 million at December 31, 2008. Our consolidated subsidiaries raised approximately $2.7 billion in 2008 for the purposes of refinancing existing debt and to fund acquisitions and construction. For example, in October, the Company obtained approximately $1 billion in non-recourse financing to support the development of Angamos, a 518 MW coal-fired generation facility in Chile. Angamos is expected to begin commercial operations in 2011. We reduced outstanding recourse debt by $360 million and repurchased 10.7 million shares of our common stock at a total cost of $143 million. Acquisitions In April, the Company completed the purchase of a 92% interest in Masinloc, a 660 gross MW coal-fired thermal power generation facility in Masinloc, Philippines. The purchase price was $930 million in cash (excluding anticipated improvements). Non-recourse financing of $665 million was obtained to fund the acquisition and improve the facilities. Investments in Renewable Energy and Related Projects Wind Generation Highlights from AES Wind Generation include the following: The Company expanded its portfolio of wind generation businesses with the acquisition of Mountain View Power Partners ("Mountain View"), which consists of 111 wind turbines with a capacity of 67 MW in Palm Springs, California. In July, we acquired a 49% interest in Guohua Hulunbeier Wind Farm, a 49.5 MW wind farm development in China. The Company also reached a separate agreement with Guohua to move to phase II of our jointly-owned Huanghua wind project to expand the facility, doubling the capacity to 99 MW. AES has a 49% interest in the Huanghua Project. In December, the Company obtained financing to build a 156 MW wind farm in Kavarna, the largest in Bulgaria, and a 22 MW wind farm in Scotland. Additionally we acquired a 34 MW wind farm from our affiliate, InnoVent. All three are expected to commence commercial operations in 2009. Solar Energy In March, the Company formed AES Solar, a joint venture with Riverstone. AES Solar will develop land-based solar photovoltaic panels that capture sunlight to convert into electricity that feed directly into power grids. AES Solar has commenced commercial operations of 24 MW solar projects in Spain. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company and Riverstone will each provide up to $500 million of capital over the next five years. Through December 31, 2008, the Company has contributed total capital of $135 million. 93 Table of Contents Climate Solutions Highlights from our climate solutions activities include: In April, the Company acquired the rights to the gas from a landfill project in El Salvador ("Nejapa"). Nejapa produces emission reduction credits and plans to build a 6 MW generation facility that could potentially increase to 25 MW in the future. In June, as a result of a financial restructuring, the Company assumed 100% ownership of AgCert International Plc, an Irish company investing in GHG projects primarily in Brazil and Mexico. AgCert currently produces approximately 1.4 million tonnes per year of CERs. In September, Greenhouse Gas Services LLC, the Company's joint venture with General Electric, announced an agreement with Google to co-develop projects to reduce GHG emissions and produce GHG credits. The first project will capture methane gas in North Carolina. Construction As of December 31, 2008, the Company has more than 3,000 Gross MW of new generation capacity. The projects under construction include 14 core power projects totaling 2,993 MW and 11 wind power projects totaling 410 MW. We began construction of Angamos, a 518 MW coal-fired generation facility in Chile expected to begin commercial operations in 2011. We also further advanced our recent projects with the start of construction of three hydro projects in Turkey that are being developed through our investment made in May 2007 in the IC Ictas Energy Group. In July, the Company achieved early successful testing of simple cycle operation for the Amman East facility in Jordan, a 380 MW natural gas-fired project expected to achieve full combined-cycle operation in the first half of 2009. In August, the Company started commercial operations of the 170 MW Buffalo Gap III wind farm in Abilene, Texas, bringing the total wind generation capacity of the Buffalo Gap wind farm to 524 MW. For a complete listing of the Company's projects under construction or in development please see Item 1 Our Organizations and Segments. Portfolio Management In the first quarter of 2008, the Company finalized our termination agreement with the Chinese government and shut down Hefei, a 115 MW oil-fueled generation facility. The plant became the property of the Anhui Province and we received termination compensation of approximately $39 million in March 2008. In May 2008, the Company completed the sale of Ekibastuz and Maikuben West, a coal-fired power plant and a coal mine with operations in Kazakhstan. Proceeds from the sale of these businesses totaled approximately $1.1 billion, a portion of which was used to pay down debt in June 2008. We have the opportunity to receive additional consideration of up to approximately $380 million under performance incentives and a management agreement to continue operation and management of the plants for the next three years. In November 2008, the Company sold a 9.6% ownership in AES Gener for $175 million which reduced the Company's ownership percentage from 80.2% to 70.6%. As a result, the Company recognized a pre-tax loss of $31 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. The net proceeds from 94 Table of Contents this transaction were used to participate in Gener's capital increase in February 2009 as discussed under Outlook for the Future . In December 2008, the Company sold its 70% interest in Jiaozuo, a 250 MW coal-fired generation plant in China for net proceeds of $73 million. Prior periods have been restated to reflect this business within Discontinued Operations for all periods presented. Credit Crisis and the Macroeconomic Environment In the second half of 2007, conditions in the credit markets began to deteriorate in the United States and abroad. In the third and fourth quarter of 2008, this crisis and associated market conditions worsened dramatically, with unprecedented market volatility, widening credit spreads, volatile currencies, illiquidity, and increased counterparty credit risk. Beginning in the second half of 2007, the Company began a series of debt-related initiatives, including the refinancing of approximately $2.0 billion of recourse debt in transactions executed in the fourth quarter of 2007 and the second quarter of 2008. As a result of these transactions, The AES Corporation reduced the 2009 maturities on its recourse debt from $467 million as of June 30, 2007 to $154 million as of December 31, 2008. The AES Corporation also eliminated many of the restrictive covenants in its 8.75% Second Priority Senior Secured Notes due 2013 and modified certain covenants contained in its senior secured credit facility. The amendments made the financial covenants less restrictive and made certain other changes, such as expanding the Company's ability to repurchase its own common stock. For further information regarding these covenant changes, see the Capital Resources and Liquidity Parent Company Liquidity section of Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. In addition, The AES Corporation successfully replaced Lehman Commercial Paper with another bank as a lender under its senior secured credit facility. Because of the factors described above, management currently believes that it can meet its near-term liquidity requirements through a combination of existing cash and cash equivalent balances, cash provided by operating activities, financings, and, if needed, borrowings under its secured and unsecured credit facilities. Although there can be no assurance due to the challenging times currently faced by financial institutions, management believes that the participating banks under its facilities will be able to meet their funding commitments. The Company is also subject to credit risk, which includes risk related to the ability of counterparties (such as parties to our PPAs, fuel supply agreements, hedging agreements, and other contractual arrangements) to meet their contractual payment obligations or the potential nonperformance of counterparties to deliver contracted commodities or services at the contracted price. While counterparty credit risk has increased in the current crisis and there can be no assurances regarding the future, to date the Company has not suffered any material effects related to its counterparties. The global economic slowdown could also result in a decline in the value of our assets, which could result in material impairments of certain assets or result in an increase in our obligations which could be material to our operations. For example, as discussed above, during the fourth quarter of 2008, and in response to the financial market crisis, the Company reviewed and prioritized the projects in our development pipeline. As a result we recognized an impairment charge of approximately $75 million ($34 million, net of minority interest and income taxes). The projects that were impaired included two liquefied natural gas projects in North America and a non-power development project at one of our facilities in North America. In addition to the decline in development assets noted above, there is a risk that the fair value of other assets could also decline, resulting in additional impairment charges and/or a material increase in 95 Table of Contents our obligations. Certain subsidiaries of the Company have defined benefit pension plans. The Company periodically evaluates the value of the pension plan assets to ensure that they will be sufficient to fund their respective pension obligations. Given the declines in worldwide asset values, we are expecting an increase in pension expense and funding requirements in future periods, which may be material. As of December 31, 2008 we expect the Company to make future employer contributions to its defined benefit pension plans in 2009 of approximately $154 million, of which $21 million will be made to its U.S. plans and $133 million to foreign plans primarily in Brazil (subject to changes in foreign currency exchange rates), compared to employer contributions made in 2008 of $197 million, of which $59 million was made to U.S. plans and $138 million to foreign plans. In Brazilian real ("R$") contributions for our subsidiaries in Brazil are expected to increase from R$236 million in 2008 to R$294 million in 2009. The decline in the fair value of pension plan assets will also result in increased pension expense in 2009, currently estimated at $124 million in 2009 (subject to changes in foreign currency exchange rates) compared to $60 million in 2008. Expense at our subsidiaries in Brazil, in local currency, is expected to be R$176 million in 2009 compared to R$77 million in 2008. See Item 1A Risk Factors, " Some of our subsidiaries participate in defined benefit pension plans and their net pension plan obligations may require additional significant contributions. " To date, other than the impacts described above, the global economic slowdown has not significantly impacted the Company. However, in the event that the credit crisis and global recession deteriorate further, or are protracted, there could be a material adverse impact on the Company. The Company could be materially impacted if such events or other events occur such that participating lenders under its secured and unsecured facilities fail to meet their commitments, or the Company is unable to access the capital markets on favorable terms or at all, is unable to raise funds through the sale of assets, or is otherwise unable to finance its activities or refinance its debt, or if capital market disruptions result in increased borrowing costs (including with respect to interest payments on the Company's variable rate debt). The Company could also be adversely affected if general economic or political conditions in the markets where the Company operates deteriorate, resulting in a reduction in cash flow from operations, a reduction in the value of currencies in these markets relative to the dollar (which could cause currency losses), an increase in the price of commodities used in our operations and construction, or if the value of its assets remain depressed or decline further. If any of the foregoing events occur, such events (or a combination thereof) could have a material impact on the Company, its results of operations, liquidity, financial covenants, and/or its credit rating. The Company could also be adversely affected if the foregoing effects are exacerbated or general economic or political conditions in the markets where the Company operates deteriorate, resulting in a reduction in cash flow from operations, a reduction in the value of currencies in these markets relative to the dollar (which could cause currency losses), an increase in the price of commodities used in our operations and construction or a decline in asset values. Outlook for the Future In 2008, management continued to focus its efforts on improving operations, executing our growth strategy, managing our risk and strategically managing our portfolio of businesses. As market conditions deteriorated in the second half of 2008, our strategy evolved, with an increased emphasis on preserving liquidity. We also recognized that uncertain economic conditions could potentially slow global demand for power for some period of time. Accordingly, we scaled back our development plans mid-year to focus on projects that we believe will still have attractive returns and can still attract capital in difficult financial markets and on completing our projects that are currently under construction. If the Company has capital available for investment beyond these priorities (whether for further development, reductions in debt, or repurchases of stock), it will be allocated based on management's assessment of its most effective use. 96 Table of Contents Consistent with this strategy, in the fourth quarter of 2008, management conducted a review of its development pipeline, and determined that certain projects in the pipeline may not achieve financial close, will not provide the returns originally anticipated, or are otherwise unfeasible, or that other uses of capital such as debt repayment or stock repurchases offer a better return on the Company's capital. Accordingly, management has determined it will not pursue certain projects and will delay others until the credit markets recover. Furthermore, management will continue to review its pipeline and may further reduce the number of projects it pursues. The Company is also evaluating other options with respect to its pipeline, such as the addition of partners who can contribute capital, share project risk and/or provide strategic expertise. There can be no assurance regarding the outcome of any such decisions on the Company, its results of operations or its financial condition. The AES Corporation has $154 million in recourse debt maturing in 2009 compared with Parent Company liquidity of approximately $1.4 billion. With regard to its projects currently under construction, the Company believes that it can complete these projects through a combination of existing cash and cash equivalent balances, cash provided by operating activities, financings, and, if needed, borrowings under its secured and unsecured credit facilities. The Company has secured the financing for the vast majority of projects under construction. The Company is also focused on operational improvements and cost reductions to help further improve its cash flow from operations and enhance its financial flexibility. The Company has already commenced efforts to reduce costs and streamline our organization. These efforts include the reorganization of the Company from four regions to three regions, which is expected to eliminate redundancies and improve our cost structure. Recent Events On December 23, 2008, the local Chilean SEC approved Gener's issuance of approximately 945 million new shares at a price of $162.50 Chilean Pesos. The proceeds of the share issuance were $246 million and Gener anticipates using these proceeds for future expansion plans, working capital and other operating needs. The preemptive rights period began on January 7, 2009 remained open for 30 days and closed on February 5, 2009. During the preemptive rights period AES, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Cachagua, paid $175 million from the proceeds of the November 2008 share sale to maintain its current ownership percentage of approximately 70.6%. 2008 Performance Highlights Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 ($'s in millions, except per share amounts) Revenue $ 16,070 $ 13,516 $ 11,509 Gross Margin $ 3,707 $ 3,392 $ 3,419 Gross Margin as a % of Revenue 23.1 % 25.1 % 29.7 % Diluted Earnings Per Share from Continuing Operations $ 1.80 $ 0.72 $ 0.25 Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities $ 2,165 $ 2,353 $ 2,348 Revenue Revenue increased 19% to $16.1 billion in 2008 compared with $13.5 billion in 2007 primarily due to higher generation rates in Latin America, the impact of favorable foreign currency translation of approximately $350 million and utility tariffs and volume. 97 Table of Contents Gross margin Gross margin increased 9% to $3.7 billion in 2008 compared with $3.4 billion in 2007 primarily due to higher generation rates in Latin America, favorable foreign currency impact, utility volume and tariff, partially offset by an increase in fixed costs associated with allowances for bad debts and higher purchased energy costs, primarily in Brazil and Cameroon. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue decreased to 23.1% in 2008 compared with 25.1% in 2007 driven by the increase in fixed costs. Our gross margin remained at approximately $3.4 billion in 2006 and 2007 and increased to $3.7 billion in 2008. Gross margin however declined in the fourth quarter of 2008 due to several factors including the mix of earnings within our portfolio, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, and recent acquisitions, such as Masinloc in the Philippines. We believe that it is reasonably possible that the recent trend in gross margin reported in the fourth quarter will continue. The Company's future gross margin trends may be significantly impacted by currency exchange rates, commodity prices and the impact of any significant regulatory developments in each country where the Company conducts its business. The Company is subject to extensive and complex governmental regulations which affect most aspects of our business, such as regulations governing the generation and distribution of electricity and environmental regulations, as described more fully in the Business section of the Form 10-K. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased $1.08 per share to $1.80 per share in 2008 compared to $0.72 per share in 2007. The 2008 results included a net positive impact of $0.74 per share relating to : (i) a gain from the sale of the Company's northern Kazakhstan businesses in the second quarter of 2008 of $905 million (pre-tax) or $1.31; (ii) additional tax expense of $144 million or $0.21 related to the repatriation of a portion of the Kazakhstan sale proceeds (iii) loss related to corporate debt restructuring charges of $55 million (pre-tax) or $0.05 (iv) impairment charges taken in the fourth quarter on certain LNG and other development efforts of $34 million (net of tax and minority interest) or $0.05, (v) other impairment charges in Brazil and South Africa of $45 million (net of tax and minority interest) or $0.06 and (vi) net currency translation and transaction losses of $0.20 per share. These were compared to 2007 results which included (i) a gain of approximately $0.15 per diluted share related to the acquisition of a leasehold interest at Eastern Energy in New York and the recovery of certain tax assets in Latin America; (ii) impairment charges related to Uruguaiana and AgCert of $0.33 per share and (iii) corporate debt retirement costs in 2007 of $0.08 per share. The remaining increase in diluted earnings per share from continuing operations from 2007 to 2008 of $0.08 per share is mainly the result of improved performance in 2008. Net cash from operating activities Net cash from operating activities decreased 8% to $2.2 billion in 2008 compared with $2.4 billion in 2007. Excluding the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities from EDC in Venezuela, which was sold in May 2007, net cash provided by operating activities would have decreased $37 million. This decrease was primarily due to increased employer pension contributions at our U.S. and foreign subsidiaries and an increase in regulatory assets related to future recoverable purchased energy costs in Brazil. These decreases were partially offset by a decrease in cash used by a Brazilian subsidiary to pay income taxes in 2008 as a result of tax credits used as the primary payment method in 2008 and improved operations in Latin America and Europe & Africa.

Generation gross margin increased $439 million, or 46%, from the previous year primarily due to higher contract and spot prices and higher volume at Gener and our businesses in Argentina of approximately $318 million, higher contract and spot prices at our businesses in the Dominican Republic of approximately $86 million, favorable foreign currency translation of approximately $44 million, and higher spot prices at our businesses in Panama of approximately $30 million. These increases were partially offset by higher purchased energy prices of approximately $57 million at Uruguaiana in Brazil. Fiscal Year 2007 versus 2006 Generation revenue increased $895 million, or 34%, from the previous year primarily due to higher rates and volume at Gener and our businesses in Argentina of approximately $443 million and $95 million, respectively; and increased volume and intercompany sales from Tiet , in Brazil, to Eletropaulo, our Brazilian utility, of approximately $130 million. Our increase in ownership of the controlling shares of Itabo, in the Dominican Republic, which resulted in a change from the equity method of accounting consolidation, contributed approximately $87 million in revenue. The increase from foreign currency translation was approximately $38 million. Generation gross margin decreased $97 million, or 9%, from the previous year primarily due to increased cost from gas supply curtailments, drier than normal hydrology and higher spot prices for electricity in the Company's businesses in Argentina, Chile and Southern Brazil of approximately $173 million and one time transmission charges at Tiet of $39 million, offset in part, by higher sales at Itabo of $23 million and intercompany sales in Tiet of $103 million. 100 Table of Contents The following table summarizes revenue and gross margin for our Utilities segment in Latin America for the periods indicated: For the Years Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 % Change 2008 vs. 2007 % Change 2007 vs. 2006 (Dollars in millions) Latin America Utilities Revenue $ 5,911 $ 5,172 $ 4,552 14 % 14 % Gross Margin $ 885 $ 865 $ 888 2 % (3 )% Gross Margin as a % of Segment Revenue 15 % 17 % 20 % Fiscal Year 2008 versus 2007 Utilities revenue increased $739 million, or 14%, from the previous year primarily due to favorable foreign currency translation of approximately $357 million at our businesses in Brazil, increased rates primarily associated with higher pass-through purchased energy and transmission costs at Eletropaulo of approximately $148 million, and higher volume at Eletropaulo and Sul in Brazil of approximately $162 million and $30 million, respectively. Utilities gross margin increased $20 million, or 2%, from the previous year primarily due to higher volume at Eletropaulo of approximately $162 million and favorable foreign currency translation of approximately $67 million at our businesses in Brazil. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in the non-pass through rates at Eletropaulo as a result of the July 2007 tariff reset of approximately $74 million, increased fixed costs of approximately $71 million at Eletropaulo primarily due to higher provisions for bad debts and higher purchased energy costs at Eletropaulo of approximately $68 million. Fiscal Year 2007 versus 2006 Utilities revenue increased $620 million, or 14%, from the previous year primarily due to favorable foreign currency translation of $493 million, and increased rates and volume at Sul and at our plants in El Salvador of $58 million and $41 million, respectively, offset by a net decrease in tariffs of $24 million at Eletropaulo. Utilities gross margin decreased $23 million, or 3%, from the previous year primarily due to reduced tariff rates at Eletropaulo of $355 million offset by lower costs, favorable foreign currency translation of $148 million and higher volume of $74 million. Additionally, Sul had increased rates and volume of $27 million and favorable foreign currency translation of $19 million. North America The following table summarizes revenue and gross margin for our Generation segment in North America for the periods indicated: For the Years Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 % Change 2008 vs. 2007 % Change 2007 vs. 2006 (Dollars in millions) North America Generation Revenue $ 2,234 $ 2,168 $ 1,928 3 % 12 % Gross Margin $ 657 $ 702 $ 610 (6 )% 15 % Gross Margin as a % of Segment Revenue 29 % 32 % 32 % 101 Table of Contents Fiscal Year 2008 versus 2007 Generation revenue increased $66 million, or 3%, from the previous year primarily due to higher volume of $38 million at TEG/TEP in Mexico, and net higher revenue at Merida in Mexico of $29 million primarily due to the pass-through of higher fuel costs offset by a revenue adjustment. In addition, revenue increased $8 million at Red Oak in New Jersey, due to higher pricing and availability bonuses. At Warrior Run in Maryland, revenue increased $12 million due to the pass-through of higher fuel costs and higher volume due to no significant outages in 2008. These effects were partially offset by lower volume in New York of $23 million primarily due to planned outages and lower capacity factors. Generation gross margin decreased $45 million, or 6%, and decreased as a percentage of revenue from the previous year due to lower gross margin in New York of $46 million mainly due to a planned outage and lower volume, and higher fuel prices and outages of $16 million at Deepwater in Texas. Gross margin decreased $13 million at TEG/TEP due primarily to outages and lower rates due to changes in the sales contract rates associated with the refinancing in 2007. These decreases were partially offset by a net increase in gross margin in Hawaii of $29 million primarily due to a $22 million net mark-to-market derivative gain on a coal supply contract and a one time use tax refund of $6 million. Fiscal Year 2007 versus 2006 Generation revenue increased $240 million, or 12%, from the previous year primarily due to approximately $200 million in new business as a result of our acquisition of TEG/TEP and approximately $96 million in higher rate and volume sales at the Company's New York facilities; offset by mark-to-market adjustments for embedded derivatives of $51 million at Deepwater and lower emission sales of $39 million. Generation gross margin increased $92 million, or 15%, from the previous year primarily due to approximately $62 million related to our acquisition of TEG/TEP and $90 million related to higher rates and volumes and lower cost at the Company's New York facilities offset by lower sales of excess emissions allowances of approximately $39 million. The following table summarizes revenue and gross margin for our Utilities segment in North America for the periods indicated: For the Years Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 % Change 2008 vs. 2007 % Change 2007 vs. 2006 (Dollars in millions) North America Utilities Revenue $ 1,079 $ 1,052 $ 1,032 3 % 2 % Gross Margin $ 261 $ 313 $ 277 (17 )% 13 % Gross Margin as a % of Segment Revenue 24 % 30 % 27 % Fiscal Year 2008 versus 2007 Utilities revenue increased $27 million, or 3%, from the previous year primarily due to a $42 million increase in rate adjustments at IPL in Indiana, related to environmental investments, $42 million of higher fuel and purchased power costs and an $8 million increase in wholesale prices. These increases were offset by $32 million of credits to customers established during the first six months of 2008, $16 million of lower retail volume primarily due to unfavorable weather compared to 2007 and an $18 million decrease in wholesale volume. 102 Table of Contents Utilities gross margin decreased $52 million, or 17%, from the previous year primarily due to lower variable retail margin of $42 million driven by the credits to customers established during the first six months of 2008 and lower retail volume. In addition, IPL had higher maintenance expenses of $9 million primarily due to storm restoration costs and the timing and duration of major generating unit overhauls, an increase of $6 million in labor and benefits costs and an increase of $3 million in contractor and consulting costs. These decreases to gross margin were offset by a return recovered through rates on approved environmental investments of $14 million. Fiscal Year 2007 versus 2006 Utilities revenue increased $20 million, or 2%, from the previous year primarily due to increased volume due to weather, offset by a decrease in fuel charges passed through to customer at IPL. Utilities gross margin increased $36 million, or 13%, from the previous year primarily due to increased volume sales and a return recovered through rates on approved environmental investments at IPL. Europe & Africa The following table summarizes revenue for our Generation segment in Europe & Africa for the periods indicated: For the Years Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 % Change 2008 vs. 2007 % Change 2007 vs. 2006 (Dollars in millions) Europe & Africa Generation Revenue $ 1,160 $ 975 $ 852 19 % 14 % Gross Margin $ 294 $ 275 $ 247 7 % 11 % Gross Margin as a % of Segment Revenue 25 % 28 % 29 % Fiscal Year 2008 versus 2007 Generation revenue increased $185 million, or 19%, from the previous year primarily due to an increase in capacity income and energy payments at Kilroot in Northern Ireland of approximately $105 million, rate recovery and higher volume of approximately $93 million at our businesses in Hungary and favorable foreign currency translation in Hungary of $32 million. In addition, revenue at Kilroot increased approximately $21 million compared to the previous year primarily due to the unfavorable impact of two major overhauls in 2007. These increases were partially offset by a reduction in revenue of approximately $49 million in Kazakhstan following the sale of Ekibastuz and Maikuben in the second quarter of 2008 that was partially offset by approximately $12 million in management fees earned from continuing management agreements for those businesses. In addition, revenue at Kilroot was approximately $37 million lower due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation. Generation gross margin increased $19 million, or 7%, from the previous year primarily due to higher rates and volume of $43 million at Tisza II in Hungary, and an increase in capacity income and fewer forced outages at Kilroot of approximately $32 million. These were offset by an increase in fixed costs of $24 million at Kilroot and Tisza II, unfavorable foreign currency translation of $12 million at Kilroot and a reduction in gross margin of $29 million in Kazakhstan following the sale of Ekibastuz and Maikuben in the second quarter of 2008 that was partially offset by $9 million in net gross margin from continuing management agreements for those businesses. 103 Table of Contents Fiscal Year 2007 versus 2006 Generation revenue increased $123 million, or 14%, from the previous year primarily due to favorable foreign currency translation of $77 million and increased rate and volume sales of approximately $60 million at our businesses in Kazakhstan. Generation gross margin increased $28 million, or 11%, from the previous year primarily due to rate and volume increases at our businesses in Kazakhstan and Kilroot of $44 million and $13 million, respectively. These increases were offset by lower emission sales in Hungary and Bohemia in the Czech Republic of approximately $28 million. The following table summarizes gross margin for our Utilities segments in Europe & Africa for the periods indicated: For the Years Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 % Change 2008 vs. 2007 % Change 2007 vs. 2006 (Dollars in millions) Europe & Africa Utilities Revenue $ 782 $ 660 $ 570 18 % 16 % Gross Margin $ 57 $ 63 $ 103 (10 )% (39 )% Gross Margin as a % of Segment Revenue 7 % 10 % 18 % Fiscal Year 2008 versus 2007 Utilities revenue increased $122 million, or 18%, from the previous year primarily due to increased tariff rates of approximately $86 million at our businesses in Ukraine, approximately $30 million due to increased rates and volume and $26 million due to favorable foreign currency translation at Sonel in Cameroon. These increases were partially offset by an unfavorable foreign currency translation impact at our businesses in Ukraine of approximately $17 million. Utilities gross margin decreased $6 million, or 10%, from the previous year primarily due to higher fixed costs of approximately $55 million across the region, a mark-to-market derivative adjustment at Sonel of $9 million and the favorable impact in 2007 of fuel pass-through costs under a concession agreement of $6 million, partially offset by increased rates and volume at Sonel of approximately $36 million and increased tariff rates of approximately $23 million at our businesses in Ukraine. Fiscal Year 2007 versus 2006 Utilities revenue increased $90 million, or 16%, from the previous year primarily due to increased tariff rates and volume of approximately $57 million in the Ukraine and approximately $28 million in favorable foreign currency translation. Utilities gross margin decreased $40 million, or 39%, from the previous year primarily due to higher non-fuel operating and maintenance costs as well as higher fuel usage at Sonel. 104 Table of Contents Asia The following table summarizes revenue and gross margin for our Generation segment in Asia for the periods indicated: For the Years Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 % Change 2008 vs. 2007 % Change 2007 vs. 2006 (Dollars in millions) Asia Generation Revenue $ 1,264 $ 817 $ 718 55 % 14 % Gross Margin $ 143 $ 176 $ 186 (19 )% (5 )% Gross Margin as a % of Segment Revenue 11 % 22 % 26 % Fiscal Year 2008 versus 2007 Generation revenue increased $447 million, or 55%, from the previous year primarily due to higher rates driven by increased pass-through fuel prices of $259 million and volume of $41 million at our Lal Pir and Pak Gen businesses in Pakistan, an increase in rates due to pass-through fuel prices at Kelanitissa in Sri Lanka, of approximately $55 million, and revenue generated from our new businesses, Masinloc in the Philippines, and Amman East in Jordan, of $148 million and $46 million, respectively. These increases were partially offset by unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $95 million in Pakistan. Generation gross margin decreased $33 million, or 19%, from the previous year primarily due to the impact of increased fuel prices on heat rate losses of approximately $14 million at Lal Pir and Pak Gen and a $15 million unfavorable impact on revenue from an amended PPA accounted for as a lease, and therefore revenue was recognized on a straight-line basis in accordance with EITF No. 01-8, Determining Whether an Arrangement Contains a Lease at Ras Laffan in Qatar. In addition, Masinloc generated a net gross margin loss of $18 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. These unfavorable effects were partially offset by the favorable impact of $14 million from the start of commercial operations in July 2008 at Amman East. Fiscal Year 2007 versus 2006 Generation revenue increased $99 million, or 14%, from the previous year primarily due to higher dispatch in Pakistan of $83 million and higher volume and rates at Kelanitissa of approximately $30 million offset by volume decreases of approximately $8 million at Chigen in China. Generation gross margin decreased $10 million, or 5%, from the previous year primarily due to decreased volume at Chigen. Corporate and Other Expense Corporate and other expenses include general and administrative expenses, executive management, finance, legal, human resources, information systems and certain development costs which are not allocable to our business segments. In addition, this includes net operating results from AES Wind Generation and other renewables initiatives which are immaterial for the purposes of separate segment disclosure and, the effects of eliminating transactions, such as management fee arrangements and self-insurance charges, between the operating segments and corporate. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, Corporate and other expense was approximately 2 - 3% of total revenues. Corporate and other expense increased $19 million, or 6%, to $355 million in 2008 from $336 million in 2007. The increase was primarily due to higher spending of $16 million on 105 Table of Contents SAP implementation projects and $27 million on the expansion of AES Wind Generation, climate solutions projects and our renewables initiatives, offset partially by a reduction in professional fees related to material weakness remediation efforts. Corporate and other expense increased $91 million, or 37%, to $336 million in 2007 from $245 million in 2006. The increase was primarily due to higher spending in professional fees of approximately $24 million primarily to complete the restatement of our financial statements and for continued material weakness remediation efforts, higher spending due to headcount increases primarily related to the strengthening of our finance organization of approximately $15 million and increased spending of $18 million for our SAP implementation projects. Interest expense Interest expense increased $56 million, or 3%, to $1,844 million in 2008 primarily due to additional interest expense at our recently acquired subsidiary, Masinloc, interest expense associated with derivatives at Eletropaulo, Panama and Puerto Rico, as well as unfavorable foreign currency translation in Brazil. These increases were offset by decreases from the elimination of a financial transaction tax in Brazil, a decrease in regulatory liabilities at Eletropaulo, and a decrease in capitalized interest on development projects at Kilroot. Interest expense increased $19 million, or 1%, to $1,788 million in 2007 primarily due to unfavorable impacts from foreign currency translation in Brazil and interest expense associated with derivatives. These increases were offset by the benefits of debt retirement activity at several of our subsidiaries in Latin America and lower interest rates at one of our subsidiaries in Brazil. Interest income Interest income increased $40 million, or 8%, to $540 million in 2008 primarily due to interest income on short-term investments and cash equivalents at two of our subsidiaries in Brazil, inflationary adjustments on accounts receivable at Gener, and interest earned on a convertible loan acquired in March 2008. These increases were offset by decreases due to lower interest income related to a gross receipts tax recovery at Tiet recorded during the second quarter of 2007 and decreased interest income related to derivatives at TEG/TEP. Interest income increased $66 million, or 15%, to $500 million in 2007 primarily due to favorable foreign currency translation on the Brazilian Real and higher cash and short-term investment balances at certain of our subsidiaries, offset by decreases at two of our Brazilian subsidiaries due to lower interest rates.

These increases were offset by a $135 million contract settlement gain in 2007 at Eastern Energy and a $93 million gross receipts tax recovery in 2007 at Eletropaulo and Tiet in 2007. Other income increased $242 million to $358 million in 2007 primarily due to the Eastern Energy contract settlement gain and tax recoveries in Brazil noted above in addition to favorable legal settlements at Eletropaulo and Red Oak. These increases were offset by a decrease in gains on the extinguishment of debt, which were driven by debt retirement activities at several of our businesses in Latin America in 2006. Other expense Years Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 (in millions) Loss on extinguishment of liabilities $ 70 $ 106 $ 181 Loss on sale and disposal of assets 34 79 23 Legal/dispute settlement 19 36 31 Regulatory special obligations 139 Write-down of disallowed regulatory assets 16 36 Other 40 18 41 Total other expense $ 163 $ 255 $ 451 Other expense decreased $92 million to $163 million in 2008, from $255 million in 2007, primarily due to a decrease in losses on sales and disposals of assets at Sul as well as an extinguishment of debt at the Parent Company. In 2008, there was a loss of $55 million on the retirement of Senior Notes at the Parent Company, compared to a loss of $90 million on a smaller debt retirement in 2007. Other expense decreased $196 million to $255 million in 2007 primarily due to higher losses in 2006 associated with debt retirement activities at several of our Latin American businesses, special obligation charges and the write-down of disallowed regulatory assets at Eletropaulo in 2006. In 2007, there was a loss of $90 million on the retirement of Senior Notes at the Parent Company, as well as higher losses on sales and disposals of assets at Eletropaulo and Sul. Impairment Expense As discussed in Note 19 Impairment Expense to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K, impairment expense for the year 2008 was $175 million and consisted primarily of the following: In the fourth quarter of 2008, and in response to the financial market crisis, the Company reviewed and prioritized projects in the development pipeline. From this review, the Company determined that the carrying value exceeded the future discounted cash flows for certain projects. As a result, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $75 million ($34 million, net of minority interest and income taxes) related to two liquefied natural gas projects in North America and a non-power development project at one of our facilities in North America. During 2008, the Company recognized additional impairment charges of $36 million related to long-lived assets at Uruguaiana. The impairment was triggered by a combination of gas curtailments and increases in the spot market price of energy in 2007 that continued in 2008. Following an initial impairment charge in the fourth quarter 107 Table of Contents of 2007, further charges were incurred in 2008 due to fixed asset purchase agreements in place. During the first half of 2008, the Company withdrew from projects in South Africa and Israel which resulted in impairment charges of $36 million. The Company also recognized an impairment of $18 million related to the shut down of the Hefei plant in China. Impairment expense for the year 2007 was $408 million and consisted primarily of the following: In the fourth quarter of 2007, the Company recognized a pre-tax impairment charge of approximately $14 million related to a $52 million prepayment advanced to AgCert for a specified amount of future CER credits. AgCert, a United Kingdom based corporation that produces emission reduction credits, notified AES that it was not able to meet its contractual obligations to deliver CERs, which triggered an analysis of the asset's recoverability and resulted in the asset impairment charge. Also during the fourth quarter of 2007, there was a pre-tax impairment charge of approximately $352 million at Uruguaiana, a gas-fired thermoelectric plant located in Brazil. The impairment was the result of an analysis of Uruguaiana's long-lived assets, which was triggered by the combination of gas curtailments and increases in the spot market price of energy. In August 2007, there was a pre-tax impairment charge of $25 million triggered by the failure of a compressor at our Placerita subsidiary in California. The fixed asset impairment was caused by damage sustained to one of the plant's gas turbines. Also during the third quarter of 2007, a pre-tax fixed asset impairment charge of approximately $10 million was recognized related to the curtailment of operations at Coal Creek Minerals, LLC, a coal mining company owned by our subsidiary Cavanal Minerals located in the United States. Impairment expense for the year 2006 was $17 million and consisted primarily of the following: During the fourth quarter of 2006, there was a pre-tax impairment charge of $6 million related to AES China Generating Co. Ltd. ("Chigen") equity investment in Wuhu, a coal-fired plant located in China. The equity impairment in Wuhu was required as a result of a goodwill impairment analysis at Chigen. During the third quarter of 2006, there was an impairment charge of $5 million related to a decrease in the market value of five held for sale gas turbines at our subsidiary Itabo located in the Dominican Republic. Gain on sale of investments Gain on sale of investments of $909 million in 2008 consisted primarily of the sale in May 2008 of our two wholly-owned subsidiaries in Kazakhstan, AES Ekibastuz LLP and Maikuben West LLP for a net gain of $905 million. There was no gain on sale of investments for the year ended December 31, 2007. Gain on sale of investments in 2006 of $98 million was the result of a net gain of $87 million from our sale of an equity investment in a power project in Canada (Kingston) in March 2006 and a net gain of $10 million related to our transfer of Infoenergy, a wholly owned AES subsidiary, to Brasiliana in September 2006. Brasiliana is 53.85% owned by BNDES, but controlled by AES. This transaction was part of the Company's agreement with BNDES to terminate the Sul Option. (Loss) gain on sale of subsidiary stock In November 2008, Cachagua, our wholly owned subsidiary, which owned 80.2% of AES Gener S.A. ("Gener") shares prior to the transaction, sold 9.6% of its ownership in Gener to a third party. After this transaction, Cachagua's new ownership in Gener was 70.6%. As a result of this transaction, the Company recorded a net loss on the sale of shares of $31 million. Gain on sale of subsidiary stock in 2007 of $134 million was a result of net gains recognized on the sale of a 0.91% and 10.18% ownership interest in Gener in May and October of 2007, respectively. 108 Table of Contents As discussed in Note 17 Subsidiary Stock to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K, in September 2006, Brasiliana's wholly owned subsidiary, Transg sold a 33% economic ownership in Eletropaulo, a regulated electric utility in Brazil. Despite the reduction in economic ownership, there was no change in Brasiliana's voting interest in Eletropaulo, and Brasiliana continues to control Eletropaulo. Brasiliana received $522 million in net proceeds on the sale. On October 5, 2006 Transg s, sold an additional 5% economic ownership in Eletropaulo for net proceeds of $78 million. In 2006, AES recognized a pre-tax loss of $535 million primarily as a result of the recognition of previously deferred currency translation losses. Foreign currency transaction gains (losses) on net monetary position The following table summarizes the gains (losses) on the Company's net monetary position from foreign currency transaction activities: Years Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 (in millions) AES Corporation $ 38 $ 31 $ (17 ) Chile (102 ) (4 ) Philippines (57 ) Brazil (44 ) 5 (49 ) Argentina (22 ) (8 ) (3 ) Kazakhstan 11 10 1 Mexico (9 ) (2 ) Colombia 5 (7 ) (1 ) Pakistan (1 ) (4 ) (18 ) Other (4 ) 3 7 Total (1) $ (185 ) $ 24 $ (80 ) (1) Includes $10 million, ($22) million and ($51) million of gains (losses) on foreign currency derivative contracts for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The Company recognized foreign currency transaction losses of $185 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. These consisted primarily of losses in Chile, the Philippines, Brazil, Argentina and Mexico partially offset by gains at The AES Corporation and in Kazakhstan. Losses of $102 million in Chile were primarily due to the devaluation of the Chilean Peso by 28% in 2008, resulting in losses at Gener, a U.S. Dollar functional currency subsidiary, associated with its net working capital denominated in Chilean Pesos, mainly cash, accounts receivable and VAT receivables. Losses of $57 million in the Philippines were primarily due to remeasurement losses at Masinloc, a Philippine Peso functional currency subsidiary, on U.S. Dollar denominated debt resulting from depreciation of the Philippine Peso of 16% in 2008. Losses of $44 million in Brazil were primarily due to the realization of deferred exchange variance on past energy purchases made by Eletropaulo denominated in U.S. Dollar, resulting in foreign currency transaction losses of $41 million. Losses of $22 million in Argentina were primarily due to the devaluation of the Argentinean Peso by 10% in 2008, resulting in losses at Alicura, an Argentine Peso functional currency subsidiary, associated with its U.S. Dollar denominated debt. 109 Table of Contents Losses of $9 million in Mexico were primarily due to the devaluation of the Mexican Peso by 26% in 2008, resulting in losses of approximately $9 million at TEG/TEP. Gains of $38 million at The AES Corporation were primarily due to debt denominated in British Pounds and gains on foreign exchange derivatives, partially offset by losses on notes receivable denominated in Euro. Gains of $11 million in Kazakhstan were primarily due to net foreign currency transaction gains of $16 million related to energy sales denominated and fixed in the U.S. Dollar, offset by $5 million of foreign currency transaction losses on external and intercompany debt denominated in other than functional currencies. Foreign currency transaction gains of $24 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 primarily consisted of gains at The AES Corporation and in Kazakhstan partially offset by losses in Argentina and Colombia. Gains of $31 million at The AES Corporation were primarily the result of favorable exchange rates for debt denominated in British Pounds and the Euro. Gains of $10 million in Kazakhstan were primarily due to $12 million of gains related to debt denominated in currencies other than the Kazakh Tenge functional currency, partially offset by $3 million of losses related to energy sales denominated and fixed in the U.S. Dollar. Losses of $8 million in Argentina were primarily due to the devaluation of the Argentine Peso by 3% in 2007, resulting in losses of $11 million at Alicura associated with its U.S. Dollar denominated debt. Losses of $7 million in Colombia were primarily due to the appreciation of the Colombian Peso by 11% in 2007 at Chivor, a U.S. Dollar function currency subsidiary. Foreign currency transaction losses of $80 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 primarily consisted of losses in Brazil, Pakistan and at The AES Corporation. Losses of $49 million in Brazil were primarily the result of losses of $45 million at Eletropaulo from swap contracts that were paid and executed in 2006 as Eletropaulo converted U.S. Dollar debt to Brazilian Real debt. Losses of $18 million in Pakistan were primarily the result of the depreciation of the Pakistani Rupee. Losses of $17 million at AES Corporation were primarily the result of unfavorable exchange rates for debt denominated in British Pounds and the Euro. Other non-operating expense Other non-operating expense was $15 million in 2008 compared to $57 million in 2007. The 2008 expense related primarily to an impairment of the Company's investment in a company developing a "blue gas" (coal to gas) technology project. The Company made this investment in September 2007 and accounted for the investment in convertible preferred shares under the cost method of accounting. During the fourth quarter of 2008, the market value of the shares materially declined due to downward trends in the capital markets and management concluded that the decline was other-than-temporary and recorded an impairment charge of $10 million. Additionally, the Company recorded an other-than-temporary impairment charge of approximately $5 million related to its investments in other entities developing new energy technology and products. Other non-operating expense in 2007 reflected the impairment in the Company's investment in AgCert, a U.K. based corporation, publicly traded on the London Stock Exchange, that produces CER credits. The Company acquired its investment in AgCert in May 2006 and, similar to the circumstances stated above, the market value of the Company's investment materially declined during 110 Table of Contents the first half of 2007 and the Company recorded an other-than-temporary impairment charge of $52 million in 2007. An additional charge of $5 million was recognized for the decrease in value of the AgCert warrants also held by the Company. The Company began consolidating AgCert in January 2008 when it became the primary beneficiary. Income taxes Income tax expense on continuing operations increased $95 million, or 14%, to $774 million in 2008. The Company's effective tax rates were 28% for 2008 and 45% for 2007. The decrease in the 2008 effective tax rate was primarily due to the non-taxable gain of $905 million on the sale of the Kazakhstan businesses in the second quarter of 2008, offset by U.S. taxes on distributions from the Company's primary holding company to facilitate early retirement of parent debt in 2008. The decrease was also attributable to the implementation of a tax planning strategy that mitigated the impact of the Mexico Flat Rate Business Tax ("IETU") enacted in the fourth quarter of 2007. The strategy resulted in a reduction to deferred tax expense in 2008 of $24 million and $23 million at TEG and TEP, respectively. Income tax expense related to continuing operations increased $320 million, or 89%, to $679 million in 2007. The Company's effective tax rates were 45% for 2007 and 39% for 2006. The increase in the 2007 effective tax rate was due, in part, to an impairment at Uruguaiana for which no tax benefit was recorded, the impact of an appreciating Real in certain of our Brazilian subsidiaries, and the impact of income tax law changes in Mexico, partially offset by the nontaxable gain on the sales of shares of one of the Company's Chilean subsidiaries and a release of valuation allowance at one of our subsidiaries in Argentina. Net equity in earnings of affiliates Net equity in earnings of affiliates decreased $43 million, or 57%, to $33 million in 2008 primarily due to the impact of increased coal prices at Yangcheng, a coal-fired plant in China, a decrease as a result of development costs related to AES Solar, formed in March 2008, and an additional write-off of three projects in Turkey that were abandoned in December 2007. Additionally, earnings decreased due to the sale of a wind project in the fourth quarter of 2007, a decrease in earnings at OPGC, in India, and decreased earnings due to a discontinuance of hedge accounting for a number of interest rate swaps at Guacolda in Chile. These losses were partially offset by a decrease in net losses at Cartagena in Spain primarily from a write-off of deferred financing costs in 2007 that did not recur in 2008. Net equity in earnings of affiliates increased $3 million, or 4%, to $76 million in 2007 primarily due to a full year of operations at Cartagena in 2007 and the absence of liquidated damages incurred in 2006 for construction delays. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in earnings in 2007 at AES Barry compared to 2006, due to proceeds received in 2006 from the settlement of a legal claim that did not recur in 2007. Minority interest Minority interest expense, net of tax, increased $363 million, or 84%, to $794 million in 2008 primarily due to the decreased losses as a result of the impairment recognized at Uruguaiana during 2007, increased earnings at Eletropaulo, Gener, Itabo, Panama and Tiet , as well as an increase in minority shareholders from approximately 20% to approximately 29% as a result of the sale of shares in Gener in November 2008. These increases were partially offset by an impairment recognized in the Bahamas, a net loss at Masinloc, and decreased earnings at Ras Laffan, Sonel, and Caess-EEO & Clesa in El Salvador. Minority interest expense, net of tax, decreased $29 million, or 6%, to $431 million in 2007 primarily due to the recognition of previously deferred currency translation losses associated with the sale of Eletropaulo shares during the third quarter 2006, resulting in a decrease of our economic ownership in 111 Table of Contents Eletropaulo from 34% to 16%. See Note 17 Subsidiary Stock to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for a further discussion of the sale of Eletropaulo shares and the Brasiliana restructuring. The decrease was also attributable to the minority interest impact of the impairment recognized at Uruguaiana in 2007, offset by increased earnings at Tiet . Discontinued operations As further discussed in Note 21 Discontinued Operations and Held for Sale Businesses to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K, Discontinued Operations includes the results of five businesses: Jiaozuo, a generation business in China, (sold in December 2008); La Electricidad de Caracas ("EDC"), a utility business in Venezuela, (sold in May 2007); Central Valley, a generation business in California (sold in July 2007); Eden, a utility business in Argentina (sold in June 2007), and Indian Queens, a generation business in the U.K. (sold in May 2006). Prior periods have been restated to reflect these businesses within Discontinued Operations for all periods presented. In 2008, income from operations of discontinued businesses, net of tax, was $12 million and reflected the operations of Jiaozuo, a coal-fired generation facility in China sold in December 2008. The Company received $73 million for its 70% interest in the business. The net gain on the disposition was $7 million. In 2007, income from operations of discontinued businesses, net of tax, was $79 million and reflected the operations of Jiaozuo, EDC, Central Valley and Eden. EDC and Central Valley were sold in May 2007 and July 2007 for $739 million and $51 million, respectively, and the Eden sale was finalized in June 2007, therefore their results are reflected in the Company's results of operations through their respective sales dates. The loss on the disposal of discontinued businesses was $661 million and primarily related to the $680 million loss on the sale of EDC. In 2006, income from operations of discontinued businesses, net of tax, was $115 million and reflected the operations of Jiaozuo, EDC, Central Valley, Eden and Indian Queens. Indian Queens was sold in May 2006 therefore its results are reflected in the Company's results of operations through the sale date. The loss on the disposal of discontinued businesses was $57 million and primarily related to the $62 million impairment charge recognized at Eden to adjust the carrying value of its assets to their estimated net realizable value when the Company reached an agreement to sell Eden in May 2006. The Eden sale was finalized in June 2007. Extraordinary item In May 2006, AES purchased an additional 25% interest in Itabo, a power generation business located in the Dominican Republic for approximately $23 million. Prior to May, the Company held a 25% interest in Itabo, through its Gener subsidiary, and had accounted for the investment using the equity method of accounting with a corresponding investment balance reflected in the "Investments in and advances to affiliates" line item on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As a result of the transaction, the Company consolidates Itabo and, therefore, the investment balance has been reclassified to the appropriate line items on the Consolidated Balance Sheets with a corresponding minority interest liability for the remaining 50% interest not owned by AES. The Company realized an after-tax extraordinary gain of $21 million as a result of the transaction due to an excess of the fair value of the noncurrent assets over the purchase price. Critical Accounting Estimates The Consolidated Financial Statements of AES are prepared in conformity with GAAP, which requires the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. AES's significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 General and 112 Table of Contents Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. An accounting estimate is considered critical if: the estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the estimate was made; different estimates reasonably could have been used; or the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material. Management believes that the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and the resulting balances are reasonable; however, actual results could differ from the original estimates, requiring adjustments to these balances in future periods. Management has discussed these critical accounting policies with the audit committee, as appropriate. Listed below are certain significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Income Tax Reserves We are subject to income taxes in both the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our worldwide income tax provision requires significant judgment and is based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service and other taxing authorities. The Company and certain of its subsidiaries are under examination by relevant taxing authorities for various tax years. The Company regularly assesses the potential outcome of these examinations in each of the taxing jurisdictions when determining the adequacy of the provision for income taxes. The Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Interpretation ("FIN") No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes , ("FIN No. 48") effective January 1, 2007. The Interpretation prescribes a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold and establishes new measurement requirements for financial statement reporting of an entity's income tax positions. Tax reserves have been established, which the Company believes to be adequate in relation to the potential for additional assessments. Once established, reserves are adjusted only when there is more information available or when an event occurs necessitating a change to the reserves. While the Company believes that the amount of the tax estimates are reasonable, it is possible that the ultimate outcome of current or future examinations may exceed current reserves in amounts that could be material. Goodwill We test goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or circumstances make it more likely than not that impairment may have occurred. Such indicators could include a significant adverse change in the business climate or a decision to sell or dispose all or a portion of a reporting unit. Goodwill impairment is evaluated using a two-step process. The first step is to identify if a potential impairment exists by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value. Determining whether an impairment has occurred requires the valuation of the respective reporting unit. The Company uses a discounted cash flow method to estimate the fair value. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered to be impaired and no further analysis is required. In applying this methodology, we rely on a number of factors, including actual operating results, future business plans, economic projections and market data. Assumptions about operating results and growth rates are based on forecasts, future business plans, economic projections and anticipated future cash flows, among other things. Changes in any of these assumptions could result in management reaching a different conclusion regarding the potential impairment of a reporting unit. Our impairment analysis contains uncertainties from uncontrollable events that could positively or negatively impact the anticipated future economic and operating conditions. 113 Table of Contents If the carrying value exceeds the reporting unit's fair value, this could indicate potential impairment and step two of the goodwill evaluation process is required to determine if goodwill is impaired and to measure the amount of impairment loss to recognize, if any. The measurement of impairment requires a fair value estimate of each identified tangible and intangible asset in the same manner the fair value would be determined in a business combination. In this case, we supplement the cash flow approach discussed above with appraisals, or other observable sources of fair value, as appropriate. Regulatory Assets and Liabilities The Company accounts for certain of its regulated operations under the provisions of SFAS No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation, ( "SFAS No. 71" ) . As a result, AES recognizes assets and liabilities that result from the regulated ratemaking process that would not be recognized under GAAP for non-regulated entities. Regulatory assets generally represent incurred costs that have been deferred because such costs are probable of future recovery in customer rates. Regulatory liabilities generally represent obligations to make refunds to customers for previous collections for costs that are not likely to be incurred or included in future rate initiatives. Management continually assesses whether the regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by considering factors such as applicable regulatory changes, recent rate orders applicable to other regulated entities and the status of any pending or potential deregulation legislation. If future recovery of costs ceases to be probable, any asset write-offs would be required to be recognized in operating income. Fair Value Fair Value of Financial Instruments A significant number of the Company's financial instruments are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings or other comprehensive income each period. The Company makes estimates regarding valuation of assets and liabilities measured at fair value in preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements. These assets and liabilities include short and long-term investments in debt and equity securities, included in the balance sheet line items "Short-term investments" and "Other assets (Noncurrent)", derivative assets, included in "Other current assets" and "Other assets (Noncurrent)" and derivative liabilities, included in "Accrued and other liabilities (current)" and "Other long-term liabilities". The Company uses valuation techniques and methodologies that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Where available, fair value is based on observable market prices or parameters or derived from such prices or parameters. Where observable prices or inputs are not available, valuation models are applied. The valuation techniques involve some level of management estimation and judgment, the degree of which is dependent on the price transparency for the instruments or market and the instruments' complexity. Investments are generally fair valued based on quoted market prices or other observable market data such as interest rate indices. The Company's investments are primarily certificates of deposit, government debt securities and money market funds. Derivatives are valued using observable data as inputs into internal valuation models. The Company's derivatives primarily consist of interest rate swaps, foreign currency instruments, and commodity and embedded derivatives. Additional discussion regarding the nature of these financial instruments and valuation techniques can be found in Note 6 Fair Value of Financial Instruments. Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities We enter into various derivative transactions in order to hedge our exposure to certain market risks. We primarily use derivative instruments to manage our interest rate, commodity, and foreign currency exposures. We do not enter into derivative transactions for trading purposes. 114 Table of Contents Under SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities as amended, ("SFAS No. 133"), we recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value except where derivatives qualify and are designated as "normal purchase/normal sale" transactions. Changes in fair value of derivatives are recognized in earnings unless specific hedge criteria are met. Income and expense related to derivative instruments are recognized in the same category as generated by the underlying asset or liability. SFAS No. 133 enables companies to designate qualifying derivatives as hedging instruments based on the exposure being hedged. These hedge designations include fair value hedges and cash flow hedges. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is highly effective and is designated and qualifies as a fair value hedge, are recognized in earnings as offsets to the changes in fair value of the exposure being hedged. The Company has no fair value hedges at this time. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is highly effective and is designated as and qualifies as a cash flow hedge, are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income and are recognized into earnings as the hedged transactions occur. Any ineffectiveness is recognized in earnings immediately. For all hedge contracts, the Company provides formal documentation of the hedge and effectiveness testing in accordance with SFAS No. 133. The Company adopted SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurement , ("SFAS No. 157") on January 1, 2008. SFAS No. 157 provides additional guidance on the definition of fair value and defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, or exit price. SFAS No. 157 requires the Company to consider and reflect the assumptions of market participants in the fair value calculation. These factors include nonperformance risk (the risk that the obligation will not be fulfilled) and credit risk, both of the reporting entity (for liabilities) and of the counterparty (for assets). These factors were not previously considered in the fair value calculation. Due to the nature of the Company's interest rate swaps, which are typically associated with non-recourse debt, credit risk for AES is evaluated at the subsidiary level rather than at the Parent Company level. Nonperformance risk on the Company's derivative instruments is an adjustment to the initial asset/liability fair value position that is derived from internally developed valuation models that utilize observable market inputs. As a result of uncertainty, complexity and judgment, accounting estimates related to derivative accounting could result in material changes to our financial statements under different conditions or utilizing different assumptions. As a part of accounting for these derivatives, we make estimates concerning nonperformance, volatilities, market liquidity, future commodity prices, interest rates, credit ratings (both ours and our counterparty's), and exchange rates. The fair value of our derivative portfolio is generally determined using internal valuation models, most of which are based on observable market inputs including interest rate curves and forward and spot prices for currencies and commodities. The Company derives most of its financial instrument market assumptions from market efficient data sources (e.g. Bloomberg and Platt's). In some cases, where market data is not readily available, management uses comparable market sources and empirical evidence to derive market assumptions to determine a financial instrument's fair value. In certain instances, the published curve may not extend through the remaining term of the contract and management must make assumptions to extrapolate the curve. Additionally, in the absence of quoted prices, we may rely on "indicative pricing" quotes from financial institutions to input into our valuation model for certain of our foreign currency swaps. These indicative pricing quotes do not constitute either a bid or ask price and therefore are not considered observable market data. For individual contracts, the use of different valuation models or assumptions could have a material effect on the calculated fair value. 115 Table of Contents Fair Value Hierarchy The Company uses valuation techniques and methodologies that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Where available, fair value is based on observable market prices or parameters or derived from such prices or parameters. Where observable prices or inputs are not available, valuation models are applied. The valuation techniques involve some level of management estimation and judgment, the degree of which is dependent on the price transparency for the instruments or market and the instruments' complexity. To increase consistency and enhance disclosure of the fair value of financial instruments, SFAS No. 157 creates a fair value hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used to measure fair value into three categories. A financial instrument's level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input significant to the fair value measurement, where Level 1 is the highest and Level 3 is the lowest. For more information regarding the fair value hierarchy, see Note 1 General and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data in this Form 10-K. New Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157. SFAS No. 157 provides enhanced guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities, but does not expand the application of fair value accounting to any new circumstances. The Company adopted SFAS No. 157 on January 1, 2008. See the Company's fair value policy in Note 1 General and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data in this Form 10-K. SFAS No. 157 is applied prospectively, except for changes in fair value for existing derivative financial instruments that include an adjustment for a blockage factor, existing hybrid instruments measured at fair value and financial instruments accounted for in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") Issue No. 02-3, Issues Involved in Accounting for Derivative Contracts Held for Trading Purposes and Contracts Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities ("EITF No. 02-3"), under which day one gain or loss recognition was prohibited. For these instruments, the impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 157 can be recorded as an adjustment to beginning retained earnings in the year of adoption. The Company does not have any of these financial instruments; therefore there is no cumulative impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 157 for AES. The adoption of SFAS No. 157 did not materially impact the Company's financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. FSP No. 157-1: Application of FASB Statement No. 157 to FASB Statement No. 13 and Other Accounting Pronouncements That Address Fair Value Measurements for Purposes of Lease Classification or Measurement under Statement 13 ("FSP No. 157-1"). In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position ("FSP") No. 157-1, Application of FASB Statement No. 157 to FASB Statement No. 13 and Other Accounting Pronouncements That Address Fair Value Measurements for Purposes of Lease Classification or Measurement Under Statement 13 , ("FSP No. 157-1"). FSP No. 157-1 excludes SFAS No. 13, Accounting for Leases , ("SFAS No. 13") and most other accounting pronouncements that address fair value measurement of leases from the scope of SFAS No. 157. FSP No. 157-2: Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157 ("FSP No. 157-2"). In February 2008, the FASB issued FSP No. 157-2, which delays the effective date of SFAS No. 157 for all nonrecurring fair value measurements of nonfinancial assets and liabilities until fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008, or January 1, 2009 for AES. AES continues to evaluate the future impact of SFAS No. 157 on these assets and liabilities but at this time does not believe that the impact will be material. 116 Table of Contents FSP No. 157-3: Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset When the Market for That Asset is Not Active ("FSP No. 157-3"). In October 2008, the FASB issued FSP No. 157-3, which clarifies the application of SFAS No. 157 in a market that is not active and provides an example to illustrate key considerations in determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that financial asset is not active. The guidance emphasizes that determining fair value in an inactive market depends on the facts and circumstances and may require the use of significant judgments. FSP No. 157-3 is effective upon issuance, including prior periods for which financial statements have not been issued, and therefore was effective for AES at September 30, 2008. The adoption of FSP No. 157-3 did not have a material impact on the Company. SFAS No. 159: The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities including an amendment of FAS No. 115 ("SFAS No. 159"). In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, which allows entities to choose, at specified election dates, to measure eligible financial assets and liabilities at fair value that are not otherwise required to be measured at fair value. If a company elects the fair value option for an eligible item, changes in that item's fair value in subsequent reporting periods must be recognized in current earnings. The Company adopted SFAS No. 159 effective January 1, 2008. As allowed by the standard, the Company did not elect the fair value option for the measurement of any eligible assets or liabilities. Therefore, the January 1, 2008 adoption did not have an impact on the Company. FSP FAS 133-1 and FIN 45-4: Disclosures about Credit Derivatives and Certain Guarantees: An Amendment of FASB Statement No. 133 and FASB Interpretation No.45; and Clarification of the Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 161 ("FSP No. FAS 133-1 & FIN 45-4" or "the FSP"). In September 2008, the FASB issued the FSP to address the concerns of financial statement users that existing disclosure requirements under SFAS No. 133 do not adequately reflect the potential adverse effects of changes in credit risk on the financial statements of the sellers of credit derivatives. FSP No. FAS 133-1 & FIN 45-4 requires disclosure of additional information about these potential adverse effects of changes in credit risk on the financial position, financial performance, and cash flows of sellers of credit derivatives. The disclosures are required for all credit derivatives, whether freestanding or embedded in a hybrid instrument. The FSP also amends FIN No. 45 to require additional disclosure about the current status of the payment performance risk of a guarantee. This new disclosure applies to all guarantees, not just those related to credit risk. The provisions in the FSP are effective for reporting periods ending after November 15, 2008, or December 31, 2008 for AES. AES has incorporated these additional disclosures into its Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008. Comparative disclosures are required for periods subsequent to adoption. Additionally, the FSP clarifies that SFAS No. 161 is effective for all periods, including quarterly and annual periods beginning after November 15, 2008, or January 1, 2009 for AES. FSP No. FAS 140-4 and FIN 46(R)-8: Disclosures by Public Entities (Enterprises) about Transfers of Financial Assets and Interests in Variable Interest Entities ("FSP No. FAS 140-4 & FIN 46(R)-8"). In December 2008, the FASB issued FSP No. FAS 140-4 and FIN 46(R)-8, which expands the required disclosures pertaining to an enterprise's involvement with variable interest entities ("VIEs") and is intended to provide more transparent information related to that involvement. The new disclosure requirements include additional information regarding consolidated VIEs as well as a requirement for sponsors of a VIE to disclose certain information even if they do not hold a significant financial interest in the VIE. FSP No. FAS 140-4 & FIN 46(R)-8 is effective for reporting periods ending after December 15, 2008. The Company adopted FSP No. FAS 140-4 & FIN 46(R)-8 effective December 31, 2008 but there was no material change to our disclosures. 117 Table of Contents The following accounting standards have been issued, but as of December 31, 2008 are not yet effective and have not been adopted by AES. SFAS No. 141(revised 2007): Business Combinations ("SFAS No. 141(R)") and SFAS No. 160: Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, an amendment of ARB No. 51 ("SFAS No. 160"). In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R) and SFAS No. 160. SFAS No. 141(R) will significantly change how business acquisitions are accounted for at the acquisition date and in subsequent periods. The standard changes the accounting for the business combination at the acquisition date to a fair value based approach rather than the cost allocation approach currently used. Other differences include changes in the accounting for acquisition related costs, contingencies and income taxes. SFAS No. 160 changes the accounting and reporting for minority interests, which will be classified as a component of equity and will be referred to as noncontrolling interests. SFAS No. 141(R) and SFAS No. 160 will be effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008, January 1, 2009 for AES. SFAS No. 141(R) and SFAS No. 160 will be applied prospectively, except for the presentation and disclosure requirements in SFAS No. 160 for existing minority interests which will require retroactive adoption. Early adoption is prohibited. AES has not completed its analysis of the potential future impact of SFAS No. 141(R) and SFAS No. 160. SFAS No. 161: Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, an amendment of SFAS No. 133 ("SFAS No. 161"). In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, which expands the disclosure requirements under SFAS No. 133. The enhanced quantitative and qualitative disclosures will include how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for and how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity's financial position, financial performance and cash flows. SFAS No. 161 is effective for the Company on January 1, 2009. SFAS No. 161 also amends SFAS No. 107, Disclosures about Fair Value Instruments , ("SFAS No. 107") to clarify that derivative instruments are subject to SFAS No. 107 disclosure requirements regarding concentration of credit risk. The Company will incorporate the additional disclosures beginning with its Form 10-Q for the three months ending March 31, 2009. SFAS No 162: The Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("SFAS No. 162"). In May 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 162, which identifies the framework, or hierarchy for selecting accounting principles to be used in preparing financial statements presented in conformity with U.S. GAAP. SFAS No. 162 amends the existing U.S. GAAP hierarchy established and set forth in the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants ("AICPA") Statement of Auditing Standard No. 69, The Meaning of Present Fairly in Conformity With Generally Accepted Accounting Principles , ("SAS 69"). The framework serves as a guide in determining the appropriate accounting treatment to be used for a transaction or event. We do not expect SFAS No. 162 to have an impact on Company's current accounting practices. The Standard will become effective 60 days following the SEC's approval of Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ("PCAOB") amendments to AU Section 411, The Meaning of Present Fairly in Conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principle s. FSP No. FAS 142-3: Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets ("FSP No. FAS 142-3"). In April 2008, the FASB issued FSP No. FAS 142-3, which amends the factors considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets , ("SFAS No. 142"). FSP No. 142-3 requires a consistent approach between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under SFAS No. 142 and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of an asset under SFAS No. 141(R). The FSP also requires enhanced disclosures when an intangible asset's expected 118 Table of Contents future cash flows are affected by an entity's intent and/or ability to renew or extend the arrangement. FSP No. 142-3 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, January 1, 2009 for AES, and is to be applied prospectively. Early adoption is prohibited. AES has not completed its analysis of the potential impact of FSP No. 142-3, but does not believe the adoption will have a material impact on the Company's financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. FSP No. APB 14-1: Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement) ("FSP No. APB 14-1"). In May 2008, the FASB issued FSP No. APB 14-1, which clarifies that convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash or other assets upon conversion are not addressed by APB No. 14, Accounting for Convertible Debt and Debt Issued with Stock Purchase Warrants . Additionally, FSP APB No. 14-1 requires an entity to separately account for the liability and equity components of a convertible instrument to reflect an entity's nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest cost is recognized in subsequent periods. FSP APB No. 14-1 also expands the disclosure requirements regarding convertible debt instrument terms and how the instrument is reflected in an entity's financial statements. AES has reviewed the impact of FSP No. APB 14-1 and determined that FSP No. APB 14-1 is not applicable for any of the Company's instruments. EITF 08-3: Accounting by Lessees for Maintenance Deposits ("EITF 08-3"). In June 2008, the EITF issued EITF 08-3, which clarifies how a lessee accounts for nonrefundable maintenance deposits. Under EITF 08-3 nonrefundable maintenance deposits will be recorded as a deposit asset and as reimbursable maintenance is performed by the lessee, the underlying maintenance is expensed or capitalized in accordance with the lessee's accounting policy. EITF 08-3 is effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2009. Early adoption is not permitted. The effect of adoption will be reflected as a change in accounting principle through a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the year of adoption. AES is currently reviewing the potential impact of EITF 08-3, but at this time does not believe it will have a material impact on the Company's financial statements. FSP No. FAS 132(R)-1: Employers' Disclosures about Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets ("FSP No. FAS 132(R)-1"). In December 2008, the FASB issued FSP No. FAS 132(R)-1, which provides guidance regarding an employers' disclosures about plan assets of a defined benefit pension or other postretirement plan. The FSP is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2009, or the year ending December 31, 2009 for AES. The Company will incorporate the required disclosures in its Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2009. EITF 08-6: Equity Method Investment Accounting Considerations ("EITF 08-6"). In November 2008 EITF 08-6 was issued. This Issue clarifies the accounting for certain transactions and impairment considerations involving equity method investments. EITF 08-6 makes certain amendments to APB 18, The Equity Method of Accounting for Common Stock . The Company does not expect EITF 08-6 to have a significant impact on current practice. EITF 08-6 is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008, and interim periods within those fiscal years, consistent with the effective dates of Statement 141(R) and Statement 160, or January 1, 2009 for AES. 119 Table of Contents Capital Resources and Liquidity Overview As discussed in Highlights of 2008, the Company began a number of initiatives as early as October 2007 and continuing throughout 2008 to mitigate our refinancing risks and manage our liquidity at the Parent Company as well as our subsidiaries. These efforts included reducing our discretionary growth investments, extending and smoothing our future debt maturities, and reducing our planned spending for overhead and development expenses. As a result of these efforts, Parent Company Liquidity at December 31, 2008 was approximately $1.4 billion. This is available to service $260 million of investment commitments over the next three years, which includes $154 million of scheduled debt maturities in 2009, before considering cash inflows and outflows related to distributions from subsidiaries, overhead and development expenses as well as cash taxes at the Parent Company. As of December 31, 2008, the Company had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $0.9 billion and short term investments of $1.4 billion. In addition, we had restricted cash and debt service reserves of $1.4 billion. The Company also had non-recourse and recourse aggregate principal amounts of debt outstanding of $12.9 billion and $5.2 billion, respectively. Of the approximately $1.1 billion of our short-term non-recourse debt $945 million is presented as current because it is due in the next twelve months and $129 million relates to defaulted debt. We expect such maturities will be repaid from net cash provided by operating activities of the subsidiary to which the debt relates or through opportunistic refinancing activity or some combination thereof. Approximately $0.2 billion of our recourse debt matures within the next twelve months which we expect to repay using cash on hand at the Parent Company or through net cash provided by operating activities. We rely mainly on long-term debt obligations to fund our project development, construction and acquisition activities. We have, to the extent achievable, utilized non-recourse debt to fund a significant portion of the capital expenditures and investments required to construct and acquire our electric power plants, distribution companies and related assets. Our non-recourse financing is designed to limit cross default risk to the Parent Company or other subsidiaries and affiliates and is generally secured by the capital stock, physical assets, contracts and cash flow of the related subsidiary or affiliate. Generally our non-recourse long-term debt is a combination of fixed and variable interest rate instruments. A portion or all of our variable rate non-recourse debt is generally fixed through the use of interest rate swaps. In addition, the debt is typically denominated in the currency that matches the currency expected to be received for revenue generated from the benefiting project thereby reducing currency risk. As of December 31, 2008, approximately 92% of the Company's non-recourse debt is denominated in currency matched to the local currency of the subsidiary that incurred the debt. In certain cases the currency is matched through the use of derivative instruments. These derivatives can require that the Company post collateral to support the currency match. As of December 31, 2008, Gener had posted $25 million in the form of a letter of credit and $46 million in bank deposits to support this type of swap. Our non-recourse debt is funded by international commercial banks, multilateral institutions and local regional banks. For more information on our long-term debt, see Note 10 Long-Term Debt to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Given its long-term debt obligations, the Company is subject to interest rate risk on debt balances that accrue interest at variable rates. When possible, the Company will borrow funds at fixed interest rates or hedge its variable rate debt to fix its interest costs on such obligations. In addition, the Company historically has tried to maintain at least 70% of its consolidated long-term obligations at fixed rates of interest including through the use of interest rate swaps and other interest rate related derivatives. These efforts apply to the notional amount of the swaps compared to the amount of related underlying debt. While the Company believes that this represents an economic hedge, the Company may be required to mark-to-market all or a portion of these interest rate swaps and other derivatives. Presently, The Parent Company's only exposure to variable interest rate debt relates to indebtedness 120 Table of Contents under its senior secured and unsecured credit facilities. On a consolidated basis, of the Company's $18.1 billion of total debt outstanding as of December 31, 2008, approximately $3.4 billion bore interest at variable rates of interest that was not subject to an interest rate swap which fixed the interest rate. In addition to utilizing non-recourse debt at a subsidiary level when available, the Parent Company provides a portion, or in certain instances all, of the remaining long-term financing or credit required to fund development, construction or acquisition of a particular project. These investments have generally taken the form of equity investments or loans, which are subordinated to the project's non-recourse loans. We generally obtain the funds for these investments from our cash flows from operations and/or the proceeds from our issuances of debt, common stock and other securities, as well as proceeds from the sales of assets. Similarly, in certain of our businesses, we may provide financial guarantees or other credit support for the benefit of counterparties who have entered into contracts for the purchase or sale of electricity with our subsidiaries or lenders. In such circumstances, if a subsidiary defaults on its payment or supply obligation, we will be responsible for the subsidiary's obligations up to the amount provided for in the relevant guarantee or other credit support. At December 31, 2008, we had provided outstanding financial and performance-related guarantees or other credit support commitments to or for the benefit of our subsidiaries, which were limited by the terms of the agreements, in an aggregate of approximately $411 million (excluding investment commitments and those collateralized by letters of credit and other obligations discussed below). As a result of the Parent Company's below investment grade rating, as well as economic conditions that might have an effect on the appetite for corporate credit, counterparties may be unwilling to accept our general unsecured commitments to provide credit support. Accordingly, with respect to both new and existing commitments, we may be required to provide some other form of assurance, such as a letter of credit, to backstop or replace our credit support. We may not be able to provide adequate assurances to such counterparties. In addition, to the extent we are required and able to provide letters of credit or other collateral to such counterparties; this will reduce the amount of credit available to us to meet our other liquidity needs. At December 31, 2008, we had $207 million in letters of credit outstanding, which operate to guarantee performance relating to certain project development activities and subsidiary operations. These letters of credit were provided under our revolver and senior unsecured credit facility. We paid letter of credit fees that averaged approximately 3.4% per annum in 2008 on the outstanding amounts. We expect to continue to seek, where possible, non-recourse debt financing in connection with the assets or businesses that our affiliates or we may develop, construct or acquire. However, depending on local and global market conditions and the unique characteristics of individual businesses, non-recourse debt may not be available or may not be available on economically attractive terms. See Credit Crisis and Macroeconomic Environment discussion above. If we decide not to provide any additional funding or credit support to a subsidiary project that is under construction or has near-term debt payment obligations and that subsidiary is unable to obtain additional non-recourse debt, such subsidiary may become insolvent, and we may lose our investment in such subsidiary. Additionally, if any of our subsidiaries lose a significant customer, the subsidiary may need to withdraw from a project or restructure the non-recourse debt financing. If we or such subsidiary chooses not to proceed with a project or is unable to successfully complete a restructuring of the non-recourse debt, we may lose our investment in such subsidiary. Many of our subsidiaries depend on timely and continued access to capital markets to manage their liquidity needs. The inability to raise capital on favorable terms, to refinance existing indebtedness or to fund operations and other commitments during times of political or economic uncertainty may have material adverse effects on the financial condition and results of operations of those subsidiaries. In addition, changes in the timing of tariff increases or delays in the regulatory determinations under the relevant concessions could affect the cash flows and results of operations of our businesses. 121 Table of Contents Capital Expenditures The Company spent $2.8 billion, $2.4 billion and $1.5 billion on capital expenditures in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. A significant majority of these costs were funded with non-recourse debt consistent with our financial strategy. At December 31, 2008, the Company had a total of $1.8 billion of availability under long-term non-recourse construction credit facilities. As more fully described in Credit Crisis and Macroeconomic Environment above, we have taken steps to dramatically decrease the amount of new discretionary capital spending. We expect to continue funding projects that are currently in the construction phase using existing capital provided by these non-recourse credit facilities as supplemented by internally generated cash flows, Parent Company liquidity, contribution from existing or new partners and other funding sources. As a result, property, plant and equipment and long-term non-recourse debt are expected to increase over the next few years even though the rate of discretionary spending has been decreased. While we believe we have the resources to continue funding the projects in construction, there can be no assurances that we will continue to fund all these existing construction efforts. As of December 31, 2008, the Parent Company had $260 million in commitments to invest in our subsidiaries projects under construction and to purchase related equipment, excluding $151 million of such obligations already included in the letters of credits discussed above. The Company expects to fund these net investment commitments over time according to the following schedule: $166 million in 2009, $39 million in 2010 and $55 million in 2011. The exact payment schedules will be dictated by the construction milestones. We expect to fund these commitments from a combination of current liquidity and internally generated Parent Company cash flow. The Company continues to assess the possible need for capital expenditures associated with international, federal, regional and state regulation of GHG emissions from electric power generation facilities. Legislation and regulations regarding GHG emissions, if enacted, may place significant costs on GHG emissions from fossil fuel-fired electric power generation facilities, particularly coal-fired facilities, and in order to comply, CO 2 emitting facilities may be required to purchase additional GHG emissions allowances or offsets under cap-and-trade programs, pay a carbon tax or to install new pollution-control equipment to capture and reduce the amount of GHG emitted from the facilities, in the event that reliable technology to do so is developed. The capital expenditures required to comply with any future GHG legislation and regulations could be significant and unless such costs can be passed on to customers or counterparties, such regulations could impair the profitability of some of the electric power generation facilities operated by our subsidiaries or render certain of them uneconomical to operate, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition. With respect to our operations outside the United States, certain of the businesses operated by the Company's subsidiaries are subject to compliance with EU ETS and the Kyoto Protocol in certain countries and other country-specific programs to regulate GHG emissions. To date, compliance with the Kyoto Protocol and EU ETS has not had a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows because of, among other factors, the cost of GHG emission allowances and/or the ability of our businesses to pass the cost of purchasing such allowances on to customers or counterparties. However, in the event that such counterparties or regulatory authorities challenge our ability to pass these costs on, there can be no assurance that the Company and/or the relevant subsidiary would prevail in any such dispute. Furthermore, even if the Company and/or the relevant subsidiary does prevail, it would be subject to the cash and administrative burden associated with such dispute. As discussed in Item 1: Business Regulatory Matters Environmental and Land Use Regulations, in the United States there presently are no federal laws or regulations regulating GHG emissions, although several legislative proposals are currently under consideration. In 2008, the Company's subsidiaries operated businesses which had total approximate CO 2 emissions of 83.8 million metric 122 Table of Contents tonnes (ownership adjusted). Approximately 41.5 million metric tonnes of the 83.8 million metric tonnes were emitted in the United States (both figures ownership adjusted). Approximately 11.8 million metric tonnes were emitted in U.S. states participating in the RGGI. At this time, the federal legislative proposals under consideration applicable to electric power generation facilities generally incorporate market-based cap-and-trade programs which authorize facilities to comply through the acquisition of emissions allowances in lieu of capital expenditures. Certain of the states, either alone or as part of a regional initiative, in which our subsidiaries operate are in the process of developing programs to reduce GHG emissions, primarily CO 2 , from the electric power generation facilities through cap-and-trade programs, which would allow CO 2 emitting facilities to comply by purchase additional GHG emissions allowances or offsets under cap-and-trade programs or by installing new pollution-control equipment to capture and reduce the amount of GHG emitted from the facilities, in the event that reliable technology to do so is developed. We believe that legislative or regulatory actions, if enacted, may require a material increase in capital expenditures at our subsidiaries. In the future the actual impact on our subsidiaries' capital expenditures from any potential federal program to regulate and reduce GHG emissions, if enacted, and the state and regional programs in the process of development, will depend on a number of factors, including among others, the GHG reductions required under any such legislation or regulations, the price and availability of offsets, the extent to which our subsidiaries would be entitled to receive GHG emissions allowances without having to purchase them, the quantity of allowances which our subsidiaries would have to purchase, the price of allowances, our subsidiaries' ability to recover or pass through costs incurred to comply with any legislative or regulatory requirements that are ultimately imposed and the use of market-based compliance options such as cap-and-trade programs. Another factor is the success of our climate solutions business, which may generate credits that will help offset our GHG emissions. However, as set forth in the Risk Factor titled "Our renewable energy projects and other initiatives face considerable uncertainties including development, operational and regulatory challenges," there is no guarantee that the climate solutions business will be successful. Even if our climate solutions business is successful, the level of benefit is unclear with regard to the impact of legislation or litigation concerning GHG emissions. Common Stock Repurchase Program On August 7, 2008, the Company's Board of Directors approved a share repurchase plan of up to $400 million of its outstanding common stock over a six month period ending February 7, 2009. From the inception of the plan through December 31, 2008, the Company repurchased 10,691,267 shares at a total cost of $143 million, including commissions, using cash balances on hand. There were no share repurchases in the fourth quarter of 2008. No shares were repurchased subsequent to December 31, 2008 and the board authorization of the plan expired on February 7, 2009. Consolidated Cash Flows $ Change Years Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 2008 vs. 2007 2007 vs. 2006 (in millions) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 2,165 $ 2,353 $ 2,348 $ (188 ) $ 5 Net cash used in investing activities 3,571 1,970 907 1,601 1,063 Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities 362 244 (1,317 ) 118 1,561 Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities decreased $188 million to $2,165 million during 2008 compared to $2,353 million during 2007. Excluding the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities from EDC in Venezuela, which was sold in May 2007, net cash provided by operating activities would have decreased $37 million. This decrease was partially due to a decrease of 123 Table of Contents approximately $110 million at IPL in North America primarily due to an increase in regulatory assets, higher working capital requirements and an increase in employer pension contributions; $77 million at our Latin America Utilities due to an increase in regulatory assets primarily comprised of recoverable purchased energy costs, partially offset by improved net working capital; $65 million at our Asia Generation businesses due to decreased net operating results, principally due to losses at our newly acquired business in the Philippines, and increased receivables due to delayed offtaker payments and increased commodity prices impacting our Pakistan business; $45 million at our renewables businesses due to decreased margin performance and additional working capital requirements; and additional interest related to Parent Company debt. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in net cash provided by operating activities at our Latin America Generation businesses of approximately $250 million primarily due to improved margin performance and a decrease in cash used by one Brazilian subsidiary to pay income taxes in 2008 compared to 2007 as tax credits were the primary payment method in 2008. In addition, our Europe & Africa Utilities experienced an increase in net cash provided by operating activities of approximately $65 million due to improved performance and net working capital. Investing Activities Net cash used for investing activities increased $1,601 million to $3,571 million during 2008 compared to net cash used of $1,970 million during 2007. This increase was largely attributable to the acquisition of Masinloc in the Philippines. Acquisitions, net of cash acquired totaled $1,135 million in 2008 compared to $315 million during 2007, an increase of $820 million. Masinloc is a 660 gross MW coal-fired thermal power generation facility purchased during the second quarter of 2008 for cash of approximately $930 million, as discussed in Note 22 Acquisitions and Dispositions to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. We also acquired Mountain View in the U.S. during the first quarter of 2008. The activity in 2007 was mainly due to the purchase of two 230 MW petroleum coke-fired power plants at TEG/TEP in Mexico and the purchase of 51% interest in a joint venture with 26 MW existing capacity and a 390 MW development pipeline of hydroelectric projects in Turkey. Other significant investing activities included: Capital expenditures totaled $2,840 million during 2008 compared to $2,425 million during 2007, an increase of $415 million. The increase was mainly due to a net increased spending of $370 million for plant construction at Gener and $144 million for wind development projects at our U.S. businesses which were partially offset by a decrease of $154 million due to completion of a plant at Maritza in Bulgaria in 2007. Proceeds from the sale of businesses totaled $1,328 million in 2008 and $1,136 million in 2007. The proceeds in 2008 included $1,084 million from the sale of Ekibastuz, a coal-fired generation plant, and Maikuben, a coal mine, in Kazakhstan, $171 million in net proceeds from the sale of a 10% ownership interest in AES Gener and $73 million in proceeds from the sale of Jiaozuo. In 2007 proceeds from the sale of businesses included $739 million from the sale of EDC, $331 million in proceeds from the sale of an 11% ownership interest in Gener, $51 million from the sale of Central Valley in the U.S. and $17 million for the sale of Eden in Argentina. The purchase of short-term investments, net of sales totaled $319 million in 2008, a $171 million decrease compared to 2007. These transactions included increases in net sales of $323 million and $209 million at Eletropaulo and Uruguaiana, respectively, as a result of a change to the investment strategy to acquire public debt and government securities. This was offset by a $229 million increase in net purchases at Brasiliana Energia in Brazil related to certificates of deposit, government debt securities and money market funds, a $93 million increase in net purchases at Alicura in Argentina related to the purchase of short-term bonds in 2008 and a $56 million increase in net purchases at Tiet in Brazil as the result of a change in investment strategy to invest in Brazilian government bonds. 124 Table of Contents Restricted cash balances increased $295 million in 2008. Restricted cash balances increased $215 million at Gener, $72 million at Chigen, $70 million at Kilroot, $24 million at TEG/TEP, and $20 million at Southland. These were offset by decreases of $49 million at New York, $30 million at Maritza, $18 million at Ebute in Nigeria and $14 million at Alicura. Cash used for advances to affiliate and equity investments was $240 million in 2008, an increase of $208 million, primarily from our investment in AES Solar. Additionally, the Company also made additional equity investments in Turkish Hydros and Asia renewables for the Huanghua joint venture wind project in Asia. Loan advances were $173 million in 2008, which consisted primarily of the Company's acquisition of a convertible loan from a Brazilian wind development business in the first quarter of 2008. Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities increased $118 million to $362 million during 2008 compared to $244 million during 2007. This $118 million change was primarily attributable to an increase in debt, net of repayments of $138 million, a decrease in distributions to minority interests of $102 million and an increase in contributions from minority interests of $36 million offset by an increase in the purchase of treasury stock of $143 million under the Company's common stock repurchase plan. Net borrowings under revolving credit facilities were $298 million during 2008, compared to net repayments of $85 million during 2007. This increase in net borrowings of $383 million was primarily due to a $126 million reduction in repayments at IPL, $116 million in repayments at Buffalo Gap 2 in the U.S. in 2007, an increase in borrowings of $60 million, $48 million, $23 million, and $12 million at Pak Gen, Lal Pir, our Panama business, and CAESS in El Salvador, respectively. Issuances of recourse and non-recourse debt during 2008 were $2,783 million compared to $4,297 million during 2007. This decrease of $1,514 million was primarily due to a decrease in the issuance of recourse debt at the Parent Company of $1,375 million and issuances of non-recourse debt during 2007 of $454 million at TEG/TEP and $446 million at Eletropaulo. These decreases were offset in part by increases in the issuance of non-recourse debt of $629 million at Masinloc and $229 million at IPL. Repayments of recourse debt and non-recourse debt during 2008 were $2,297 million compared to $3,566 million during 2007. This decrease of $1,269 million was predominately due to a decrease in repayments of non-recourse debt of $515 million at Eletropaulo and $443 million at TEG/TEP, a decrease in repayments of recourse debt of $278 million at the Parent Company, and decreases in repayments of non-recourse debt of $226 million at Gener, $96 million at Alicura, $94 million at Kilroot, and $83 million at Sonel. These decreases were offset in part by increases in repayments of non-recourse debt of $309 million at IPL and $251 million at Buffalo Gap 3 in the U.S. Minority distributions were $597 million during 2008 compared to $699 million during 2007. This decrease of $102 million was primarily due to higher dividends paid to minorities (BNDES) at Brasiliana Energia during 2007. Minority contributions were $410 million during 2008 compared to $374 million during 2007. This increase of $36 million was primarily due to current year contributions of $240 million at Buffalo Gap 3, $77 million at Mountain View I and II and $52 million at Gener offset by the receipt of a contribution of $313 million from the tax equity partners at Buffalo Gap 2 in 2007. 125 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations A summary of our contractual obligations, commitments and other liabilities as of December 31, 2008 is presented in the table below (in millions): Contractual Obligations Total Less than 1 year 1-3 years 4-5 years 5 years and more Other Footnote Reference Debt Obligations (1) $ 18,030 $ 1,219 $ 2,690 $ 2,399 $ 11,722 $ 10 Interest Payments on Long-Term Debt (2) $ 10,597 1,363 2,533 2,082 4,619 n/a Capital Lease Obligations (3) $ 158 11 17 14 116 11 Operating Lease Obligations (4) $ 493 64 118 118 193 11 Sale Leaseback Obligations (5) $ 744 39 84 90 531 11 Electricity Obligations (6) $ 47,265 1,754 4,387 5,039 36,085 11 Fuel Obligations (7) $ 21,841 2,113 3,260 2,728 13,740 11 Other Purchase Obligations (8) $ 20,924 2,403 2,467 1,700 14,354 11 Other Long-term Liabilities Reflected on AES's Consolidated Balance Sheet under GAAP (9) $ 1,055 27 162 59 641 166 n/a Total $ 121,107 $ 8,993 $ 15,718 $ 14,229 $ 82,001 $ 166 (1) Includes recourse and non-recourse debt presented on the Consolidated Financial Statements.

See Note 10 Long-Term Debt to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K which provides additional disclosure regarding these obligations. These amounts exclude capital lease obligations which are included in the capital lease category, see (3) below. (2) Interest payments are estimated based on final maturity dates of debt securities outstanding at December 31, 2008 and do not reflect anticipated future refinancing, early redemptions or new debt issuances. Variable rate interest obligations are estimated based on rates as of December 31, 2008. (3) Several AES subsidiaries have leases for operating and office equipment and vehicles that are classified as capital leases within Property, Plant and Equipment. Minimum contractual obligations include $96 million of imputed interest. (4) The Company was obligated under long-term non-cancelable operating leases, primarily for office rental and site leases. These amounts exclude amounts related to the sale/leaseback discussed below in item (5). (5) Sale/Leaseback Obligations represent a sales/leaseback with operating lease treatment at one of our New York subsidiaries. (6) Operating subsidiaries of the Company have entered into contracts for the purchase of electricity from third parties. (7) Operating subsidiaries of the Company have entered into fuel purchase contracts subject to termination only in certain limited circumstances. (8) Amounts relate to other contractual obligations where the Company has an enforceable and legally binding agreement to purchase goods or services that specifies all significant terms, including: quantity, pricing, and approximate timing. These amounts include planned capital expenditures that are contractually obligated. (9) These amounts do not include current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet except for the current portion of FIN No. 48 obligations. See the indicated notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information on the items excluded. Derivatives (See Note 5 Derivative Instruments) and incentive compensation are excluded as the Company is not able to reasonably estimate the timing or amount of the future payments. In addition, the amounts do not include: (1) regulatory liabilities (See Note 9 Regulatory Assets and Liabilities), (2) contingencies (See Note 12 Contingencies), (3) pension and other post retirement employee benefit liabilities (see Note 13 Benefit Plans) or (4) any taxes (See Note 20 Income Taxes) except for FIN No. 48 obligations. Noncurrent FIN No. 48 obligations are reflected in the "Other" column of the table above as the Company is not able to reasonably estimate the timing of the future payments. 126 Table of Contents Parent Company Liquidity The following discussion of "Parent Company Liquidity" has been included because we believe it is a useful measure of the liquidity available to The AES Corporation, or the Parent Company, given the non-recourse nature of most of our indebtedness. Parent Company liquidity as outlined below is a non-GAAP measure and should not be construed as an alternative to cash and cash equivalents which are determined in accordance with GAAP, as a measure of liquidity. Cash and cash equivalents are disclosed in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and the parent only unconsolidated statements of cash flows in Schedule I of this Form 10-K. Parent Company liquidity may differ from similarly titled measures used by other companies. The principal sources of liquidity at the Parent Company level are: dividends and other distributions from our subsidiaries, including refinancing proceeds; proceeds from debt and equity financings at the Parent Company level, including borrowings under our credit facilities; and proceeds from asset sales. Cash requirements at the Parent Company level are primarily to fund: interest; principal repayments of debt; acquisitions; construction commitments; other equity commitments; taxes; and Parent Company overhead and development costs. The Company defines Parent Company Liquidity as cash available to the Parent Company plus available borrowings under existing credit facilities. The cash held at qualified holding companies represents cash sent to subsidiaries of the Company domiciled outside of the U.S. Such subsidiaries have no contractual restrictions on their ability to send cash to the Parent Company. Parent Company Liquidity is reconciled to its most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure, "cash and cash equivalents" at December 31, 2008 and 2007 as follows: Parent Company Liquidity 2008 2007 2006 (in millions) Cash and cash equivalents $ 903 $ 2,043 $ 1,347 Less: Cash and cash equivalents at subsidiaries 656 728 1,090 Parent and qualified holding companies cash and cash equivalents 247 1,315 257 Borrowing available under revolving credit facility 720 520 662 Borrowing available under senior unsecured credit facility 423 318 227 Total Parent Company Liquidity $ 1,390 $ 2,153 $ 1,146 127 Table of Contents Recourse Debt Transactions: Financing and Tender Offer In the second quarter of 2008, the Company completed a number of debt-related transactions that resulted in a net reduction of approximately $360 million of recourse debt. These transactions included $223 million of debt paid at maturity, the repurchase of the tendered $762 million of senior notes maturing from 2009 to 2013, and the issuance of $625 million of 8% Senior Unsecured Notes at par value due 2020. The notes repaid at maturity included $223 million outstanding 6.0% Junior Subordinated Convertible Debentures due May 15, 2008 and 8.75% Senior Unsecured Notes due June 15, 2008. On May 15, 2008, we issued $625 million of 8% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2020 ("2020 Notes") at par value. Deferred financing costs attributable to the issuance of the 2020 Notes were approximately $10 million. On June 19, 2008, the Company repurchased $762 million of senior notes maturing from 2009 to 2013 in connection with a tender process. Specifically, the Company repurchased $313 million of the 9.50% Senior Notes due 2009, (the "2009 Notes"), $209 million of the 9.375% Senior Notes due 2010, (the "2010 Notes"), $178 million of the 8.875% Senior Notes due 2011, (the "2011 Notes") and $62 million of the 8.75% Second Priority Senior Secured Notes due 2013 (the "2013 Notes"). The Company recognized and included a pre-tax loss on the retirement of the senior notes for the year ended December 31, 2008 of $55 million in "Other expense" which included $52 million of tender consideration. In connection with the tender offer for the senior notes, the Company also solicited and received consents from the note holders of the 2013 Notes to amend the related indenture so that the covenants conform substantially to the covenants contained in the indenture governing the Company's senior unsecured notes, with the exception of those covenants related to security. Amendment of Credit Agreement On July 29, 2008, The AES Corporation and certain subsidiary guarantors amended and restated the Company's existing senior secured credit facility pursuant to the terms of the Fourth Amended and Restated Credit and Reimbursement Agreement, dated as of July 29, 2008 (the "Amended and Restated Credit Agreement"). The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement provides for a $200 million term loan facility maturing on August 10, 2011, and $750 million revolving credit facility maturing on June 23, 2010. The Company entered into the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement to, among other things: (i) increase the size of the Restricted Payments basket; (ii) reduce the required minimum Cash Flow Coverage Ratio (as defined therein) and increase the maximum Recourse Debt to Cash Flow Ratio (as defined therein); (iii) clarify and make modifications in the provisions that permit hedging activities; and (iv) make certain other changes, such as excluding certain equity-like securities from the definition of Recourse Debt, amending the financial reporting and environmental notice requirements, clarifying that the term "Permitted Business" includes climate solutions, carbon offsets, biofuels, battery storage and ancillary businesses, including related trading activities and amending certain other definitions and covenants. 128 Table of Contents Recourse Debt: Our recourse debt at year-end was approximately $5.2 billion, $5.6 billion, and $4.8 billion in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The following table sets forth our Parent Company contingent contractual obligations as of December 31, 2008: Contingent Contractual Obligations Amount Number of Agreements Exposure Range for Each Agreement (in millions) (in millions) Guarantees $ 411 34 <$1 - $53 Letters of credit under the revolving credit facility 30 4 <$1 - $28 Letters of credit under the senior unsecured credit facility 177 15 <$1 - $131 Total $ 618 53 As of December 31, 2008, the Company had $260 million of commitments to invest in subsidiaries under construction and to purchase related equipment, excluding $151 million of such obligations already included in the letters of credits discussed above. The Company expects to fund these net investment commitments over time according to the following schedule: $166 million in 2009, $39 million in 2010 and $55 million in 2011. The exact payment schedules will be dictated by the construction milestones. We expect to fund these commitments from a combination of current liquidity and internally generated Parent Company cash flow. We have a diverse portfolio of performance related contingent contractual obligations. These obligations are designed to cover potential risks and only require payment if certain targets are not met or certain contingencies occur. The risks associated with these obligations include change of control, construction cost overruns, subsidiary default, political risk, tax indemnities, spot market power prices, supplies support and liquidated damages under power sales agreements for projects in development, in operation and under construction. While we do not expect that we will be required to fund any material amounts under these contingent contractual obligations during 2009 or beyond, many of the events which would give rise to such obligations are beyond our control. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to fund our obligations under these contingent contractual obligations if we are required to make substantial payments thereunder. While we believe that our sources of liquidity will be adequate to meet our needs for the foreseeable future, this belief is based on a number of material assumptions, including, without limitation, assumptions about our ability to access the capital markets (see "Credit Crisis and the Macroeconomic Environment"), the operating and financial performance of our subsidiaries, currency exchange rates, power market pool prices, and the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends. In addition, our subsidiaries' ability to declare and pay cash dividends to us (at the Parent Company level) is subject to certain limitations contained in loans, governmental provisions and other agreements. We can provide no assurance that these sources will be available when needed or that the actual cash requirements will not be greater than anticipated. We have met our interim needs for shorter-term and working capital financing at the Parent Company level with our secured revolving credit facility and senior unsecured credit facility. See Item 1A Risk Factors, " The AES Corporation is a holding company and its ability to make payments on its outstanding indebtedness, including its public debt securities, is dependent upon the receipt of funds from its subsidiaries by way of dividends, fees, interest, loans or otherwise ." Various debt instruments at the Parent Company level, including our senior secured credit facilities, contain certain restrictive covenants. The covenants provide for, among other items: limitations on other indebtedness, liens, investments and guarantees; 129 Table of Contents limitations on dividends, stock repurchases and other equity transactions; restrictions and limitations on mergers and acquisitions, sales of assets, leases, transactions with affiliates and off balance sheet and derivative arrangements; maintenance of certain financial ratios; and financial and other reporting requirements. As of December 31, 2008, we were in compliance with these covenants. Non-Recourse Debt: While the lenders under our non-recourse debt financings generally do not have direct recourse to the Parent Company, defaults thereunder can still have important consequences for our results of operations and liquidity, including, without limitation: reducing our cash flows as the subsidiary will typically be prohibited from distributing cash to the parent level during the time period of any default; triggering our obligation to make payments under any financial guarantee, letter of credit or other credit support we have provided to or on behalf of such subsidiary; causing us to record a loss in the event the lender forecloses on the assets; and triggering defaults in our outstanding debt at the parent level. For example, our senior secured credit facilities and outstanding debt securities at the parent level include events of default for certain bankruptcy related events involving material subsidiaries. In addition, our revolving credit agreement at the parent level includes events of default related to payment defaults and accelerations of outstanding debt of material subsidiaries. Some of our subsidiaries are currently in default with respect to all or a portion of their outstanding indebtedness. The total non-recourse debt classified as current in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets amounts to $1.1 billion. The portion of current debt related to such defaults was $129 million at December 31, 2008, all of which was non-recourse debt related to three subsidiaries Aixi, Kelanitissa and Kilroot. None of the subsidiaries that are currently in default are subsidiaries that currently meet the applicable definition of materiality in AES's corporate debt agreements in order for such defaults to trigger an event of default or permit acceleration under such indebtedness. At December 31, 2008 none of our subsidiaries met the definition of material subsidiary under our recourse debt agreements. However, as a result of additional dispositions of assets, other significant reductions in asset carrying values or other matters in the future that may impact our financial position and results of operations or the financial position of the individual subsidiary, it is possible that one or more of these subsidiaries could fall within the definition of a "material subsidiary" and thereby upon an acceleration trigger an event of default and possible acceleration of the indebtedness under the AES Parent Company's outstanding debt securities. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements In May 1999, one of our subsidiaries acquired six electric generating plants from New York State Electric and Gas. Concurrently, the subsidiary sold two of the plants to an unrelated third party for $666 million and simultaneously entered into a leasing arrangement with the unrelated party. In May 2007, the subsidiary purchased a portion of the lessor's interest in a trust estate that holds the leased plants. Future minimum lease commitments under the lease agreement have been reduced by the subsidiary's interest in the plants. We have accounted for this transaction as a sale/leaseback 130 Table of Contents transaction with operating lease treatment. We expense periodic lease payments as incurred, which amounted to $34 million, $42 million and $54 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. We are not subject to any additional liabilities or contingencies if the arrangement terminates and we believe that the dissolution of the off-balance sheet arrangement would have minimal effects on our operating cash flows. The terms of the lease include restrictive covenants such as the maintenance of certain coverage ratios. Historically, the plants have satisfied the restrictive covenants of the lease and there are no known trends or uncertainties that would indicate that the lease will be terminated early. See Note 11 Commitments to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for a more complete discussion of this transaction. IPL, a consolidated subsidiary of the Company, formed IPL Funding Corporation ("IPL Funding") in 1996 as a special-purpose entity, consolidated by IPL, to purchase retail receivables originated by IPL pursuant to a receivables sale agreement entered into with IPL. At the same time, IPL Funding entered into a purchase facility (the "Purchase Facility") with unrelated parties (the "Purchasers") pursuant to which the Purchasers agree to purchase from IPL Funding, on a revolving basis, up to $50 million, of interests in the pool of receivables purchased from IPL. As collections reduce accounts receivable included in the pool, IPL Funding sells ownership interests in additional receivables acquired from IPL to return the ownership interests sold up to a maximum of $50 million, as permitted by the Purchase Facility. During 2008, the Purchase Facility was extended through May 27, 2009. Accounts receivable on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets are stated net of the $50 million sold. IPL and IPL Funding provide certain indemnities to the Purchasers, including indemnification in the event that there is a breach of representations and warranties made with respect to the purchased receivables. IPL Funding and IPL each have agreed to indemnify the Purchasers on an after-tax basis for any and all damages, losses, claims, liabilities, penalties, taxes, costs and expenses at any time imposed on or incurred by the indemnified parties arising out of or otherwise relating to the purchase facility, subject to certain limitations as defined in the Purchase Facility. Under the Purchase Facility, if IPL fails to maintain certain financial covenants regarding interest coverage and debt-to-capital ratios, it would constitute a "termination event." As of December 31, 2008, IPL was in compliance with such covenants. In addition, as a result of IPL's current credit rating, the facility agent has the ability to (i) replace IPL as the collection agent; and (ii) declare a "lock-box" event. Under a lock-box event or a termination event, the facility agent has the ability to require all proceeds of purchased receivables of IPL to be directed to lock-box accounts within 45 days of notifying IPL. A termination event would also (i) give the facility agent the option to take control of the lock-box account, and (ii) give the Purchasers the option to discontinue the purchase of additional interests in receivables and cause all proceeds of the purchased interests to be used to reduce the Purchaser's investment and to pay other amounts owed to the Purchasers and the facility agent. This would have the effect of reducing the operating capital available to IPL by the aggregate amount of such purchased interests in receivables (currently $50 million). Please refer to Note 25 Off-Balance Sheet and Related Party Transactions to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further details on IPL's servicing responsibilities and indemnification requirements under the Purchase Facility. 131 Table of Contents
