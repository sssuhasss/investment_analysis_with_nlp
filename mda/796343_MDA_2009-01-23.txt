BUSINESS OVERVIEW Founded in 1982, Adobe Systems Incorporated is one of the largest and most diversified software companies in the world. We offer a line of creative, business and mobile software and services used by creative professionals, designers, knowledge workers, high-end consumers, OEM partners, developers and enterprises for creating, managing, delivering and engaging with compelling content and experiences across multiple operating systems, devices and media. We distribute our products through a network of distributors and dealers, VARs, systems integrators, ISVs and OEMs, direct to end users and through our own Web site at www.adobe.com. We also license our technology to hardware manufacturers, software developers and service providers, and we offer integrated software solutions to businesses of all sizes. We have operations in the Americas, EMEA and Asia. Our software runs on personal computers with Microsoft Windows, Apple OS, Linux, UNIX and various non-PC platforms, depending on the product. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES In preparing our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC, we make assumptions, judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our assumptions, judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. On a regular basis, we evaluate our assumptions, judgments and estimates. We also discuss our critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. We believe that the assumptions, judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for revenue recognition, stock-based compensation, goodwill impairment and income taxes have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. These areas are key components of our results of operations and are based on complex rules which require us to make judgments and estimates, so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies. Historically, our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to our critical accounting policies have not differed materially from actual results. Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue when all four revenue recognition criteria have been met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, we have delivered the product or performed the service, the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is probable. Determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report. For example, for multiple element arrangements, we must: (1) determine whether and when each element has been delivered; (2) determine whether undelivered products or 47 TABLE OF CONTENTS services are essential to the functionality of the delivered products and services; (3) determine whether vendor-specific objective evidence ( VSOE ) of fair value exists for each undelivered element; and (4) allocate the total price among the various elements we must deliver. Changes in assumptions or judgments or changes to the elements in a software arrangement could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period. In addition, we must estimate certain royalty revenue amounts due to the timing of securing information from our customers. While we believe we can make reliable estimates regarding these matters, these estimates are inherently subjective. Accordingly, our assumptions and judgments regarding future products and services as well as our estimates of royalty revenue could differ from actual events, thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations. Product revenue is recognized when the above criteria are met. We reduce the revenue recognized for estimated future returns, price protection and rebates at the time the related revenue is recorded. In determining our estimate for returns and in accordance with our internal policy regarding global channel inventory which is used to determine the level of product held by our distributors on which we have recognized revenue, we rely upon historical data, the estimated amount of product inventory in our distribution channel, the rate at which our product sells through to the end user, product plans and other factors. Our estimated provisions for returns can vary from what actually occurs. Product returns may be more or less than what was estimated. The amount of inventory in the channel could be different than what is estimated. Our estimate of the rate of sell through for product in the channel could be different than what actually occurs. There could be a delay in the release of our products. These factors and unanticipated changes in the economic and industry environment could make our return estimates differ from actual returns, thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations. We offer price protection to our distributors that allows for the right to a credit if we permanently reduce the price of a software product. When evaluating the adequacy of the price protection allowance, we analyze historical returns, current sell-through of distributor and retailer inventory of our products, changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products and other related factors. In addition, we monitor the volume of sales to our channel partners and their inventories. Changes to these assumptions or in the economic environment could result in higher returns or higher price protection costs in subsequent periods. In the future, actual returns and price protection may materially exceed our estimates as unsold products in the distribution channels are exposed to rapid changes in consumer preferences, market conditions or technological obsolescence due to new platforms, product updates or competing products. While we believe we can make reliable estimates regarding these matters, these estimates are inherently subjective. Accordingly, if our estimates change, our returns and price protection reserves would change, which would impact the total net revenue we report. Our consulting revenue is recognized using the proportionate performance method and is measured monthly based on input measures, such as on hours incurred to date compared to total estimated hours to complete, with consideration given to output measures, such as contract milestones, when applicable. Accordingly, our estimates of consulting revenue could differ from actual events and may materially impact our financial position and results of operations. Stock-based Compensation We account for stock-based compensation in accordance with SFAS 123R. Under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement, stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period. We currently use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares. The determination of the fair value of stock-based awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables. These variables include our expected stock price volatility over the expected term of the awards, actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors, the risk-free interest rate, estimated forfeitures and expected dividends. We estimate the expected term of options granted by calculating the average term from our historical stock option exercise experience. We estimate the volatility of our common stock by using implied volatility in market traded options. Our decision to use implied volatility was based upon the availability of actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility. We base the risk-free interest rate on zero-coupon yields implied from U.S. Treasury issues with remaining terms similar to the expected 48 TABLE OF CONTENTS term on the options. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and therefore use an expected dividend yield of zero in the option pricing model. We are required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. We use historical data to estimate pre-vesting option forfeitures and record stock-based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest. If we use different assumptions for estimating stock-based compensation expense in future periods or if actual forfeitures differ materially from our estimated forfeitures, the change in our stock-based compensation expense could materially affect our operating income, net income and net income per share. Goodwill Impairment We complete our goodwill impairment test on an annual basis, during the second quarter of our fiscal year, or more frequently, if changes in facts and circumstances indicate that an impairment in the value of goodwill recorded on our balance sheet may exist. In order to estimate the fair value of goodwill, we typically estimate future revenue, consider market factors and estimate our future cash flows. Based on these key assumptions, judgments and estimates, we determine whether we need to record an impairment charge to reduce the value of the asset carried on our balance sheet to its estimated fair value. Assumptions, judgments and estimates about future values are complex and often subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy or our internal forecasts. Although we believe the assumptions, judgments and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, different assumptions, judgments and estimates could materially affect our reported financial results. Accounting for Income Taxes We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year. In addition, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Management must make assumptions, judgments and estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes and also our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against a deferred tax asset. Our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to the current provision for income taxes take into account current tax laws, our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities. We have established reserves for income taxes to address potential exposures involving tax positions that could be challenged by tax authorities. In addition, we are subject to the continual examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and other domestic and foreign tax authorities, including a current examination by the IRS for our fiscal 2005, 2006 and 2007 tax returns. These examinations are expected to focus on our intercompany transfer pricing practices as well as other matters. Although we believe our assumptions, judgments and estimates are reasonable, changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of the current and any future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements. Our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to the value of a deferred tax asset take into account predictions of the amount and category of future taxable income, such as income from operations or capital gains income. Actual operating results and the underlying amount and category of income in future years could render our current assumptions, judgments and estimates of recoverable net deferred taxes inaccurate. Any of the assumptions, judgments and estimates mentioned above could cause our actual income tax obligations to differ from our estimates, thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview of 2008 During fiscal 2008, our software and technologies continued to redefine how people engage with ideas and information anytime, anywhere and through virtually any medium. Given our solid execution during the year, we were able to deliver strong revenue and earnings growth when compared to the previous year. 49 TABLE OF CONTENTS In our Creative Solutions segment, revenue increased by nine percent during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007, based on continued adoption of our CS3 family of products during the first three quarters of fiscal 2008, as well as the release of our new CS4 family of products which began shipping in the fourth quarter of the year. Consisting of six Creative Suite editions and thirteen individual creative products, our CS4 family of products launch was the largest in our more than 25-year history. Although reviews and market commentary about our new CS4 family of products were overwhelmingly positive, we believe revenue from the fourth quarter launch was significantly impacted by the global financial crisis that is affecting demand in the creative professional end user market. Helping to drive the growth we achieved in our Creative Solutions business was a thirteen percent growth with our professional digital imaging products during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007. In addition, we achieved strong growth in our Scene7 business. Revenue increased by more than twenty percent with our digital imaging and digital video hobbyist markets with the introduction of new versions of our Adobe Photoshop Elements and Adobe Premiere Elements products during the fourth quarter. Business Productivity Solutions achieved greater than fifteen percent increase in revenue during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007. This success was driven by continued adoption of our Acrobat 8 family of products, as well as adoption of its successor, Acrobat 9, which was released in the third quarter of the fiscal year. In addition, our execution in driving our enterprise business with our LiveCycle product family resulted in more than a thirty percent increase in revenue in this business during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007, with revenue exceeding $250 million. We also continued to grow our Acrobat Connect Pro business which provides real-time collaboration capabilities via the Web utilizing our Adobe Flash Player. Our Mobile and Device Solutions segment achieved greater than 100% growth during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007, due to the ongoing success we have had targeting mobile operators, handset manufacturers and consumer electronic device manufactures with our Flash Lite technology. On May 1, 2008, we announced the Open Screen Project. The project aims to enable a consistent runtime environment that will remove barriers for developers and designers as they publish content and applications across desktops and consumer devices, including phones, mobile Internet devices ( MIDs ) and set top boxes. As part of the project, we will be removing some restrictions on the use of some of our technology specifications and publishing several technology protocols. We will also be removing the license fees on the next major releases of Adobe Flash Player and Adobe AIR for devices. Accordingly, we expect revenue from Mobile and Device Solutions to decrease beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2009. We would expect this decrease to be offset in time by an increased demand for tooling products, server technologies, services and applications. In our other segments, revenue increased by fifteen percent compared to fiscal 2007 due primarily to higher revenue with our Platform business and the sustaining of revenue in our legacy Print and Publishing business. Revenue Fiscal 2008 % Change 2008 to 2007 Fiscal 2007 % Change 2007 to 2006 Fiscal 2006 Product $ 3,396.5 12 % $ 3,019.5 22 % $ 2,484.7 Percentage of total revenue 95 % 96 % 96 % Services and support 183.4 33 % 138.4 53 % 90.6 Percentage of total revenue 5 % 4 % 4 % Total revenue $ 3,579.9 13 % $ 3,157.9 23 % $ 2,575.3 In fiscal 2008, we categorized our products into the following segments: Creative Solutions, Knowledge Worker, Enterprise, Mobile and Device Solutions, Platform and Print and Publishing products. Our Creative Solutions segment focuses on delivering a complete professional line of integrated tools for a full range of creative and developer tasks to an extended set of customers. Our Knowledge Worker segment focuses on the needs of knowledge worker customers, providing essential applications and services to help them reliably share information and collaborate effectively. This segment contains revenue generated by the Adobe Acrobat family of products. Our Enterprise segment provides server-based enterprise interaction solutions that automate people-centric processes and contains revenue generated by our LiveCycle line of products. The Mobile and Device Solutions segment provides solutions that create 50 TABLE OF CONTENTS compelling experiences through rich content, user interfaces and data services on mobile and non-PC devices such as cellular phones, consumer devices and Internet connected hand-held devices. The Platform segment provides developer solutions and technologies, including Adobe Flash Player, Adobe AIR and Flex Builder which are used to build rich application experiences. Finally, the Print and Publishing segment addresses market opportunities ranging from the diverse publishing needs of technical and business publishing, to our legacy type and OEM printing businesses. We will adjust our reporting segments at the beginning of fiscal 2009 to reflect changes in how we manage our business as we enter the new fiscal year. We are combining our former Mobile and Device Solutions segment with our Platform segment. These segment reporting changes reflect changes we have made internally in terms of how we manage these businesses. Our services and support revenue is composed of consulting, training and maintenance and support, primarily related to the licensing of our enterprise, developer and platform products. Our support revenue also includes technical support and developer support to partners and developer organizations related to our desktop products. Our maintenance and support offerings which entitle customers to receive product upgrades and enhancements or technical support, depending on the offering, is recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement. Segment Information Fiscal 2008 % Change 2008 to 2007 Fiscal 2007 % Change 2007 to 2006 Fiscal 2006 Creative Solutions $ 2,072.8 9 % $ 1,899.0 32 % $ 1,438.0 Percentage of total revenue 58 % 60 % 56 % Knowledge Worker 810.9 11 % 728.5 11 % 657.8 Percentage of total revenue 23 % 23 % 26 % Enterprise 253.0 32 % 191.3 21 % 158.2 Percentage of total revenue 7 % 6 % 6 % Mobile and Device Solutions 113.1 115 % 52.5 40 % 37.5 Percentage of total revenue 3 % 2 % 1 % Platform 118.5 46 % 80.9 19 % 68.1 Percentage of total revenue 3 % 3 % 3 % Print and Publishing 211.6 3 % 205.7 (5 )% 215.7 Percentage of total revenue 6 % 6 % 8 % Total revenue $ 3,579.9 13 % $ 3,157.9 23 % $ 2,575.3 Fiscal 2008 Revenue Compared to Fiscal 2007 Revenue Revenue from our Creative Solutions segment increased $173.8 million during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 primarily due to ongoing adoption of our CS3 family of products, as well as the launch of our CS4 family of products in the fourth quarter of fiscal year. We also achieved solid growth in our Scene7 business and with our hobbyist products. Also contributing to the increase in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 was an increase in certain unit average selling prices. Units sold remained relatively stable. Revenue in our Knowledge Worker segment increased $82.4 million during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 primarily due to an increase in the licensing of our Acrobat 8 and new Acrobat 9 family of products. An increase in the number of units sold as well as a slight increase in certain unit average selling prices also contributed to higher revenue as compared to fiscal 2007. Revenue from our Enterprise segment increased $61.7 million during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 primarily due to an increased adoption of our LiveCycle family of products and a larger number of enterprise solution transactions at a higher average transaction size. Revenue from our Mobile and Device Solutions segment increased by $60.6 million during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 due to continued adoption of Flash Lite by mobile and non-PC device manufacturers. On May 1, 2008, we announced the Open Screen Project. The project aims to enable a consistent runtime environment that will remove barriers 51 TABLE OF CONTENTS for developers and designers as they publish content and applications across desktops and consumer devices, including phones, MIDs and set top boxes. See Overview of 2008 for further information regarding the Open Screen Project . Platform revenue increased by $37.6 million during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 primarily due to increased revenue related to Flash Player and the launch of Adobe AIR which resulted in increased revenue from our developer tools. Revenue in our Print and Publishing business increased by $5.9 million during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007, driven by ongoing adoption of our eLearning solutions as well as some of our legacy print and publishing products. Fiscal 2007 Revenue Compared to Fiscal 2006 Revenue Revenue from our Creative Solutions segment increased $461.0 million during fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 primarily due to the launch of the English versions of our CS3 family of products in the second quarter of fiscal 2007 and the release of localized versions of our CS3 family of products during the third quarter of fiscal 2007. The increase in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 was also due to an increase in certain unit average selling prices. Increases in revenue were offset in part, by a slight decrease in the number of units sold. Revenue from our Knowledge Worker segment increased $70.7 million during fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 primarily due to an increase in the licensing of our new Acrobat 8 family of products. The number of units sold as well as the average unit selling prices remained relatively stable during fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006. Revenue from our Enterprise segment increased $33.1 million during fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 primarily due to continued adoption of our LiveCycle family of products. Revenue also increased due to a larger number of enterprise solution transactions offset with a decrease in the average transaction size during fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006. Revenue from our Mobile and Device Solutions segment increased $15.0 million during fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 due to continued adoption of Flash Lite by mobile and non-PC device manufacturers, and our Flash Cast solutions by mobile operators. Revenue from our Platform segment increased $12.8 million during fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 due primarily to increased revenue related to Flash Player. Revenue from our Print and Publishing segment decreased $10.0 million during fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 due to lower revenue associated with some of our legacy products. Geographic Information Fiscal 2008 % Change 2008 to 2007 Fiscal 2007 % Change 2007 to 2006 Fiscal 2006 Americas $ 1,632.8 8 % $ 1,508.9 19 % $ 1,266.7 Percentage of total revenue 46 % 48 % 49 % EMEA 1,229.2 20 % 1,026.4 33 % 770.1 Percentage of total revenue 34 % 32 % 30 % Asia 717.9 15 % 622.6 16 % 538.5 Percentage of total revenue 20 % 20 % 21 % Total revenue $ 3,579.9 13 % $ 3,157.9 23 % $ 2,575.3 Fiscal 2008 Revenue by Geography Compared to Fiscal 2007 Revenue by Geography Overall revenue in each of the geographic segments for fiscal 2008 increased compared to fiscal 2007 primarily due to the ongoing adoption of our CS3 family of products during the first half of the year, the launch of our CS4 family of products in the fourth quarter of the year, the launch of our Acrobat 9 family of products in the third quarter of the year and strong growth in our enterprise business. Included in the overall increase in revenue were impacts associated with foreign currency. Revenue in EMEA measured in U.S. dollars was favorably impacted by approximately $69.3 million during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 primarily due to the strength of the Euro against the U.S. dollar. Additionally, during fiscal 2008 we had a hedging gain of 52 TABLE OF CONTENTS $13.2 million. Revenue in Asia was favorably impacted by approximately $39.6 million during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 primarily due to the strength of the Yen against the U.S. dollar. Fiscal 2007 Revenue by Geography Compared to Fiscal 2006 Revenue by Geography Overall revenue in each of the geographic segments for fiscal 2007 increased compared to fiscal 2006 primarily due to the launch of the English versions of our CS3 family of products in the second quarter of fiscal 2007, the release of the localized versions of our CS3 family of products during the third quarter of fiscal 2007 and success with our Acrobat 8 family of products. Revenue in the Americas increased during fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 primarily due to the launch of the English versions of our CS3 family of products during the second quarter of fiscal 2007 and increased revenue from the Acrobat 8 family of products. Revenue in EMEA increased during fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 due to the release of localized versions of our CS3 family of products and increases in revenue from the Acrobat Pro products. Additionally, revenue in EMEA increased approximately $65.9 million due to the strength of the Euro against the U.S. dollar. Revenue in Asia increased during fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 due to the release of localized versions of our CS3 family of products. Changes in the Yen over the U.S. dollar did not have a significant impact to revenue in Asia during fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006. See Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk regarding foreign currency risks. Product Backlog With regard to our product backlog, the actual amount of backlog at any particular time may not be a meaningful indicator of future business prospects. Backlog is comprised of unfulfilled orders, excluding those associated with new product releases, those pending credit review and those not shipped due to the application of our global inventory policy. We had minimal backlog at the end of the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2008. The comparable backlog at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 was approximately 7% of fourth quarter fiscal 2007 revenue. Cost of Revenue Fiscal 2008 % Change 2008 to 2007 Fiscal 2007 % Change 2007 to 2006 Fiscal 2006 Product $ 266.4 (2 )% $ 270.8 20 % $ 226.5 Percentage of total revenue 7 % 9 % 9 % Services and support 96.2 15 % 83.9 27 % 66.0 Percentage of total revenue 3 % 3 % 3 % Total cost of revenue $ 362.6 2 % $ 354.7 21 % $ 292.5 Product Cost of product revenue includes product packaging, third-party royalties, excess and obsolete inventory, amortization related to localization costs and acquired rights to use technology and the costs associated with the manufacturing of our products. Cost of product revenue increased (decreased) due to the following: % Change 2008 to 2007 % Change 2007 to 2006 Amortization of acquired rights to use technology 6 % 8 % Royalties for licensed technologies 3 7 Localization costs related to our product launches (1 ) 10 Excess and obsolete inventory (1 ) 3 Amortization of purchased technology (10 ) (11 ) Various individually insignificant items 1 3 Total change (2 )% 20 % 53 TABLE OF CONTENTS Amortization of acquired rights to use technology increased primarily due to the fact that we entered into certain technology licensing arrangements totaling $100.4 million and $60.0 million during fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007, respectively. Of this cost, an estimated $56.4 million and $44.8 million during fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007, respectively, was related to future licensing rights and has been capitalized and will be amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives up to fifteen years. Of the remaining costs, we estimated that approximately $27.2 million and $15.2 million was related to historical use of licensing rights which was expensed as cost of sales and the residual of $16.8 million for fiscal 2008 was expensed as general and administrative costs. In connection with these licensing arrangements, we have the ability to acquire additional rights to use technology in the future. Royalty costs increased during fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 primarily due to an increase in the number of licensed technology agreements during the year coupled with royalty costs associated with a legal settlement in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007. Localization costs which are amortized over the product life cycle, decreased during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 and increased during fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 primarily due to increased costs during fiscal 2007 associated with the release of the localized versions of our CS3 family of products and the Acrobat 8 family of products. Amortization of purchased technology decreased during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 and decreased during fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006, due to a decrease in amortization primarily associated with intangible assets purchased through the Macromedia acquisition at the beginning of fiscal 2006. Services and Support Cost of services and support revenue is primarily comprised of employee-related costs and associated costs incurred to provide consulting services, training and product support. Cost of services and support revenue increased during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007, primarily due to increases in compensation and related benefits driven by increases in headcount related to product support and utilization by customers of our consulting services. Cost of services and support revenue increased during fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006, primarily due to increases in compensation and related benefits primarily as a result of headcount increases and increases in costs to support consulting engagements and product releases. Operating Expenses Research and Development, Sales and Marketing and General and Administrative Expenses Included in compensation costs for fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006 are compensation and related benefits, including stock-based compensation costs as a result of adopting SFAS 123R at the beginning of fiscal 2006. The increase in compensation costs during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 related to increases in headcount and stock-based compensation offset by decreases in profit sharing and employee bonuses based on company performance. Additionally, the increase in compensation for fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 related to higher expense for profit sharing and employee bonuses based on company performance. Research and Development Fiscal 2008 % Change 2008 to 2007 Fiscal 2007 % Change 2007 to 2006 Fiscal 2006 Expenses $ 662.1 8 % $ 613.2 14 % $ 539.7 Percentage of total revenue 18 % 19 % 21 % Research and development expenses consist primarily of salary and benefit expenses for software developers, contracted development efforts, related facilities costs and expenses associated with computer equipment used in software development. 54 TABLE OF CONTENTS Research and development expenses increased due to the following: % Change 2008 to 2007 % Change 2007 to 2006 Compensation and related benefits associated with headcount growth 7 % 9 % Compensation associated with incentive compensation and stock-based compensation 5 Various individually insignificant items 1 Total change 8 % 14 % We believe that investments in research and development, including the recruiting and hiring of software developers, are critical to remaining competitive in the marketplace and are directly related to continued timely development of new and enhanced products. We will continue to focus on long-term opportunities available in our end markets and make significant investments in the development of our desktop application and server-based software products. Sales and Marketing Fiscal 2008 % Change 2008 to 2007 Fiscal 2007 % Change 2007 to 2006 Fiscal 2006 Expenses $ 1,089.3 11 % $ 984.4 14 % $ 867.1 Percentage of total revenue 30 % 31 % 34 % Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salary and benefit expenses, sales commissions, travel expenses and related facilities costs for our sales, marketing, order management and global supply chain management personnel. Sales and marketing expenses also include the costs of programs aimed at increasing revenue, such as advertising, trade shows, public relations and other market development programs. Sales and marketing expenses increased due to the following: % Change 2008 to 2007 % Change 2007 to 2006 Compensation and related benefits associated with headcount growth 5 % 3 % Marketing spending related to product launches and overall marketing efforts to further increase revenue 4 2 Compensation associated with incentive compensation and stock-based compensation 1 6 Various individually insignificant items 1 3 Total change 11 % 14 % General and Administrative Fiscal 2008 % Change 2008 to 2007 Fiscal 2007 % Change 2007 to 2006 Fiscal 2006 Expenses $ 337.3 23 % $ 275.0 17 % $ 234.6 Percentage of total revenue 9 % 9 % 9 % General and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and benefit expenses, travel expenses and related facilities costs for our finance, facilities, human resources, legal, information services and executive personnel. General and administrative expenses also include outside legal and accounting fees, provision for bad debts, expenses associated with computer equipment and software used in the administration of the business, charitable contributions and various forms of insurance. 55 TABLE OF CONTENTS General and administrative expenses increased due to the following: % Change 2008 to 2007 % Change 2007 to 2006 Allocation of costs associated with acquired rights to use technology 6 % % Compensation and related benefits associated with headcount growth 4 3 Charitable contributions 4 Compensation associated with incentive compensation and stock-based compensation 2 8 Professional and consulting fees 2 2 Provision for bad debt 2 Depreciation and amortization 1 2 Various individually insignificant items 2 2 Total change 23 % 17 % Allocation of costs associated with acquired rights to use technology increased primarily due to the fact that we entered into certain technology licensing arrangements totaling $100.4 million and $60.0 million during fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007, respectively. Of this cost, an estimated $56.4 million and $44.8 million during fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007, respectively, was related to future licensing rights and has been capitalized and will be amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives up to fifteen years. Of the remaining costs, we estimated that approximately $27.2 million and $15.2 million during fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007, respectively, was related to historical use of licensing rights which was expensed as cost of sales and the residual of $16.8 million for fiscal 2008 was expensed as general and administrative costs. In connection with these licensing arrangements, we have the ability to acquire additional rights to use technology in the future. Charitable contributions represent funding of the Adobe Foundation which is a private foundation created to leverage human, technological and financial resources to drive social change and improve the communities in which we live and work.

Fiscal 2008 Restructuring Charges In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, we initiated a restructuring program in order to reduce our operating costs and focus our resources on key strategic priorities impacting a total of approximately 560 full-time positions globally. In connection with this restructuring plan, we recorded restructuring charges totaling $29.2 million related to termination benefits for the elimination of approximately 460 of these full-time positions globally. As of November 28, 2008, $0.4 million was paid. The remaining accrual associated with these termination benefits is expected to be substantially paid during fiscal 2009. In fiscal 2009, we expect to record approximately $10.0 million to $13.0 million primarily related to the consolidation of leased facilities and approximately $6.0 million to $7.0 million related to employee severance arrangements for the elimination of approximately 100 of the remaining full-time positions globally. We expect to pay this facility related liability through fiscal 2013. Charges associated with these ongoing termination benefits were recorded in accordance with SFAS No. 112, Employers Accounting for Postemployment Benefits, and expected charges associated with the consolidation of leased facilities will be recorded in accordance with SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. 56 TABLE OF CONTENTS Macromedia Restructuring Charges We acquired Macromedia on December 3, 2005 and in the first quarter of fiscal 2006, pursuant to Board of Directors approval, implemented a restructuring plan to eliminate approximately 313 positions held by Adobe employees worldwide, which impacted all functional areas. The reduction in force was completed in fiscal 2006. The restructuring plan also included costs related to the world-wide consolidation of facilities, the cancellation of certain contracts and the write-off of fixed assets located at facilities that have been vacated. During fiscal 2008, we recorded charges of $2.9 million related to changes in estimates related to Macromedia facilities restructuring charges due to changes in sub-lease income estimates. Additionally, we have a $13.1 million liability for restructuring as of November 28, 2008 primarily associated with the Macromedia restructured facilities. We expect to pay this liability through fiscal 2011. See Note 9 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding our restructuring charges. Amortization of Purchased Intangibles and Incomplete Technology Fiscal 2008 % Change 2008 to 2007 Fiscal 2007 % Change 2007 to 2006 Fiscal 2006 Expenses $ 68.2 (6 )% $ 72.4 4 % $ 69.9 Percentage of total revenue 2 % 2 % 3 % As a result of our acquisition of Macromedia in fiscal 2006, we acquired purchased intangibles which are amortized over their estimated useful lives of two to four years. In addition, during fiscal 2008 we completed one business combination and during fiscal 2007, we completed two business combinations and one asset acquisition. We acquired purchased intangibles through these acquisitions which are amortized over their estimated useful lives. Amortization expense decreased during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007, due to a decrease in amortization expense associated with intangible assets purchased through the Macromedia acquisition. Additionally, included in the amortization of purchased intangibles and incomplete technology for fiscal 2007 was $1.5 million related to the write-off of in-process research and development from an acquisition that occurred during the second quarter of fiscal 2007. Non-operating Income Fiscal 2008 % Change 2008 to 2007 Fiscal 2007 % Change 2007 to 2006 Fiscal 2006 Interest and other income, net $ 43.8 (47 )% $ 82.7 23 % $ 67.3 Percentage of total revenue 1 % 3 % 3 % Interest expense (10.0 ) * (.2 ) 100 % (.1 ) Percentage of total revenue * * * Investment gains and (losses), net 16.4 131 % 7.1 (88 )% 61.2 Percentage of total revenue * % * % 2 % Total non-operating income $ 50.2 (44 )% $ 89.6 (30 )% $ 128.4 _________________________________________ * Percentage is not meaningful. Interest and Other Income, net Interest and other income, net, included interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and short-term fixed income investments as well as foreign exchange gains and losses, including those from hedging revenue transactions primarily denominated in Euro and Japanese Yen currencies. Interest and other income, net, decreased during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 primarily as a result of lower average invested balances due to cash used for our share repurchase programs, lower interest rates and increased hedging costs. Additionally, during fiscal 2008, interest and other income, net included losses on fixed income investments associated 57 TABLE OF CONTENTS with a write-down for an other-than-temporary impairment totaling approximately $1.3 million during the second quarter of fiscal 2008. Interest and other income, net increased during fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 primarily as a result of higher rates of return on invested cash and short-term investments. Interest Expense Interest expense for fiscal 2008, primarily represents interest associated with our credit facility. The outstanding balance as of November 28, 2008 was $350.0 million. Interest due under the credit facility is paid upon expiration of the London interbank offered rate ( LIBOR ) contract or at a minimum, quarterly. Investment Gains and (Losses), net Investment gains and (losses), net consist principally of realized gains or losses from the sale of marketable equity investments, other-than-temporary declines in the value of marketable and non-marketable equity securities and gains and losses associated with our interests in Adobe Ventures. Investment gains and (losses), net fluctuated due to the following: 2008 2007 2006 Net gains (losses) related to our investments in Adobe Ventures and cost method investments $ 15.9 $ 6.9 $ (6.5 ) Gains from sale of equity investments 5.4 0.2 67.9 Write-downs due to other-than-temporary declines in value of our marketable equity securities (4.9 ) Losses on stock warrants (0.2 ) Total investment gains and (losses), net $ 16.4 $ 7.1 $ 61.2 During fiscal 2008, investment gains and (losses), net increased as compared to fiscal 2007 due primarily to investment gains from our direct and Adobe Ventures investments. Additionally, during fiscal 2008, we received cash and recognized a gain resulting from the expiration of the escrow period related to the sale of our investment in Atom Entertainment, Inc. that occurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. Investment gains and (losses), net increased in fiscal 2006 when compared to fiscal 2007 due to the sale of our investment in Atom Entertainment, Inc. Provision for Income Taxes Fiscal 2008 % Change 2008 to 2007 Fiscal 2007 % Change 2007 to 2006 Fiscal 2006 Provision $ 206.7 (7 )% $ 223.4 28 % $ 173.9 Percentage of total revenue 6 % 7 % 7 % Effective tax rate 19 % 24 % 26 % Our effective tax rate decreased approximately five percentage points during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007. The decrease was primarily related to the completion in the third quarter of fiscal 2008 of a U.S. income tax examination covering our fiscal years 2001 through 2004, a refund of foreign taxes from our fiscal years 2000 through 2002 following a foreign tax court judgment and stronger international profits for fiscal 2008 offset in part by an increase due to the tax benefit for the reinstatement of the research and development credit relating to fiscal 2006 in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 . Our effective tax rate decreased approximately two percentage points during fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006. The decrease is primarily due to the reinstatement of the federal research and development tax credit in December 2006. The reinstatement of the credit was retroactive to January 1, 2006. A $12.3 million cumulative tax benefit for the credit relating to fiscal 2006 was reflected in its entirety in the first quarter of fiscal 2007. 58 TABLE OF CONTENTS LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES This data should be read in conjunction with the consolidated statements of cash flows. Fiscal 2008 Fiscal 2007 Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments $ 2,019.2 $ 1,993.9 Working capital 1,972.5 1,720.4 Stockholders equity $ 4,410.4 $ 4,650.0 Summary of our cash flows is as follows: Fiscal 2008 Fiscal 2007 Fiscal 2006 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,280.7 $ 1,441.1 $ 900.0 Net cash (used for) provided by investing activities (304.7 ) 81.5 195.2 Net cash used for financing activities (1,021.6 ) (1,350.4 ) (747.4 ) Effect of foreign currency exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents (14.4 ) 1.7 3.9 Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents $ (60.0 ) $ 173.9 $ 351.7 Our primary source of cash is receipts from revenue. The primary uses of cash are payroll related expenses; general operating expenses including marketing, travel and office rent; and cost of product revenue. Another source of cash is proceeds from the exercise of employee options and participation in the employee stock purchase plan and another use of cash is our stock repurchase program, which is detailed below. Cash flows from operating activities Net cash provided by operating activities of $1.3 billion for fiscal 2008, was primarily comprised of net income plus the net effect of non-cash expenses. The primary working capital sources of cash were increases in net income, deferred revenue and trade payables. Increases in deferred revenue related to maintenance and support and free of charge upgrade plan purchases which offset in part, decreases in deferred revenue related to royalties. The primary working capital uses of cash were increases in trade receivables and prepaid expenses and other current assets coupled with decreases in income taxes payable, accrued expenses and accrued restructuring costs. Trade receivables increased primarily as a result of high sales of our CS4 family of products at the end of fiscal 2008. Income taxes payable decreased primarily due to payments made as the result of the completion of a U.S. income tax examination covering our fiscal years 2001 through 2004. Accrued expenses decreased primarily due to payments for employee bonuses and profit sharing offset in part by increases in royalty accruals and charitable contributions. Accrued restructuring costs increased due to the restructuring program initiated in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 offset in part by payments of facility costs during fiscal 2008 associated with the Macromedia acquisition. See Note 9 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding our restructuring charges. Net cash provided by operating activities of $1.4 billion for fiscal 2007, was primarily comprised of net income, net of non-cash related expenses. The primary working capital sources of cash were increases in net income, accrued expenses, income taxes payable, deferred revenue and trade payables coupled with decreases in trade receivables and prepaid expenses and other current assets. Net changes in accrued expenses was primarily attributable to increases in accrued bonuses and accrued localization costs related to the localization of our CS3 family of products during fiscal 2007. Income taxes payable increased due to overall increased taxable income. Increases to deferred revenue related primarily to deferred maintenance and service revenue due to strong upgrade plan sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 for our CS3 family of products and related individual creative products. The decrease in trade receivables was due to collections in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 related to high Acrobat 8 sales at the end of fiscal 2006 and strong collections during the third quarter of fiscal 2007 resulting from shipments of our CS3 family of products. The primary working capital use of cash was a decrease in accrued restructuring costs which was primarily due to payments for facility and severance costs for fiscal 2007 . 59 TABLE OF CONTENTS Net cash provided by operating activities of $900.0 million for fiscal 2006, was primarily comprised of net income, net of non-cash related expenses. The primary working capital sources of cash were increases in deferred revenue, income taxes payable and trade payables. Deferred revenue increased primarily due to increased maintenance and support obligations. Income taxes payable increased primarily due to higher current tax liabilities related to overall increased taxable income. Working capital uses of cash included increases in trade receivables and prepaid expenses and other current assets coupled with decreases in accrued restructuring costs and accrued expenses. Trade receivables increased due to increased revenue. Accrued restructuring decreased due to payments made during fiscal 2006. Net changes to accrued expenses was attributable primarily to decreases in compensation related costs and other expenses. Cash flows from investing activities Net cash from investing activities changed from cash provided for fiscal 2007 of $81.5 million to cash used in fiscal 2008 of $304.7 million primarily due to purchases of short-term investments offset in part by maturities and sales of short-term investments. Other uses of cash during fiscal 2008 represented purchases of property and equipment, long-term investments and other assets and one business combination offset in part by proceeds from the sale of other investments in equity securities. The uses associated with the purchase of long-term investments and other assets related primarily to cash paid for future licensing rights acquired through certain technology licensing arrangements totaling $56.0 million in fiscal 2008. As part of our lease extension for the Almaden Tower lease completed during the second quarter of fiscal 2007, we purchased a portion of the lease receivable totaling $80.4 million. Other uses of cash during fiscal 2007 included the completion of two business combinations and one asset acquisition. Net cash from investing activities decreased from net cash provided for fiscal 2006 of $195.2 million to net cash provided for fiscal 2007 of $81.5 million. In fiscal 2006, net cash acquired with the Macromedia acquisition amounted to $488.4 million and the sale of our minority equity investment in Atom Entertainment, Inc. amounted to $82.3 million. No similar transactions of this magnitude occurred during fiscal 2007. The primary sources of cash during fiscal 2007 were sales and maturities of short-term investments offset in part by purchases of short-term investments. The proceeds from the sales of short-term investments were primarily used for stock repurchases. Uses of cash during fiscal 2007 included purchases of property and equipment, purchases of long-term investments and other assets which related primarily to the technology licensing arrangements that occurred during the second quarter of fiscal 2007, three acquisitions completed in fiscal 2007 and the purchase of the lease receivable associated with the Almaden tower lease. See Note 15 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding this lease extension. Cash flows from financing activities Net cash used for financing activities decreased $328.8 million for a total of $1.0 billion in fiscal 2008 as compared to cash used for the same period last year, primarily due to net borrowings under our credit agreement of $350.0 million. Additionally, we had lower purchases of treasury stock when compared to the prior year (see sections entitled Stock Repurchase Program I and Stock Repurchase Program II discussed below), offset in part by lower proceeds related to the issuance of treasury stock. Net cash used for financing activities increased $603.0 million for a total of $1.4 billion during fiscal 2007 as compared to cash used of $747.4 million during fiscal 2006. Increases were primarily due to additional purchases of treasury stock when compared to the prior year. Cash used for stock repurchases increased due to a higher average cost per share, a greater number of shares being repurchased and remaining prepayments related to stock repurchase agreements. (See the following sections titled Stock Repurchase Program I and Stock Repurchase Program II discussed below) . We expect to continue our investing activities, including short-term and long-term investments and purchases of computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, product support and administrative staff. Furthermore, cash may be used to repurchase stock under our stock repurchase programs and strategically acquire software companies, products or technologies that are complementary to our business. The Board of Directors has approved a facilities expansion for our operations in India, which may include the purchase of land and buildings. As previously disclosed, we plan to invest $100.0 million directly in venture capital, of which, approximately $33.5 million has already been invested. We expect the remaining balance to be invested over the next three to five years. 60 TABLE OF CONTENTS In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, we initiated a restructuring program in order to reduce our operating costs and focus our resources on key strategic priorities impacting a total of approximately 560 full-time positions globally. In connection with this restructuring plan, we recorded restructuring charges totaling $29.2 million related to termination benefits for the elimination of approximately 460 of these full-time positions globally. As of November 28, 2008, $0.4 million was paid. The remaining accrual associated with these termination benefits is expected to be substantially paid during fiscal 2009. In fiscal 2009, we expect to record approximately $10.0 million to $13.0 million primarily related to the consolidation of leased facilities and approximately $6.0 million to $7.0 million related to employee severance arrangements for the elimination of approximately 100 of the remaining full-time positions globally. We expect to pay this facility related liability through fiscal 2013. Our existing cash, cash equivalents and investment balances may decline during fiscal 2009 in the event of a further weakening of the economy or changes in our planned cash outlay. However, based on our current business plan and revenue prospects, we believe that our existing balances, our anticipated cash flows from operations and our available credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital and operating resource expenditure requirements for the next twelve months. During the third quarter of fiscal 2007, we also increased our existing $500.0 million credit facility to $1.0 billion. The purpose of the credit facility is to provide backup liquidity for general corporate purposes including stock repurchases. Cash from operations could be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to the risks detailed in Part I, Item 1A titled Risk Factors. See Note 16 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding our credit agreement. We use professional investment management firms to manage a large portion of our invested cash. External investment firms managed, on average, 65% of our consolidated invested balances during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008. Within the U.S., the portfolio is invested primarily in money market funds for working capital purposes. Outside of the U.S., our fixed income portfolio is primarily invested in U.S. Treasury securities. Stock Repurchase Program I To facilitate our stock repurchase program, designed to return value to our stockholders and minimize dilution from stock issuances, we repurchase shares in the open market and also enter into structured repurchases with third parties. Authorization to repurchase shares to cover on-going dilution is not subject to expiration. However, this repurchase program is limited to covering net dilution from stock issuances and is subject to business conditions and cash flow requirements as determined by our Board of Directors from time to time. As part of this program, on April 17, 2005, the Board of Directors approved the use of an additional $1.0 billion for stock repurchases commencing upon the close of the Macromedia acquisition. This additional $1.0 billion in stock repurchases was completed by the third quarter of fiscal 2006. During fiscal 2008 and 2007, we entered into several structured repurchase agreements with large financial institutions, whereupon we provided the financial institutions with prepayments of $525.0 million and $1.1 billion, respectively. We entered into these agreements in order to take advantage of repurchasing shares at a guaranteed discount to the Volume Weighted Average Price ( VWAP ) of our common stock over a specified period of time. We only enter into such transactions when the discount that we receive is higher than the foregone return on our cash prepayments to the financial institutions. There were no explicit commissions or fees on these structured repurchases. Under the terms of the agreements, there is no requirement for the financial institutions to return any portion of the prepayment to us. The financial institutions agree to deliver shares to us at monthly intervals during the contract term. The parameters used to calculate the number of shares deliverable are: the total notional amount of the contract, the number of trading days in the contract, the number of trading days in the interval and the average VWAP of our stock during the interval less the agreed upon discount. During fiscal 2008, we repurchased 22.4 million shares at an average price of $36.26 through structured repurchase agreements which included prepayments from fiscal 2007. During fiscal 2007, we repurchased 22.0 million shares at an average price of $40.04 through structured repurchase agreements which included prepayments from fiscal 2006. During fiscal 2008, we also repurchased 3.6 million shares at an average price of $36.41 in open market transactions. 61 TABLE OF CONTENTS For fiscal 2008 and 2007, the prepayments were classified as treasury stock on our balance sheet at the payment date, though only shares physically delivered to us by November 28, 2008 and November 30, 2007 were excluded from the denominator in the computation of earnings per share. All outstanding structured repurchase agreements as of November 28, 2008 under this program will expire on or before March 19, 2009. As of November 28, 2008 and November 30, 2007, approximately $134.7 million and $422.6 million, respectively, of up-front payments remained under the agreements. See Item 5, Market for Registrant Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities, for share repurchases during the quarter ended November 28, 2008. Stock Repurchase Program II Under this stock repurchase program, we had authorization to repurchase an aggregate of 50.0 million shares of our common stock. During the third quarter of fiscal 2008, the remaining authorized number of shares were repurchased. From the inception of the 50.0 million share authorization under this program, we provided prepayments of $1.9 billion under structured share repurchase agreements to large financial institutions. During fiscal 2008, we repurchased 31.9 million shares under these structured agreements at an average price of $37.15. During fiscal 2007, we repurchased 17.7 million shares under these structured agreements at an average price of $40.50 and approximately $133.7 million of up-front payments remained under these agreements as of November 30, 2007. During fiscal 2008, we also repurchased 0.5 million shares at an average price of $39.79 in open market transactions.

(2) Stock repurchase agreements executed with large financial institutions. See Stock Repurchase Program I and Stock Repurchase Program II above. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations Our principal commitments as of November 28, 2008, consist of obligations under operating leases, royalty agreements and various service agreements. See Note 15 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our contractual commitments . 62 TABLE OF CONTENTS Contractual Commitments The following table summarizes our contractual commitments as of November 28, 2008: Total Less than 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years Over 5 years Total non-cancellable operating leases $ 229.2 $ 49.2 $ 60.9 $ 34.7 $ 84.4 Total purchase commitments 145.9 111.1 15.7 4.6 14.5 Total debt 350.0 350.0 Total $ 725.1 $ 160.3 $ 76.6 $ 389.3 $ 98.9 As of November 28, 2008, the principal outstanding under the credit agreement was $350.0 million which is due in full no later than February 16, 2013. Interest associated with this agreement cannot be estimated with certainty by period throughout the term since it is based on a fluctuating interest rate calculation. As a result of adopting FIN 48, we reclassified $197.7 million from current income taxes payable to long-term income taxes payable related to unrecognized tax benefits. The gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits at November 28, 2008 was $139.5 million, exclusive of interest and penalties. The timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain and the amounts ultimately paid, if any, upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ materially from the amounts accrued for each year. While it is reasonably possible that some issues with the IRS and other examinations could be resolved within the next 12 months, based upon the current facts and circumstances, we cannot estimate the timing of such resolution or range of potential changes as it relates to the unrecognized tax benefits that are recorded as part of our financial statements. We do not expect any material settlements in fiscal 2009 but it is inherently uncertain to determine. Two of our lease agreements and our credit agreement are subject to financial covenants. As of November 28, 2008, we were in compliance with all of our financial covenants and we expect to remain in compliance during the next 12 months. We believe these covenants will not impact our credit or cash in the coming fiscal year or restrict our ability to execute our business plan. Under the terms of our credit agreement and lease agreements, we are not prohibited from paying cash dividends unless payment would trigger an event of default or one currently exists. Royalties We have certain royalty commitments associated with the shipment and licensing of certain products. Royalty expense is generally based on a dollar amount per unit shipped or a percentage of the underlying revenue. Guarantees The lease agreements for our corporate headquarters provide for residual value guarantees. Under Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Interpretation No. 45 ( FIN 45 ), Guarantor Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others, the fair value of a residual value guarantee in lease agreements entered into after December 31, 2002, must be recognized as a liability on our consolidated balance sheet. As such, we recognized $5.2 million and $3.0 million in liabilities, related to the extended East and West Towers and Almaden Tower leases, respectively. These liabilities are recorded in other long-term liabilities with the offsetting entry recorded as prepaid rent in other assets. The balance will be amortized to the income statement over the life of the leases. As of November 28, 2008, the unamortized portion of the fair value of the residual value guarantees remaining in other long-term liabilities and prepaid rent was $2.6 million. Indemnifications In the normal course of business, we provide indemnifications of varying scope to customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products. Historically, costs related to these indemnification provisions have not been significant and we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these indemnification provisions on our future results of operations. 63 TABLE OF CONTENTS To the extent permitted under Delaware law, we have agreements whereby we indemnify our directors and officers for certain events or occurrences while the director or officer is, or was serving, at our request in such capacity. The indemnification period covers all pertinent events and occurrences during the director or officer lifetime. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited; however, we have director and officer insurance coverage that limits our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. We believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements in excess of applicable insurance coverage is minimal. As part of our limited partnership interests in Adobe Ventures, we have provided a general indemnification to Granite Ventures, an independent venture capital firm and sole general partner of Adobe Ventures, for certain events or occurrences while Granite Ventures is, or was serving, at our request in such capacity provided that Granite Ventures acts in good faith on behalf of the partnership. We are unable to develop an estimate of the maximum potential amount of future payments that could potentially result from any hypothetical future claim, but believe the risk of having to make any payments under this general indemnification to be remote.
