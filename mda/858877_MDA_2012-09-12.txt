OVERVIEW We design, manufacture, and sell Internet Protocol ( IP ) based networking and other products related to the communications and information technology ( IT ) industry and provide services associated with these products and their use. We provide a broad line of products for transporting data, voice, and video within buildings, across campuses, and around the world. Our products are designed to transform how people connect, communicate, and collaborate. Our products are installed at enterprise businesses, public institutions, telecommunications companies and other service providers, commercial businesses, and personal residences. A summary of our results is as follows, for further details see our Results of Operations on page 50 (in millions, except percentages and per-share amounts): Three Months Ended Fiscal Year Ended July 28, 2012 July 30, 2011 Variance July 28, 2012 July 30, 2011 Variance Net sales $ 11,690 $ 11,195 4.4 % $ 46,061 $ 43,218 6.6 % Gross margin percentage 60.6 % 61.3 % (0.7 )pts 61.2 % 61.4 % (0.2 )pts Research and development $ 1,416 $ 1,484 (4.6 )% $ 5,488 $ 5,823 (5.8 )% Sales and marketing $ 2,417 $ 2,520 (4.1 )% $ 9,647 $ 9,812 (1.7 )% General and administrative $ 711 $ 532 33.6 % $ 2,322 $ 1,908 21.7 % Total R&D, sales and marketing, general and administrative $ 4,544 $ 4,536 0.2 % $ 17,457 $ 17,543 (0.5 )% Total as a percentage of revenue 38.9 % 40.5 % (1.6 )pts 37.9 % 40.6 % (2.7 )pts Amortization of purchased intangible assets $ 91 $ 101 (9.9 )% $ 383 $ 520 (26.3 )% Restructuring and other charges $ 79 $ 768 (89.7 )% $ 304 $ 799 (62.0 )% Operating income as a percentage of revenue 20.3 % 13.0 % 7.3 pts 21.9 % 17.8 % 4.1 pts Income tax percentage 19.7 % 16.0 % 3.7 pts 20.8 % 17.1 % 3.7 pts Net income $ 1,917 $ 1,232 55.6 % $ 8,041 $ 6,490 23.9 % Net income as a percentage of revenue 16.4 % 11.0 % 5.4 pts 17.5 % 15.0 % 2.5 pts Earnings per share-diluted $ 0.36 $ 0.22 63.6 % $ 1.49 $ 1.17 27.4 % 40 Table of Contents Fiscal 2012 Compared with Fiscal 2011 Financial Performance Net sales increased 7%, with net product sales increasing 5% and service revenue increasing 12%. Total gross margin decreased by 0.2 percentage points primarily as a result of higher sales discounts and unfavorable product pricing as well as unfavorable product mix shifts. These negative impacts to gross margin were partially offset by lower manufacturing costs, higher volume, lower restructuring charges, and lower amortization and impairment charges from purchased intangible assets. As a percentage of revenue, research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses collectively declined by 2.7 percentage points due to the expense reductions we implemented in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 and in fiscal 2012. General and administrative expenses increased due primarily to impairment charges on real estate held for sale. Operating income as a percentage of revenue increased by 4.1 percentage points, primarily as a result of our sales increase, lower restructuring charges, lower amortization of purchased intangible assets and operating expense management. Diluted earnings per share increased by 27% from the prior year, a result of both a 24% increase in net income and a decline in our diluted share count of 159 million shares. Fiscal 2012 Compared with Fiscal 2011 Business Summary Our solid fiscal 2012 performance reflects continued execution on our plan to deliver profitable growth. In a challenging global macroeconomic environment we grew profits faster than revenue as revenue increased by 7% while net income increased by 24%. Our net income increase was in part due to lower restructuring charges in the current fiscal year. In fiscal 2012, revenue increased by $2.8 billion. The Americas contributed $1.5 billion of the increase led by higher sales in the United States. APJC contributed $0.9 billion to the revenue increase led by strong sales growth in Japan. EMEA added $0.5 billion to the revenue increase in fiscal 2012. Both our product and service categories experienced revenue growth across each of our geographic segments. We encountered certain challenges from a geographic perspective, such as those we identified in fiscal 2012 related to macroeconomic challenges in much of Europe, which are expected to continue in fiscal 2013. Partially offsetting these challenges, we saw solid growth in fiscal 2012 in certain emerging countries such as Mexico and Brazil within the Americas, China within APJC, and Russia within EMEA. We believe our prospects in most emerging countries are strong and we plan to align more of our resources to meet expected further opportunities in these countries. From a customer markets standpoint, in fiscal 2012 we had solid revenue growth across the service provider, commercial, and enterprise markets. The public sector customer market experienced flat revenue growth in fiscal 2012 as compared with fiscal 2011. Global public sector spending was a challenge for us in fiscal 2012, particularly in the Americas, with lower U.S. federal government spending, and in parts of EMEA due to continued austerity measures taking place in parts of the region. We expect these challenges in the public sector to continue into fiscal 2013. In fiscal 2012, net product sales increased by $1.8 billion while service revenue increased by $1.0 billion. Data Center products provided $0.6 billion of the increase in net product sales, our core Switching and NGN Routing products collectively provided $0.6 billion, Service Provider Video provided $0.4 billion, and Wireless products contributed $0.3 billion of the increase. These are key product areas for us, which along with the Service revenue contribution reflect, in our view, the success we are experiencing with our technology architectures and our ability to deliver customer solutions, particularly in the enterprise and service provider data center and cloud environments. With regard to profitability, our profits grew faster than revenue during fiscal 2012. This was attributable to lower operating expenses as a percentage of revenue driven by the cost reduction efforts we began in fiscal 2011, and substantially completed in fiscal 2012, and lower restructuring charges in fiscal 2012, coupled with relative stability in our gross margin. Our product gross margin benefited from value engineering and other cost savings, such as savings generated from price negotiations with our component suppliers. In summary, we achieved solid and profitable growth in fiscal 2012, and did so while encountering a challenging global macroeconomic environment. We expect that we will continue to be impacted by some of the same 41 Table of Contents challenges in fiscal 2013. In particular, we expect to be impacted by continued weakness in the European economy, lower global public sector spending especially with regard to the U.S. federal government and European governments, and a continued conservative approach to IT-related capital spending as our customers respond to this difficult macroeconomic environment. Fourth Quarter Snapshot For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, as compared with the corresponding period in fiscal 2011, net sales increased by 4%, with net product sales increasing by 3% and service revenue increasing by 12%. With regard to our geographic segment performance, on a year-over-year basis, net sales increased by 7% in the Americas, decreased by 5% in EMEA, and increased by 9% in APJC. Total gross margin decreased by 0.7 percentage points, primarily as a result of higher sales discounts and unfavorable product pricing as well as unfavorable product mix shifts, partially offset by lower manufacturing costs and higher volume. As a percentage of revenue, research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses collectively declined by 1.6 percentage points. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, general and administrative expenses include $202 million of real estate charges, primarily related to impairment charges on real estate held for sale. Operating income as a percentage of revenue increased by 7.3 percentage points, primarily as a result of lower restructuring and other charges in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 and our sales increase. Diluted earnings per share increased by 64% from the prior year period, primarily as a result of a 56% increase in net income and also, to a lesser degree, from a decline of 142 million in our diluted share count. Strategy and Focus Areas We began in fiscal 2011, and had largely completed by the end of fiscal 2012, realigning our sales, services and engineering organizations in order to simplify our operating model, drive faster innovation, and focus on our five foundational priorities: Leadership in our core business (routing, switching, and associated services) which includes comprehensive security and mobility solutions Collaboration Data center virtualization and cloud Video Architectures for business transformation We believe that focusing on these priorities best positions us to continue to expand our share of our customers information technology spending. For a full discussion of our strategy and focus areas, see Item 1. Business. Other Key Financial Measures The following is a summary of our other key financial measures for fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011 (in millions, except days sales outstanding in accounts receivable ( DSO ) and annualized inventory turns): Fiscal 2012 Fiscal 2011 Cash and cash equivalents and investments $ 48,716 $ 44,585 Cash provided by operating activities $ 11,491 $ 10,079 Deferred revenue $ 12,880 $ 12,207 Repurchases of common stock--stock repurchase program $ 4,360 $ 6,791 Dividends $ 1,501 $ 658 DSO 34 days 38 days Inventories $ 1,663 $ 1,486 Annualized inventory turns 11.7 11.8 Our product backlog at the end of fiscal 2012 was $5.0 billion, or 11% of fiscal 2012 net sales, compared with $4.5 billion at the end of fiscal 2011, or 10% of fiscal 2011 net sales. 42 Table of Contents CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make judgments, assumptions, and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. The accounting policies described below are significantly affected by critical accounting estimates. Such accounting policies require significant judgments, assumptions, and estimates used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements, and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies. Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognized when all of the following criteria have been met: Persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists. Contracts, Internet commerce agreements, and customer purchase orders are generally used to determine the existence of an arrangement. Delivery has occurred. Shipping documents and customer acceptance, when applicable, are used to verify delivery. The fee is fixed or determinable. We assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment. Collectibility is reasonably assured. We assess collectibility based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis, as well as the customer payment history. In instances where final acceptance of the product, system, or solution is specified by the customer, revenue is deferred until all acceptance criteria have been met. When a sale involves multiple deliverables, such as sales of products that include services, the multiple deliverables are evaluated to determine the unit of accounting, and the entire fee from the arrangement is allocated to each unit of accounting based on the relative selling price. Revenue is recognized when the revenue recognition criteria for each unit of accounting are met. The amount of product and service revenue recognized in a given period is affected by our judgment as to whether an arrangement includes multiple deliverables and, if so, our valuation of the units of accounting for multiple deliverables. According to the accounting guidance prescribed in Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 605, Revenue Recognition , we use vendor-specific objective evidence of selling price ( VSOE ) for each of those units, when available. We determine VSOE based on our normal pricing and discounting practices for the specific product or service when sold separately. In determining VSOE, we require that a substantial majority of the historical standalone transactions have the selling prices for a product or service fall within a reasonably narrow pricing range, generally evidenced by approximately 80% of such historical standalone transactions falling within plus or minus 15% of the median rates. When VSOE does not exist, we apply the selling price hierarchy to applicable multiple-deliverable arrangements. Under the selling price hierarchy, third-party evidence of selling price ( TPE ) will be considered if VSOE does not exist, and estimated selling price ( ESP ) will be used if neither VSOE nor TPE is available. Generally, we are not able to determine TPE because our go-to-market strategy differs from that of others in our markets, and the extent of our proprietary technology varies among comparable products or services from those of our peers. In determining ESP, we apply significant judgment as we weigh a variety of factors, based on the facts and circumstances of the arrangement. We typically arrive at an ESP for a product or service that is not sold separately by considering company-specific factors such as geographies, competitive landscape, internal costs, profitability objectives, pricing practices used to establish bundled pricing, and existing portfolio pricing and discounting. Some of our sales arrangements have multiple deliverables containing software and related software support components. Such sales arrangements are subject to the accounting guidance in ASC 985-605, Software-Revenue Recognition . 43 Table of Contents As our business and offerings evolve over time, our pricing practices may be required to be modified accordingly, which could result in changes in selling prices, including both VSOE and ESP, in subsequent periods. There were no material impacts during fiscal 2012, nor do we currently expect a material impact in fiscal 2013 on our revenue recognition due to any changes in our VSOE, TPE, or ESP. Revenue deferrals relate to the timing of revenue recognition for specific transactions based on financing arrangements, service, support, and other factors. Financing arrangements may include sales-type, direct-financing, and operating leases, loans, and guarantees of third-party financing. Our deferred revenue for products was $3.7 billion as of each July 28, 2012 and July 30, 2011. Technical support services revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the period during which the services are to be performed, which typically is from one to three years. Advanced services revenue is recognized upon delivery or completion of performance. Our deferred revenue for services was $9.2 billion and $8.5 billion as of July 28, 2012 and July 30, 2011, respectively. We make sales to distributors and retail partners which we refer to as two-tier systems of sales to the end customer. Revenue from distributors and retail partners is recognized based on a sell-through method using information provided by them. Our distributors and retail partners participate in various cooperative marketing and other programs, and we maintain estimated accruals and allowances for these programs. If actual credits received by our distributors and retail partners under these programs were to deviate significantly from our estimates, which are based on historical experience, our revenue could be adversely affected. Allowances for Receivables and Sales Returns The allowances for receivables were as follows (in millions, except percentages): July 28, 2012 July 30, 2011 Allowance for doubtful accounts $ 207 $ 204 Percentage of gross accounts receivable 4.5 % 4.2 % Allowance for credit loss lease receivables $ 247 $ 237 Percentage of gross lease receivables 7.2 % 7.6 % Allowance for credit loss loan receivables $ 122 $ 103 Percentage of gross loan receivables 6.8 % 7.0 % The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our assessment of the collectibility of customer accounts. We regularly review the adequacy of these allowances by considering internal factors such as historical experience, credit quality and age of the receivable balances as well as external factors such as economic conditions that may affect a customer ability to pay and expected default frequency rates, which are published by major third-party credit-rating agencies and are generally updated on a quarterly basis. We also consider the concentration of receivables outstanding with a particular customer in assessing the adequacy of our allowances for doubtful accounts. If a major customer creditworthiness deteriorates, if actual defaults are higher than our historical experience, or if other circumstances arise, our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us could be overstated, and additional allowances could be required, which could have an adverse impact on our revenue. The allowance for credit loss on financing receivables is also based on the assessment of collectibility of customer accounts. We regularly review the adequacy of the credit allowances determined either on an individual or a collective basis. When evaluating the financing receivables on an individual basis, we consider historical experience, credit quality and age of receivable balances, and economic conditions that may affect a customer ability to pay. As discussed in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, effective at the beginning of the second quarter of fiscal 2012 we refined our methodology for determining the portion of our allowance for credit loss that is evaluated on a collective basis. The refinement consists of more systematically giving effect to economic conditions, concentration of risk and correlation. We also began to use expected default frequency rates published by a major third-party credit-rating agency as well as our own historical loss rate in the event of default. Determination of expected default frequency rates and loss factors associated with internal credit risk 44 Table of Contents ratings as well as assessing economic conditions, concentration of risk, and correlation are complex and subjective. Our ongoing consideration of all these factors could result in an increase in our allowance for credit loss in the future, which could adversely affect our revenue. Both accounts receivable and financing receivables are charged off at the point when they are considered uncollectible. A reserve for future sales returns is established based on historical trends in product return rates. The reserve for future sales returns as of July 28, 2012 and July 30, 2011 was $129 million and $106 million, respectively, and was recorded as a reduction of our accounts receivable. If the actual future returns were to deviate from the historical data on which the reserve had been established, our revenue could be adversely affected. Inventory Valuation and Liability for Purchase Commitments with Contract Manufacturers and Suppliers Our inventory balance was $1.7 billion and $1.5 billion as of July 28, 2012 and July 30, 2011, respectively. Inventory is written down based on excess and obsolete inventories determined primarily by future demand forecasts. Inventory write-downs are measured as the difference between the cost of the inventory and market, based upon assumptions about future demand, and are charged to the provision for inventory, which is a component of our cost of sales. At the point of the loss recognition, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory is established, and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis. We record a liability for firm, noncancelable, and unconditional purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with the valuation of our excess and obsolete inventory. As of July 28, 2012, the liability for these purchase commitments was $193 million, compared with $168 million as of July 30, 2011, and was included in other current liabilities. Our provision for inventory was $115 million, $196 million, and $94 million for fiscal 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively. The provision for the liability related to purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers was $151 million, $114 million, and $8 million in fiscal 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively. On a combined basis, the $44 million decline in our provisions for inventory and purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers for fiscal 2012 was primarily due to the absence in the current fiscal year of charges we recorded in connection with the restructuring and realignment of our consumer business during fiscal 2011. If there were to be a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products, or if there were a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements, we could be required to increase our inventory write-downs, and our liability for purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers, and accordingly our profitability could be adversely affected. We regularly evaluate our exposure for inventory write-downs and the adequacy of our liability for purchase commitments. Inventory and supply chain management remain areas of focus as we balance the need to maintain supply chain flexibility to help ensure competitive lead times with the risk of inventory obsolescence, particularly in light of current macroeconomic uncertainties and conditions and the resulting potential for changes in future demand forecast. Warranty Costs The liability for product warranties, included in other current liabilities, was $415 million as of July 28, 2012, compared with $342 million as of July 30, 2011. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Our products are generally covered by a warranty for periods ranging from 90 days to five years, and for some products we provide a limited lifetime warranty. We accrue for warranty costs as part of our cost of sales based on associated material costs, technical support labor costs, and associated overhead. Material cost is estimated based primarily upon historical trends in the volume of product returns within the warranty period and the cost to repair or replace the equipment. Technical support labor cost is estimated based primarily upon historical trends in the rate of customer cases and the cost to support the customer cases within the warranty period. Overhead cost is applied based on estimated time to support warranty activities. 45 Table of Contents The provision for product warranties issued during fiscal 2012, 2011, and 2010 was $661 million, $456 million, and $469 million, respectively. The increase in the provision in fiscal 2012, as compared with fiscal 2011, was primarily due to increased shipment volume of products with higher warranty costs and longer warranty lives, and also due to increased warranty charges related to specific products. If we experience an increase in warranty claims compared with our historical experience, or if the cost of servicing warranty claims is greater than expected, our profitability could be adversely affected. Share-Based Compensation Expense Share-based compensation expense is presented as follows (in millions): Years Ended July 28, 2012 July 30, 2011 July 31, 2010 Share-based compensation expense $ 1,401 $ 1,620 $ 1,517 Prior to the initial declaration of a quarterly cash dividend on March 17, 2011, the fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock units was measured based on an expected dividend yield of 0% as we did not historically pay cash dividends on our common stock. For awards granted on or subsequent to March 17, 2011, we used an annualized dividend yield based on the per share dividends declared by our Board of Directors as of the grant date. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The determination of the fair value of employee stock options and employee stock purchase rights on the date of grant using an option-pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables. For employee stock options and employee stock purchase rights, these variables include, but are not limited to, the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, the risk-free interest rate, and expected dividends as of the grant date. For employee stock options, we have historically used the implied volatility for two-year traded options on our stock as the expected volatility assumption required in the lattice-binomial model. For employee stock purchase rights, we used the implied volatility for traded options (with lives corresponding to the expected life of the employee stock purchase rights) on our stock. The selection of the implied volatility approach was based upon the availability of actively traded options on our stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility. The valuation of employee stock options is also impacted by kurtosis and skewness, which are technical measures of the distribution of stock price returns and the actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors. Because share-based compensation expense is based on awards ultimately expected to vest, it has been reduced for forfeitures. If factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of our option-pricing model in future periods or if we experience different forfeiture rates, the compensation expense that is derived may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current year. Fair Value Measurements Our fixed income and publicly traded equity securities, collectively, are reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at a fair value of $38.9 billion as of July 28, 2012, compared with $36.9 billion as of July 30, 2011. Our fixed income investment portfolio, as of July 28, 2012, consisted primarily of high quality investment-grade securities. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. As described more fully in Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, a valuation hierarchy is based on the level of independent, objective evidence available regarding the value of the investments. It encompasses three classes of investments: Level 1 consists of securities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical securities; Level 2 consists of securities for which observable inputs other than Level 1 inputs are used, such as quoted prices for similar securities in active markets or quoted prices for identical securities in less active markets and model-derived valuations for which the variables are derived from, or corroborated by, observable market data; and Level 3 consists of securities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value. 46 Table of Contents Our Level 2 securities are valued using quoted market prices for similar instruments or nonbinding market prices that are corroborated by observable market data. We use inputs such as actual trade data, benchmark yields, broker/dealer quotes, and other similar data, which are obtained from independent pricing vendors, quoted market prices, or other sources to determine the ultimate fair value of our assets and liabilities. We use such pricing data as the primary input, to which we have not made any material adjustments during fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011, to make our assessments and determinations as to the ultimate valuation of our investment portfolio. We are ultimately responsible for the financial statements and underlying estimates. The inputs and fair value are reviewed for reasonableness, may be further validated by comparison to publicly available information, and could be adjusted based on market indices or other information that management deems material to its estimate of fair value. The assessment of fair value can be difficult and subjective. However, given the relative reliability of the inputs we use to value our investment portfolio, and because substantially all of our valuation inputs are obtained using quoted market prices for similar or identical assets, we do not believe that the nature of estimates and assumptions affected by levels of subjectivity and judgment was material to the valuation of the investment portfolio as of July 28, 2012. We had no Level 3 investments in our total portfolio as of July 28, 2012. Other-than-Temporary Impairments We recognize an impairment charge when the declines in the fair values of our fixed income or publicly traded equity securities below their cost basis are judged to be other than temporary. The ultimate value realized on these securities, to the extent unhedged, is subject to market price volatility until they are sold. If the fair value of a debt security is less than its amortized cost, we assess whether the impairment is other than temporary. An impairment is considered other than temporary if (i) we have the intent to sell the security, (ii) it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its entire amortized cost basis, or (iii) we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost of the security. If an impairment is considered other than temporary based on (i) or (ii) described in the prior sentence, the entire difference between the amortized cost and the fair value of the security is recognized in earnings. If an impairment is considered other than temporary based on condition (iii), the amount representing credit loss, defined as the difference between the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis of the debt security, will be recognized in earnings, and the amount relating to all other factors will be recognized in other comprehensive income (OCI). In estimating the amount and timing of cash flows expected to be collected, we consider all available information, including past events, current conditions, the remaining payment terms of the security, the financial condition of the issuer, expected defaults, and the value of underlying collateral. For publicly traded equity securities, we consider various factors in determining whether we should recognize an impairment charge, including the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than our cost basis, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value. Impairment charges on our investments in publicly traded equity securities were not material in fiscal 2012, 2011, and 2010. There were no impairment charges on investments in fixed income securities in fiscal 2012, 2011, and 2010. Our ongoing consideration of all the factors described previously could result in additional impairment charges in the future, which could adversely affect our net income. We also have investments in privately held companies, some of which are in the startup or development stages. As of July 28, 2012, our investments in privately held companies were $858 million, compared with $796 million as of July 30, 2011, and were included in other assets. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We monitor these investments for events or circumstances indicative of potential impairment and will make appropriate reductions in carrying values if we determine that an impairment charge is required, based primarily on the financial condition and near-term prospects of these companies. These investments are inherently risky 47 Table of Contents because the markets for the technologies or products these companies are developing are typically in the early stages and may never materialize. Our impairment charges on investments in privately held companies were $23 million, $10 million, and $25 million in fiscal 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively. Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Asset Impairments Our methodology for allocating the purchase price relating to purchase acquisitions is determined through established valuation techniques. Goodwill represents a residual value as of the acquisition date, which in most cases results in measuring goodwill as an excess of the purchase consideration transferred plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interest in the acquired company over the fair value of net assets acquired, including contingent consideration. We perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis in the fourth fiscal quarter and between annual tests in certain circumstances for each reporting unit. The assessment of fair value for goodwill and purchased intangible assets is based on factors that market participants would use in an orderly transaction in accordance with the new accounting guidance for the fair value measurement of nonfinancial assets. The goodwill recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of July 28, 2012 and July 30, 2011 was $17.0 billion and $16.8 billion, respectively. In response to changes in industry and market conditions, we could be required to strategically realign our resources and consider restructuring, disposing of, or otherwise exiting businesses, which could result in an impairment of goodwill. There was no impairment of goodwill resulting from our annual impairment testing in fiscal 2012, 2011 or 2010. For the annual impairment testing in fiscal 2012, the excess of the fair value over the carrying value for each of our reporting units was $17.3 billion for the Americas segment, $13.8 billion for the EMEA segment and $9.1 billion for the APJC segment. We performed a sensitivity analysis for goodwill impairment with respect to each of our respective reporting units and determined that a hypothetical 10% decline in the fair value of each reporting unit as of July 28, 2012 would not result in an impairment of goodwill for any reporting unit. As a result of the divestiture of our manufacturing operations in Juarez, Mexico, in fiscal 2011 we recorded an adjustment of $63 million to reduce goodwill associated with these operations. We make judgments about the recoverability of purchased intangible assets with finite lives whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist. Recoverability of purchased intangible assets with finite lives is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate. We review indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Recoverability of indefinite-lived intangible assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future discounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate. If the asset is considered to be impaired, the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset. Assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our purchased intangible assets are complex and subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts. Our impairment charges related to purchased intangible assets were $12 million, $164 million, and $28 million during fiscal 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively. Our ongoing consideration of all the factors described previously could result in additional impairment charges in the future, which could adversely affect our net income. Income Taxes We are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our effective tax rates differ from the statutory rate, primarily due to the tax impact of state taxes, foreign operations, research and development ( R&D ) tax credits, tax audit settlements, nondeductible compensation, international realignments, and transfer pricing adjustments. Our effective tax rate was 20.8%, 17.1%, and 17.5% in fiscal 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. Although we believe our reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax 48 Table of Contents outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made. The provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate, as well as the related net interest and penalties. Significant judgment is also required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all available evidence, including past operating results, estimates of future taxable income, and the feasibility of tax planning strategies. In the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized, we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made. Our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely impacted by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates; by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; by expiration of or lapses in the R&D tax credit laws; by transfer pricing adjustments including the effect of acquisitions on our intercompany R&D cost-sharing arrangement and legal structure; by tax effects of nondeductible compensation; by tax costs related to intercompany realignments; by changes in accounting principles; or by changes in tax laws and regulations including possible U.S. changes to the taxation of earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, the deductibility of expenses attributable to foreign income, or the foreign tax credit rules. Significant judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement attributes prescribed in the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes. The accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes applies to all income tax positions, including the potential recovery of previously paid taxes, which if settled unfavorably could adversely impact our provision for income taxes or additional paid-in capital. Further, as a result of certain of our ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments, our income in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates and in some cases is wholly exempt from tax. Our failure to meet these commitments could adversely impact our provision for income taxes. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition. Loss Contingencies We are subject to the possibility of various losses arising in the ordinary course of business. We consider the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability, as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss, in determining loss contingencies. An estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. We regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted and whether new accruals are required. Third parties, including customers, have in the past and may in the future assert claims or initiate litigation related to exclusive patent, copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property rights to technologies and related standards that are relevant to us. These assertions have increased over time as a result of our growth and the general increase in the pace of patent claims assertions, particularly in the United States. If any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us by any third party is successful, or if we fail to develop non-infringing technology or license the proprietary rights on commercially reasonable terms and conditions, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. 49 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Fiscal 2012, 2011, and 2010 were 52, 52, and 53-week fiscal years, respectively. Net Sales The following table presents the breakdown of net sales between product and service revenue (in millions, except percentages): Years Ended July 28, 2012 July 30, 2011 Variance in Dollars Variance in Percent July 30, 2011 July 31, 2010 Variance in Dollars Variance in Percent Net sales: Product $ 36,326 $ 34,526 $ 1,800 5.2 % $ 34,526 $ 32,420 $ 2,106 6.5 % Percentage of net sales 78.9 % 79.9 % 79.9 % 81.0 % Service 9,735 8,692 1,043 12.0 % 8,692 7,620 1,072 14.1 % Percentage of net sales 21.1 % 20.1 % 20.1 % 19.0 % Total $ 46,061 $ 43,218 $ 2,843 6.6 % $ 43,218 $ 40,040 $ 3,178 7.9 % We manage our business primarily on a geographic basis, organized into three geographic segments. Our net sales, which include product and service revenue, for each segment are summarized in the following table (in millions, except percentages): Years Ended July 28, 2012 July 30, 2011 Variance in Dollars Variance in Percent July 30, 2011 July 31, 2010 Variance in Dollars Variance in Percent Net sales: Americas $ 26,501 $ 25,015 $ 1,486 5.9 % $ 25,015 $ 23,334 $ 1,681 7.2 % Percentage of net sales 57.5 % 57.9 % 57.9 % 58.3 % EMEA 12,075 11,604 471 4.1 % 11,604 10,825 779 7.2 % Percentage of net sales 26.2 % 26.8 % 26.8 % 27.0 % APJC 7,485 6,599 886 13.4 % 6,599 5,881 718 12.2 % Percentage of net sales 16.3 % 15.3 % 15.3 % 14.7 % Total $ 46,061 $ 43,218 $ 2,843 6.6 % $ 43,218 $ 40,040 $ 3,178 7.9 % Fiscal 2012 Compared with Fiscal 2011 For fiscal 2012, as compared with fiscal 2011, net sales increased by 7%. Within total net sales growth, net product sales increased by 5%, while service revenue increased by 12%. Our product and service revenue totals reflect sales growth across each of our geographic segments. The sales increase was primarily due to: the strong performance of our Service offerings; new product transitions taking place in Switching; and increased demand for our Data Center, Service Provider Video, and Wireless products. We conduct business globally in numerous currencies. The direct effect of foreign currency fluctuations on sales has not been material because our sales are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. However, if the U.S. dollar strengthens relative to other currencies, such strengthening could have an indirect effect on our sales to the extent it raises the cost of our products to non-U.S. customers and thereby reduces demand. A weaker U.S. dollar could have the opposite effect. However, the precise indirect effect of currency fluctuations is difficult to measure or predict because our sales are influenced by many factors in addition to the impact of such currency fluctuations. In addition to the impact of macroeconomic factors, including a reduced IT spending environment and budget-driven reductions in spending by government entities, net sales by segment in a particular period may be significantly impacted by several factors related to revenue recognition, including the complexity of transactions such as multiple-element arrangements; the mix of financing arrangements provided to our channel partners and customers; and final acceptance of the product, system, or solution, among other factors. In addition, certain customers tend to make large and sporadic purchases, and the net sales related to these transactions may also be affected by the timing of revenue recognition, which in turn would impact the net sales of the relevant segment. As has been the case in certain of our emerging countries from time to time, customers require greater levels of financing arrangements, service, and support and this may occur in future periods, which may also impact the timing of the recognition of revenue. 50 Table of Contents Fiscal 2011 Compared with Fiscal 2010 For fiscal 2011, as compared with fiscal 2010, net sales increased by 8%. Within total net sales growth, net product sales increased by 6%, while service revenue increased by 14%. Our product and service revenue totals each reflected sales growth across each of our geographic segments. The sales increase was due to customer acceptance of the new product transitions taking place in our core switching and routing businesses, sales growth in our Collaboration, Data Center, Wireless, and Service Provider Video product categories and the strong performance of our services solutions. Net Product Sales by Segment The following table presents the breakdown of net product sales by segment (in millions, except percentages): Years Ended July 28, 2012 July 30, 2011 Variance in Dollars Variance in Percent July 30, 2011 July 31, 2010 Variance in Dollars Variance in Percent Net product sales: Americas $ 20,168 $ 19,292 $ 876 4.5 % $ 19,292 $ 18,240 $ 1,052 5.8 % Percentage of net product sales 55.5 % 55.9 % 55.9 % 56.3 % EMEA 10,024 9,788 236 2.4 % 9,788 9,223 565 6.1 % Percentage of net product sales 27.6 % 28.3 % 28.3 % 28.4 % APJC 6,134 5,446 688 12.6 % 5,446 4,957 489 9.9 % Percentage of net product sales 16.9 % 15.8 % 15.8 % 15.3 % Total $ 36,326 $ 34,526 $ 1,800 5.2 % $ 34,526 $ 32,420 $ 2,106 6.5 % Americas Fiscal 2012 Compared with Fiscal 2011 For fiscal 2012, as compared with fiscal 2011, net product sales in the Americas segment increased by 5%. The increase in net product sales was across most of our customer markets in the Americas segment, led by growth in the enterprise, service provider and commercial markets. We experienced a net product sales decline in the public sector market for the fiscal year. Within the Americas segment, net product sales to the U.S. public sector were flat, as lower net product sales to the U.S. federal government were offset by higher net product sales to state and local government. From a country perspective, net product sales increased by 4% in the United States, 10% in Canada, 21% in Mexico, and 14% in Brazil. Fiscal 2011 Compared with Fiscal 2010 For fiscal 2011, as compared with fiscal 2010, net product sales in the Americas segment increased by 6%. Net product sales increased 3% in the United States, 31% in Canada, 20% in Brazil, and 8% in Mexico. The increase in net product sales was across all of our customer markets in the Americas segment, led by the net product sales growth in our commercial market, followed by smaller increases in net product sales growth in the service provider, enterprise, and public sector markets. Net product sales to the U.S. public sector decreased due to a decrease in sales to the U.S. federal government, while sales to the state and local government market were flat. EMEA Fiscal 2012 Compared with Fiscal 2011 For fiscal 2012, as compared with fiscal 2011, net product sales in the EMEA segment increased by 2%. The increase in net product sales was across most of our customer markets in the EMEA segment, led by growth in the commercial, enterprise and public sector markets. We experienced a slight decline in net product sales in the service provider customer market during the fiscal year driven by lower revenue from this customer market in several of the large countries in the region. From a country perspective, net product sales increased by 11% in the United Kingdom, 15% in Russia, and 9% in the Netherlands. These increases were partially offset by net product sales declines of 23% in Italy, 21% in Spain, 2% in Germany, and 1% in France. 51 Table of Contents We believe that the slower growth we experienced in EMEA was a result of weak macroeconomic conditions attributable in large part to the austerity measures taking place in parts of the region. In particular, we experienced weakness in this segment during the second half of fiscal 2012, with a year-over-year decline in net product sales in this segment during the fourth quarter. Fiscal 2011 Compared with Fiscal 2010 For fiscal 2011, as compared with fiscal 2010, net product sales in the EMEA segment increased by 6%. The increase in net product sales in the European Markets segment was primarily due to growth in the enterprise and service provider markets and to a lesser extent sales growth in the commercial market. For fiscal 2011, as compared with fiscal 2010, sales to the public sector market were flat. From a country perspective, for fiscal 2011 as compared with fiscal 2010, net product sales increased by approximately 17% in France, 13% in the Netherlands, 2% in Germany, 1% in the United Kingdom, and 63% in Russia and were flat in Italy. APJC Fiscal 2012 Compared with Fiscal 2011 For fiscal 2012, as compared with fiscal 2011, net product sales in the APJC segment increased by 13%. The increase was led by strong net product sales growth in the service provider market, and to a lesser degree, in the commercial, enterprise and public sector markets. From a country perspective, net product sales increased by 27% in Japan, 17% in China, and 12% in Australia. We experienced a year-over-year net product sales decline of 19% in South Korea, and 4% in India. Our sales decline in India was due to ongoing business momentum challenges in the public sector customer market. Fiscal 2011 Compared with Fiscal 2010 For fiscal 2011, as compared with fiscal 2010, net product sales in our APJC segment increased by 10%. The increase was led by sales growth in the enterprise, commercial and service provider markets, and to a lesser extent sales growth in the public sector market. From a country perspective, net product sales increased by approximately 13% in India, 11% in China, 8% in Australia, and 7% in Japan. Net Product Sales by Groups of Similar Products In addition to the primary view on a geographic basis, we also prepare financial information related to groups of similar products and customer markets for various purposes. Our product categories consist of the following categories (with subcategories in parentheses): Switching (fixed switching, modular switching, and storage); NGN Routing (high-end routers, mid-range and low-end routers, and optical); Collaboration (unified communications and Cisco TelePresence); Service Provider Video (cable and cable modem, video systems); Wireless; Security; Data Center; and Other Products. The Other Products category consists primarily of Linksys-related products, emerging technology products, and other networking products. 52 Table of Contents The following table presents net sales for groups of similar products (in millions, except percentages): Years Ended July 28, 2012 July 30, 2011 Variance in Dollars Variance in Percent July 30, 2011 July 31, 2010 Variance in Dollars Variance in Percent Net product sales: Switching $ 14,531 $ 14,130 $ 401 2.8 % $ 14,130 $ 14,074 $ 56 0.4 % Percentage of net product sales 40.0 % 40.9 % 40.9 % 43.4 % NGN Routing 8,425 8,264 161 1.9 % 8,264 7,868 396 5.0 % Percentage of net product sales 23.2 % 24.0 % 24.0 % 24.3 % Collaboration 4,139 4,013 126 3.1 % 4,013 2,981 1,032 34.6 % Percentage of net product sales 11.4 % 11.6 % 11.6 % 9.2 % Service Provider Video 3,858 3,483 375 10.8 % 3,483 3,294 189 5.7 % Percentage of net product sales 10.6 % 10.1 % 10.1 % 10.2 % Wireless 1,699 1,427 272 19.1 % 1,427 1,134 293 25.8 % Percentage of net product sales 4.7 % 4.1 % 4.1 % 3.5 % Security 1,349 1,200 149 12.4 % 1,200 1,302 (102 ) (7.8 )% Percentage of net product sales 3.7 % 3.5 % 3.5 % 4.0 % Data Center 1,298 694 604 87.0 % 694 196 498 254.1 % Percentage of net product sales 3.6 % 2.0 % 2.0 % 0.6 % Other 1,027 1,315 (288 ) (21.9 )% 1,315 1,571 (256 ) (16.3 )% Percentage of net product sales 2.8 % 3.8 % 3.8 % 4.8 % Total $ 36,326 $ 34,526 $ 1,800 5.2 % $ 34,526 $ 32,420 $ 2,106 6.5 % Switching Fiscal 2012 Compared with Fiscal 2011 For fiscal 2012, as compared with fiscal 2011, net product sales in our Switching product category increased by 3% or $401 million. The increase was primarily due to growth from transitioning products taking place in our Switching product portfolio. The impact of competitive pressures moderated growth, primarily in the first and fourth quarters of fiscal 2012. Within our Switching product category, higher sales of LAN fixed-configuration switches and storage products were partially offset by lower sales of modular switches. Sales of LAN fixed-configuration switches increased by 11%, or $814 million, while sales of modular switches decreased by 8%, or approximately $469 million. The increase in sales of LAN fixed-configuration switches was primarily due to increased sales of Cisco Catalyst 2960 Series Switches, Cisco Nexus 2000 and 5000 Series Switches, and the Cisco Catalyst 3750 Series Switches, partially offset by decreased sales of Cisco Catalyst 3560 Series Switches. Net product sales in our Switching product category were positively impacted by a 11% increase in sales of storage products, primarily stemming from strong growth in the first and fourth quarters of fiscal 2012. Sales of modular switches decreased primarily due to lower sales of Cisco Catalyst 6500 and 4500 Series Switches, partially offset by increased sales of Cisco Nexus 7000 Series Switches. Fiscal 2011 Compared with Fiscal 2010 Net product sales in our Switching product category were relatively flat in fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010, which was due to the combined effect of continuing transitions taking place in our product portfolio, lower public sector spending, and the impact of increased competitive pressures. Within our Switches product category, higher sales of LAN fixed-configuration switches partially offset lower sales of modular switches. Sales of LAN fixed-configuration switches increased 5%, or $331 million, while sales of modular switches decreased 5%, or $306 million. The increase in LAN fixed-configuration switches was primarily due to increased sales of Cisco Catalyst 2960 Series Switches and Cisco Nexus 2000 and 5000 Series Switches, partially offset by decreased sales of Cisco Catalyst 3560 and 3750 Series Switches. The decrease in sales of modular switches was primarily due to decreased sales of Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series Switches, partially offset by increased sales of Cisco Nexus 7000 and Cisco Catalyst 4500 Series Switches. Net product sales increased 6%, or $31 million, in Storage, which was attributable to increased sales of our Cisco MDS 9000 product line. 53 Table of Contents NGN Routing Fiscal 2012 Compared with Fiscal 2011 For fiscal 2012, as compared with fiscal 2011, net product sales in our NGN Routing product category increased by 2%, or $161 million. The increase in sales of our NGN Routing product category was driven by a 6%, or $293 million, increase in sales of high-end router products, partially offset by a 3%, or $83 million, decline in sales of our midrange and low-end router products. Within the high-end router products category, the increase was driven by higher sales of Cisco CRS-3 Carrier Routing System products and higher sales of the Cisco Aggregation Services Routers ( ASR ) 9000, 5000, and 1000 family of products. These increases were partially offset by lower sales of Cisco 7600 and 12000 Series Routers. Within the midrange and low-end router products category, the decrease was related to the product transition taking place within our Cisco Integrated Services Router (ISR) products, as the sales decline in our older generation products had a greater impact than the growth experienced with our Cisco ISR 1900, ISR 2900 and ISR 3900 router products in this category. Sales of other NGN Routing products decreased by 6%, compared with fiscal 2011, primarily due to decreased sales of other routing and optical networking products. Fiscal 2011 Compared with Fiscal 2010 For fiscal 2011 as compared with fiscal 2010, growth in sales of our NGN Routing product category was driven by a 7%, or $294 million, increase in sales of our high-end routers. Within high-end router products, the increase was driven by higher sales of Cisco ASR 5000 products from our December 2009 acquisition of Starent and higher sales of the Cisco ASR 1000 and 9000 products. These increases were partially offset by lower sales of Cisco 12000 and 7600 Series Routers. For fiscal 2011, midrange and low-end routers sales decreased sales by 3%, or $84 million compared with fiscal 2010. Sales of other NGN Routing products increased by 31%, compared with fiscal 2011, primarily due to increased sales of optical networking products. Collaboration Fiscal 2012 Compared with Fiscal 2011 For fiscal 2012, as compared with fiscal 2011, sales of Collaboration products increased by 3%, or $126 million. The increase was due to a 5% increase in sales of unified communications products, primarily IP phones and collaborative web-based offerings, partially offset by a 1% decrease in sales of Cisco TelePresence systems. Challenges in both the public sector and demand weakness in Europe, along with our execution challenges related to our sales coverage model, contributed to the decrease in sales of Cisco TelePresence systems in fiscal 2012. Fiscal 2011 Compared with Fiscal 2010 Sales of Collaboration products increased by 35%, or $1.0 billion, primarily due to the inclusion of Tandberg sales within our Cisco TelePresence systems product line following our fiscal 2010 third quarter acquisition of Tandberg, and a 6% increase in sales of unified communications products, primarily IP phones and collaborative web-based offerings. Service Provider Video Fiscal 2012 Compared with Fiscal 2011 For fiscal 2012, as compared with fiscal 2011, sales of Service Provider Video products increased by 11%, or $375 million due to growth in our service provider customer market from increased sales of set-top boxes worldwide. Sales of video systems and other products increased by 13%, or $316 million, while sales of cable and cable modem products increased by 6%, or $59 million. 54 Table of Contents Fiscal 2011 Compared with Fiscal 2010 Sales of Service Provider Video products increased by 6%, or $189 million, due to increased sales of cable and cable modem products of 20% due to strong customer market demand, and increased sales of video systems products of 1%. Wireless Fiscal 2012 Compared with Fiscal 2011 For fiscal 2012, as compared with fiscal 2011, sales of Wireless products increased by 19%, or $272 million. These increases reflect the continued customer adoption of and migration to the Cisco Unified Wireless Network architecture and new product performance. Fiscal 2011 Compared with Fiscal 2010 Sales of Wireless products increased by 26%, or $293 million, which was primarily due to continued customer adoption of and migration to the Cisco Unified Wireless Network architecture. Security Fiscal 2012 Compared with Fiscal 2011 For fiscal 2012, as compared with fiscal 2011, sales of Security products increased by 12%, or $149 million. These increases were primarily due to growth in our network security products driven by the recent update of our firewall security product portfolio. Fiscal 2011 Compared with Fiscal 2010 For fiscal 2011, sales of Security products decreased by 8%, or $102 million. Our decreased sales of Security products were the result of lower sales of module and line cards related to our routers and LAN switches, partially offset by increased sales of our web and email security products. Data Center Fiscal 2012 Compared with Fiscal 2011 For fiscal 2012, as compared with fiscal 2011, sales of Data Center products increased by 87%, or $604 million, due to increased sales of Cisco Unified Computing System products. The increase was due to the momentum we are experiencing with our products for the enterprise and service provider data center and cloud environments, as current customers increase their data center build out, and new customer product purchases. To the extent our data center business grows and further penetrates the market, we expect that, in comparison to what we experienced during the initial rapid growth of this business, the growth rates for our data center product sales will experience more normal seasonality consistent with the overall server market. Fiscal 2011 Compared with Fiscal 2010 Sales of Data Center products increased by 254%, or $498 million, due to sales growth of over 273%, or $496 million, of Cisco Unified Computing System products. Other Products The decrease in sales of Other Products for fiscal 2012 and 2011 as compared with the prior fiscal year compare periods was primarily due to lower sales of Flip Video camera products in connection with our decision in fiscal 2011 to exit this consumer product line. 55 Table of Contents Net Service Sales by Segment The following table presents the breakdown of service revenue by segment (in millions, except percentages): Years Ended July 28, 2012 July 30, 2011 Variance in Dollars Variance in Percent July 30, 2011 July 31, 2010 Variance in Dollars Variance in Percent Net service sales: Americas $ 6,333 $ 5,723 $ 610 10.7 % $ 5,723 $ 5,094 $ 629 12.3 % Percentage of net service sales 65.0 % 65.8 % 65.8 % 66.9 % EMEA 2,051 1,816 235 12.9 % 1,816 1,602 214 13.4 % Percentage of net service sales 21.1 % 20.9 % 20.9 % 21.0 % APJC 1,351 1,153 198 17.2 % 1,153 924 229 24.8 % Percentage of net service sales 13.9 % 13.3 % 13.3 % 12.1 % Total $ 9,735 $ 8,692 $ 1,043 12.0 % $ 8,692 $ 7,620 $ 1,072 14.1 % Fiscal 2012 Compared with Fiscal 2011 For fiscal 2012, as compared with fiscal 2011, service revenue experienced double-digit percentage growth across all of our geographic segments. Worldwide technical support services revenue increased by 10%, and worldwide advanced services, which relates to consulting support services for specific network needs, experienced 20% revenue growth. Technical support services revenue grew across all of our geographic segments, with strong revenue growth in our EMEA and APJC segments. Renewals and technical support service contract initiations associated with recent product sales have resulted in a new installed base of equipment being serviced, which was the primary driver for these increases. Advanced services revenue also grew across all geographic segments, with particularly strong growth in APJC. The APJC revenue growth in advanced services was led by strength in the second half of fiscal 2012 and was driven by both subscription growth and transaction growth, which was in part the result of the completion of several large, multiyear projects in this region. Fiscal 2011 Compared with Fiscal 2010 Net service revenue increased across all of our geographic segments, with APJC reporting strong revenue growth. Technical support services revenue increased 12%, and advanced services experienced 21% revenue growth. Technical support service revenue increased across all of our geographic segments, with particular strength in APJC. Growth in each of our Americas and EMEA segments also contributed to the overall technical support service revenue growth. We experienced revenue growth in advanced services across each of our geographic segments, with strong growth in our APJC and EMEA segments, followed by growth in our Americas segment. Total service revenue growth also benefited from a full year of service revenue attributable to our acquisitions of Tandberg and Starent during fiscal 2010. Gross Margin The following table presents the gross margin for products and services (in millions, except percentages): AMOUNT PERCENTAGE Years Ended July 28, 2012 July 30, 2011 July 31, 2010 July 28, 2012 July 30, 2011 July 31, 2010 Gross margin: Product $ 21,821 $ 20,879 $ 20,800 60.1 % 60.5 % 64.2 % Service 6,388 5,657 4,843 65.6 % 65.1 % 63.6 % Total $ 28,209 $ 26,536 $ 25,643 61.2 % 61.4 % 64.0 % 56 Table of Contents Product Gross Margin Fiscal 2012 Compared with Fiscal 2011 The following table summarizes the key factors that contributed to the change in product gross margin percentage from fiscal 2011 to fiscal 2012: Product Gross Margin Percentage Fiscal 2011 60.5 % Sales discounts, rebates, and product pricing (2.8 )% Mix of products sold (0.6 )% Overall manufacturing costs 1.7 % Restructuring and other charges 0.5 % Shipment volume, net of certain variable costs 0.5 % Amortization of purchased intangible assets 0.3 % Fiscal 2012 60.1 % In fiscal 2012, product gross margin decreased by 0.4 percentage points compared with fiscal 2011. The decrease was primarily due to the impact of higher sales discounts, rebates, and unfavorable product pricing, which were driven by normal market factors and by the geographic mix of net product sales. These factors impacted most of our customer markets and all of our geographic segments. Additionally, our product gross margin for fiscal 2012 was negatively impacted by the shift in the mix of products sold, primarily as a result of sales increases in our relatively lower margin Cisco Unified Computing System products and increased sales in other lower margin products. In fiscal 2012, we experienced a positive mix impact from the absence of the lower margin consumer related products due to our exit from the Flip Video camera product line in fiscal 2011. The negative impacts to product gross margin were partially offset by lower overall manufacturing costs, higher shipment volume, lower restructuring charges, the absence of significant impairment charges related to purchased intangible assets, and lower amortization expense in fiscal 2012. The lower overall manufacturing costs were in part due to increased benefits from our value engineering efforts, particularly in certain of our Switching products; favorable component pricing; and continued operational efficiency in manufacturing operations. Value engineering is the process by which production costs are reduced through component redesign, board configuration, test processes, and transformation processes. Our future gross margins could be impacted by our product mix and by further growth in sales of products that have lower gross margins, such as Cisco Unified Computing System products. Our gross margins may also be impacted by the geographic mix of our revenue or, as was the case in fiscal 2012 and 2011, by increased sales discounts, rebates, and product pricing, which may be attributable to competitive factors. Additionally, our manufacturing-related costs may be negatively impacted by constraints in our supply chain. If any of the preceding factors that impact our gross margins are adversely affected in future periods, our product and service gross margins could continue to decline. 57 Table of Contents Fiscal 2011 Compared with Fiscal 2010 The following table summarizes the key factors that contributed to the change in product gross margin percentage from fiscal 2010 to fiscal 2011: Product Gross Margin Percentage Fiscal 2010 64.2 % Sales discounts, rebates, and product pricing (2.9 )% Mix of products sold (1.6 )% Amortization of purchased intangible assets (0.6 )% Restructuring and other charges (0.4 )% Overall manufacturing costs 1.4 % Shipment volume, net of certain variable costs 0.4 % Fiscal 2011 60.5 % In fiscal 2011, product gross margin decreased by 3.7 percentage points. The decrease was primarily due to the impact of higher sales discounts, rebates, and unfavorable product pricing, which were driven by normal market factors and by the geographic mix of product revenue. These factors impacted most of our customer markets and all of our geographic segments. Additionally, our product gross margin was negatively impacted by the shift in the mix of products sold as a result of revenue declines in our higher margin switching products coupled with revenue increases from our lower margin Cisco Unified Computing System products. Higher year-over-year impairment charges related to acquisition-related intangible assets and higher restructuring and other charges, both primarily in the consumer business, also contributed to the decline in our product gross margin percentage. These negative factors were partially offset by lower overall manufacturing costs and by slightly higher shipment volume. The lower overall manufacturing costs were in part due to favorable component pricing, continued operational efficiency in manufacturing operations, and value engineering. Service Gross Margin Fiscal 2012 Compared with Fiscal 2011 Our service gross margin percentage increased by 0.5 percentage points for fiscal 2012, as compared with fiscal 2011. The increase was primarily due to higher sales volume for both technical support services and advanced services. The benefit to gross margin of increased volume was partially offset by increased headcount-related and partner delivery costs, and unfavorable mix. The mix impacts were due to our lower gross margin advanced services revenue contributing a higher proportion of service revenue for fiscal 2012, as compared with the prior year. Lower share-based compensation expense in fiscal 2012 as compared with fiscal 2011 also added to the increase in service gross margin. For fiscal 2012, as compared with fiscal 2011, gross margin from technical support services was flat as the benefits from a 10% increase in revenue combined with lower supply chain costs were offset by higher headcount-related costs. For fiscal 2012, as compared with fiscal 2011, gross margin in advanced services increased primarily due to a 20% increase in revenue in fiscal 2012. Partially offsetting the volume benefit were higher delivery team costs which were, in part headcount related, and higher partner delivery costs. Our revenue from advanced services may increase to a higher proportion of total service revenue due to our continued focus on providing comprehensive support to our customers networking devices, applications, and infrastructures. Our service gross margin normally experiences some fluctuations due to various factors such as the timing of contract initiations in our renewals, our strategic investments in headcount, and the resources we deploy to support the overall service business. Other factors include the mix of service offerings, as the gross margin from our advanced services is typically lower than the gross margin from technical support services. 58 Table of Contents Fiscal 2011 Compared with Fiscal 2010 Our service gross margin percentage increased by 1.5 percentage points for fiscal 2011, as compared with fiscal 2010, with both technical support services and advanced services experiencing higher gross margins. The increase was primarily due to higher sales volume. Partially offsetting the volume increases were unfavorable mix impacts, primarily due to advanced services representing a higher proportion of service revenue in fiscal 2011 and due to increased service delivery costs. Gross margin in technical support services increased primarily as a result of increased sales volume and lower headcount-related cost impacts. These benefits were partially offset by increased support service delivery costs, particularly from outside services. Advanced services gross margin increased primarily due to strong volume growth partially offset by higher delivery team costs, which were partially headcount related. Gross Margin by Segment The following table presents the total gross margin for each segment (in millions, except percentages): AMOUNT PERCENTAGE Years Ended July 28, 2012 July 30, 2011 July 31, 2010 July 28, 2012 July 30, 2011 July 31, 2010 Gross margin: Americas $ 16,639 $ 15,766 $ 15,042 62.8 % 63.0 % 64.5 % EMEA 7,605 7,452 7,235 63.0 % 64.2 % 66.8 % APJC 4,519 4,143 3,842 60.4 % 62.8 % 65.3 % Segment total 28,763 27,361 26,119 62.4 % 63.3 % 65.2 % Unallocated corporate items (1) (554 ) (825 ) (476 ) Total $ 28,209 $ 26,536 $ 25,643 61.2 % 61.4 % 64.0 % (1) The unallocated corporate items include the effects of amortization and impairments of acquisition-related intangible assets, share-based compensation expense, and other asset impairments and restructuring. We do not allocate these items to the gross margin for each segment because management does not include such information in measuring the performance of the operating segments. The decrease in fiscal 2012 amounts is primarily due to the absence in fiscal 2012 of significant restructuring and acquisition-related intangible asset impairments that were recognized in fiscal 2011. Fiscal 2012 Compared with Fiscal 2011 For fiscal 2012, we experienced a gross margin percentage decline across all of our geographic segments as compared with fiscal 2011. The Americas segment experienced a slight gross margin percentage decline with the impact of higher sales discounts, rebates and unfavorable pricing being substantially offset by higher volume, higher service gross margin, lower overall manufacturing and delivery costs, and favorable mix impacts. Significantly lower sales to the consumer market resulted in a positive gross margin mix impact to the Americas segment for fiscal 2012. The gross margin percentage decline in our EMEA segment was primarily the result of unfavorable mix impacts; higher sales discounts, rebates and unfavorable pricing; and lower service gross margin due to increased headcount-related costs. These decreases were partially offset by lower overall manufacturing and delivery costs and increased volume in this segment. The APJC segment experienced the largest gross margin percentage decline of all of our geographic segments due primarily to the impact of higher sales discounts, rebates and unfavorable pricing, lower service gross margin, and unfavorable mix impacts. These decreases were partially offset by increased volume and lower overall manufacturing and delivery costs. 59 Table of Contents The gross margin percentage for a particular segment may fluctuate, and period-to-period changes in such percentages may or may not be indicative of a trend for that segment. Our product and service gross margins may be impacted by economic downturns or uncertain economic conditions as well as our movement into new market opportunities, and could decline if any of the factors that impact our gross margins are adversely affected in future periods. Fiscal 2011 Compared with Fiscal 2010 For fiscal 2011, as compared with fiscal 2010, the gross margin percentage across all geographic segments declined primarily due to higher sales discounts, rebates, and unfavorable pricing, as well as due to a product mix shift. These declines were partially offset by the impacts from increased shipment volume and lower overall manufacturing costs across all geographic segments. Factors That May Impact Net Sales and Gross Margin Net product sales may continue to be affected by factors, including global economic downturns and related market uncertainty, that have resulted in reduced IT-related capital spending in our enterprise, service provider, public sector, and commercial markets; changes in the geopolitical environment and global economic conditions; competition, including price-focused competitors from Asia, especially from China; new product introductions; sales cycles and product implementation cycles; changes in the mix of our customers between service provider and enterprise markets; changes in the mix of direct sales and indirect sales; variations in sales channels; and final acceptance criteria of the product, system, or solution as specified by the customer. Sales to the service provider market have been and may be in the future characterized by large and sporadic purchases, especially relating to our router sales and sales of certain products within our Collaboration and Data Center product categories. In addition, service provider customers typically have longer implementation cycles; require a broader range of services, including network design services; and often have acceptance provisions that can lead to a delay in revenue recognition. Certain of our customers in certain emerging countries also tend to make large and sporadic purchases, and the net sales related to these transactions may similarly be affected by the timing of revenue recognition. As we focus on new market opportunities, customers may require greater levels of financing arrangements, service, and support, especially in certain emerging countries, which in turn may result in a delay in the timing of revenue recognition. To improve customer satisfaction, we continue to focus on managing our manufacturing lead-time performance, which may result in corresponding reductions in order backlog. A decline in backlog levels could result in more variability and less predictability in our quarter-to-quarter net sales and operating results. Net product sales may also be adversely affected by fluctuations in demand for our products, especially with respect to telecommunications service providers and Internet businesses, whether or not driven by any slowdown in capital expenditures in the service provider market; price and product competition in the communications and information technology industry; introduction and market acceptance of new technologies and products; adoption of new networking standards; and financial difficulties experienced by our customers. We may, from time to time, experience manufacturing issues that create a delay in our suppliers ability to provide specific components, resulting in delayed shipments. To the extent that manufacturing issues and any related component shortages result in delayed shipments in the future, and particularly in periods when we and our suppliers are operating at higher levels of capacity, it is possible that revenue for a quarter could be adversely affected if such matters are not remediated within the same quarter. For additional factors that may impact net product sales, see Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors. Our distributors and retail partners participate in various cooperative marketing and other programs. Increased sales to our distributors and retail partners generally result in greater difficulty in forecasting the mix of our products and, to a certain degree, the timing of orders from our customers. We recognize revenue for sales to our distributors and retail partners generally based on a sell-through method using information provided by them, and we maintain estimated accruals and allowances for all cooperative marketing and other programs. 60 Table of Contents Product gross margin may be adversely affected in the future by changes in the mix of products sold, including periods of increased growth of some of our lower margin products; introduction of new products, including products with price-performance advantages; our ability to reduce production costs; entry into new markets, including markets with different pricing structures and cost structures, as a result of internal development or through acquisitions; changes in distribution channels; price competition, including competitors from Asia, especially those from China; changes in geographic mix of our product sales; the timing of revenue recognition and revenue deferrals; sales discounts; increases in material or labor costs, including share-based compensation expense; excess inventory and obsolescence charges; warranty costs; changes in shipment volume; loss of cost savings due to changes in component pricing; effects of value engineering; inventory holding charges; and the extent to which we successfully execute on our strategy and operating plans. Additionally, our manufacturing-related costs may be negatively impacted by constraints in our supply chain. Service gross margin may be impacted by various factors such as the change in mix between technical support services and advanced services; the timing of technical support service contract initiations and renewals; share-based compensation expense; and the timing of our strategic investments in headcount and resources to support this business. Research and Development ( R&D ), Sales and Marketing, and General and Administrative ( G&A ) Expenses R&D, sales and marketing, and G&A expenses are summarized in the following table (in millions, except percentages): Years Ended July 28, 2012 July 30, 2011 Variance in Dollars Variance in Percent July 30, 2011 July 31, 2010 Variance in Dollars Variance in Percent Research and development $ 5,488 $ 5,823 $ (335 ) (5.8 )% $ 5,823 $ 5,273 $ 550 10.4 % Percentage of net sales 11.9 % 13.5 % 13.5 % 13.2 % Sales and marketing 9,647 9,812 (165 ) (1.7 )% 9,812 8,782 1,030 11.7 % Percentage of net sales 20.9 % 22.7 % 22.7 % 21.9 % General and administrative 2,322 1,908 414 21.7 % 1,908 1,933 (25 ) (1.3 )% Percentage of net sales 5.0 % 4.4 % 4.4 % 4.8 % Total $ 17,457 $ 17,543 $ (86 ) (0.5 )% $ 17,543 $ 15,988 $ 1,555 9.7 % Percentage of net sales 37.9 % 40.6 % 40.6 % 39.9 % Fiscal 2010 had an extra week compared with fiscal 2011. We estimate that the extra week contributed approximately $150 million of additional research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expense in fiscal 2010. R&D Expenses Fiscal 2012 Compared with Fiscal 2011 The decrease in R&D expenses for fiscal 2012, as compared with fiscal 2011, was primarily due to lower headcount-related expenses resulting from our restructuring actions initiated in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 and lower share-based compensation expense. Additionally, R&D expenses declined due to lower acquisition-related expenses, which was driven by the absence in fiscal 2012 of certain compensation payments that were paid in the prior year. We continue to invest in R&D in order to bring a broad range of products to market in a timely fashion. If we believe that we are unable to enter a particular market in a timely manner with internally developed products, we may purchase or license technology from other businesses, or we may partner with or acquire businesses as an alternative to internal R&D. 61 Table of Contents Fiscal 2011 Compared with Fiscal 2010 The increase in R&D expenses for fiscal 2011, as compared with fiscal 2010, was primarily due to higher headcount-related expenses, higher contracted services, and increased depreciation and equipment expenditures. The increase in depreciation expense was partially acquisition related. Sales and Marketing Expenses Fiscal 2012 Compared with Fiscal 2011 For fiscal 2012, as compared with fiscal 2011, sales and marketing expenses decreased by $165 million. Marketing expenses decreased by $204 million, which were partially offset by an increase of $39 million in sales expenses. The decrease in marketing expenses for the period was due to lower advertisement expenses, lower headcount-related expenses, and lower share-based compensation expense. The increase in sales expenses was due primarily to higher project related services, partially offset by lower headcount-related expenses and lower share-based compensation expense. The decline in headcount related expenses for both sales and marketing was in part attributable to our restructuring actions initiated in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. Fiscal 2011 Compared with Fiscal 2010 Sales and marketing expenses for fiscal 2011 increased compared with fiscal 2010 due to an increase of $851 million in sales expenses and an increase of $179 million in marketing expenses. Both the sales expense and the marketing expense components of the category increased for fiscal 2011 due to higher headcount-related expenses, as well as higher outside services costs, higher depreciation expense, and increased share-based compensation expense. Additionally, marketing expenses for fiscal 2011 increased due to higher advertisement expenses. G&A Expenses Fiscal 2012 Compared with Fiscal 2011 G&A expenses increased in fiscal 2012, as compared with fiscal 2011, primarily due to a net increase of approximately $300 million in real estate charges primarily for impairments on real estate held for sale, followed by other increased corporate-level expenses. The increase in real estate charges in fiscal 2012 was primarily due to charges of $202 million recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012. These increased corporate-level expenses, which tend to vary from period to period, include increases related to our operational infrastructure such as real estate; IT project implementations, which include further investments in our global data center infrastructure, and investments related to operational and financial systems. Partially offsetting these increases were lower share-based compensation expense, and lower headcount-related expenses due to the restructuring actions initiated in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. Fiscal 2011 Compared with Fiscal 2010 The decrease in G&A expenses in fiscal 2011, as compared with fiscal 2010, was due to lower real estate charges in fiscal 2011 and the absence of non-income tax-related expenses (such as fees and licenses), which were included in fiscal 2010. Partially offsetting these items were higher headcount-related expenses, higher outside services costs for operational support areas, and increased equipment, depreciation, and rent expenses. Effect of Foreign Currency In fiscal 2012, foreign currency fluctuations, net of hedging, increased the combined R&D, sales and marketing, and G&A expenses by $90 million, or approximately 0.5%, compared with fiscal 2011. In fiscal 2011, foreign currency fluctuations, net of hedging, increased the combined R&D, sales and marketing, and G&A expenses by $53 million, or approximately 0.3%, compared with fiscal 2010. 62 Table of Contents Headcount Fiscal 2012 Compared with Fiscal 2011 Our headcount decreased by 5,186 employees in fiscal 2012. The decrease was attributable to headcount reductions from the completion of the sale of our Juarez, Mexico manufacturing operations and from our restructuring actions initiated in July 2011. Partially offsetting these declines in headcount were headcount increases due to the growth of our service business and targeted hiring in engineering, which includes the hiring of recent university graduates. Fiscal 2011 Compared with Fiscal 2010 For fiscal 2011, our headcount increased by 1,111 employees, the increase being attributable to targeted hiring as part of our investment in growth initiatives, partially offset by the impacts of our voluntary early retirement program and our restructuring activities, which began to reduce our headcount in late fiscal 2011. Share-Based Compensation Expense The following table presents share-based compensation expense (in millions): Years Ended July 28, 2012 July 30, 2011 July 31, 2010 Cost of sales product $ 53 $ 61 $ 57 Cost of sales service 156 177 164 Share-based compensation expense in cost of sales 209 238 221 Research and development 401 481 450 Sales and marketing 588 651 602 General and administrative 203 250 244 Share-based compensation expense in operating expenses 1,192 1,382 1,296 Total share-based compensation expense $ 1,401 $ 1,620 $ 1,517 The year-over-year decrease in share-based compensation expense for fiscal 2012, as compared with fiscal 2011, was due primarily to a decrease in the aggregate value of share-based awards granted in recent periods, the timing of the annual grants to employees in fiscal 2012, and stock options awards from prior years becoming fully amortized and replaced with restricted stock units with a lower aggregate value. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The increase in share-based compensation expense for fiscal 2011, as compared with fiscal 2010, was due primarily to a change in vesting periods from five to four years for awards granted beginning in fiscal 2009, the timing of annual employee grants, and the overall growth in headcount and number of share-based awards granted on a year-over-year basis. Amortization of Purchased Intangible Assets The following table presents the amortization of purchased intangible assets included in operating expenses (in millions): Years Ended July 28, 2012 July 30, 2011 July 31, 2010 Amortization of purchased intangible assets included in operating expenses $ 383 $ 520 $ 491 The decrease in amortization of purchased intangible assets for fiscal 2012, compared with fiscal 2011, was primarily due to the absence of significant impairment charges during fiscal 2012 and also due to certain purchased intangible assets having become fully amortized or impaired in fiscal 2011. For fiscal 2011, as 63 Table of Contents compared with fiscal 2010, the increase in the amortization of purchased intangible assets was due to impairment charges included in operating expenses of $92 million, partially offset by lower amortization due to certain purchased intangible assets having become fully amortized. The impairment charges in fiscal 2011 were primarily due to declines in estimated fair value as a result of reductions in expected future cash flows associated with certain of our consumer products. For additional information regarding purchased intangible assets, see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The fair value of acquired technology and patents, as well as acquired technology under development, is determined at acquisition date primarily using the income approach, which discounts expected future cash flows to present value. The discount rates used in the present value calculations are typically derived from a weighted-average cost of capital analysis and then adjusted to reflect risks inherent in the development lifecycle as appropriate. We consider the pricing model for products related to these acquisitions to be standard within the high-technology communications industry, and the applicable discount rates represent the rates that market participants would use for valuation of such intangible assets. Restructuring and Other Charges In fiscal 2012, we incurred within operating expenses net restructuring and other charges of approximately $304 million, consisting of $250 million of employee severance charges for employees subject to our workforce reduction and $54 million of other restructuring charges. In fiscal 2011, we incurred within operating expenses restructuring charges of $799 million. These charges included $453 million related to a voluntary early retirement program for eligible employees in the United States and Canada; $247 million related to employee severance for other employees subject to our reduction of our work force; and $71 million related to the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, primarily as a result of the sale of our Juarez, Mexico manufacturing operations. We also recorded charges within operating expenses of $28 million related to the consolidation of excess facilities and other activities. Operating Income The following table presents our operating income and our operating income as percentage of revenue (in millions, except percentages): Years Ended July 28, 2012 July 30, 2011 July 31, 2010 Operating income $ 10,065 $ 7,674 $ 9,164 Operating income as a percentage of revenue 21.9 % 17.8 % 22.9 % In fiscal 2012, as compared with fiscal 2011, our results reflect solid execution on delivering profitable growth, as we grew operating income faster than revenue. Operating income increased by 31%, as a percentage of revenue operating income increased by 4.1 percentage points. The increase resulted from: revenue growth of 7%; effective expense management that resulted in lower total R&D, sales and marketing, and G&A expenses as a percentage of revenue; lower amortization of purchased intangible assets; lower restructuring and other charges; and lower share-based compensation expense. In fiscal 2011, as compared with fiscal 2010, operating income as a percentage of revenue decreased by 5.1 percentage points. The decrease was primarily the result of the following: a 2.6 percentage point decrease in gross margin; higher total R&D, sales and marketing, and G&A expenses as a percentage of revenue; and restructuring and other charges of $799 million. 64 Table of Contents Interest and Other Income, Net Interest Income (Expense), Net The following table summarizes interest income and interest expense (in millions): Years Ended July 28, 2012 July 30, 2011 Variance in Dollars July 30, 2011 July 31, 2010 Variance in Dollars Interest income $ 650 $ 641 $ 9 $ 641 $ 635 $ 6 Interest expense (596 ) (628 ) 32 (628 ) (623 ) (5 ) Interest income (expense), net $ 54 $ 13 $ 41 $ 13 $ 12 $ 1 Fiscal 2012 Compared with Fiscal 2011 Interest income increased slightly in fiscal 2012 as compared with fiscal 2011. The slight increase was due to increased income from financing receivables, partially offset by the effect of lower average interest rates on our portfolio of cash, cash equivalents, and fixed income investments. The decrease in interest expense in fiscal 2012, as compared with fiscal 2011, was attributable to the effect of lower average interest rates on our debt due to favorable hedging impacts. Fiscal 2011 Compared with Fiscal 2010 Interest income increased slightly in fiscal 2011 due to increased income from financing receivables, partially offset by the effect of lower average interest rates on our portfolio of cash, cash equivalents, and fixed income investments. The increase in interest expense in fiscal 2011, as compared with fiscal 2010, was due to higher average debt balances during fiscal 2011 attributable to our senior debt issuance in March 2011. Partially offsetting the impact of higher average debt balances during fiscal 2011 is the effect of lower average interest rates on our debt during fiscal 2011. Other Income, Net The components of other income, net, are summarized as follows (in millions): Years Ended July 28, 2012 July 30, 2011 Variance in Dollars July 30, 2011 July 31, 2010 Variance in Dollars Gains (losses) on investments, net: Publicly traded equity securities $ 43 $ 88 $ (45 ) $ 88 $ 66 $ 22 Fixed income securities 58 91 (33 ) 91 103 (12 ) Total available-for-sale investments 101 179 (78 ) 179 169 10 Privately held companies (70 ) 34 (104 ) 34 54 (20 ) Net gains on investments 31 213 (182 ) 213 223 (10 ) Other gains (losses), net 9 (75 ) 84 (75 ) 16 (91 ) Other income, net $ 40 $ 138 $ (98 ) $ 138 $ 239 $ (101 ) Fiscal 2012 Compared with Fiscal 2011 The decrease in total net gains on available-for-sale investments in fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011 was attributable to lower gains on fixed income and publicly traded equity securities in fiscal 2012 as a result of market conditions and the timing of sales of these securities. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the unrealized gains and losses on investments. For fiscal 2012 as compared with fiscal 2011, the change in net (losses) gains on investments in privately held companies was primarily due to equity method losses related to our proportional share of losses from our VCE joint venture increasing by $84 million for fiscal 2012. The change in other gains and (losses), net for fiscal 2012 as compared with fiscal 2011, was primarily due to more favorable foreign exchange impacts in fiscal 2012. 65 Table of Contents Fiscal 2011 Compared with Fiscal 2010 The increase in total net gains on available-for-sale investments in fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 was primarily attributable to higher gains on publicly traded equity securities, partially offset by lower gains on fixed income securities in fiscal 2011. These changes were the result of market conditions and the timing of sales of these securities. For fiscal 2011 as compared with fiscal 2010, the decline in net gains on investments in privately held companies was due to lower net equity method gains and lower gains on sales. The decline was partially offset by lower impairment charges on investments in privately held companies. Impairment charges on investments in privately held companies were $10 million and $25 million for fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively. The change in other gains and (losses), net for fiscal 2011 as compared with fiscal 2010, was primarily due to fiscal 2011 experiencing lower gains from customer lease terminations, higher donations expense, and unfavorable foreign exchange impacts. Provision for Income Taxes Our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely impacted by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates. Our provision for income taxes does not include provisions for U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes associated with the repatriation of undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that we intend to reinvest indefinitely in our foreign subsidiaries. If these earnings were distributed to the United States in the form of dividends or otherwise, or if the shares of the relevant foreign subsidiaries were sold or otherwise transferred, we would be subject to additional U.S. income taxes (subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits) and foreign withholding taxes. Further, as a result of certain of our ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments, our income in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates and in some cases is wholly exempt from tax. Our failure to meet these commitments could adversely impact our provision for income taxes. Fiscal 2012 Compared with Fiscal 2011 The provision for income taxes resulted in an effective tax rate of 20.8% for fiscal 2012, compared with 17.1% for fiscal 2011. The net 3.7 percentage point increase in the effective tax rate between fiscal years was attributable to a smaller proportion of net income which was subject to foreign income tax rates that are lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% and the expiration of the U.S. federal R&D tax credit on December 31, 2011, partially offset by other items including a reduction in state taxes. For a full reconciliation of our effective tax rate to the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% and for further explanation of our provision for income taxes, see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Fiscal 2011 Compared with Fiscal 2010 The provision for income taxes resulted in an effective tax rate of 17.1% for fiscal 2011, compared with 17.5% for fiscal 2010. During fiscal 2010, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (the Ninth Circuit ) withdrew its prior holding and reaffirmed the 2005 U.S. Tax Court ruling in Xilinx, Inc. v. Commissioner . The net 0.4 percentage point decrease in the effective tax rate between fiscal years was attributable to the absence in fiscal 2011 of this tax benefit of $158 million, or 1.7 percentage points, offset by other items including the tax benefit of $188 million, or 2.5 percentage points, related to the retroactive reinstatement of the U.S. federal R&D credit. 66 Table of Contents LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The following sections discuss the effects of changes in our balance sheet, contractual obligations, other commitments, and the stock repurchase program on our liquidity and capital resources. Balance Sheet and Cash Flows Cash and Cash Equivalents and Investments The following table summarizes our cash and cash equivalents and investments (in millions): July 28, 2012 July 30, 2011 Increase Cash and cash equivalents $ 9,799 $ 7,662 $ 2,137 Fixed income securities 37,297 35,562 1,735 Publicly traded equity securities 1,620 1,361 259 Total $ 48,716 $ 44,585 $ 4,131 The increase in cash and cash equivalents and investments was primarily the result of cash provided by operations of $11.5 billion, an increase from $10.1 billion in fiscal 2011. Significant uses of cash in fiscal 2012 included the repurchase of common stock (net of the issuance of common stock related to employee stock incentive plans) of $3.4 billion, cash dividends paid of $1.5 billion, capital expenditures of $1.1 billion, and the pay-down of short-term debt of $557 million. The increase in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2012 as compared with fiscal 2011 was primarily the result of an increase in net income and a smaller increase in financing receivables in fiscal 2012. Our total in cash and cash equivalents and investments held by various foreign subsidiaries was $42.5 billion and $39.8 billion as of July 28, 2012 and July 30, 2011, respectively. Under current tax laws and regulations, if cash and cash equivalents and investments held outside the United States were to be distributed to the United States in the form of dividends or otherwise, we would be subject to additional U.S. income taxes (subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits) and foreign withholding taxes. The balance available in the United States as of July 28, 2012 and July 30, 2011 was $6.2 billion and $4.8 billion, respectively. On July 30, 2012, subsequent to year end, we completed our acquisition of NDS Group Limited, which reduced our current balance of cash and cash equivalents and investments held by various foreign subsidiaries by approximately $5.0 billion. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. We classify our investments as short-term investments based on their nature and their availability for use in current operations. We believe the overall credit quality of our portfolio is strong, with our cash equivalents and our fixed income investment portfolio consisting primarily of high quality investment-grade securities. We believe that our strong cash and cash equivalents and investments position allows us to use our cash resources for strategic investments to gain access to new technologies, for acquisitions, for customer financing activities, for working capital needs, and for the repurchase of shares of common stock and payment of dividends. We expect that cash provided by operating activities may fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors, including fluctuations in our operating results, the rate at which products are shipped during the quarter (which we refer to as shipment linearity), the timing and collection of accounts receivable and financing receivables, inventory and supply chain management, deferred revenue, excess tax benefits resulting from share-based compensation, and the timing and amount of tax and other payments. For additional discussion, see Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in this report. 67 Table of Contents Accounts Receivable, Net The following table summarizes our accounts receivable, net (in millions), and DSO: July 28, 2012 July 30, 2011 Decrease Accounts receivable, net $ 4,369 $ 4,698 $ (329 ) DSO 34 38 (4 ) Our accounts receivable net, as of July 28, 2012 decreased by approximately 7% compared with the end of fiscal 2011. Our DSO as of July 28, 2012 was lower by 4 days compared with the end of fiscal 2011. The decrease in DSO was due to an improvement in shipment linearity during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, compared with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. Services billings have traditionally had the effect of increasing DSO due in part to the timing of billings, which in comparison to product billings, have a larger proportion billed in the latter part of the quarter. Given various factors such as our business mix, linearity, and the growth of our service business, going forward we expect DSO to continue to be in the range of 30 to 40 days. Inventory Supply Chain The following table summarizes our inventories and purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers (in millions, except annualized inventory turns): July 28, 2012 July 30, 2011 Increase (Decrease) Inventories $ 1,663 $ 1,486 $ 177 Annualized inventory turns 11.7 11.8 (0.1 ) Purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers $ 3,869 $ 4,313 $ (444 ) Inventory as of July 28, 2012 increased by 12% from our inventory balance at the end of fiscal 2011, and for the same period purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers declined by approximately 10%. On a combined basis, inventories and purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers decreased by 5% compared with the end of fiscal 2011. The inventory increase was due to higher levels of manufactured finished goods in support of current order activity. The decline in purchase commitments in fiscal 2012, as compared to fiscal 2011, was due to the increased commitments we made in fiscal 2011 to secure our near-term supply needs as a result of supply constraints resulting from the earthquake in Japan. We believe our inventory and purchase commitments levels are in line with our current demand forecasts. Our finished goods consist of distributor inventory and deferred cost of sales and manufactured finished goods. Distributor inventory and deferred cost of sales are related to unrecognized revenue on shipments to distributors and retail partners as well as shipments to customers. Manufactured finished goods consist primarily of build-to-order and build-to-stock products. We purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products. During the normal course of business, in order to manage manufacturing lead times and help ensure adequate component supply, we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers that allow them to procure inventory based upon criteria as defined by us or that establish the parameters defining our requirements and our commitment to securing manufacturing capacity. A significant portion of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements are firm, noncancelable, and unconditional commitments. In certain instances, these agreements allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed. Our purchase commitments are for short-term product manufacturing requirements as well as for commitments to suppliers to secure manufacturing capacity. 68 Table of Contents We record a liability, included in other current liabilities, for firm, noncancelable, and unconditional purchase commitments for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with the valuation of our excess and obsolete inventory. The purchase commitments for inventory are expected to be primarily fulfilled within one year. Inventory and supply chain management remain areas of focus as we balance the need to maintain supply chain flexibility to help ensure competitive lead times with the risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements. We believe the amount of our inventory and purchase commitments is appropriate for our revenue levels. Financing Receivables and Guarantees We measure our net balance sheet exposure position related to our financing receivables and financing guarantees by reducing the total of gross financing receivables and financing guarantees by the associated allowances for credit loss and deferred revenue. As of July 28, 2012, our net balance sheet exposure position related to financing receivables and financing guarantees was as follows (in millions): FINANCING RECEIVABLES FINANCING GUARANTEES TOTAL July 28, 2012 Lease Receivables Loan Receivables Financed Service Contracts and Other Total Channel Partner End-User Customers Total Gross amount less unearned income $ 3,179 $ 1,796 $ 2,651 $ 7,626 $ 277 $ 232 $ 509 $ 8,135 Allowance for credit loss (247 ) (122 ) (11 ) (380 ) (380 ) Deferred revenue (71 ) (98 ) (1,838 ) (2,007 ) (193 ) (200 ) (393 ) (2,400 ) Net balance sheet exposure $ 2,861 $ 1,576 $ 802 $ 5,239 $ 84 $ 32 $ 116 $ 5,355 Financing Receivables Gross financing receivables less unearned income increased by 9% compared with the end of fiscal 2011. The change was primarily due to a 22% increase in loan receivables and an 11% increase in lease receivables. Gross financed service contracts and other increased by 1% compared with the end of fiscal 2011. We provide financing to certain end-user customers and channel partners to enable sales of our products, services, and networking solutions. These financing arrangements include leases, financed service contracts, and loans. Arrangements related to leases are generally collateralized by a security interest in the underlying assets. Lease receivables include sales-type and direct-financing leases. We also provide certain qualified customers financing for long-term service contracts, which primarily relate to technical support services and advanced services. Our loan financing arrangements may include not only financing the acquisition of our products and services but also providing additional funds for other costs associated with network installation and integration of our products and services. We expect to continue to expand the use of our financing programs in the near term. Financing Guarantees In the normal course of business, third parties may provide financing arrangements to our customers and channel partners under financing programs. The financing arrangements to customers provided by third parties are related to leases and loans and typically have terms of up to three years. In some cases, we provide guarantees to third parties for these lease and loan arrangements. The financing arrangements to channel partners consist of revolving short-term financing provided by third parties, generally with payment terms ranging from 60 to 90 days. In certain instances, these financing arrangements result in a transfer of our receivables to the third party. The receivables are de-recognized upon transfer, as these transfers qualify as true sales, and we receive payments for the receivables from the third party based on our standard payment terms. These financing arrangements facilitate the working capital requirements of the channel partners, and in some cases, we guarantee a portion of these arrangements. We could be called upon to make payments under these guarantees in the event of nonpayment by the channel partners or end-user customers. Historically, our payments under these arrangements have been immaterial. Where we provide a guarantee, we defer the revenue associated with the channel partner and end-user financing arrangement in accordance with revenue recognition policies, or we record a liability for the fair value of the guarantees. In either case, the deferred revenue is recognized as revenue when the guarantee is removed. 69 Table of Contents Deferred Revenue Related to Financing Receivables and Guarantees The majority of the deferred revenue in the preceding table is related to financed service contracts. The majority of the revenue related to financed service contracts, which primarily relates to technical support services, is deferred as the revenue related to financed service contracts is recognized ratably over the period during which the related services are to be performed. A portion of the revenue related to lease and loan receivables is also deferred and included in deferred product revenue based on revenue recognition criteria not currently having been met. Borrowings Senior Notes The following table summarizes the principal amount of our senior notes (in millions): July 28, 2012 July 30, 2011 Senior notes: Floating-rate notes, due 2014 $ 1,250 $ 1,250 1.625% fixed-rate notes, due 2014 2,000 2,000 2.90% fixed-rate notes, due 2014 500 500 5.50% fixed-rate notes, due 2016 3,000 3,000 3.15% fixed-rate notes, due 2017 750 750 4.95% fixed-rate notes, due 2019 2,000 2,000 4.45% fixed-rate notes, due 2020 2,500 2,500 5.90% fixed-rate notes, due 2039 2,000 2,000 5.50% fixed-rate notes, due 2040 2,000 2,000 Total $ 16,000 $ 16,000 Interest is payable semiannually on each class of the senior fixed-rate notes, each of which is redeemable by us at any time, subject to a make-whole premium. Interest is payable quarterly on the floating-rate notes. We were in compliance with all debt covenants as of July 28, 2012. Commercial Paper In fiscal 2011 we established a short-term debt financing program of up to $3.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper notes. As of July 28, 2012, we had no commercial paper outstanding under this program. As of July 30, 2011, we had commercial paper notes of $500 million outstanding under this program. Other Notes and Borrowings Other notes and borrowings include notes and credit facilities with a number of financial institutions that are available to certain of our foreign subsidiaries. The amount of borrowings outstanding under these arrangements was $31 million and $88 million as of July 28, 2012 and July 30, 2011, respectively. Credit Facility On February 17, 2012, we terminated our then-existing credit facility and entered into a credit agreement with certain institutional lenders that provides for a $3.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that is scheduled to expire on February 17, 2017. Any advances under the credit agreement will accrue interest at rates that are equal to, based on certain conditions, either (i) the higher of the Federal Funds rate plus 0.50%, Bank of America prime rate as announced from time to time or one-month LIBOR plus 1.00%, or (ii) LIBOR plus a margin that is based on our senior debt credit ratings as published by Standard & Poor Financial Services, LLC and Moody Investors Service, Inc. The credit agreement requires that we comply with certain covenants, including that we maintain an interest coverage ratio as defined in the agreement. As of July 28, 2012, we were in compliance with the required interest coverage ratio and the other covenants and we had not borrowed any funds under the credit facility. We may also, upon the agreement of either the then-existing lenders or additional lenders not currently parties to the agreement, increase the commitments under the credit facility by up to an additional $2.0 billion and/or extend the expiration date of the credit facility up to February 17, 2019. 70 Table of Contents Deferred Revenue The following table presents the breakdown of deferred revenue (in millions): July 28, 2012 July 30, 2011 Increase (Decrease) Service $ 9,173 $ 8,521 $ 652 Product 3,707 3,686 21 Total $ 12,880 $ 12,207 $ 673 Reported as: Current $ 8,852 $ 8,025 $ 827 Noncurrent 4,028 4,182 (154 ) Total $ 12,880 $ 12,207 $ 673 The 8% increase in deferred service revenue in fiscal 2012 reflects the impact of new contract initiations and renewals, partially offset by the ongoing amortization of deferred service revenue. The slight increase in deferred product revenue was due to increased deferrals related to subscription revenue arrangements and, to a lesser extent, higher two-tier deferred revenue which was due to improved shipment linearity to two-tier partners during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012. This increase was partially offset by decreased deferred revenue related to our financing arrangements. Contractual Obligations The impact of contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be analyzed in conjunction with the factors that impact our cash flows from operations discussed previously. In addition, we plan for and measure our liquidity and capital resources through an annual budgeting process. The following table summarizes our contractual obligations at July 28, 2012 (in millions): PAYMENTS DUE BY PERIOD July 28, 2012 Total Less than 1 Year 1 to 3 Years 3 to 5 Years More than 5 Years Operating leases $ 1,139 $ 328 $ 442 $ 167 $ 202 Purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers 3,869 3,869 Other purchase obligations 1,460 501 808 151 Long-term debt 16,010 3,760 3,750 8,500 Other long-term liabilities 425 88 40 297 Total by period $ 22,903 $ 4,698 $ 5,098 $ 4,108 $ 8,999 Other long-term liabilities (uncertainty in the timing of future payments) 1,977 Total $ 24,880 Operating Leases For more information on our operating leases, see Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Purchase Commitments with Contract Manufacturers and Suppliers We purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products. A significant portion of our reported estimated purchase commitments arising from these agreements are firm, noncancelable, and unconditional commitments. We record a liability for firm, noncancelable, and unconditional purchase commitments for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with the valuation of our excess and obsolete inventory. See further discussion in Inventory Supply Chain. As of July 28, 2012, the liability for these purchase commitments was $193 million and is recorded in other current liabilities and is not included in the preceding table. 71 Table of Contents Other Purchase Obligations Other purchase obligations represent an estimate of all contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business, other than operating leases and commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers, for which we have not received the goods or services. Purchase orders are not included in the preceding table as they typically represent our authorization to purchase rather than binding contractual purchase obligations. Long-Term Debt The amount of long-term debt in the preceding table represents the principal amount of the respective debt instruments. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Other Long-Term Liabilities Other long-term liabilities primarily include noncurrent income taxes payable, accrued liabilities for deferred compensation, noncurrent deferred tax liabilities, and certain other long-term liabilities. Due to the uncertainty in the timing of future payments, our noncurrent income taxes payable of approximately $1.8 billion and noncurrent deferred tax liabilities of $133 million were presented as one aggregated amount in the total column on a separate line in the preceding table. Noncurrent income taxes payable include uncertain tax positions (see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) partially offset by payments. Other Commitments In connection with our business combinations and asset purchases, we have agreed to pay certain additional amounts contingent upon the achievement of agreed-upon technology, development, product, or other milestones or continued employment with us of certain employees of acquired entities. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We also have certain funding commitments primarily related to our investments in privately held companies and venture funds, some of which are based on the achievement of certain agreed-upon milestones, and some of which are required to be funded on demand. The funding commitments were $120 million as of July 28, 2012, compared with $192 million as of July 30, 2011. Insieme Networks, Inc. In the third quarter of fiscal 2012, we made an investment in Insieme Networks, Inc. ( Insieme ), an early-stage company focused on research and development in the data center market. This investment includes $100 million of funding and a license to certain of our technology. As a result of this investment, we own approximately 86% of Insieme and have consolidated the results of Insieme in our Consolidated Financial Statements beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2012. In connection with this investment, Insieme and we have entered into a put/call option agreement that provides us with the right to purchase the remaining interests in Insieme. In addition, the noncontrolling interest holders can require us to purchase their shares upon the occurrence of certain events. If we acquire the remaining interests of Insieme, the noncontrolling interest holders are eligible to receive two milestone payments, which will be determined using agreed-upon formulas based on revenue for certain of Insieme products. We will begin recognizing the amounts due under the milestone payments when it is determined that such payments are probable of being earned, which we expect may be in fiscal 2014. When such a determination is made, the milestone payments will then be recorded as compensation expense by us based on an estimate of the fair value of the amounts probable of being earned, pursuant to a vesting schedule. Subsequent changes to the fair value of the amounts probable of being earned and the continued vesting will result in adjustments to the recorded compensation expense. The maximum amount that could be recorded as compensation expense by us is approximately $750 million. The milestone payments, if earned, are expected to be paid primarily during fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2017. 72 Table of Contents Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We consider our investments in unconsolidated variable interest entities to be off-balance sheet arrangements. In the ordinary course of business, we have investments in privately held companies and provide financing to certain customers. These privately held companies and customers may be considered to be variable interest entities. We evaluate on an ongoing basis our investments in these privately held companies and customer financings and we have determined that as of July 28, 2012 there were no material unconsolidated variable interest entities. VCE is a joint venture that we formed in fiscal 2010 with EMC Corporation ( EMC ), with investments from VMware, Inc. ( VMware ) and Intel Corporation. VCE helps organizations leverage best-in-class technologies and disciplines from Cisco, EMC, and VMware to enable the transformation to cloud computing. As of July 28, 2012, our cumulative gross investment in VCE was approximately $392 million, inclusive of accrued interest, and our ownership percentage was approximately 35%. During fiscal 2012, we invested approximately $276 million in VCE. We account for our investment in VCE under the equity method and our portion of VCE net loss is recognized in other income, net. As of July 28, 2012, we have recorded cumulative losses since inceptions from VCE of $239 million. Our carrying value in VCE as of July 28, 2012 was $153 million. Over the next 12 months, as VCE scales its operations, we expect that we will make additional investments in VCE and may incur additional losses proportionate with our share ownership. From time to time, EMC and Cisco may enter into guarantee agreements on behalf of VCE to indemnify third parties, such as customers, for monetary damages. Such guarantees were not material as of July 28, 2012. On an ongoing basis, we reassess our investments in privately held companies and customer financings to determine if they are variable interest entities and if we would be regarded as the primary beneficiary pursuant to the applicable accounting guidance. As a result of this ongoing assessment, we may be required to make additional disclosures or consolidate these entities. Because we may not control these entities, we may not have the ability to influence these events. We provide financing guarantees, which are generally for various third-party financing arrangements extended to our channel partners and end-user customers. We could be called upon to make payments under these guarantees in the event of nonpayment by the channel partners or end-user customers. See the previous discussion of these financing guarantees under Financing Receivables and Guarantees. Securities Lending We periodically engage in securities lending activities with certain of our available-for-sale investments. These transactions are accounted for as a secured lending of the securities, and the securities are typically loaned only on an overnight basis. The average daily balance of securities lending for fiscal 2012 and 2011 was $0.5 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively. We require collateral equal to at least 102% of the fair market value of the loaned security and that the collateral be in the form of cash or liquid, high-quality assets. We engage in these secured lending transactions only with highly creditworthy counterparties, and the associated portfolio custodian has agreed to indemnify us against collateral losses. As of July 28, 2012 and July 30, 2011, we had no outstanding securities lending transactions. We believe these arrangements do not present a material risk or impact to our liquidity requirements. 73 Table of Contents Stock Repurchase Program In September 2001, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program. As of July 28, 2012, our Board of Directors had authorized an aggregate repurchase of up to $82 billion of common stock under this program, and the remaining authorized repurchase amount was $5.9 billion with no termination date. The stock repurchase activity under the stock repurchase program, reported based on the trade date is summarized as follows (in millions, except per-share amounts): Shares Repurchased Weighted- Average Price per Share Amount Repurchased Cumulative balance at July 31, 2010 3,127 $ 20.78 $ 64,982 Repurchase of common stock under the stock repurchase program 351 19.36 6,791 Cumulative balance at July 30, 2011 3,478 $ 20.64 $ 71,773 Repurchase of common stock under the stock repurchase program 262 16.64 4,360 Cumulative balance at July 28, 2012 3,740 $ 20.36 $ 76,133 Dividends During fiscal 2012 and 2011, our Board of Directors declared the following dividends (in millions,except per-share amounts): Declaration Date Dividend per Share Record Date Amount Payment Date Fiscal 2012 June 14, 2012 $ 0.08 July 5, 2012 $ 425 July 25, 2012 February 7, 2012 0.08 April 5, 2012 432 April 25, 2012 December 15, 2011 0.06 January 5, 2012 322 January 25, 2012 September 20, 2011 0.06 October 6, 2011 322 October 26, 2011 Total $ 0.28 $ 1,501 Fiscal 2011 June 8, 2011 $ 0.06 July 7, 2011 $ 329 July 27, 2011 March 17, 2011 0.06 March 31, 2011 329 April 20, 2011 Total $ 0.12 $ 658 On August 14, 2012 our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.14 per common share, a six-cent increase over the previous quarter dividend, to be paid on October 24, 2012 to all shareholders of record as of the close of business on October 4, 2012. Any future dividends will be subject to the approval of our Board of Directors. Liquidity and Capital Resource Requirements Based on past performance and current expectations, we believe our cash and cash equivalents, investments, cash generated from operations and ability to access capital markets and committed credit lines will satisfy, through at least the next 12 months, our liquidity requirements, both in total and domestically, including the following: working capital needs, capital expenditures, investment requirements, stock repurchases, cash dividends, contractual obligations, commitments, principal and interest payments on debt, future customer financings, and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations. There are no other transactions, arrangements, or relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect the liquidity and the availability of, as well as our requirements for capital resources. 74 Table of Contents
