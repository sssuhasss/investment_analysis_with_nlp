Item 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW We concluded a difficult year in 2006. Following a strong first half, we experienced a slow-down in retail performance resulting from a shift from limited edition line extensions to more sustainable new product platforms which took longer than expected. In addition, our base business sales were negatively impacted in the second half of the year by poor merchandising activity. Results for 2006, excluding items affecting comparability as indicated below, fell short of our long-term goals and were below expectations. Net sales were impacted by slower retail takeaway and a decline in market share during the second half of the year, primarily in our North American chocolate business. Income per share-diluted was impacted by the lower than expected sales growth, increased costs for product obsolescence associated with the shift to new product platforms and increased expenses for advertising and consumer programs during the fourth quarter to regain marketplace momentum. A product recall and temporary plant closure in Canada also negatively impacted our results for the year. We plan to accelerate growth in 2007 by focusing on increasing sales of our core confectionery products, revitalizing our iconic brands through increased advertising and increased consumer and customer support, and by expanding our innovative new product platforms based on consumer preferences. Adoption of SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108 Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Misstatements When Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements ( SAB No. 108 ), required companies to change the accounting principle used for evaluating the effect of possible prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements. As a result, we changed one of the five criteria of our revenue recognition policy to delay the recognition of revenue on goods in-transit until they are received by our customers. We also made adjustments to correct certain liabilities as of December 31, 2006, along with a corresponding adjustment to retained earnings for all years presented in this report. Adjustments were made to liabilities primarily associated with business acquisitions and divestitures occurring prior to 2002. As permitted by SAB No. 108, we adjusted our financial statements for all prior periods to provide comparability. These adjustments were not material to our results of operations or financial condition in any period presented in this report. 16 Non-GAAP Financial Measures Items Affecting Comparability Our Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section includes certain measures of financial performance that are not defined by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ). For each of these non-GAAP financial measures, we are providing below (1) the most directly comparable GAAP measure; (2) a reconciliation of the differences between the non-GAAP measure and the most directly comparable GAAP measure; (3) an explanation of why our management believes these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to investors; and (4) additional purposes for which we use these non-GAAP measures. We believe that the disclosure of these non-GAAP measures provides investors with a better comparison of our year-to-year operating results. We exclude the effects of certain items from Income before Interest and Income Taxes ( EBIT ), Net Income and Income per Share-Diluted when we evaluate key measures of our performance internally, and in assessing the impact of known trends and uncertainties on our business. We also believe that excluding the effects of these items provides a more balanced view of the underlying dynamics of our business. Items affecting comparability include the impacts of charges or credits in 2006, 2005, 2003, 2002 and 2001 associated with our business realignment initiatives and a reduction of the income tax provision in 2004 resulting from adjustments to income tax contingency reserves. Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements contains information regarding the business realignment initiatives and Note 11 contains information about the income tax provision adjustment. 17 For the years ended December 31, 2006 2005 EBIT Net Income Income Per Share- Diluted EBIT Net Income Income Per Share- Diluted In millions of dollars except per share amounts Results in accordance with GAAP $ 992.6 $ 559.1 $ 2.34 $ 853.6 $ 488.5 $ 1.97 Items affecting comparability: Business realignment and asset impairments included in cost of sales (3.2 ) (2.0 ) (.01 ) 22.5 13.4 .05 Business realignment charges included in selling, marketing and administrative ( SM&A ) .3 .2 Business realignment and asset impairments, net 14.5 9.3 .04 96.5 60.7 .25 Non-GAAP results excluding items affecting comparability $ 1,004.2 $ 566.6 $ 2.37 $ 972.6 $ 562.6 $ 2.27 For the years ended December 31, 2004 2003 EBIT Net Income Income Per Share- Diluted EBIT Net Income Income Per Share- Diluted In millions of dollars except per share amounts Results in accordance with GAAP $ 876.6 $ 574.6 $ 2.24 $ 767.4 $ 439.2 $ 1.66 Items affecting comparability: Business realignment and asset impairments included in cost of sales 2.1 1.3 Business realignment and asset impairments, net 23.4 14.2 .05 Gain on sale of business (8.3 ) (5.7 ) (.02 ) Tax provision adjustment (61.1 ) (.24 ) Cumulative effect of accounting change 7.4 .03 Non-GAAP results excluding items affecting comparability $ 876.6 $ 513.5 $ 2.00 $ 784.6 $ 456.4 $ 1.72 For the years ended December 31, 2002 2001 EBIT Net Income Income Per Share- Diluted EBIT Net Income Income Per Share- Diluted In millions of dollars except per share amounts Results in accordance with GAAP $ 683.0 $ 393.9 $ 1.43 $ 401.5 $ 200.4 $ .73 Items affecting comparability: Business realignment and asset impairments included in cost of sales 6.4 4.1 .01 50.1 31.8 .11 Costs to explore the sale of the Company included in SM&A 17.2 10.9 .04 Gain on sale of business (19.2 ) (1.1 ) Elimination of amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets 14.7 13.5 .05 Business realignment and asset impairments, net 27.6 17.4 .06 228.3 140.1 .51 Non-GAAP results excluding items affecting comparability $ 734.2 $ 426.3 $ 1.54 $ 675.4 $ 384.7 $ 1.40 18 Actual Results Excluding Items Affecting Comparability Key Annual Performance Measures Long-term Goal 2006 2005 2004 Increase in Net Sales 3% to 4% 2.6% 9.1% 6.1% Increase in EBIT 7% to 9% 3.2% 11.0% 11.7% Improvement in EBIT Margin in basis points ( bps ) 70 to 90 bps 10 bps 40 bps 100 bps Increase in Income Per Share-Diluted ( EPS ) 9% to 11% 4.4% 13.5% 16.3% SUMMARY OF OPERATING RESULTS Analysis of Selected Items from Our Income Statement Percent Change Increase (Decrease) For the years ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 2006-2005 2005-2004 In millions of dollars except per share amounts Net Sales $ 4,944.2 $ 4,819.8 $ 4,416.4 2.6 % 9.1 % Cost of Sales 3,076.7 2,956.7 2,672.7 4.1 10.6 Gross Profit 1,867.5 1,863.1 1,743.7 0.2 6.9 Gross Margin 37.8 % 38.7 % 39.5 % SM&A Expense 860.3 913.0 867.1 (5.8 ) 5.3 SM&A Expense as a percent of sales 17.4 % 18.9 % 19.6 % Business Realignment and Asset Impairments Charge 14.6 96.5 (84.9 ) N/A EBIT 992.6 853.6 876.6 16.3 (2.6 ) EBIT Margin 20.1 % 17.7 % 19.8 % Interest Expense, Net 116.1 88.0 66.6 31.9 32.2 Provision for Income Taxes 317.4 277.1 235.4 14.6 17.7 Effective Income Tax Rate 36.2 % 36.2 % 29.1 % Net Income $ 559.1 $ 488.5 $ 574.6 14.4 (15.0 ) Net Income Per Share Diluted $ 2.34 $ 1.97 $ 2.24 18.8 (12.1 ) Net Sales 2006 compared with 2005 U.S. confectionery sales volume increases contributed over three quarters of the total increase in net sales. Sales of new products and higher seasonal sales contributed the majority of the volume increase. Sales in 2006 also benefited from improved price realization resulting from higher list prices in the United States implemented in 2005, substantially offset by a higher rate of promotional allowances. Favorable foreign currency exchange rates and higher sales volume in Mexico also contributed to the sales increase. These increases were offset somewhat by lower sales in Canada, partly due to the impact of a product recall during the fourth quarter caused by a contaminated ingredient purchased from an outside supplier. 2005 compared with 2004 Business acquisitions, primarily Mauna Loa Macadamia Nut Corporation ( Mauna Loa ) and Grupo Lorena, contributed approximately 2.9% of the increase in net sales from 2004. Approximately two-thirds of the additional sales increase of 6.2% resulted from unit volume growth, primarily reflecting the introduction of new 19 products and limited edition items. Improved performance by our Canadian and Mexican businesses and exports to Asia and Latin America also contributed to this increase. The remaining sales increase resulted from selling price increases, a lower rate of promotional spending, and favorable foreign currency exchange rates for our international businesses. Key Marketplace Metrics For the 52 weeks ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Consumer Takeaway Increase 4.0 % 4.2 % 7.0 % Market Share (Decrease) Increase (0.2 ) 0.7 0.5 Consumer takeaway is provided for channels of distribution accounting for approximately 80% of our U.S. confectionery retail business. These channels of distribution include food, drug, mass merchandisers, including Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., and convenience stores. The change in market share is provided for measured channels which include sales in the food, drug, convenience store and mass merchandiser classes of trade, excluding sales of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Cost of Sales and Gross Margin 2006 compared with 2005 The sales volume increase, higher energy, raw material and other input costs were the primary contributors to the cost of sales increase for 2006. Higher costs associated with obsolete, aged and unsaleable products also contributed to the increase. These increases were offset somewhat by reductions in U.S. manufacturing costs and a decrease in cost of sales of $3.2 million in 2006 resulting from the adjustment of liabilities associated with business realignment initiatives. Business realignment charges of $22.5 million were included in cost of sales in 2005 reflecting accelerated depreciation resulting from the closure of a manufacturing facility located in Las Piedras, Puerto Rico. Gross margin in 2006 was negatively impacted by higher costs for energy and raw materials, increased costs related to product obsolescence and an unfavorable sales mix. These were partially offset by improved price realization and supply chain productivity. Our business realignment initiatives improved gross margin 0.1 percentage point in 2006 and reduced gross margin by 0.4 percentage points in 2005. 2005 compared with 2004 Business realignment charges increased cost of sales by $22.5 million. Higher sales volume, business acquisitions and higher raw material costs, in addition to higher labor, overhead and distribution costs primarily caused the remainder of the increase. A less favorable product mix, primarily associated with the lower-margin Mauna Loa and Grupo Lorena businesses, and the impact of business realignment charges reduced our gross margin by 1.1 percentage points. Improved price realization, primarily from selling price increases and improved profitability for our international businesses, more than offset the impact of higher raw material, labor and overhead costs, and sales of certain new products which had lower margins. Selling, Marketing and Administrative 2006 compared with 2005 Selling, marketing and administrative expenses decreased primarily due to reduced administrative costs reflecting lower incentive compensation expense and savings resulting from our 2005 business realignment initiatives. Reduced advertising expense in 2006 was substantially offset by higher consumer promotion expenses. 20 2005 compared with 2004 Selling, marketing and administrative expenses increased during this period primarily due to increased performance-based employee compensation costs, including stock-based compensation. Business acquisition expenses and consumer promotions expenses also increased, but were offset somewhat by lower advertising expenses. Business Realignment Initiatives In July 2005, we announced initiatives intended to advance our value-enhancing strategy (the 2005 business realignment initiatives ). We also announced that we would record a total pre-tax charge of approximately $140 million to $150 million, or $.41 to $.44 per share-diluted in connection with the 2005 business realignment initiatives. Our 2005 business realignment initiatives were complete as of December 31, 2006. Charges (credits) associated with business realignment initiatives recorded during 2006 and 2005 were as follows: For the years ended December 31, 2006 2005 In thousands of dollars Cost of sales 2005 business realignment initiatives $ (1,599 ) $ 22,459 Previous business realignment initiatives (1,600 ) Total cost of sales (3,199 ) 22,459 Selling, marketing and administrative 2005 business realignment initiatives 266 Business realignment and asset impairments, net 2005 business realignment initiatives: U.S. voluntary workforce reduction program 9,972 69,472 U.S. facility rationalization (Las Piedras, Puerto Rico plant) 1,567 12,771 Streamline international operations (primarily Canada) 2,524 14,294 Previous business realignment initiatives 513 Total business realignment and asset impairments, net 14,576 96,537 Total net charges associated with business realignment initiatives $ 11,643 $ 118,996 The credit of $1.6 million recorded in cost of sales during 2006 for the 2005 business realignment initiatives related to higher than expected proceeds from the sale of equipment from the Las Piedras, Puerto Rico plant. The charge recorded in selling, marketing and administrative expenses resulted from accelerated depreciation relating to the termination of an office building lease. The net business realignment and asset impairments charges recorded during 2006 included $7.3 million for involuntary terminations relating to organizational changes. During 2006, we recorded charges (credits) related to previous business realignment initiatives that began in 2003 and 2001. These charges (credits) were recorded to finalize the sale of certain properties, adjust previously recorded liabilities, and reflect the impact of an employment complaint arising from the 2003 business realignment initiatives. During 2004, eight former employees filed a complaint in federal court in Colorado alleging we discriminated against them based on age. We do not expect any significant impact as a result of this case. The $22.5 million recorded in cost of sales in 2005 resulted from accelerated depreciation related to the closure of the Las Piedras manufacturing facility. The business realignment and asset impairments charge in 2005 included $8.3 million for involuntary termination benefits primarily for Las Piedras plant employees. 21 Changes in liabilities recorded for the business realignment initiatives were as follows: Accrued Liabilities Balance 12/31/05 Utilization during 2006 New charges during 2006 Balance 12/31/06 In thousands of dollars Voluntary workforce reduction $ 31,883 $ (19,727 ) $ 5,531 $ 17,687 Facility rationalization (1,562 ) 1,562 Streamline international operations 5,888 (6,723 ) 1,896 1,061 Total $ 37,771 $ (28,012 ) $ 8,989 $ 18,748 Income Before Interest and Income Taxes and EBIT Margin 2006 compared with 2005 EBIT increased in 2006 compared with 2005, primarily as a result of lower net business realignment charges associated primarily with the 2005 business realignment initiatives. Net pre-tax business realignment charges of $11.6 million were recorded in 2006 compared with $119.0 million recorded in 2005, a decrease of $107.4 million. The remainder of the increase in EBIT was attributable to lower selling, marketing and administrative expenses which were partially offset by lower gross profit resulting from higher input costs and the impact of product obsolescence. Net business realignment charges reduced EBIT margin by 0.2 percentage points in 2006 and 2.5 percentage points in 2005. The remainder of the improvement in EBIT margin reflected lower selling, marketing and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales. 2005 compared with 2004 EBIT decreased from 2004 to 2005 as a result of net charges of $119.0 million related to the 2005 business realignment initiatives recorded in 2005. The impact of the business realignment charges was substantially offset by an increase in EBIT of $96.0 million resulting from the sales volume growth and net price realization which more than offset higher input costs and an increase in selling, marketing and administrative expenses. EBIT margin declined in 2005 primarily due to our Mauna Loa and Grupo Lorena businesses, which had lower margins, and the impact of business realignment charges which together reduced EBIT margin by 3.1 percentage points. Also contributing to the EBIT margin decline were higher raw material, labor and overhead costs, and sales of certain new products that had lower margins. Improved price realization, improved profitability from our international businesses and lower selling, marketing and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales offset 1.0 percentage point of the EBIT margin decline. Interest Expense, Net 2006 compared with 2005 Net interest expense was higher in 2006 than the comparable period of 2005, primarily reflecting higher interest expense resulting from commercial paper borrowings to fund repurchases of Common Stock and working capital requirements, along with significant contributions to our pension plans in late 2005. Higher interest rates in 2006 also contributed to the increase in interest expense. 2005 compared with 2004 Net interest expense was higher in 2005 primarily due to higher short-term interest expense and decreased capitalized interest. The increase in interest expense was primarily associated with commercial paper borrowings to finance stock repurchases and contributions to our pension plans, in addition to higher interest rates. 22 Income Taxes and Effective Tax Rate 2006 compared with 2005 Our effective income tax rate was 36.2% for 2006 and 2005. 2005 compared with 2004 The effective income tax rate for 2005 benefited by 0.2 percentage points from the impact of tax rates associated with business realignment charges. Our effective income tax rate for 2004 was not comparable to 2005 because in 2004 we settled Federal tax audits for the 1999 and 2000 tax years and resolved several state tax audit issues. Our provision for income taxes was reduced by $61.1 million from adjustments to income tax contingency reserves related to those years. The income tax contingency reserve adjustments related primarily to the deductibility of certain expenses, interest on potential assessments, and acquisition and divestiture matters. The reduction in the 2004 provision for income taxes resulting from the adjustment to income tax contingency reserves reduced the effective income tax rate by 7.3 percentage points. Net Income and Net Income Per Share 2006 compared with 2005 Net Income in 2006 was reduced by $7.6 million, or $.03 per share-diluted, and in 2005 was reduced by $74.0 million, or $.30 per share-diluted, as a result of net charges associated with our 2005 business realignment initiatives which were recorded in each year. In addition to the impact of the business realignment initiatives, earnings per share-diluted in 2006 increased primarily as a result of lower selling, marketing and administrative expenses which more than offset the impact of reduced gross profit. The impact of lower weighted-average shares outstanding, net of higher interest expense, also contributed to the increase in earnings per share-diluted in 2006. 2005 compared with 2004 Net income for 2005 was unfavorably impacted by total charges associated with the 2005 business realignment initiatives of $119.0 million before tax, $74.0 million after tax or $.30 per share-diluted. Net income for 2004 was favorably impacted by $61.1 million, or $.24 per share-diluted, because of the adjustment to the Federal and state income tax contingency reserves. FINANCIAL CONDITION Our financial condition remained strong during 2006. Solid cash flow from operations and our liquidity, leverage and capital structure contributed to our continued investment grade credit rating by recognized rating agencies. Acquisitions and Divestitures In October 2006, our wholly-owned subsidiary, Artisan Confections Company, purchased the assets of Dagoba Organic Chocolates, LLC based in Ashland, Oregon, for $17.0 million. Dagoba is known for its high-quality organic chocolate bars, drinking chocolates and baking products that are primarily sold in natural food and gourmet stores across the United States. Dagoba has annual sales of approximately $8 million. In August 2005, Artisan Confections Company completed the acquisition of Scharffen Berger Chocolate Maker, Inc. Based in San Francisco, California, Scharffen Berger is known for its high-cacao content, signature dark chocolate bars and baking products sold online and in a broad range of outlets, including specialty retailers, natural food stores and gourmet centers across the United States. Scharffen Berger also owns and operates three specialty stores located in New York City, Berkeley, and San Francisco. 23 Also, in August 2005, Artisan Confections Company acquired the assets of Joseph Schmidt Confections, Inc., a premium chocolate maker located in San Francisco, California. Distinctive products created by Joseph Schmidt include artistic and innovative truffles, colorful chocolate mosaics, specialty cookies, and handcrafted chocolates. We sell these products in select department stores and other specialty outlets nationwide as well as in Joseph Schmidt stores located in San Jose and San Francisco, California. The combined purchase price for Scharffen Berger and Joseph Schmidt was $47.1 million, with the final amount subject to upward adjustment. The final purchase price, which will not exceed $61.1 million, will be determined based upon actual sales growth through 2007. Together, these companies have combined annual sales of approximately $25 million. In December 2004, Artisan Confections Company acquired Mauna Loa for $127.8 million. Mauna Loa is the leading processor and marketer of macadamia snacks with annual sales of approximately $80 million. In October 2004, our wholly-owned Mexican subsidiary, Hershey Mexico, acquired Grupo Lorena, one of Mexico top sugar confectionery companies, for $39.0 million. This business has annual sales of over $30 million. Included in the acquisition was the Pel n Pelo Rico brand. Results subsequent to the dates of acquisition were included in the consolidated financial statements. Had the results of the acquisitions been included in the consolidated financial statements for each of the periods presented, the effect would not have been material. In October 2005, our wholly-owned subsidiary, Hershey Canada Inc., completed the sale of its Mr. Freeze freeze pops business for $2.7 million. Assets A summary of our assets is as follows: December 31, 2006 2005 In thousands of dollars Current assets $ 1,417,812 $ 1,376,403 Property, plant and equipment, net 1,651,300 1,659,138 Goodwill and other intangibles 642,269 629,964 Other assets 446,184 597,194 Total assets $ 4,157,565 $ 4,262,699 The change in current assets from 2005 to 2006 was primarily due to the following: Higher cash and cash equivalents in 2006 due to the timing of cash collections; An increase in accounts receivable in 2006 resulting from the timing of sales in December; An increase in inventories reflecting higher raw material inventories to support manufacturing requirements; and A decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets reflecting the implementation of SFAS No. 158 and lower prepaid selling and marketing expenses, partially offset by a receivable of approximately $14.0 million related to the recovery of damages resulting from the product recall in Canada. Property, plant and equipment was lower in 2006 primarily due to depreciation expense of $181.0 million and asset retirements, partially offset by capital additions. The change in other assets in 2006 was primarily due to the implementation of SFAS No. 158 which resulted in the reclassification of $143.9 million of assets related to our pension plans to accumulated other comprehensive loss. 24 Liabilities A summary of our liabilities is as follows: December 31, 2006 2005 In thousands of dollars Current liabilities $ 1,453,538 $ 1,490,382 Long-term debt 1,248,128 942,755 Other long-term liabilities 486,473 412,929 Deferred income taxes 286,003 400,253 Total liabilities $ 3,474,142 $ 3,246,319 Changes in current liabilities from 2005 to 2006 were primarily the result of the following: Lower accounts payable reflecting the timing of payments in December; Reduced accrued liabilities associated with business realignment initiatives, incentive compensation and marketing programs; and Higher current portion of long-term debt, substantially offset by the refinancing of commercial paper borrowings upon the issuance of long-term debt. The increase in long-term debt in 2006 resulted from the issuance of $500 million of Notes in August 2006, discussed further in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section. This increase was reduced by the reclassification of 6.95% Notes and certain lease obligations to current portion of long-term debt. The increase in other long-term liabilities in 2006 was principally associated with the recording of liabilities for post-retirement benefits upon adoption of SFAS No. 158. The decrease in deferred taxes in 2006 was primarily associated with the tax effect of the reclassification of assets related to our pension plans and liabilities recorded for our post-retirement benefit plans upon adoption of SFAS No. 158. Capital Structure We have two classes of stock outstanding, Common Stock and Class B Stock. Holders of the Common Stock and the Class B Stock generally vote together without regard to class on matters submitted to stockholders, including the election of directors. Holders of the Common Stock have one vote per share. Holders of the Class B Stock have ten votes per share. Holders of the Common Stock, voting separately as a class, are entitled to elect one-sixth of our Board of Directors. With respect to dividend rights, holders of the Common Stock are entitled to cash dividends 10% higher than those declared and paid on the Class B Stock. Hershey Trust Company, as trustee for the benefit of Milton Hershey School (the Milton Hershey School Trust ) maintains voting control over The Hershey Company. However, the Milton Hershey School Trust has not taken an active role in setting our policy, nor has it exercised influence with regard to the ongoing business decisions of our Board of Directors or management. The Milton Hershey School Trust decided to explore a sale of The Hershey Company in June 2002, but subsequently decided to terminate the sale process in September 2002. After terminating the sale process, the Trustee of the Milton Hershey School Trust advised the Pennsylvania Office of Attorney General in September 2002 that it would not agree to any sale of its controlling interest in The Hershey Company without approval of the court having jurisdiction over the Milton Hershey School Trust following advance notice to the Office of Attorney General. Subsequently, Pennsylvania enacted legislation that requires that the Office of Attorney General be provided advance notice of any transaction that would result in the Milton Hershey School Trust no longer having voting control of the Company. The law provides specific statutory authority for the Attorney General to intercede, and petition the Court having jurisdiction over the Milton Hershey School Trust to stop such a transaction if the Attorney General can prove that the transaction is unnecessary for the future economic viability of the Company and is inconsistent with 25 investment and management considerations under fiduciary obligations. This legislation could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock and thereby delay or prevent a change in control of the Company. In December 2000, our Board of Directors unanimously adopted a Stockholder Protection Rights Agreement ( Rights Agreement ). The Milton Hershey School Trust supported the Rights Agreement. This action was not in response to any specific effort to acquire control of The Hershey Company. Under the Rights Agreement, our Board of Directors declared a dividend of one right ( Right ) for each outstanding share of Common Stock and Class B Stock payable to stockholders of record at the close of business on December 26, 2000. The Rights will at no time have voting power or receive dividends. The issuance of the Rights has no dilutive effect, will not affect reported earnings per share, is not taxable and will not change the manner in which our Common Stock is traded. We discuss the Rights Agreement in more detail in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Our principal source of liquidity is operating cash flows. Our net income and, consequently, our cash provided from operations are impacted by: sales volume, seasonal sales patterns, timing of new product introductions, profit margins and price changes. Sales are typically higher during the third and fourth quarters of the year due to seasonal and holiday-related sales patterns. Generally, working capital needs peak during the summer months. We meet these needs primarily by issuing commercial paper. Cash Flows from Operating Activities Our cash flows provided from (used by) operating activities were as follows: For the years ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 In thousands of dollars Net income $ 559,061 $ 488,547 $ 574,637 Depreciation and amortization 199,911 218,032 189,665 Stock-based compensation and excess tax benefits 16,323 14,263 18,710 Deferred income taxes 4,173 71,038 (74,570 ) Business realignment initiatives, net of tax 7,573 74,021 Contributions to pension plans (23,570 ) (277,492 ) (8,020 ) Working capital (40,553 ) (174,010 ) (26,081 ) Changes in other assets and liabilities 275 47,363 113,413 Net cash provided from operating activities $ 723,193 $ 461,762 $ 787,754 Over the past three years, cash from operating activities provided approximately $2.0 billion. The change in cash (used by) provided from deferred income taxes primarily reflected the tax impact of higher pension plan contributions in 2005 and the adjustment of income tax contingency reserves in 2004. In 2004, we adjusted deferred income taxes primarily to reflect the deferred tax benefit resulting from a $61.1 million adjustment to income tax contingency reserves recorded in the second quarter of 2004. Deferred income taxes in 2004 also reflected an increase resulting from the Mauna Loa acquisition. These adjustments represented non-cash items that impacted net income and are reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows to reconcile cash flows from operating activities. We contributed $309.1 million to our pension plans over the past three years to improve the plans funded status. As of December 31, 2006, the fair value of our pension plan assets exceeded benefits obligations by $328.0 million. Over the three-year period, cash provided from or used by working capital tended to fluctuate due to sales during December and inventory management practices. 26 During the three-year period, changes in other assets and liabilities primarily related to hedging transactions and the timing of payments for accrued liabilities associated with selling and marketing programs, incentive compensation and income taxes. The increase in income taxes paid in 2006 compared with 2005 primarily reflected significantly lower tax deductions in 2006 for pension plan contributions. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Our cash flows provided from (used by) investing activities were as follows: For the years ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 In thousands of dollars Capital additions $ (183,496 ) $ (181,069 ) $ (181,728 ) Capitalized software additions (15,016 ) (13,236 ) (14,158 ) Business acquisitions (17,000 ) (47,074 ) (166,859 ) Proceeds from divestitures 2,713 Net cash used by investing activities $ (215,512 ) $ (238,666 ) $ (362,745 ) Capital additions primarily included capacity expansion, modernization of existing facilities and purchases of manufacturing equipment for new products. Capitalized software additions were primarily for ongoing enhancement of our information systems. We anticipate total capital expenditures of $250 million to $300 million in 2007 and $225 million to $250 million in 2008 and 2009. In October 2006, our wholly-owned subsidiary, Artisan Confections Company, acquired the assets of Dagoba Organic Chocolates, LLC for $17.0 million. In August 2005, Artisan Confections Company acquired the assets of Joseph Schmidt Confections, Inc. and completed the acquisition of Scharffen Berger Chocolate Maker, Inc. The combined purchase price for Joseph Schmidt and Scharffen Berger was $47.1 million, although the final amount may be adjusted upward based on actual sales growth through 2007. The adjustment may not increase the final amount to a total of more than $61.1 million. In 2004, Artisan Confections Company acquired Mauna Loa for $127.8 million and our wholly-owned Mexican subsidiary, Hershey Mexico, acquired Grupo Lorena, a sugar confectionery company, for $39.0 million. In October 2005, our wholly-owned subsidiary, Hershey Canada Inc., sold its Mr. Freeze freeze pops business for $2.7 million. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Our cash flows provided from (used by) financing activities were as follows: For the years ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 In thousands of dollars Net change in short-term borrowings $ (163,826 ) $ 475,582 $ 331,245 Long-term borrowings 496,728 248,318 Repayment of long-term debt (234 ) (278,236 ) (883 ) Cash dividends paid (235,129 ) (221,235 ) (205,747 ) Stock options exercises 46,386 101,818 89,330 Repurchase of Common Stock (621,648 ) (536,997 ) (698,910 ) Net cash used by financing activities $ (477,723 ) $ (210,750 ) $ (484,965 ) 27 We use short-term borrowings (commercial paper and bank borrowings) to fund seasonal working capital requirements and finance share repurchase programs. Additional information on short-term borrowings is included under Borrowing Arrangements below. In August 2006, we issued $250 million of 5.3% Notes due in 2011 and $250 million of 5.45% Notes due in 2016. The Notes were issued under a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 filed in May 2006 described under Registration Statements below. In August 2005, we issued $250 million of 4.85% Notes due in 2015 under an August 1997 Form S-3 Registration Statement. We paid cash dividends of $178.9 million on our Common Stock and $56.3 million on our Class B Stock in 2006. Cash used for the repurchase of Common Stock was partially offset by cash received from the exercise of stock options. Repurchases and Issuances of Common Stock For the years ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 In thousands Shares Dollars Shares Dollars Shares Dollars Shares repurchased under pre-approved share repurchase programs: Open market repurchases 9,912 $ 524,387 4,085 $ 238,157 2,633 $ 115,604 Milton Hershey School Trust repurchases 689 38,482 69 3,936 11,282 501,373 Shares repurchased to replace Treasury Stock issued for stock options and employee benefits 1,096 58,779 4,859 294,904 1,898 81,933 Total share repurchases 11,697 $ 621,648 9,013 $ 536,997 15,813 $ 698,910 Shares issued for stock options and employee benefits (1,437 ) (44,564 ) (2,949 ) (74,438 ) (3,341 ) (84,047 ) Net change 10,260 $ 577,084 6,064 $ 462,559 12,472 $ 614,863 We intend to continue to repurchase shares of Common Stock in order to replace Treasury Stock shares issued for exercised stock options. The value of shares purchased in a given period will vary based on stock options exercised over time and market conditions. During 2006, we completed share repurchase programs of $250 million approved in April 2005 and $500 million approved in December 2005. In December 2006, our Board of Directors approved an additional $250 million share repurchase program. Cumulative Share Repurchases and Issuances A summary of cumulative share repurchases and issuances is as follows: Shares Dollars (In thousands) Shares repurchased under authorized programs which began in 1993: Open market repurchases 54,520 $ 1,834,449 Repurchases from the Milton Hershey School Trust 11,918 245,550 Shares retired (1,056 ) (12,820 ) Total repurchases under authorized programs 65,382 2,067,179 Privately negotiated purchases from the Milton Hershey School Trust 67,282 1,501,373 Shares reissued for stock option obligations, supplemental retirement contributions, and employee stock ownership trust obligations (25,747 ) (653,882 ) Shares repurchased to replace reissued shares 22,721 887,277 Total held as Treasury Stock as of December 31, 2006 129,638 $ 3,801,947 28 Borrowing Arrangements We maintain debt levels we consider prudent based on our cash flow, interest coverage ratio and percentage of debt to capital. We use debt financing to lower our overall cost of capital which increases our return on stockholders equity. In December 2006, we entered into a five-year agreement establishing an unsecured revolving credit facility to borrow up to $1.1 billion, with an option to increase borrowings to $1.5 billion with the consent of the lenders. We may use these funds for general corporate purposes, including commercial paper backstop and business acquisitions. The credit agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and a financial covenant. As of December 31, 2006, we complied with all of these covenants. This facility replaced our previous $900 million revolving credit facility entered into in November 2004. In March 2006, we entered into a short-term credit agreement establishing an unsecured revolving credit facility to borrow up to $400 million through September 2006. In September 2006, we entered into an agreement amending the short-term facility. The amended agreement reduced the credit limit from $400 million to $200 million and expired on December 1, 2006. We used the funds for general corporate purposes, including commercial paper backstop. We entered into this agreement because we expected borrowings to exceed the $900 million credit limit available under the revolving credit agreement in effect at that time. In September 2005, we entered into a short-term credit agreement establishing an unsecured revolving credit facility to borrow up to $300 million. The agreement expired in December 2005. We used the funds for general corporate purposes. We entered into this facility because we expected borrowings in late 2005 to exceed the $900 million credit limit available under the revolving credit agreement in effect at that time. Borrowing increased due to the retirement of $200 million of 6.7% Notes in October 2005, refinancing of certain consolidated lease arrangements, contributions to our pension plans, stock repurchases and seasonal working capital needs. In November 2004, we entered into a five-year credit agreement under which we could borrow up to $900 million with an option to increase borrowings by an additional $600 million with concurrence by the lenders. This credit agreement was replaced by the new $1.1 billion revolving credit facility referred to in the first bullet above. In addition to the revolving credit facility, we maintain lines of credit with domestic and international commercial banks. As of December 31, 2006, we could borrow up to approximately $54.2 million in various currencies under the lines of credit and as of December 31, 2005, we could borrow up to $71.1 million. Registration Statements In September 2005, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 that was declared effective in January 2006. Under this registration statement, we could offer on a delayed or continuous basis up to $750 million aggregate principal amount of additional debt securities (the $750 Million Shelf Registration Statement ). In May 2006, we filed a new shelf registration statement on Form S-3 that registered an indeterminate amount of debt securities. This registration statement was effective immediately upon filing under new Securities and Exchange Commission regulations governing well-known seasoned issuers (the WKSI Registration Statement ). The WKSI Registration Statement replaces, and will be used in lieu of, the $750 Million Shelf Registration Statement for offerings of debt securities occurring subsequent to May 2006. In August 2006, we issued $250 million of 5.3% Notes due September 1, 2011, and $250 million of 5.45% Notes due September 1, 2016. These Notes were issued under the WKSI Registration Statement. 29 Proceeds from the debt issuances and any other offerings under the WKSI Registration Statement may be used for general corporate requirements. These may include reducing existing borrowings, financing capital additions, funding contributions to our pension plans, future business acquisitions and working capital requirements. OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS, CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND COMMITMENTS As of December 31, 2006, our contractual cash obligations by year were as follows: Payments Due by Year (In thousands of dollars) Contractual Obligations 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Total Unconditional Purchase Obligations $ 1,023,500 $ 271,800 $ 72,300 $ 25,100 $ $ $ 1,392,700 Non-cancelable Operating Leases 14,334 12,969 9,124 6,511 5,892 16,091 64,921 Long-term Debt 188,765 144 147 136 250,000 997,701 1,436,893 Total Obligations $ 1,226,599 $ 284,913 $ 81,571 $ 31,747 $ 255,892 $ 1,013,792 $ 2,894,514 In entering into contractual obligations, we have assumed the risk that might arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts. Our risk is limited to replacing the contracts at prevailing market rates. We do not expect any significant losses resulting from counterparty defaults. Purchase Obligations We enter into certain obligations for the purchase of raw materials. These obligations were primarily in the form of forward contracts for the purchase of raw materials from third-party brokers and dealers. These contracts minimize the effect of future price fluctuations by fixing the price of part or all of these purchase obligations. Total obligations for each year presented above consisted of fixed price contracts for the purchase of commodities and unpriced contracts that were valued using market prices as of December 31, 2006. The cost of commodities associated with the unpriced contracts is variable as market prices change over future periods. We mitigate the variability of these costs to the extent we have entered into commodities futures contracts to hedge our costs for those periods. Increases or decreases in market prices are offset by gains or losses on commodities futures contracts. This applies to the extent that we have hedged the unpriced contracts as of December 31, 2006 and in future periods by entering into commodities futures contracts. Taking delivery of the specific commodities for use in the manufacture of finished goods satisfies these obligations. For each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2006, we satisfied these obligations by taking delivery of and making payment for the specific commodities. Lease Arrangement with Special Purpose Trust In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an interpretation of ARB No. 51 ( Interpretation No. 46 ). Interpretation No. 46 addresses consolidation by business enterprises of special-purpose entities ( SPEs ), such as special-purpose trusts ( SPTs ), to which the usual condition for consolidation described in Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51, Consolidated Financial Statements , does not apply because the SPEs have no voting interests or otherwise are not subject to control through ownership of voting interests. We adopted Interpretation No. 46 as of June 30, 2003, resulting in the consolidation of off-balance sheet arrangements with SPTs. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements. 30 In December 2000, we entered into a lease agreement with the owner of a warehouse and distribution facility in Redlands, California. The lease term was approximately ten years, with occupancy to begin upon completion of the facility. The lease agreement contained an option for us to purchase the facility. In January 2002, we assigned our right to purchase the facility to an SPT that in turn purchased the completed facility and leased it to us under a new lease agreement. The term of this lease agreement was five years, with up to four renewal periods of five years each with the consent of the lessor. The cost incurred by the SPT to acquire the facility, including land, was $40.1 million. We exercised our option to purchase the facility at the original cost of $40.1 million at the end of the lease term in January 2007. Asset Retirement Obligations Our Company has a number of facilities that contain varying degrees of asbestos in certain locations within these facilities. Our asbestos management program is compliant with current regulations. Current regulations require that we handle or dispose of this type of asbestos in a special manner if such facilities undergo major renovations or are demolished. We believe we do not have sufficient information to estimate the fair value of any asset retirement obligations related to these facilities. We cannot specify the settlement date or range of potential settlement dates and, therefore, sufficient information is not available to apply an expected present value technique. We expect to maintain the facilities with repairs and maintenance activities that would not involve the removal of asbestos. Income Tax Obligations We base our deferred income taxes, accrued income taxes and provision for income taxes upon income, statutory tax rates, the legal structure of our Company and interpretation of tax laws. We are regularly audited by Federal, state and foreign tax authorities. From time to time, these audits result in assessments of additional tax. We maintain reserves for such assessments. We determine the reserves based upon our judgment of assessment risk. We adjust the reserves, from time to time, based upon changing facts and circumstances, such as receiving audit assessments or clearing of an item for which a reserve has been established. A settlement of Federal tax audits for the 1999 and 2000 tax years, as well as the resolution of a number of state tax audit issues were concluded during the second quarter of 2004. Based upon the results of the audits, we reduced our income tax contingency reserves by $73.7 million. This reflected a reduction of the provision for income taxes by $61.1 million and a reduction to goodwill of $12.6 million. The reserve adjustment related primarily to the deductibility of certain expenses, interest on potential assessments, and acquisition and divestiture matters. Assessments of additional tax require cash payments. We are not aware of any significant income tax assessments. ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND MARKET RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS We use certain derivative instruments, from time to time, including interest rate swaps, foreign currency forward exchange contracts and options, and commodities futures contracts, to manage interest rate, foreign currency exchange rate and commodity market price risk exposures. We enter into interest rate swap agreements and foreign currency contracts and options for periods consistent with related underlying exposures. These derivative instruments do not constitute positions independent of those exposures. We enter into commodities futures contracts for varying periods. These futures contracts are intended to be, and are effective as hedges of market price risks associated with anticipated raw material purchases, energy requirements and transportation costs. We do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to any instruments with leverage or prepayment features. In entering into these contracts, we have assumed the risk that might arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts. We do not expect any significant losses from counterparty defaults. 31 Accounting Under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 We account for derivative instruments in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities , as amended ( SFAS No. 133, as amended ). SFAS No. 133, as amended, provides that we report the effective portion of the gain or loss on a derivative instrument designated and qualifying as a cash flow hedging instrument as a component of other comprehensive income. We reclassify the effective portion of the gain or loss on these derivative instruments into income in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. The remaining gain or loss on the derivative instrument resulting from hedge ineffectiveness, if any, must be recognized currently in earnings. Fair value hedges pertain to derivative instruments that qualify as a hedge of exposures to changes in the fair value of a firm commitment or assets and liabilities recognized on the balance sheet. For fair value hedges, we reflect the gain or loss on the derivative instrument in earnings in the period of change together with the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item. The effect of that accounting is to reflect in earnings the extent to which the hedge is not effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value. As of December 31, 2006, we designated and accounted for all derivative instruments, including foreign exchange contracts and options, and commodities futures contracts, as cash flow hedges. We adopted SFAS No. 133, as amended, as of January 1, 2001. Additional information regarding accounting policies associated with derivative instruments is contained in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. The information below summarizes our market risks associated with long-term debt and derivative instruments outstanding as of December 31, 2006. Note 1, Note 5 and Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements provide additional information. Long-Term Debt The table below presents the principal cash flows and related interest rates by maturity date for long-term debt, including the current portion, as of December 31, 2006. We determined the fair value of long-term debt based upon quoted market prices for the same or similar debt issues. Maturity Date 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Total Fair Value In thousands of dollars except for rates Long-term Debt $ 188,765 $ 144 $ 147 $ 136 $ 250,000 $ 997,701 $ 1,436,893 $ 1,519,067 Interest Rate 6.3 % 2.0 % 2.0 % 2.0 % 5.3 % 6.3 % 6.1 % We calculated the interest rates on variable rate obligations using the rates in effect as of December 31, 2006. Interest Rate Swaps In order to minimize financing costs and to manage interest rate exposure, from time to time, we enter into interest rate swap agreements. In December 2005, we entered into forward swap agreements to hedge interest rate exposure related to $500 million of term financing to be executed during 2006. In February 2006, we terminated a forward swap agreement hedging the anticipated execution of $250 million of term financing because the transaction was no longer expected to occur by the originally specified time period or within an additional two-month period of time thereafter. We recorded a gain of $1.0 million in the first quarter of 2006 as a result of the discontinuance of this cash flow hedge. In August 2006, a forward swap agreement hedging the anticipated issuance of $250 million of 32 10-year notes matured resulting in cash receipts of $3.7 million. The $3.7 million gain on the swap will be amortized as a reduction to interest expense over the term of the $250 million of 5.45% Notes due September 1, 2016. In October 2003, we entered into swap agreements effectively converting interest payments on long-term debt from fixed to variable rates. We converted interest payments on $200 million of 6.7% Notes due in October 2005 and $150 million of 6.95% Notes due in March 2007 from their respective fixed rates to variable rates based on the London Interbank Offered Rate, LIBOR. In March 2004, we terminated these agreements, resulting in cash receipts totaling $5.2 million, with a corresponding increase to the carrying value of the long-term debt. We are amortizing or have amortized this increase over the remaining terms of the respective long-term debt as a reduction to interest expense. The fair value of interest rate swaps equals the difference in the present values of cash flows calculated at the contracted interest rates and at current market interest rates at the end of the period. We calculate the fair value of the swap agreements quarterly based upon the quoted market price for the same or similar financial instruments. As of December 31, 2006, we were not a party to any interest rate swap agreements. A summary of the fair value and market risk associated with interest rate swaps is as follows: December 31, 2006 2005 In millions of dollars Fair value of forward swap agreements liability $ $ 4.9 Potential net loss in fair value of interest rate swaps of ten percent resulting from a hypothetical near-term adverse change in market rates $ $ .5 Foreign Exchange Forward Contracts and Options We enter into foreign exchange forward contracts and options to hedge transactions denominated in foreign currencies. These transactions are primarily purchase commitments or forecasted purchases of equipment, raw materials and finished goods. We also may hedge payment of forecasted intercompany transactions with our subsidiaries outside the United States. These contracts reduce currency risk from exchange rate movements. We generally hedge foreign currency price risks for periods from 3 to 24 months. Foreign exchange forward contracts and options are effective as hedges of identifiable, foreign currency commitments. We designate our foreign exchange forward contracts as cash flow hedging derivatives. The fair value of these contracts is classified as either an asset or liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We record gains and losses on these contracts as a component of other comprehensive income and reclassify them into earnings in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. A summary of foreign exchange forward contracts and options and the corresponding amounts at contracted forward rates is as follows: December 31, 2006 2005 Contract Amount Primary Currencies Contract Amount Primary Currencies In millions of dollars Foreign exchange forward contracts and options to purchase foreign currencies $ 29.0 Australian dollars Canadian dollars Euros $ 51.1 Australian dollars British sterling Euros We define the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts and options as the amount of the difference between the contracted and current market foreign currency exchange rates at the end of the period. We estimate the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts and options on a quarterly basis by obtaining market quotes for future contracts with similar terms, adjusted where necessary for maturity differences. 33 A summary of the fair value and market risk associated with foreign exchange forward contracts and options is as follows: December 31, 2006 2005 In millions of dollars Fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts and options asset $ 1.5 $ .4 Potential net loss in fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts and options of ten percent resulting from a hypothetical near-term adverse change in market rates $ .2 $ .1 Our risk related to foreign exchange forward contracts and options is limited to the cost of replacing the contracts at prevailing market rates. Commodities Price Risk Management and Futures Contracts Our most significant raw material requirements include cocoa, sugar, milk, peanuts and almonds. The cost of cocoa beans and prices for related futures contracts historically have been subject to wide fluctuations attributable to a variety of factors. These factors include: the effect of weather on crop yield; imbalances between supply and demand; currency exchange rates; political unrest in producing countries; and speculative influences. During 2006, cocoa prices traded in a relatively wide range between 67 and 75 per pound, based on the New York Board of Trade futures contract. Our costs will not necessarily reflect market price fluctuations because of our forward purchasing practices, premiums and discounts that reflect varying delivery times, and supply and demand for specific varieties and grades of cocoa beans. We attempt to minimize the effect of future price fluctuations related to the purchase of our raw materials by using forward purchasing to cover future manufacturing requirements generally for 3 to 24 months. We use futures contracts in combination with forward purchasing of cocoa and other commodities primarily to provide favorable pricing opportunities and flexibility in sourcing our raw material and energy requirements. We use fuel oil futures contracts to minimize price fluctuations associated with our transportation costs. Our commodity procurement practices are intended to reduce the risk of future price increases and provide visibility to future costs, but also may potentially limit our ability to benefit from possible price decreases. We account for commodities futures contracts in accordance with SFAS No. 133, as amended. We make or receive cash transfers to or from commodity futures brokers on a daily basis reflecting changes in the value of futures contracts on the New York Board of Trade or various other exchanges. These changes in value represent unrealized gains and losses. We report these cash transfers as a component of other comprehensive income. The cash transfers offset higher or lower cash requirements for the payment of future invoice prices of raw materials, energy requirements and transportation costs. Futures held in excess of the amount required to fix the price of unpriced physical forward contracts are effective as hedges of anticipated purchases. Sensitivity Analysis The following sensitivity analysis reflects our market risk to a hypothetical adverse market price movement of ten percent, based on our net commodity positions at four dates spaced equally throughout the year. Our net commodity positions consist of the amount of futures contracts we hold over or under the amount of futures contracts we need to price unpriced physical forward contracts for the same commodities. Inventories, priced 34 forward contracts and estimated anticipated purchases not yet under contract were not included in the sensitivity analysis calculations. We define a loss, for purposes of determining market risk, as the potential decrease in fair value or the opportunity cost resulting from the hypothetical adverse price movement. The fair values of net commodity positions reflect quoted market prices or estimated future prices, including estimated carrying costs corresponding with the future delivery period. For the years ended December 31, 2006 2005 Fair Value Market Risk (Hypothetical 10% Change) Fair Value Market Risk (Hypothetical 10% Change) In millions of dollars Highest long position $ 138.4 $ 13.8 $ 16.3 $ 1.6 Lowest long position (147.0 ) 14.7 (204.5 ) 20.5 Average position (long) (37.3 ) 3.7 (126.3 ) 12.6 The increase in fair values from 2005 to 2006 primarily reflected an increase in net commodity positions. The negative positions primarily resulted as unpriced physical forward contract futures requirements exceeded the amount of commodities futures that we held at certain points in time during the years. Sensitivity analysis disclosures represent forward-looking statements which are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those presently anticipated or projected. Factors that could affect the sensitivity analysis disclosures include: significant increases or decreases in market prices reflecting fluctuations attributable to the effect of weather on crop yield; imbalances between supply and demand; currency exchange rates; political unrest in producing countries; speculative influences; and changes in our hedging strategies. USE OF ESTIMATES AND OTHER CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. In various instances, GAAP requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We believe that our most critical accounting policies and estimates relate to the following: Accounts Receivable Trade Accrued Liabilities Pension and Other Post-Retirement Benefit Plans Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Commodities Futures Contracts Management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. While we base estimates and assumptions on our knowledge of current events and actions we may undertake in the future, actual results may ultimately differ from these estimates and assumptions. For a discussion of our significant accounting policies, refer to Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 35 Accounts Receivable Trade In the normal course of business, we extend credit to customers that satisfy pre-defined credit criteria. Our primary concentration of credit risk is associated with McLane Company, Inc., one of the largest wholesale distributors in the United States to convenience stores, drug stores, wholesale clubs and mass merchandisers. McLane Company, Inc. accounted for approximately 22.9% of our total accounts receivable as of December 31, 2006. As of December 31, 2006, no other customer accounted for more than 10% of our total accounts receivable. We believe we have little concentration of credit risk associated with the remainder of our customer base. Accounts Receivable Trade, as shown on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, were net of allowances and anticipated discounts. An allowance for doubtful accounts is determined through analysis of the following: Aging of accounts receivable at the date of the financial statements; Assessments of collectibility based on historical trends; and Evaluation of the impact of current and projected economic conditions. We monitor the collectibility of our accounts receivable on an ongoing basis by analyzing aged accounts receivable, assessing the credit worthiness of our customers and evaluating the impact of reasonably likely changes in economic conditions that may impact credit risks. Estimates with regard to the collectibility of accounts receivable are reasonably likely to change in the future. Information on our Accounts Receivable Trade, related expenses and assumptions is as follows: For the three-year period 2004-2006 In millions of dollars, except percents Average expense for potential uncollectible accounts $.8 Average write-offs of uncollectible accounts $2.4 Allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of gross accounts receivable 1% 3% We recognize the provision for uncollectible accounts as selling, marketing and administrative expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. If we made reasonably possible near-term changes in the most material assumptions regarding collectibility of accounts receivable, our annual provision could change within the following range: A reduction in expense of approximately $3.8 million; and An increase in expense of approximately $3.0 million. Changes in estimates for future uncollectible accounts receivable would not have a material impact on our liquidity or capital resources. Accrued Liabilities Accrued liabilities requiring the most difficult or subjective judgments include liabilities associated with marketing promotion programs and potentially unsaleable products. Liabilities associated with marketing promotion programs We recognize the costs of marketing promotion programs as a reduction to net sales along with a corresponding accrued liability based on estimates at the time of revenue recognition. Information on our promotional costs and assumptions is as follows: For the years ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 In millions of dollars Promotional costs $ 625.8 $ 583.5 $ 555.9 36 We determine the amount of the accrued liability by: Analysis of programs offered; Historical trends; Expectations regarding customer and consumer participation; Sales and payment trends; and Experience with payment patterns associated with similar, previously offered programs. The estimated costs of these programs are reasonably likely to change in the future due to changes in trends with regard to customer and consumer participation, particularly for new programs and for programs related to the introduction of new products. Reasonably possible near-term changes in the most material assumptions regarding the cost of promotional programs could result in changes within the following range: A reduction in costs of approximately $17.0 million An increase in costs of approximately $4.0 million Changes in these assumptions would affect net sales and income before income taxes. Over the three-year period ended December 31, 2006, actual promotion costs have not deviated from the estimated amounts by more than 6%. Changes in estimates related to the cost of promotional programs would not have a material impact on our liquidity or capital resources. Liabilities associated with potentially unsaleable products At the time of sale, we estimate a cost for the possibility that products will become aged or unsaleable in the future. The estimated cost is included as a reduction to net sales. A related accrued liability is determined using statistical analysis that incorporates historical sales trends, seasonal timing and sales patterns, and product movement at retail. Estimates for costs associated with unsaleable products may change as a result of inventory levels in the distribution channel, current economic trends, changes in consumer demand, the introduction of new products and changes in trends of seasonal sales in response to promotional programs. Over the three-year period ended December 31, 2006, costs associated with aged or unsaleable products have amounted to approximately 2% of gross sales. Reasonably possible near-term changes in the most material assumptions regarding the estimates of such costs would have increased or decreased net sales and income before income taxes in a range from $.5 million to $1.0 million. Over the three-year period ended December 31, 2006, actual costs have not deviated from our estimates by more than 1%. Reasonably possible near-term changes in the estimates of costs associated with unsaleable products would not have a material impact on our liquidity or capital resources. Pension and Other Post-Retirement Benefit Plans Overview We sponsor a number of defined benefit pension plans. The primary plans are The Hershey Company Retirement Plan and The Hershey Company Retirement Plan for Hourly Employees. These are cash balance 37 plans that provide pension benefits for most domestic employees. We monitor legislative and regulatory developments regarding cash balance plans, as well as recent court cases, for any impact on our plans. We also sponsor two primary post-retirement benefit plans. The health care plan is contributory, with participants contributions adjusted annually, and the life insurance plan is non-contributory. We fund domestic pension liabilities in accordance with the limits imposed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and Federal income tax laws. For years beginning after 2007, we will need to comply with the funding requirements of the Pension Protection Act of 2006. We fund non-domestic pension liabilities in accordance with laws and regulations applicable to those plans. We broadly diversify our pension plan assets, consisting primarily of domestic and international common stocks and fixed income securities. Short-term and long-term liabilities associated with benefit plans are primarily determined based on actuarial calculations. These calculations consider payroll and employee data, including age and years of service, along with actuarial assumptions at the date of the financial statements. We take into consideration long-term projections with regard to economic conditions, including interest rates, return on assets and the rate of increase in compensation levels. With regard to liabilities associated with post-retirement benefit plans that provide health care and life insurance, we take into consideration the long-term annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of the covered benefits. In compliance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions , and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions , we review the discount rate assumptions and may revise them annually. The expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption ( asset return assumption ) for funded plans is by its nature of a longer duration and revised only when long-term asset return projections demonstrate that need. In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132 (R) ( SFAS No. 158 ). SFAS No. 158 requires an employer that is a business entity and sponsors one or more single-employer defined benefit plans to: Recognize the funded status of a benefit plan measured as the difference between plan assets at fair value and the benefit obligation in its statement of financial position. For a pension plan, the benefit obligation is the projected benefit obligation; for any other post-retirement benefit plan, such as a retiree health care plan, the benefit obligation is the accumulated post-retirement benefit obligation. Recognize as a component of other comprehensive income, net of tax, the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise during the period but are not recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost. Measure defined benefit plan assets and obligations as of the date of the employer fiscal year-end statement of financial position. Disclose in the notes to financial statements additional information about certain effects on net periodic benefit cost for the next fiscal year that arise from delayed recognition of the gains or losses, prior service costs or credits, and transition asset or obligation. 38 We adopted the recognition and related disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 158 as of December 31, 2006. The impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 158 was as follows: Incremental Effect of Applying SFAS No. 158 on Individual Line Items in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2006 (in thousands of dollars) Before Application of SFAS No. 158 Adjustments Increase (Decrease) After Application of SFAS No. 158 Prepaid expenses and other current assets $ 100,224 $ (12,406 ) $ 87,818 Other assets 590,124 (143,940 ) 446,184 Total assets 4,313,911 (156,346 ) 4,157,565 Accrued liabilities 450,982 3,041 454,023 Other long-term liabilities 398,703 87,770 486,473 Deferred income taxes 395,188 (109,185 ) 286,003 Total liabilities 3,492,516 (18,374 ) 3,474,142 Accumulated other comprehensive loss (217 ) (137,972 ) (138,189 ) Total stockholders equity 821,395 (137,972 ) 683,423 Pension Plans Our pension plan costs and related assumptions were as follows: For the years ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 In millions of dollars Net periodic pension benefit costs $ 25.3 $ 29.9 $ 34.4 Assumptions: Average discount rate assumptions net periodic benefit cost calculation 5.4 % 5.7 % 6.0 % Average discount rate assumptions benefit obligation calculation 5.7 % 5.4 % 5.7 % Asset return assumptions 8.5 % 8.5 % 8.5 % Net Periodic Pension Benefit Costs We expect net periodic pension benefit income in 2007 primarily due to the better than expected asset return in 2006, the modifications announced in October 2006 which will reduce future benefits under The Hershey Company Retirement Plan, The Hershey Company Retirement Plan for Hourly Employees and the Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan, and the impact of a higher discount rate assumption as of December 31, 2006. The recognized net actuarial losses will be lower in 2007 primarily due to the better than expected asset return in 2006. Actuarial gains and losses may arise when actual experience differs from assumed experience or when we revise the actuarial assumptions used to value the plans obligations. We only amortize the unrecognized net actuarial gains/losses in excess of 10% of a respective plan projected benefit obligation, or the fair market value of assets, if greater. The estimated recognized net actuarial loss component of net periodic pension benefit costs for 2007 is $2.4 million. This amount was based on the December 31, 2006 unrecognized net actuarial loss of $175.1 million and an amortization period of primarily between thirteen and fifteen years. We present the unrecognized net actuarial loss in Note 12, Pension and Other Post-Retirement Benefit Plans. The thirteen to fifteen year amortization period equals the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits under the plans ( average remaining service period ). Changes to the assumed rates of participant termination, disability and retirement would affect the average remaining service period. An increase in these rates would decrease the average remaining service period 39 and a decrease in these rates would have the opposite effect. However, we anticipate no changes to the assumed rates at this time. The 2006 recognized net actuarial loss component of net periodic pension benefit costs was $12.1 million. Projections beyond 2007 are dependent on a variety of factors such as changes to the discount rate and the actual return on pension plan assets. Average Discount Rate Assumption Net Periodic Benefit Costs The discount rate represents the estimated rate at which we could effectively settle our pension benefit obligations. In order to estimate this rate for 2006, a single effective rate of discount was determined by our actuaries after discounting the pension obligation cash flows using the spot rate of matching duration from the Citigroup Pension Discount Curve. In 2005 and 2004, we considered the yields of high quality securities in determining the average discount rate assumptions. High quality securities are generally considered to be those receiving a rating no lower than the second highest given by a recognized rating agency. The duration of such securities is reasonably comparable to the duration of our pension plan liabilities. The use of a different discount rate assumption can significantly affect net periodic benefit cost: A one-percentage point decrease in the discount rate assumption would have increased 2006 net periodic pension benefit cost by $14.2 million. A one-percentage point increase in the discount rate assumption would have decreased 2006 net periodic pension benefit cost by $12.1 million. Average Discount Rate Assumption Benefit Obligations The discount rate assumption to be used in calculating the amount of benefit obligations is determined in the same manner as the average discount rate assumption used to calculate net periodic benefit cost as described above. We increased our 2006 discount rate assumption due to the increasing interest rate environment. The use of a different discount rate assumption can significantly affect the amount of benefit obligations: A one-percentage point decrease in the discount rate assumption would have increased the December 31, 2006 pension benefits obligations by $136.7 million. A one-percentage point increase in the discount rate assumption would have decreased the December 31, 2006 pension benefits obligations by $114.9 million. Asset Return Assumptions We based the expected return on plan assets component of net periodic pension benefit costs on the fair market value of pension plan assets. To determine the expected return on plan assets, we consider the current and expected asset allocations, as well as historical and expected returns on the categories of plan assets. The historical geometric average return over the 19 years prior to December 31, 2006 was approximately 9.9%. The actual return on assets was as follows: For the years ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Actual return on assets 15.7 % 7.8 % 10.7 % The use of a different asset return assumption can significantly affect net periodic benefit cost: A one-percentage point decrease in the asset return assumption would have increased 2006 net periodic pension benefit cost by $12.3 million. A one-percentage point increase in the asset return assumption would have decreased 2006 net periodic pension benefit cost by $12.3 million. 40 Our asset investment policies specify ranges of asset allocation percentages for each asset class. The ranges for the domestic pension plans were as follows: Asset Class Allocation Range Equity securities 50% 85% Debt securities 15% 50% Cash and certain other investments 0% 5% As of December 31, 2006, actual allocations were within the specified ranges. We expect the level of volatility in pension plan asset returns to be in line with the overall volatility of the markets and weightings within the asset classes. For 2006 and 2005, minimum funding requirements for the plans were not material. However, we made contributions of $23.6 million in 2006 and $277.5 million in 2005 to improve the funded status. These contributions were fully tax deductible. A one-percentage point change in the funding discount rate or asset return assumptions would not have changed the 2006 minimum funding requirements for the domestic plans. For 2007, there will be no minimum funding requirements for the domestic plans and minimum funding requirements for the non-domestic plans will not be material. Post-Retirement Benefit Plans Other post-retirement benefit plan costs and related assumptions were as follows: For the years ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 In millions of dollars Net periodic other post-retirement benefit cost $ 28.7 $ 24.6 $ 24.3 Assumptions: Average discount rate assumption 5.4 % 5.7 % 6.0 % The use of a different discount rate assumption can significantly affect net periodic other post-retirement benefit cost: A one-percentage point decrease in the discount rate assumption would have increased 2006 net periodic other post-retirement benefit cost by $1.9 million. A one-percentage point increase in the discount rate assumption would have decreased 2006 net periodic other post-retirement benefit cost by $1.6 million. Other post-retirement benefit obligation assumptions were as follows: December 31, 2006 2005 In millions of dollars Other post-retirement benefit obligation $ 345.1 $ 355.9 Assumptions: Benefit obligations discount rate assumption 5.7 % 5.4 % A one-percentage point decrease in the discount rate assumption would have increased the December 31, 2006 other post-retirement benefits obligations by $37.9 million. A one-percentage point increase in the discount rate assumption would have decreased the December 31, 2006 other post-retirement benefits obligations by $31.6 million. 41 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets We account for goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets . This standard classifies intangible assets into three categories: (1) intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization; (2) intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization; and (3) goodwill. For intangible assets with definite lives, the standard requires impairment testing if conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. For intangible assets with indefinite lives and for goodwill, the standard requires impairment testing at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that these assets might be impaired. We use a two-step process to evaluate goodwill for impairment. In the first step, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit with the carrying amount of the reporting unit, including goodwill. We estimate the fair value of the reporting unit based on discounted future cash flows. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit, we complete a second step to determine the amount of the goodwill impairment that we should record. In the second step, we determine an implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill by allocating the reporting unit fair value to all of its assets and liabilities other than goodwill (including any unrecognized intangible assets). We compare the resulting implied fair value of the goodwill to the carrying amount and record an impairment charge for the difference. The assumptions we used to estimate fair value are based on the past performance of each reporting unit and reflect the projections and assumptions that we use in current operating plans. We also consider assumptions that market participants may use. Such assumptions are subject to change due to changing economic and competitive conditions. Our other intangible assets consist primarily of customer-related intangible assets, patents and trademarks obtained through business acquisitions. We amortize customer-related intangible assets and patents over their estimated useful lives. The useful lives of trademarks were determined to be indefinite and, therefore, we do not amortize them. We evaluate our trademarks for impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the assets to their estimated fair value. If the estimated fair value is less than the carrying amount, we record an impairment charge to reduce the asset to its estimated fair value. The estimated fair value is generally determined based on discounted future cash flows. We completed our annual impairment tests and determined that none of our goodwill or other intangible assets was impaired as of December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. Commodities Futures Contracts We use futures contracts in combination with forward purchasing of cocoa and other commodities primarily to reduce the risk of future price increases, provide visibility to future costs and take advantage of market fluctuations. Accounting for commodities futures contracts is in accordance with SFAS No. 133, as amended. Additional information with regard to accounting policies associated with commodities futures contracts and other derivative instruments is contained in Note 5, Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. Our gains (losses) on cash flow hedging derivatives were as follows: For the years ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 In millions of dollars Net after-tax gains (losses) on cash flow hedging derivatives $ 11.4 $ (6.5 ) $ 16.3 Reclassification adjustments from accumulated other comprehensive loss to income (5.3 ) 18.1 26.1 Hedge ineffectiveness gains (losses) recognized in cost of sales, before tax 2.0 (2.0 ) .4 42 We reflected reclassification adjustments related to gains or losses on commodities futures contracts in cost of sales. No gains or losses on commodities futures contracts resulted because we discontinued a hedge due to the probability that the forecasted hedged transaction would not occur. We recognized no components of gains or losses on commodities futures contracts in income due to excluding such components from the hedge effectiveness assessment. The amount of net losses on cash flow hedging derivatives, including foreign exchange forward contracts and options, and commodities futures contracts, expected to be reclassified into earnings in the next twelve months was approximately $4.6 million after tax as of December 31, 2006. This amount is primarily associated with commodities futures contracts. RETURN MEASURES We believe that two important measures of profitability are operating return on average stockholders equity and operating return on average invested capital. These operating return measures calculated in accordance with GAAP are presented on the SIX-YEAR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL SUMMARY on page 15 with the directly comparable Non-GAAP operating return measures. The Non-GAAP operating return measures are calculated using Non-GAAP Income excluding items affecting comparability. A reconciliation of Net Income presented in accordance with GAAP to Non-GAAP Income excluding items affecting comparability is provided on pages 17 and 18, along with the reasons why we believe that the use of Non-GAAP Income in these calculations provides useful information to investors. Operating Return on Average Stockholders Equity Operating return on average stockholders equity is calculated by dividing net income by the average of beginning and ending stockholders equity. To calculate Non-GAAP operating return on average stockholders equity, we define Non-GAAP Income as net income adjusted to exclude certain items. These items include the following: Amortization of indefinite-lived intangibles for all years After-tax effect of the business realignment initiatives in 2006, 2005, 2003, 2002 and 2001 Adjustment to income tax contingency reserves which reduced the provision for income taxes in 2004 After-tax gain on the sale of a group of our gum brands in 2003 After-tax effect of incremental expenses to explore the possible sale of our Company in 2002 After-tax gain on the sale of the Luden throat drops business in 2001 Our operating return on average stockholders equity, GAAP basis, was 65.8% in 2006. Our Non-GAAP operating return on average stockholders equity was 66.7% in 2006. The increase in operating return on average stockholders equity in 2006 was principally due to a reduction in equity resulting from share repurchases and the adoption of SFAS No. 158. Over the last six years, our Non-GAAP operating return on stockholders equity has ranged from 32.1% in 2001 to 66.7% in 2006. Operating Return on Average Invested Capital Operating return on average invested capital is calculated by dividing earnings by average invested capital. Average invested capital consists of the annual average of the beginning and ending balances of long-term debt, deferred income taxes and stockholders equity. 43 For the calculation of operating return on average invested capital, GAAP basis, earnings is defined as net income less the after-tax effect of interest on long-term debt. For the calculation of the Non-GAAP operating return measure, we define earnings as net income adjusted to exclude the following: Amortization of indefinite-lived intangibles for all years After-tax effect of the business realignment initiatives in 2006, 2005, 2003, 2002 and 2001 Adjustment to income tax contingency reserves on the provision for income taxes in 2004 After-tax gain on the sale of a group of our gum brands in 2003 After-tax effect of incremental expenses to explore the possible sale of our Company in 2002 After-tax gain on the sale of the Luden throat drops business in 2001 After-tax effect of interest on long-term debt Our operating return on average invested capital, GAAP basis, was 26.4% in 2006. Our Non-GAAP operating return on average invested capital was 26.8% in 2006. Over the last six years, our Non-GAAP operating return on average invested capital has ranged from 18.1% in 2001 to 26.8% in 2006 and 2005. OUTLOOK The outlook section contains a number of forward-looking statements, all of which are based on current expectations. Actual results may differ materially. Refer to Risk Factors on page 8 for information concerning the key risks to achieving our future performance goals. During the three years ended December 31, 2006, we have improved operating results as we implemented our business strategies. Over the long-term, our strategies seek to achieve the following goals, excluding items affecting comparability: Net sales growth of 3% 4% per year; Annual growth in EBIT of 7% 9%; Improvement in EBIT margin of 70 90 basis points per year; and EPS growth of 9% 11% per year. Our focus in 2007 includes enhancing the relevance of our products, extending our reach and enabling our growth. Key priorities include the following: Accelerating core brand growth; Investing in innovative new product platforms; Refocusing snack adjacencies; Disciplined global expansion; and Providing affordability by expanding gross margin. We expect sales growth in 2007 to be within our long-term goal of 3% to 4%. Our top priority is restoring and accelerating core brand growth, with renewed emphasis on our iconic brands, particularly Kisses, Hershey and Reese s. Investment in these brands will double in 2007 with enhanced advertising, increased consumer support and powerful in-store merchandising. Emphasis during 2007 will also be focused on on-trend growth platforms that leverage our iconic brands, our confectionery and nut expertise and our marketplace scale. The primary growth platforms that we will focus on in 2007 are: Dark and premium chocolate; 44 Refreshment products; Health and wellness products; and Substantial snacks. Growth in the dark and premium chocolate platform will be driven by the Cacao Reserve by Hershey product line introduced in 2006, sales growth for Hershey Extra Dark and Special Dark products, and expansion of sales of Scharffen Berger and Joseph Schmidt dark and premium chocolates. Increases in sales of refreshment products are expected from Ice Breakers gum and mint items, driven by the introduction of new gum and mint sours products. York chocolate-covered chewy mints, introduced in late 2006, will also contribute to sales increases in 2007. Increased sales for our health and wellness product platform will be generated by sixty calorie and one hundred calorie portion control products that leverage our scale brands, along with incremental sales of the Dagoba organic chocolates business acquired in late 2006. Growth will also be contributed from the introduction of Ice Breakers mint and gum products that contain Vitamin C, ginseng and antioxidants. Growth in the substantial snack platform is anticipated from sales of new layered sandwich cookies, single-serve soft cookies and brownies primarily under the Hershey and Reese brand names. Sales increases are also expected from our Really Nuts product line in 2007. Over time, we will focus on disciplined global expansion in selected high potential markets with a regionally relevant product portfolio. Geographically, we expect future net sales growth to be concentrated primarily in emerging markets in Asia, particularly India and China, Mexico and selected markets in South America. We intend to focus on growth from our large-scale brands, expand our sales to global customers and develop region-specific business systems and alliances. We expect a return to gross margin expansion in 2007, excluding items affecting comparability. We expect higher input costs in 2007, compared with 2006, although to a lesser extent than the cost increases in 2006 compared with 2005. The amount of these cost increases will be subject to changes in market conditions for costs that we have not fully hedged. We utilize forward purchasing and commodity futures contracts and maintain a commodity procurement function to assess market fundamentals and develop procurement strategies. We expect to offset these cost increases through a combination of the following: Improved sales mix from higher margin single serve products and new product platforms; Reduced costs for product obsolescence; Effective procurement strategies; Continued improvements in supply chain productivity; and Cost control initiatives. EBIT is expected to grow 3% to 4% in 2007, excluding items affecting comparability. Net sales growth and gross margin expansion will be substantially offset by increased investment in trade and consumer promotional programs and advertising, along with investment in our international businesses. EBIT margin is expected to be flat in 2007, excluding items affecting comparability. EBIT margin is affected by the following factors: Selling prices; Promotional allowances; Raw material and other input costs; 45 Supply chain efficiencies; The mix of products sold in any period; Investment in advertising and consumer marketing programs; and Selling and administrative expenses. Improvement in gross margin resulting from a more profitable sales mix and continued enhancement of supply chain productivity is expected to be offset by increased brand investment and the impact of our expanded international operations. Selling, marketing and administrative expenses will increase as a percentage of sales during 2007. This is expected to result from increased advertising and consumer marketing expenses, and improvements in retail coverage and technology, along with the restoration of certain administrative expenses that were unusually low during 2006 because of our business realignment initiatives and lower than expected performance. Net income and EPS in 2006 were unfavorably impacted by the 2005 business realignment initiatives. Excluding the impact of business realignment initiatives, net income is expected to increase 3% to 4% and EPS is expected to increase within a range of 7% to 9% for the full year 2007, reflecting the impact of lower weighted average shares outstanding resulting from share repurchases. We expect strong cash flows from operating activities in 2007. Net cash provided from operating activities is expected to exceed cash requirements for capital additions, capitalized software additions and anticipated dividend payments. We will continue to monitor the funded status of pension plans based on market performance and make future contributions as appropriate. The plans were sufficiently funded at the end of 2006. We do not anticipate significant pension plan contributions in 2007. We will continue to repurchase shares of our Common Stock during 2007 under the $250 million share repurchase program approved in December 2006. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS In January 2007, our Company and Lotte Confectionery Co., LTD., Korea leading confectionery and ice cream manufacturer, announced a manufacturing joint venture in China that will produce Hershey and Lotte products for the market in China. The manufacturing agreement is part of a strategic alliance that enables the companies to explore opportunities for marketing and distribution of products in Asia and the United States. The manufacturing facility, located in Jinshan, near Shanghai, will make a variety of Hershey , Hershey Kisses and Reese products and is expected to be in operation by June 2007, with products available in retail locations in China by August 2007. As part of the agreement, we will provide Lotte with expertise and distribution capabilities in the United States and will help test and distribute Lotte Xylitol gum and a variety of other refreshment products. In February 2007, our Board of Directors approved a comprehensive, three-year supply chain transformation program. We expect to complete this program by December 31, 2009. When completed, this program will greatly enhance our manufacturing, sourcing and customer service capabilities, and will generate significant resources to invest in our growth initiatives. These initiatives include accelerated marketplace momentum within our core U.S. business, creation of innovative new product platforms to meet consumer and customer needs, and disciplined global expansion. Under the program, which we will implement in stages over the next three years, we will: Significantly increase manufacturing capacity utilization by reducing the number of production lines by more than one-third; Outsource production of low value-added items; and, Construct a flexible, cost-effective production facility in Monterrey, Mexico to meet current and emerging marketplace needs. 46 The result of our transformation program will be a flexible, global supply chain capable of delivering our iconic brands, in a wide range of affordable items and assortments, across retail channels in our priority markets. We will source finished products from fewer facilities, each one a center of excellence specializing in our proprietary product technologies. Increased access to borderless sourcing will further leverage our manufacturing scale within a lower overall cost structure. We have developed a phased, three-year plan to ensure smooth implementation and to maintain product quality and customer service. The program will result in a total net reduction of approximately 1,500 positions across our supply chain over the next three years. When completed, manufacturing of approximately 80 percent of our production volume will take place in the U.S. and Canada. We estimate that the program will incur pre-tax charges and non-recurring project implementation costs of $525 million to $575 million over the next three years. This estimate includes $275 million to $300 million in asset write-offs, $200 million to $225 million in employment-related costs, including the impact of curtailment charges associated with our pension and other post-retirement benefit plans, and approximately $50 million in project implementation costs. We will incur these charges primarily in 2007 and 2008, with approximately $300 million expected to be charged in 2007. We estimate the cash portion of the total charge to be $275 million to $300 million. This initiative also includes gross capital investments of $300 million to $310 million. Capital investments over the implementation period are expected to be approximately $200 million more than previous expectations of $190 million to $200 million per year, resulting in total capital expenditures of $250 million to $300 million in 2007 and $225 million to $250 million in 2008 and 2009. Following completion of this initiative, we expect annual capital investments of approximately $140 million to $160 million. As a result of the program, we estimate that our gross margin should improve significantly, with on-going annual savings of approximately $170 million to $190 million generated by 2010. We will invest a portion of these savings in our strategic growth initiatives, in such areas as core brand growth, new product innovation, selling and go-to-market capabilities, and disciplined global expansion. The amount and timing of this investment will be contingent upon market conditions and the pace of our innovation and global expansion. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 ( FIN No. 48 ). FIN No. 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise financial statements in accordance with FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. FIN No. 48 describes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. FIN No. 48 was effective for our Company as of January 1, 2007. We do not expect any significant changes to the recognition and measurement of our tax positions or to our effective income tax rate as a result of the adoption of this new accounting interpretation. In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, Fair Value Measurements ( SFAS No. 157 ). SFAS No. 157 establishes a framework for measuring fair value in GAAP, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for our Company beginning January 1, 2008. We have not yet determined the impact of the adoption of this new accounting standard. 47 In February 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities ( SFAS No. 159 ). SFAS No. 159 permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value and establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between entities that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities. SFAS No. 159 is effective for our Company beginning January 1, 2008. We have not yet determined the impact, if any, from the adoption of SFAS No. 159.
