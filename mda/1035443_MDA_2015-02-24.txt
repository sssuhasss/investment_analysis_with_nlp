ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties regarding events, conditions, and financial trends that may affect our future plans of operation, business strategy, results of operations, and financial position. A number of important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those included within or contemplated by such forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, those described under Item 1A. Risk Factors in this annual report on Form 10-K. We do not undertake any responsibility to update any of these factors or to announce publicly any revisions to any of the forward-looking statements contained in this or any other document, whether as a result of new information, as a result of future events, or otherwise. As used in this report, references to the Company, Alexandria, we, us, and our refer to Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. and its subsidiaries. Executive Summary We are very pleased with the execution of our strategic business plan resulting in our 2014 total return performance of 44.7%. In 2014, we celebrated the 20th anniversary of the founding of Alexandria. We began the year with confidence in our business, driven by continued strong performance in the core asset base, positive factors resulting in accelerating demand for our Class A office/laboratory and tech office properties in our urban innovation cluster campuses, a valuable near-term development pipeline primed to deliver continued growth, and a disciplined approach to allocation of capital. Our current value-creation pipeline aggregating 2.3 million rentable square feet was 90% leased or under negotiation as of December 31, 2014. At the end of 2014, occupancy of our North American operating properties was 97.0% , up 110 bps from the end of 2013, and occupancy of our operating and redevelopment properties was 96.1%, up 60 bps from the end of 2013. Our leasing activity remained robust with 2,768,833 RSF leased in 2014 and our growth for both cash rental rates from lease renewals/re-leasing of space and same property NOI (cash basis) were greater than 5% for 2014. Our core operations remained strong in 2014 and we are poised to continue delivering earnings growth in 2015. We continued to carefully execute on our long term capital plan in 2014, and closed the year with a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ( Adjusted EBITDA ) ratio of 7.2 times and a fixed charge coverage ratio of 3.3 times for the fourth quarter of 2014 on an annualized basis. We successfully completed a $700 million offering of unsecured senior notes at an average interest rate of 3.50% and average maturity of 9.6 years. We also reduced our non-income-producing assets as a percentage of gross investments in real estate to 16% as of December 31, 2014, with a further projected decrease to 13% by the end of the first quarter of 2015. In August 2014, Standard & Poor Rating Services raised its credit outlook for the Company to Positive from Stable, reflecting continued and further expected improvement in our key credit metrics and growth in cash flows. Our capital plan in 2015 to fund our value-creation projects includes (i) net cash provided by operating activities after dividends, (ii) unsecured debt funding supported by significant growth in EBITDA, and (iii) sales of land, high-value core-like operating assets, and non-core operating assets. In the fourth quarter of 2014 and January 2015, we completed real estate sales aggregating $113.4 million of land and non-core operating assets and had an additional $122.0 million of assets held for sale as of December 31, 2014. Our acquisitions remain targeted in our core urban cluster submarkets. In January 2015, we acquired 640 Memorial Drive, a 222,504 RSF, 100% leased, Class A, LEED Gold Certified, office/laboratory building in Mid-Cambridge, near the MIT campus for $176.5 million. In connection with the acquisition, we assumed a secured note payable of $82 million with an interest rate of 3.93% and a maturity date in 2023. In January 2015, we also executed an agreement to purchase the outstanding 10% noncontrolling interest in our flagship campus at Alexandria Technology Square in the Cambridge submarket for $108.3 million. This purchase will be paid in two installments of approximately $54.0 million each in April 1, 2015, and April 1, 2016. We have owned 90% of this 1.2 million RSF urban innovation campus since its purchase from Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2006, and have since doubled the campus NOI from $30 million in 2006 to $64 million in 2014. The campus occupancy was 99.5% as of December 31, 2014, however, we believe we are poised to capture significant rent growth from 81% of the leases contractually ending over the next five years and also enhance our returns through potential campus expansion of an additional 100,000 RSF. 60 The disciplined execution of our strategic business plan in 2014 resulted in an FFO per share attributable to Alexandria common stockholders, as adjusted, of $4.80 for 2014, up 9.1% over 2013. Transitioning into 2015, we continue to remain focused on allocating our precious capital into markets with strong fundamentals, accelerating demand, and limited supply. With our strong balance sheet in place, overlapping demand from the science and technology sectors in submarkets such as Mission Bay/SoMa and Cambridge, as well as strong rental rate growth across many of our key urban markets, we remain confident in our ability to deliver consistent and solid growth in FFO per share and NAV in 2015. Results Operating results Total revenues were $726.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 , up 15.2% , compared to $631.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 ; 56% of total ABR as of December 31, 2014 , was from investment-grade client tenants; NOI was $508.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 , up 15.0% , compared to $442.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 , driven by deliveries of our value-creation projects, same property NOI growth, and leasing activity further described below; Operating margins were 70% for the year ended December 31, 2014 ; Same property ( Same Properties ) NOI increased 4.5% and 5.5% (cash basis) for the year ended December 31, 2014 , compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 ; and Our same property performance and operating margins remained solid, primarily due to the strong occupancy percentage of our asset base, solid leasing activity, and our favorable lease structure, as further described below. The following table presents information regarding our asset base and value-creation projects as of December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012 : December 31, (Rentable square feet) 2014 2013 2012 Operating properties 16,727,985 15,534,238 15,435,147 Development properties 1,857,520 1,826,919 1,566,774 Redevelopment properties 143,777 99,873 547,092 RSF of total properties 18,729,282 17,461,030 17,549,013 Number of properties 193 184 181 Occupancy in North America at year-end operating 97.0 % 95.9 % 94.6 % Occupancy in North America at year-end operating and redevelopment 96.1 % 95.5 % 91.6 % ABR per occupied RSF at year-end $ 37.23 $ 35.90 $ 34.59 Leasing activity Executed a total of 190 leases during the year ended December 31, 2014 , with a weighted average lease term of 7.3 years , for 2,768,833 RSF, including 1,321,317 RSF related to our development, redevelopment, and previously vacant projects; Achieved rental rate increases for renewed/re-leased space of 13.3% and 5.4% (cash basis); and Increased the occupancy rate for operating and redevelopment properties in North America by 60 bps to 96.1% as of December 31, 2014 , from December 31, 2013. Approximately 61% of the 190 leases executed during the year ended December 31, 2014 , did not include concessions for free rent. Tenant concessions/free rent averaged approximately 2.8 months and tenant improvements/lease commissions per square foot was $12.62 , with respect to the 2,768,833 RSF leased during the year ended December 31, 2014 . 61 The following chart presents renewed/re-leased space and development/redevelopment/previously vacant space leased for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013, and 2014: Lease structure Our Same Properties (cash basis) NOI increase for the year ended December 31, 2014 , of 5.5% and Same Properties operating margin of 69% benefited significantly from our favorable lease structure. As of December 31, 2014 , approximately 95% of our leases (on an RSF basis) were triple net leases, requiring client tenants to pay substantially all real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, common area expenses, and other operating expenses (including increases thereto) in addition to base rent. Additionally, approximately 94% of our leases (on an RSF basis) contained effective annual rent escalations that were either fixed or indexed based on a consumer price index or another index, and approximately 93% of our leases (on an RSF basis) provided for the recapture of certain capital expenditures.

We subsequently leased 100% of the project to accommodate an expansion requirement of an existing tenant. (4) In the third quarter of 2014, Alexandria and Uber Technologies, Inc. ( Uber ) formed a joint venture and acquired key land parcels for the ground-up development of two Class A buildings. Alexandria holds a 51% interest in the joint venture and Uber holds a 49% interest. Additionally, Alexandria executed a 15-year lease with Uber. The purchase price of the land parcels, includes 423 parking structure spaces, foundation piles, plans, and permits, and was funded by contributions from Alexandria and Uber. The land parcels are fully entitled, and include Proposition M office allocation approvals. See page 51 for details of this development project. The design and budget of this project are in process, and the estimated project cost with related yields are expected to be disclosed in the near future. (5) We acquired 9625 Towne Centre Drive in the fourth quarter of 2014 with an in-place lease.

The purchase price will be paid in two installments of approximately $54.0 million each on April 1, 2015, and April 1, 2016. 64 Real estate asset sales The sale of non-strategic, non-income-producing-assets and non-core/ core-like operating assets provided a significant source of capital to fund our highly pre-leased value-creation development and redevelopment projects described above. Our real estate asset sales during the year ended December 31, 2014 , and January 2015, and remainder of assets held for sale as of December 31, 2014, consisted of the following (dollars in thousands): Dispositions Property/Market Submarket Classification Prior to Sale Square Feet Annualized NOI (1) Sales Price/NBV (2) Gain on Sale 2014 Impairments Dispositions in 2014 Various/San Francisco Bay Area South San Francisco Land 370,307 $ 802 $ 31,000 (3) $ $ 24,700 (3) 810 Dexter Avenue/Seattle Lake Union Land 150,000 375 19,000 797 124 Terry Avenue North/Seattle Lake Union Land 200,000 (51 ) 11,500 3,834 Non-Cluster Land 312,950 (244 ) 17,880 1,772 882 79,380 6,403 24,700 Various/San Diego Sorrento Valley & Sorrento Mesa Rental Properties 62,346 (471 ) 7,447 (4) 1,838 Dispositions in 2014 411 86,827 8,241 24,700 Held for sale as of 12/31/14 dispositions in January 2015 661 University Avenue/Canada Toronto Rental Properties N/A (1,363 ) 54,104 (5) 16,621 (5) Pennsylvania Rental Properties 21,859 3 1,900 794 Dispositions in January 2015 (1,360 ) 56,004 17,415 Dispositions in 2014 and January 2015 (949 ) 142,831 $ 8,241 42,115 Held for sale as of 12/31/14 pending sales 500 Forbes Boulevard/San Francisco Bay Area South San Francisco Rental Properties 155,685 5,539 107,848 (6) TBD 9,560 (6) Other Rental Properties 100,441 1,124 14,175 TBD Pending sales 6,663 122,023 9,560 Total dispositions completed and remainder of assets held for sale $ 5,714 $ 264,854 $ 51,675 (1) Annualized using actual results for the quarter ended prior to date of sale or the fourth quarter of 2014 for assets held for sale as of December 31, 2014. (2) Represents sale price for assets sold or net book value for pending sales as of December 31, 2014, net of impairment charges recognized in the fourth quarter of 2014. (3) During the fourth quarter of 2014, we sold nine non-contiguous land parcels with seven industrial buildings with occupancy of 98% located in the industrial park areas of South San Francisco near Associated Road, Rozzi Place, and Eccles Avenue to a single buyer focused on operating, redeveloping, and developing industrial properties. The sale price was approximately $31 million and reduced our developable square footage in aggregate by 370,307 SF. Additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2014 and prior to the sale, we recognized impairment charges on these land parcels aggregating $24.7 million to reduce their net book value to fair value less cost to sell. We acquired these parcels in 2006 and 2007 with the intention of creating an amenity-rich campus in South San Francisco. Our goal was to capture significant expansion and growth of major biotech companies prior to the financial crisis in 2008. A significant amount of the expansion plans by major biotech companies were approved by the city of South San Francisco. As we executed very successfully on our Class A campus aggregating 407,369 RSF on long-term leases to the investment-grade-rated tenant, Amgen Inc. and allocated capital to other high-demand urban innovation campuses in Mission Bay and Cambridge, we will invest the sale proceeds immediately into highly leased value-creation ground-up development projects. (4) These properties were classified as held for sale /discontinued operations prior to October 2014, therefore the NOI and gain on sale are classified in income from discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of income. (5) Represents land and land improvements subject to a ground lease with the Company as a lessee. Our annualized net operating loss of $1.4 million primarily represents ground rent expense. Prior to the sale, our land and land improvements were leased to a tenant and the tenant was completing the construction of a 780,540 RSF building. Rental payments from the tenant were expected to commence upon completion and stabilization of the building. (6) During the fourth quarter of 2014, we committed to the sale of an operating property with a 155,685 RSF building located in South San Francisco, classified it as held for sale, and accordingly, recognized an impairment charge of $9.6 million to reduce its net book value to our estimate of fair value less cost to sell of $107.8 million. The impairment is primarily related to the write-off of non-cash items related to improvements received from a prior tenant and an acquired below market lease. These non-cash items had a net book value of $17.7 million immediately prior to recognition of the impairment charge. The property was originally acquired in 2007 and is currently leased to an investment-grade-rated client tenant through 2019. We expect to complete the sale in 2015 at a low cap rate and immediately invest the proceeds into highly leased value-creation ground-up development projects. 65 Execution of capital strategy During 2014, we continued to execute on many of the long-term components of our capital strategy including the following key accomplishments: Achieved solid key credit metric ratios, including a net debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio of 7.2 times and a fixed charge coverage ratio of 3.3 times for the fourth quarter of 2014 on an annualized basis; Reduced our non-income-producing assets (construction in progress and land) to 16% of our gross investments in real estate as of December 31, 2014 , and expect to further reduce this percentage to 13% by March 31, 2015, primarily through deliveries of our highly pre-leased development projects; Completed the successful offering of $700 million of unsecured senior notes consisting of $400 million of 2.75% unsecured senior notes payable due in 2020 ( 2.75% Unsecured Senior Notes ) and $300 million of 4.50% unsecured senior notes payable due in 2029 ( 4.50% Unsecured Senior Notes ); extended average remaining term of outstanding debt to 5.6 years as of December 31, 2014 ; Maintained significant liquidity of approximately $1.45 billion as of December 31, 2014 ; Executed additional interest rate swap agreements to provide a minimum of hedged variable-rate debt of $500 million in both 2015 and 2016; In August 2014, Standard & Poor Ratings Services raised their credit outlook for Alexandria to Positive from Stable, reflecting continued and further expected improvement in key credit metrics and growth in cash flows; and Maintained a high-quality client tenant base; as of December 31, 2014, 56% of our total annualized base rent was from investment-grade client tenants. During 2015, we intend to continue executing this capital strategy to achieve further improvements to our credit rating, allowing us to further reduce our cost of capital and continue our disciplined approach to capital allocation that generates strong yields. For further information, see Projected Results below. Balance sheet As described above, we successfully executed our long-term capital strategy in 2014, continuing to strengthen our balance sheet and credit profile. We expect to continue the transition of our balance sheet debt from short-term and medium-term bank debt to long-term unsecured fixed-rate debt over the next several years. However, some bank debt will remain a component of our long-term capital structure, primarily consisting of an unsecured senior line of credit for liquidity and flexibility, and if appropriate, unsecured senior bank term loans. The transition from unhedged variable-rate bank debt to longer-term fixed-rate debt is expected to result in an increase in our interest costs. Growth in earnings from core operations and completion of Class A development projects is expected to generate growth in per share earnings and FFO, even after consideration of projected increases in interest expense related to refinancing outstanding variable-rate bank debt. Our capital structure will also continue to benefit from longer and laddered debt maturities, less LIBOR-based variable interest rate risk, and continued access to diverse sources of capital. While this transition from unhedged variable-rate bank debt is in process, we expect to utilize interest rate swap agreements to reduce our interest rate risk. The transition of unhedged variable-rate bank debt to longer-term fixed-rate unsecured bonds is not expected to impact the highly effective designation of the existing interest rate swap agreements as of December 31, 2014 . Our forecasts assume outstanding unhedged variable-rate debt in an amount at least equal to our effective notional amount of interest rate swap agreements in effect at any point in time. Secured mortgage notes payable will remain a small portion of our capital structure, and we may utilize secured construction loans for our value-creation development projects from time to time. In addition, we expect to continue to maintain a significant proportion of unencumbered NOI, to allow for future flexibility to access both the unsecured and secured debt markets. For the year ended December 31, 2014, our unencumbered NOI as a percentage of total NOI was 84% . During the three months ended December 31, 2014, we purchased 513,500 outstanding shares of our Series D Convertible Preferred Stock at an aggregate price of $14.4 million, or $27.975 per share, in a privately negotiated transaction. Our capital plan for 2015 assumes no additional purchases of our Series D Convertible Stock. We expect our EBITDA to grow significantly in 2015. This growth in EBITDA, plus cash flows from operating activities, after dividends, is expected to allow us to borrow additional debt in 2015 on a leverage neutral basis and provide significant capital to fund value-creation development projects. 66 We expect to match-fund a portion of our capital needs to fund high-value Class A, pre-leased value-creation development and redevelopment projects with net proceeds from asset sales. We expect to identify real estate assets for sale, including land and non-core/ core-like operating assets, over the next several quarters to generate proceeds for reinvestment into our value-creation projects. The amount of asset sales necessary to meet our forecasted sources of capital will vary depending upon the amount of EBITDA associated with the assets sold. For example, the sale of an income-producing property benefits leverage less than the sale of a non-income producing land parcel. Additionally, we expect to continue to execute our strategy to deliver solid growth in FFO per share attributable to Alexandria common stockholders diluted, and net asset value in 2015, including any impact of asset sales. As of December 31, 2014 , we had five properties held for sale with an aggregate net book value of $178.0 million . In addition, we completed the sale of two of these properties in January 2015, with an aggregate sales price of $56.0 million . We may identify additional properties for potential sale in 2015 and thereafter. As of December 31, 2014 , approximately 16% of our gross real estate represented non-income-producing assets (construction in progess and land). Our current development and redevelopment projects represented 8% of our gross investments in real estate, a significant amount of which is leased and expected to be delivered in 2015. The completion and delivery of these projects is expected to reduce our non-income-producing assets as a percentage of gross investments in real estate to 13% by March 31, 2015, from 16% as of December 31, 2014 . Over the next few quarters, we may continue identifying non-strategic, non-income-producing assets and non-core/ core-like operating assets for potential sale. After the first quarter of 2015, our target is to maintain non-income-producing assets (construction in progess and land) as a percentage of our gross investments in real estate in the range from 10% to 15%. Investments in unconsolidated joint ventures 360 Longwood Avenue We are currently developing a building aggregating 413,536 RSF in the Longwood Medical Area of the Greater Boston market through an unconsolidated joint venture. As of December 31, 2014 , 155,524 RSF of the project was occupied and in-service, primarily by Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Inc. We currently have an additional 104,022 RSF under lease negotiation and expect to reach stabilized occupancy at this property by 2016 . The cost at completion for this unconsolidated joint venture is approximately $350.0 million. The joint venture had a construction loan with commitments aggregating $213.2 million , with $159.9 million outstanding as of December 31, 2014 . The remaining cost to complete the development is expected to be funded primarily from the remaining construction loan commitments of $53.3 million . The construction loan bears interest at LIBOR+3.75%, with a floor of 5.25%, and has a maturity date of April 1, 2019, inclusive of two separate one-year options to extend the stated maturity date of April 1, 2017. We have a 27.5% interest in this unconsolidated joint venture that we account for under the equity method of accounting. Our investment under the equity method of accounting was $49.1 million as of December 31, 2014 . We expect to earn unlevered yields on our share of the gross real estate in the joint venture as follows: (i) initial stabilized yield of 8.9% , (ii) initial stabilized yield (cash basis) of 8.3% , and (iii) average cash yield during the term of the initial leases of 9.3% . Our projected unlevered yields are based upon our share of the investment in real estate of the joint venture at completion of approximately $109.0 million , including costs incurred directly by us outside the joint venture. In addition to these yields, we will receive construction management and other fees in aggregate of approximately $637 thousand through completion of the project, and recurring annual property management fees thereafter from this project. Construction management and other fees have been excluded from our estimate of unlevered yields. 1455/1515 Third Street During the three months ended September 30, 2014, Alexandria and Uber entered into a joint venture agreement and acquired two land parcels supporting the development of two buildings aggregating 422,980 RSF at 1455/1515 Third Street in the Mission Bay submarket of the San Francisco Bay Area, for $125.0 million. We have a 51% interest and Uber has a 49% interest in this unconsolidated joint venture. The purchase price was funded by contributions into the joint venture by Uber and Alexandria. We account for our investment in this joint venture under the equity method of accounting. Our investment under the equity method of accounting was $68.3 million as of December 31, 2014 . The project is expected to be funded by equity contributions from Alexandria and Uber. We may also fund a portion of the project with proceeds from a secured construction loan. We are in the process of finalizing the design and construction budget with our partner and we expect to provide the total estimated cost at completion and estimate of yields in the near future. The project is 100% pre-leased to Uber pursuant to a 15-year lease. 67 The following table sets forth the information related to our 360 Longwood Avenue and 1455/1515 Third Street unconsolidated joint ventures as of December 31, 2014 (dollars in thousands): Unconsolidated joint venture information Year ended December 31, 2014 360 Longwood Avenue 1455/1515 Third Street Total ARE Share 100% ARE 27.5% Share (1) 100% ARE 51% Share (1) Revenue $ 2,939 $ 1,015 (2) $ 127 $ 65 $ 1,080 Rental operations (274 ) (80 ) (161 ) (82 ) (162 ) Interest (119 ) (35 ) (35 ) Depreciation and amortization (627 ) (239 ) (176 ) (90 ) (329 ) Net income (loss) $ 1,919 $ 661 $ (210 ) $ (107 ) $ 554 Unconsolidated joint venture information As of December 31, 2014 360 Longwood Avenue 1455/1515 Third Street Total ARE Share 100% ARE 27.5% Share (1) 100% ARE 51% Share (1) Rental properties $ 111,523 $ 34,189 $ 21,150 $ 10,787 $ 44,976 Construction in progress 184,844 56,667 106,524 55,894 112,561 Gross investments in real estate 296,367 90,856 127,674 66,681 157,537 Less: accumulated depreciation (591 ) (200 ) (176 ) (90 ) (290 ) Investments in real estate 295,776 90,656 127,498 66,591 157,247 Other assets 10,410 3,637 7,319 3,861 7,498 Total assets $ 306,186 $ 94,293 $ 134,817 $ 70,452 $ 164,745 Secured notes payable $ 159,881 (3) $ 43,967 $ $ $ 43,967 Other liabilities 4,445 1,227 4,206 2,145 3,372 Total liabilities 164,326 45,194 4,206 2,145 47,339 Equity 141,860 49,099 130,611 68,307 117,406 Total liabilities and equity $ 306,186 $ 94,293 $ 134,817 $ 70,452 $ 164,745 RSF RSF Rental properties 155,524 (4) Active development (CIP) (5) 258,012 422,980 Total 413,536 422,980 (1) Amounts include costs incurred directly by us outside the joint ventures. We believe the ARE basis in our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures is useful information for investors as it provides our proportional share of the investments in real estate from all properties, including our share of the assets and liabilities of our unconsolidated joint ventures. The ARE basis allows investors to estimate the impact of real estate investments and debt financing at the joint venture level. (2) Includes development fees earned. (3) Secured construction loan with an aggregate commitment of $213.2 million, which bears interest at LIBOR+3.75%, with a floor of 5.25%.

In order to supplement an evaluation of our results of operations, we analyze the operating performance for all properties, including operating properties and completed development and redevelopment properties, to the extent that those properties were fully operating for the entire periods presented separate from properties acquired subsequent to the beginning of the earliest period presented, properties currently classified as held for sale , properties currently undergoing development or redevelopment, and corporate entities (legal entities performing general and administrative functions), which are excluded from the results of our Same Properties ( Non-Same Properties ). Additionally, rental revenues from lease termination fees, if any, are excluded from the results of the Same Properties. The following table presents information regarding our Same Properties as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 : December 31, 2014 2013 Percentage change in NOI over comparable period from prior year 4.5% 1.8% Percentage change in NOI (cash basis) over comparable period from prior year 5.5% 5.4% Operating margin 69% 68% Number of Same Properties 149 137 RSF 12,419,189 11,781,883 Occupancy current period average 96.6% 93.5% Occupancy same period prior year average 93.5% 92.7% 69 The following table reconciles the number of Same Properties to total properties for the year ended December 31, 2014 : Development current Properties Summary Properties 75/125 Binney Street 1 Development current 9 430 East 29th Street 1 Development deliveries 3 5200 Illumina Way Building 6 1 Redevelopment current 3 3013/3033 Science Park Road 2 Redevelopment deliveries 11 6040 George Watts Hill Drive 1 360 Longwood Avenue (unconsolidated JV) 1 Development/redevelopment Asia 5 1455/1515 Third Street (unconsolidated JV) 2 9 Acquisitions in North America since January 1, 2013: 10151 Barnes Canyon Road 1 Development deliveries since January 1, 2013 Properties 407 Davis Drive 1 225 Binney Street 1 150 Second Street 1 269 East Grand Avenue 1 3545 Cray Court 1 499 Illinois Street 1 4025/4031/4045 Sorrento Valley Boulevard 3 3 9625 Towne Centre Drive 1 Redevelopment current Properties Properties held for sale 5 225 Second Avenue 1 Total properties excluded from Same Properties 44 11055/11065 Roselle Street 2 3 Same Properties 149 Redevelopment deliveries since January 1, 2013 Properties Total properties as of December 31, 2014 193 400 Technology Square 1 1551 Eastlake Avenue East 1 285 Bear Hill Road 1 343 Oyster Point Boulevard 1 1616 Eastlake Avenue East 1 9800 Medical Center Drive 3 4757 Nexus Center Drive 1 11075 Roselle Street 1 10121 Barnes Canyon Road 1 11 70 NOI is a non-GAAP financial measure equal to income from continuing operations, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, excluding loss on early extinguishment of debt, impairment of real estate, depreciation and amortization, interest expense, and general and administrative expense. We believe NOI provides useful information to investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations because it reflects primarily those income and expense items that are incurred at the property level. Therefore, we believe NOI is a useful measure for evaluating the operating performance of our real estate assets, including our share from our unconsolidated joint ventures. NOI on a cash basis is NOI, adjusted to exclude the effect of straight-line rent adjustments required by GAAP. We believe that NOI on a cash basis is helpful to investors as an additional measure of operating performance because it eliminates straight-line rent adjustments to rental revenue. The chart below shows our NOI for the years ended December 31, 2012 , through December 31, 2014 (in millions): Further, we believe NOI is useful to investors as a performance measure, because when compared across periods, NOI reflects the impact on operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, and operating costs, providing perspective not immediately apparent from income from continuing operations. NOI excludes certain components from income from continuing operations in order to provide results that are more closely related to the results of operations of our properties. For example, interest expense is not necessarily linked to the operating performance of a real estate asset and is often incurred at the corporate level rather than at the property level. In addition, depreciation and amortization, because of historical cost accounting and useful life estimates, may distort operating performance at the property level. Impairments of real estate have been excluded in deriving NOI because we do not consider impairments of real estate to be property-level operating expenses. Impairments of real estate relate to changes in the values of our assets and do not reflect the current operating performance with respect to related revenues or expenses. Our impairment of real estate represents the write-down in the value of the assets to the estimated fair value less cost to sell. These impairments result from investing decisions and the deterioration in market conditions that adversely impact underlying real estate values. Our calculation of NOI also excludes charges incurred from changes in certain financing decisions, such as losses on early extinguishment of debt, as these charges often relate to the timing of corporate strategy. Property operating expenses that are included in determining NOI consist of costs that are related to our operating properties, such as utilities; repairs and maintenance; rental expense related to ground leases; contracted services, such as janitorial, engineering, and landscaping; property taxes and insurance; and property-level salaries. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of accounting and corporate compensation, corporate insurance, professional fees, office rent, and office supplies that are incurred as part of corporate office management, and are excluded from NOI because they represent the ownership structure we have, and are not necessarily linked to the operating performance of our properties. NOI presented by us may not be comparable to NOI reported by other equity REITs that define NOI differently. We believe that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of our operating results, NOI should be examined in conjunction with income from continuing operations as presented in our consolidated statements of income. NOI should not be considered as an alternative to income from continuing operations as an indication of our performance, or as an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity, or our ability to make distributions. 71 Comparison of the year ended December 31, 2014 , to the year ended December 31, 2013 The following table presents a comparison of the components of NOI for our Same Properties and Non-Same Properties for the year ended December 31, 2014 , compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 , and a reconciliation of NOI to income from continuing operations, the most directly comparable financial measure (dollars in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2014 2013 $ Change % Change Revenues: Rental Same Properties $ 437,987 $ 421,615 $ 16,372 3.9 % Rental Non-Same Properties 106,166 46,149 60,017 130.1 Total rental 544,153 467,764 76,389 16.3 Tenant recoveries Same Properties 148,694 138,682 10,012 7.2 Tenant recoveries Non-Same Properties 24,786 11,413 13,373 117.2 Total tenant recoveries 173,480 150,095 23,385 15.6 Other income Same Properties 398 156 242 155.1 Other income Non-Same Properties 8,846 13,136 (4,290 ) (32.7 ) Total other income 9,244 13,292 (4,048 ) (30.5 ) Total revenues Same Properties 587,079 560,453 26,626 4.8 Total revenues Non-Same Properties 139,798 70,698 69,100 97.7 Total revenues 726,877 631,151 95,726 15.2 Expenses: Rental operations Same Properties 183,028 173,799 9,229 5.3 Rental operations Non-Same Properties 36,136 15,240 20,896 137.1 Total rental operations 219,164 189,039 30,125 15.9 Our share of NOI from unconsolidated JVs: JV NOI Same Properties JV NOI Non-Same Properties 918 918 100.0 Our share of NOI from unconsolidated JVs 918 918 100.0 NOI: NOI Same Properties 404,051 386,654 17,397 4.5 NOI Non-Same Properties 104,580 55,458 49,122 88.6 Total NOI 508,631 442,112 66,519 15.0 Other expenses: General and administrative 53,530 48,520 5,010 10.3 Interest 79,299 67,952 11,347 16.7 Depreciation and amortization 224,096 189,123 34,973 18.5 Impairment of real estate 51,675 51,675 100.0 Loss on early extinguishment of debt 525 1,992 (1,467 ) (73.6 ) 409,125 307,587 101,538 33.0 Less: our share of NOI from unconsolidated JVs (918 ) (918 ) (100.0 ) Equity in earnings of unconsolidated JVs 554 554 100.0 Income from continuing operations $ 99,142 $ 134,525 $ (35,383 ) (26.3 )% NOI Same Properties $ 404,051 $ 386,654 $ 17,397 4.5 % Less: straight-line rent adjustments (18,878 ) (21,451 ) 2,573 (12.0 ) NOI (cash basis) Same Properties $ 385,173 $ 365,203 $ 19,970 5.5 % 72 Rental revenues Total rental revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014 , increased by $76.4 million , or 16.3% , to $544.2 million , compared to $467.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 . The increase was primarily due to rental revenues from our Non-Same Properties, including development and redevelopment projects aggregating 1,521,836 RSF that were delivered after January 1, 2013, and operating properties aggregating 546,899 RSF that were acquired after January 1, 2013. In addition, rental revenues from our Same Properties for the year ended December 31, 2014 , increased by $16.4 million , or 3.9% , to $438.0 million from $421.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 . Occupancy of Same Properties increased by 310 bps to 96.6% for the year ended December 31, 2014 , from 93.5% for the year ended December 31, 2013 . Tenant recoveries Tenant recoveries for the year ended December 31, 2014 , increased by $23.4 million , or 15.6% , to $173.5 million , compared to $150.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 . This increase is consistent with the increase in our rental operating expenses of $30.1 million , or 15.9% . Same Properties tenant recoveries increased by $10.0 million , or 7.2% , primarily as a result of an increase in Same Properties rental operating expenses of $9.2 million , or 5.3% . Rental operating expenses increased during the year ended December 31, 2014 , compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 , due to higher utilities and repairs and maintenance in the year ended December 31, 2014 . Our utility consumption and repairs and maintenance increased primarily due to a 310 bps increase in occupancy of our Same Properties. Non-Same Properties tenant recoveries increased by $13.4 million as a result of a Non-Same Properties rental operating expense increase of $20.9 million . Other income Other income for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 , consisted of the following (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2014 2013 Change Management fee income $ 2,761 $ 3,133 $ (372 ) Interest and other income 4,157 4,589 (432 ) Investment income 2,326 5,570 (3,244 ) Total other income $ 9,244 $ 13,292 $ (4,048 ) Rental operating expenses Total rental operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014 , increased by $30.1 million , or 15.9% , to $219.2 million , compared to $189.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 . Approximately $20.9 million of the increase was due to an increase in rental operating expenses from our Non-Same Properties, primarily related to recently delivered development and redevelopment projects, and recently acquired operating properties as mentioned above. The remaining increase in rental operating expenses of $9.2 million was due to the increase in occupancy and higher utilities and repairs and maintenance as described under Tenant Recoveries above. General and administrative expenses General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014 , increased by $5.0 million , or 10.3% , to $53.5 million , compared to $48.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 . General and administrative expenses increased primarily due to property acquisition-related expenses from our recent acquisitions, property disposition-related expenses due to sales of real estate, and expenses related to growth in both the depth and breadth of our operations in multiple markets. As a percentage of total assets, our general and administrative expenses were relatively consistent at 0.7% and 0.6% for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively. 73 Interest expense Interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, was comprised of the following (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, Component 2014 2013 Change Secured notes payable $ 29,429 $ 38,496 $ (9,067 ) Unsecured senior notes payable 56,125 36,456 19,669 Unsecured senior line of credit 8,107 7,007 1,100 Unsecured senior bank term loans 14,328 20,934 (6,606 ) Interest rate swaps 6,871 15,422 (8,551 ) Amortization of loan fees and other interest 11,544 10,232 1,312 Unsecured senior convertible notes 20 (20 ) Total interest incurred 126,404 128,567 (2,163 ) Capitalized interest (47,105 ) (60,615 ) 13,510 Total interest expense $ 79,299 $ 67,952 $ 11,347 Total interest expense increased by $11.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 , compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 , primarily as a result of the $13.5 million reduction in the amount of capitalization of interest related to the delivery of development and redevelopment projects previously mentioned. Total interest incurred declined by $2.2 million due to a decrease in our weighted average interest rate from 3.76% as of December 31, 2013 , to 3.23% as of December 31, 2014 , offset by an approximate $617.5 million increase in outstanding debt. Interest from secured notes payable, our unsecured senior line of credit, unsecured senior bank term loans, and interest rate swaps decreased by $23.1 million , and interest from unsecured senior notes payable increased by $19.7 million as we continued to transition from variable-rate bank debt to long-term unsecured fixed-rate debt. Since the beginning of 2013, we have completed two offerings of unsecured senior notes payable aggregating $1.20 billion at an average rate of 3.68% and an average maturity of 9.8 years. Net proceeds from these offerings were used to reduce our 2016 unsecured senior bank term loan ( 2016 Unsecured Senior Bank Term Loan ) and reduce amounts outstanding under our unsecured senior line of credit. Depreciation and amortization Depreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2014 , increased by $35.0 million , or 18.5% , to $224.1 million , compared to $189.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 . Depreciation increased primarily due to depreciation related to recently delivered development and redevelopment projects, and recently acquired operating properties, as mentioned above. Impairment of real estate During the year ended December 31, 2014 , we determined that nine land parcels and three operating properties met the criteria to be classified as held for sale and consequently recognized aggregate real estate impairment charges of $51.7 million to lower the carrying costs of this real estate to their estimated fair value less cost to sell. For additional information, refer to the section titled Sales of Real Estate Assets and Related Impairment Charges in Note 3 Investments in Real Estate to our audited consolidated financial statements under Item 15 of this Report. Loss on early extinguishment of debt During the year ended December 31, 2014 , we recognized a loss on early extinguishment of debt related to the write-off of a portion of unamortized loan fees aggregating $525 thousand , upon our $125.0 million partial repayment of the outstanding principal balance of our 2016 Unsecured Senior Bank Term Loan. During the year ended December 31, 2013 , we recognized a loss on early extinguishment of debt related to the write-off of a portion of unamortized loan fees aggregating $2.0 million , upon our $250 million partial repayment of the outstanding principal balance of our senior bank term loan due in 2016. 74 Income from discontinued operations Income from discontinued operations of $1.2 million and $900 thousand for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, includes the results of operations of one property which was classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2014 , as well as the results of operations (prior to disposition) and gain/loss on sales of real estate attributable to 10 properties sold subsequent to January 1, 2013. Refer to the Recent Accounting Pronouncements section of Note 2 Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for discussion of our adoption of the ASU on the reporting of discontinued operations which raises the threshold for classification as discontinued operations. Gain on sales of real estate land parcels During the year ended December 31, 2014 , excluding the sale of nine land parcels for which we recognized an impairment charge as discussed above, we completed the sale of six parcels of land in various markets, aggregating 662,950 RSF for an aggregate sales price of $48.4 million and recognized an aggregate gain on sales of real estate land parcels of $6.4 million . These gains are classified in gain on sales of real estate land parcels below income from discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. The land parcels sold did not meet the criteria for classification as discontinued operations since the parcels did not have any significant operations prior to disposition. Pursuant to the presentation and disclosure literature on gains/losses on sales or disposals by REITs required by the SEC, gains or losses on sales or disposals by a REIT that do not qualify as discontinued operations are classified below income from discontinued operations in the income statement. Accordingly, we classified the gain on sale of land parcel below income from discontinued operations, in the consolidated statements of income, and included the gain in income from continuing operations attributable to Alexandria common stockholders in the control number, or numerator for the computation of EPS. 75 Comparison of the year ended December 31, 2013 , to the year ended December 31, 2012 The following table presents a comparison of the components of NOI for our Same Properties and Non-Same Properties for the year ended December 31, 2013 , compared to the year ended December 31, 2012 , and a reconciliation of NOI to income from continuing operations, the most directly comparable financial measure (dollars in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2013 2012 $ Change % Change Revenues: Rental Same Properties $ 382,083 $ 373,589 $ 8,494 2.3 % Rental Non-Same Properties 85,681 49,204 36,477 74.1 Total rental 467,764 422,793 44,971 10.6 Tenant recoveries Same Properties 124,080 120,168 3,912 3.3 Tenant recoveries Non-Same Properties 26,015 13,112 12,903 98.4 Total tenant recoveries 150,095 133,280 16,815 12.6 Other income Same Properties 342 348 (6 ) (1.7 ) Other income Non-Same Properties 12,950 18,076 (5,126 ) (28.4 ) Total other income 13,292 18,424 (5,132 ) (27.9 ) Total revenues Same Properties 506,505 494,105 12,400 2.5 Total revenues Non-Same Properties 124,646 80,392 44,254 55.0 Total revenues 631,151 574,497 56,654 9.9 Expenses: Rental operations Same Properties 160,358 153,961 6,397 4.2 Rental operations Non-Same Properties 28,681 18,795 9,886 52.6 Total rental operations 189,039 172,756 16,283 9.4 NOI: NOI Same Properties 346,147 340,144 6,003 1.8 NOI Non-Same Properties 95,965 61,597 34,368 55.8 Total NOI 442,112 401,741 40,371 10.0 Other expenses: General and administrative 48,520 47,747 773 1.6 Interest 67,952 69,184 (1,232 ) (1.8 ) Depreciation and amortization 189,123 185,687 3,436 1.9 Impairment of land parcel 2,050 (2,050 ) (100.0 ) Loss on early extinguishment of debt 1,992 2,225 (233 ) (10.5 ) 307,587 306,893 694 0.2 Income from continuing operations $ 134,525 $ 94,848 $ 39,677 41.8 % NOI Same Properties $ 346,147 $ 340,144 $ 6,003 1.8 % Less: straight-line rent adjustments (5,299 ) (16,618 ) 11,319 (68.1 ) NOI (cash basis) Same Properties $ 340,848 $ 323,526 $ 17,322 5.4 % 76 Rental revenues Total rental revenues for the year ended December 31, 2013 , increased by $45.0 million , or 10.6% , to $467.8 million , compared to $422.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 . The increase was primarily due to rental revenues from our Non-Same Properties, including 23 development and redevelopment projects that were completed and delivered after January 1, 2012, and five operating properties that were acquired after January 1, 2012. In addition, rental revenues from our Same Properties increased by $8.5 million . Occupancy of Same Properties increased 80 bps, to 93.5% as of December 31, 2013 , from 92.7% as of December 31, 2012 . Tenant recoveries Tenant recoveries for the year ended December 31, 2013 , increased by $16.8 million , or 12.6% , to $150.1 million , compared to $133.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 . This increase is consistent with the increase in our rental operating expenses of $16.3 million . Same Properties tenant recoveries increased by $3.9 million , primarily as a result of an increase in Same Properties rental operating expenses of $6.4 million and higher occupancy for Same Properties in 2013 . Rental operating expenses increased during the year ended December 31, 2013 , compared to the year ended December 31, 2012 , primarily due to an increase in operating costs related to colder weather in 2013 , property tax rate increases for our properties located in Massachusetts, an increase in repairs and maintenance projects in 2013 compared to 2012 , and overall higher occupancy in 2013 . Non-Same Properties tenant recoveries increased by $12.9 million as a result of a Non-Same Properties rental operating expense increase of $9.9 million and higher occupancy for the development and redevelopment properties delivered since the beginning of 2012 . As of December 31, 2013 , approximately 94% of our leases (on an RSF basis) were triple net leases, requiring client tenants to pay substantially all real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, common area expenses, and other operating expenses (including increases thereto) in addition to base rent. Other income Other income for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 , consisted of the following (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2013 2012 Change Management fee income $ 3,133 $ 2,679 $ 454 Interest income 4,589 3,364 1,225 Investment income 5,570 12,381 (6,811 ) Total other income $ 13,292 $ 18,424 $ (5,132 ) Total other income for the year ended December 31, 2013 , decreased by $5.1 million , or 27.9% , to $13.3 million , compared to $18.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 , primarily due to lower investment income in 2013 . Investment income decreased largely due to a $5.8 million gain from an equity investment primarily related to one non-tenant life science entity during 2012 . The decrease in investment income was partially offset by an increase in interest income. Rental operating expenses Total rental operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2013 , increased by $16.3 million , or 9.4% , to $189.0 million , compared to $172.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 . Approximately $9.9 million of the increase was due to an increase in rental operating expenses from our Non-Same Properties, primarily related to 23 development and redevelopment projects that were completed and delivered after January 1, 2012, and five operating properties that were acquired after January 1, 2012. The remaining increase in rental operating expenses of $6.4 million was due to the increase in occupancy and higher utilities described under Tenant Recoveries above. General and administrative expenses General and administrative expenses remained relatively consistent at $48.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 , compared to $47.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 . As a percentage of total assets, our general and administrative expenses were relatively consistent at 0.6% for the year ended December 31, 2013 , and 0.7% for the year ended December 31, 2012 . 77 Interest expense Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 , was comprised of the following (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, Component 2013 2012 Change Secured notes payable $ 38,496 $ 40,439 $ (1,943 ) Unsecured senior notes payable 36,456 21,255 15,201 Unsecured senior line of credit 7,007 12,035 (5,028 ) Unsecured senior bank term loans 20,934 25,567 (4,633 ) Interest rate swaps 15,422 22,309 (6,887 ) Amortization of loan fees and other interest 10,232 10,084 148 Unsecured senior convertible notes 20 246 (226 ) Total interest incurred 128,567 131,935 (3,368 ) Capitalized interest (60,615 ) (62,751 ) 2,136 Total interest expense $ 67,952 $ 69,184 $ (1,232 ) The total interest incurred decreased by $3.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2013 , compared to the year ended December 31, 2012 , primarily as a result of a $612.0 million reduction in our unsecured senior line of credit and unsecured senior bank term loans in 2013 and the decrease in expense related to the expiration, at various dates from September 2012 through September 2013, of certain interest rate swap agreements aggregating $250.0 million with rates ranging from 4.546% to 5.015%. As these interest rate swaps ended, we opted to leave a portion of the underlying debt unhedged in anticipation of a reduction of outstanding variable-rate debt that occurred during May 2013, when we issued $500.0 million of unsecured notes payable at a fixed rate of 3.90% ( 3.90% Unsecured Senior Notes ). In addition, we reduced the outstanding principal balance outstanding on our unsecured senior bank term loans by $500.0 million in 2012 and 2013, and we amended our unsecured senior line of credit and unsecured senior bank term loans in 2013 to reduce our interest rate on outstanding borrowings. These decreases in interest costs have been partially offset by the increase in interest expense from the issuances of unsecured senior notes payable. From the beginning of 2012 to the end of 2013, we have issued $1.05 billion of unsecured senior notes payable. The amended terms and corresponding interest rates of our senior bank term loans and our senior line of credit are as follows: Balance as of December 31, 2013 Maturity Date Applicable Rate Facility Fee Facility Prior Amended Prior Amended Prior Amended 2016 Unsecured Senior Bank Term Loan $ 500 million June 2016 July 2016 L+1.75% L+1.20% N/A N/A 2019 Unsecured Senior Bank Term Loan $ 600 million January 2017 January 2019 L+1.50% L+1.20% N/A N/A $1.5 billion unsecured senior line of credit $ 204 million April 2017 January 2019 L+1.20% L+1.10% 0.25 % 0.20 % Depreciation and amortization Depreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2013 , increased by $3.4 million , or 1.9% , to $189.1 million , compared to $185.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 . Depreciation increased due to 23 development and redevelopment projects that were completed and delivered after January 1, 2012, and five operating properties that were acquired in North America after January 1, 2012. Impairment of land parcel During the three months ended December 31, 2012 , we committed to sell a land parcel with 50,000 developable square feet rather than hold it on a long-term basis for future development. Upon our decision to sell, we reduced the costs of the land parcel to the anticipated sales price, less cost to sell. As a result, in the three months ended December 31, 2012 , we recognized an impairment charge of approximately $2.1 million. We completed the sale of this land parcel in May 2013 at an aggregate sales price of $2.7 million, and a gain upon sale of $391 thousand. 78 Loss on early extinguishment of debt During the year ended December 31, 2013 , in conjunction with the refinancing of our unsecured senior bank term loans and the partial repayment of $250.0 million of our 2016 Unsecured Senior Bank Term Loan, we recognized a loss on early extinguishment of debt aggregating $2.0 million, related to the write-off of unamortized loan fees. During the year ended December 31, 2012 , we recognized a loss on early extinguishment of debt of approximately $2.2 million, including $1.6 million related to the write-off of unamortized loan fees upon modification of our unsecured senior line of credit and $0.6 million related to the write-off of unamortized loan fees resulting from the early repayment of our $250.0 million unsecured senior bank term loan due in 2012 ( 2012 Unsecured Senior Bank Term Loan ). Income from discontinued operations Income from discontinued operations, of $900 thousand and $8.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, includes the results of operations of four operating properties that were classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2013 , as well as the results of operations (prior to disposition) and gain/loss on sale of real estate attributable to 13 properties sold from January 1, 2012, to December 31, 2013 , as well as any related impairments. During the year ended December 31, 2012 , we recognized an impairment loss aggregating $11.4 million related to our decision to sell rather than hold our investment in 1124 Columbia Street in the Seattle market and One Innovation Drive, 377 Plantation Street, and 381 Plantation Street in the Greater Boston market. We completed the sale of these assets in 2013 along with our sale of 25/35/45 West Watkins Mill Road and 1201 Clopper Road in the Maryland market and 702 Electronic Drive in Pennsylvania, for an aggregate sales price of $128.6 million and a net loss on sale of $121 thousand. Gain on sales of real estate land parcels During the year ended December 31, 2013 , we sold four parcels of land for aggregate consideration of $73.3 million and recognized an aggregate gain of $4.8 million, which included a gain of $4.1 million on the sale of our land parcel in the Mission Bay submarket of the San Francisco Bay Area at 1600 Owens Street for $55.2 million. In March 2012, we completed an in-substance partial sale of our interest in a joint venture that owned a land parcel, resulting in a $1.9 million gain on the sale of the land parcel. The land parcels sold did not meet the criteria for classification as discontinued operations since the parcels did not have any significant operations prior to disposition. Pursuant to the presentation and disclosure literature on gains/losses on sales or disposals by REITs required by the SEC, gains or losses on sales or disposals by a REIT that do not qualify as discontinued operations are classified below income from discontinued operations in the income statement. Accordingly, we classified the gain on the sales of the land parcels below income from discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of income, and included the gain in income from continuing operations attributable to Alexandria common stockholders in the control number, or numerator, for the computation of EPS. 79 Projected results Based on our current view of existing market conditions and certain current assumptions, we present guidance for EPS attributable to Alexandria common stockholders diluted and FFO per share attributable to Alexandria common stockholders diluted, each for the year ended December 31, 2015, as set forth in the table below. The table below provides a reconciliation of FFO per share attributable to Alexandria common stockholders diluted, a non-GAAP measure, to EPS, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, and other key assumptions and key credit metrics included in our guidance for the year ended December 31, 2015. EPS and FFO Per Share Attributable to Alexandria Common Stockholders Diluted 2015 Guidance EPS $1.60 to $1.80 Add back: depreciation and amortization 3.52 Other (0.02) FFO per share $5.10 to $5.30 2015 Guidance Key Assumptions (Dollars in thousands) Low High Occupancy percentage for operating properties in North America as of December 31, 2015 96.9% 97.4% Same property performance: NOI increase 0.5% 2.5% NOI increase (cash basis) 5.0% 7.0% Lease renewals and re-leasing of space: Rental rate increases 14.0% 17.0% Rental rate increases (cash basis) 8.0% 10.0% Straight-line rents $ 42,000 $ 47,000 General and administrative expenses $ 55,000 $ 59,000 Capitalization of interest $ 35,000 $ 45,000 Interest expense $ 110,000 $ 120,000 Key Credit Metrics 2015 Guidance Net debt to Adjusted EBITDA fourth quarter of 2015 annualized 6.5x to 7.5x Fixed charge coverage ratio fourth quarter of 2015 annualized 3.0x to 3.5x Non-income-producing assets as a percentage of gross real estate as of December 31, 2015 10% to 15% 80 Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio As of December 31, 2014 , we had construction in progress related to our seven North American development projects and two North American redevelopment projects, respectively. The completion of these projects, along with recently delivered projects, certain future projects, and contributions from Same Properties, is expected to contribute significant increases in rental income, NOI, and cash flows. Operating performance assumptions related to the completion of our development and redevelopment projects in North America, including the timing of initial occupancy, stabilization dates, and initial stabilized yield, are included in Item 2. Properties Investments in Real Estate. Certain key assumptions regarding our projections, including the impact of various development and redevelopment projects, are included in the tables above and in the table in Summary of Capital Expenditures, including the Projected Construction Spending table located within Item 2. Properties Investments in Real Estate. The completion of our development and redevelopment projects will result in an increase in interest expense and other project costs, because these project costs will no longer qualify for capitalization and these costs will be expensed as incurred. Our projection assumptions for Same Property NOI growth, rental rate growth, straight-line rents, general and administrative expenses, capitalization of interest, and interest expense are included in the tables above and are subject to a number of variables and uncertainties, including those discussed under the Forward-Looking Statements section of Item 1A. Risk Factors, and in Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014 . To the extent our full-year earnings guidance is updated during the year, we will provide additional disclosure supporting reasons for any significant changes to such guidance. 81 Liquidity and capital resources Overview We expect to meet certain long-term liquidity requirements, such as requirements for development, redevelopment, other construction projects, capital improvements, tenant improvements, property acquisitions, leasing costs, non-revenue-generating expenditures, and scheduled debt maturities, through net cash provided by operating activities, periodic asset sales, strategic joint venture capital, and long-term secured and unsecured indebtedness, including borrowings under our unsecured senior line of credit, unsecured senior bank term loans, and the issuance of additional debt and/or equity securities. We expect to continue meeting our short-term liquidity and capital requirements, as further detailed in this section, generally through our working capital and net cash provided by operating activities. We believe that the net cash provided by operating activities will continue to be sufficient to enable us to make the distributions necessary to continue qualifying as a REIT. Over the next several years, our balance sheet, capital structure, and liquidity objectives are as follows: Retain positive cash flows from operating activities after payment of dividends for reinvestment in acquisitions and/or development and redevelopment projects; Maintain adequate liquidity from net cash provided by operating activities, cash and cash equivalents, and available borrowing capacity under our unsecured senior line of credit and available commitments under our secured construction loans; Reduce the amount of our unsecured bank debt; Maintain diverse sources of capital, including sources from net cash provided by operating activities, unsecured debt, secured debt, selective asset sales, joint venture capital, preferred stock, and common stock; Manage the amount of debt maturing in a single year; Mitigate unhedged variable-rate debt exposure through the reduction of short-term and medium-term variable-rate bank debt; Maintain a large unencumbered asset pool to provide financial flexibility; Fund preferred stock and common stock dividends from net cash provided by operating activities; Manage a disciplined level of value-creation projects as a percentage of our gross investments in real estate; Maintain high levels of pre-leasing and percentage leased in value-creation projects; and Maintain solid key credit metrics, including net debt to Adjusted EBITDA and fixed charge coverage ratio, with some variation from quarter to quarter and year to year. 82 Unsecured senior line of credit and unsecured senior bank term loans We have unsecured bank debt totaling $1.28 billion as of December 31, 2014 , under our 2016 Unsecured Senior Bank Term Loan, 2019 unsecured senior bank term loan ( 2019 Unsecured Senior Bank Term Loan ), and amounts outstanding on our $1.5 billion unsecured senior line of credit. The table below reflects the outstanding balances, maturity dates, applicable rates, and facility fees for each of these facilities. Balance as of December 31, 2014 As of December 31, 2014 Facility Maturity Date (1) Applicable Rate Facility Fee 2016 Unsecured Senior Bank Term Loan $ 375 million July 2016 LIBOR+1.20% N/A 2019 Unsecured Senior Bank Term Loan $ 600 million January 2019 LIBOR+1.20% N/A $1.5 billion unsecured senior line of credit $ 304 million January 2019 LIBOR+1.10% 0.20% (1) Includes any extension options that we control. The maturity date of the unsecured senior line of credit is January 2019, assuming we exercise our sole right to extend the stated maturity date, twice, by an additional six months after each exercise. Borrowings under the unsecured senior line of credit will bear interest at LIBOR or the base rate specified in the amended unsecured senior line of credit agreement, plus in either case a specified margin ( Applicable Margin ). The Applicable Margin for LIBOR borrowings under the unsecured senior line of credit is based on our existing credit rating as set by certain rating agencies. In addition to the Applicable Margin, our unsecured senior line of credit is subject to an annual facility fee of 0.20% based upon aggregate outstanding commitments. The requirements of, and our actual performance with respect to, the key financial covenants under our unsecured senior line of credit and unsecured senior bank term loans as of December 31, 2014 , were as follows: Covenant Ratios (1) Requirement Actual (2) Leverage Ratio Less than or equal to 60.0% 35.9% Secured Debt Ratio Less than or equal to 45.0% 6.4% Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio Greater than or equal to 1.50x 3.12x Unsecured Leverage Ratio Less than or equal to 60.0% 38.9% Unsecured Interest Coverage Ratio Greater than or equal to 1.50x 8.19x (1) For definitions of the ratios, refer to the amended unsecured senior line of credit and unsecured senior bank term loan agreements filed as Exhibits 10.24, 10.25, 10.26, and 10.27 hereto, which are listed in Item 15 of this report. (2) Actual covenants are calculated pursuant to the specific terms to our unsecured senior line of credit and unsecured senior bank term loan agreements. Unsecured senior notes payable The requirements of, and our actual performance with respect to, the key financial covenants under our 2.75% Unsecured Senior Notes, 3.90% Unsecured Senior Notes, 4.60% unsecured senior notes ( 4.60% Unsecured Senior Notes ), and 4.50% Unsecured Senior Notes as of December 31, 2014 , were as follows: Covenant Ratios (1) Requirement Actual Total Debt to Total Assets Less than or equal to 60% 40% Secured Debt to Total Assets Less than or equal to 40% 7% Consolidated EBITDA to Interest Expense Greater than or equal to 1.5x 5.9x Unencumbered Total Asset Value to Unsecured Debt Greater than or equal to 150% 247% (1) For definitions of the ratios, refer to the indenture filed as Exhibit 4.3 hereto and the related supplemental indentures filed as Exhibits 4.4, 4.7, 4.9, and 4.11 hereto, which are each listed in Item 15 of this report. In addition, the terms of the indentures, among other things, limit the ability of the Company, Alexandria Real Estate Equities, L.P., and the Company subsidiaries to (i) consummate a merger, or consolidate or sell all or substantially all of the Company assets, and (ii) incur certain secured or unsecured indebtedness. 83 Sources and uses of capital We expect that our principal liquidity needs for the year ended December 31, 2015, will be satisfied by the following multiple sources of capital, as shown in the table below. There can be no assurance that our sources and uses of capital will not be materially higher or lower than these expectations. Sources and Uses of Capital (Dollars in thousands) 2015 Guidance Low High Sources of capital: Net cash provided by operating activities after dividends $ 115,000 $ 135,000 Incremental debt 390,000 470,000 Remainder/asset sales (1) (2) 340,000 440,000 Total sources of capital $ 845,000 $ 1,045,000 Uses of capital: Construction $ 645,000 $ 745,000 Acquisitions (3) 200,000 300,000 Total uses of capital $ 845,000 $ 1,045,000 Incremental debt: Issuance of unsecured senior and other notes payable (4) $ 535,000 $ 685,000 Borrowings under: Existing secured construction loans 80,000 130,000 Repayments of: Secured notes payable (61,000 ) (137,000 ) 2016 unsecured senior term loan (150,000 ) (200,000 ) Unsecured senior line of credit (14,000 ) (8,000 ) Incremental debt $ 390,000 $ 470,000 (1) Represents the amount of remaining capital to be sourced in 2015. We expect to identify real estate sales, including land and non-core/ core-like operating assets, over the next several quarters to generate proceeds for reinvestment into high-value Class A pre-leased development projects. The amount of asset sales necessary to meet our forecasted sources of capital will vary depending upon the amount of EBITDA associated with the assets sold. For example, the sale of an income-producing property benefits leverage less than the sale of a non-income-producing land parcel. Additionally, we intend to continue to execute our strategy of delivering solid growth in FFO per share, as adjusted, and NAV in 2015, including any impact of asset sales. (2) Assets classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2014, aggregated $178.0 million , including $56.0 million in sales completed in January 2015. (3) Includes (i) the acquisition of 640 Memorial Drive completed in January 2015 for $176.5 million and (ii) $54.1 million, representing half of the aggregate consideration of $108.3 million to purchase the outstanding 10% noncontrolling interest in our flagship campus at Alexandria Technology Square , which is due on April 1, 2015. The other half of the $108.3 million will be paid on April 1, 2016, and therefore has been excluded from uses of capital for 2015. (4) Includes a secured note payable of $82.0 million with an interest rate of 3.93% assumed in connection with the acquisition of 640 Memorial Drive in January 2015. The key assumptions behind the sources and uses of capital in the table above are a favorable capital market environment, performance of our core operating properties, lease-up and delivery of current and future development and redevelopment projects, and leasing activity. Our expected sources and uses of capital are subject to a number of variables and uncertainties, including those discussed under the Forward-Looking Statements section of Part I, the Risk Factors section of Item 1A, and the Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section under Item 7, of this annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014 . We expect to update our forecast of sources and uses of capital on a quarterly basis. 84 Sources of capital Net cash provided by operating activities after dividends We expect to retain $115.0 million to $135.0 million of net cash flows from operating activities after payment of common stock and preferred stock dividends. For the year ended December 31, 2015 , we expect the completion of our highly pre-leased value creation projects, along with recently delivered projects, certain future projects, and contributions from Same Properties, to contribute significant increases in rental income, NOI, and cash flows. Refer to the Cash Flows section appearing elsewhere in this section of our annual report on Form 10-K for a discussion of net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 . Real estate sales We continue the disciplined execution of select sales of non-strategic non-income-producing assets and non-core/ core-like operating assets. For 2015 , we expect to sell real estate ranging from $340.0 million to $440.0 million . The amount of asset sales necessary to meet our forecasted sources of capital will vary depending upon the amount of EBITDA associated with the assets sold. In January 2015, we completed the sale of two assets for an aggregate sales price of $56.0 million. We also have three additional assets currently classified as held for sale with an aggregate net book value as of December 31, 2014, of $122.0 million . For additional information, refer to the section titled Sales of Real Estate Assets and Related Impairment Charges in Note 3 Investments in Real Estate to our audited consolidated financial statements under Item 15 of this Report. The sale of non-strategic non-income-producing-assets and non-core/ core-like operating assets provides a significant source of capital to fund our highly pre-leased value-creation development and redevelopment projects described above. Debt We expect to fund a significant portion of our capital needs in 2015 from the issuance of unsecured senior notes payable, borrowings available under existing secured construction loans, unsecured senior line of credit, new secured construction loans, and acquired secured notes payable. In July 2014, we completed public offerings of $400 million aggregate principal amount and $300 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes payable at stated interest rates of 2.75% and 4.50% , respectively, at a weighted average interest rate of 3.50% and a weighted average tenor of 9.6 years. The 2.75% Unsecured Senior Notes were priced at 99.793% of the principal amount with a yield to maturity of 2.791% and are due January 15, 2020 . The 4.50% Unsecured Senior Notes were priced at 99.912% of the principal amount with a yield to maturity of 4.508% and are due July 30, 2029 .

Unsecured senior line of credit We use our unsecured senior line of credit to fund working capital, construction activities, and, from time to time, acquisition of properties. In July 2014, we completed a $700 million unsecured senior notes payable offering. Net proceeds from this offering were used to reduce approximately $569 million of borrowings outstanding on our unsecured senior line of credit and increased our borrowing capacity in July 2014 under the unsecured senior line of credit to approximately $1.5 billion. Borrowings under the unsecured senior line of credit will bear interest at a Eurocurrency Rate or a Base Rate specified in the amended unsecured line of credit agreement, plus, in either case, the Applicable Margin. The Eurocurrency Rate specified in the amended unsecured line of credit agreement is, as applicable, the rate per annum equal to (i) the LIBOR or a successor rate thereto as approved by the administrative agent for loans denominated in a LIBOR quoted currency (i.e., U.S. dollars, euro, pounds sterling, or yen), (ii) the average annual yield rates applicable to Canadian dollar bankers acceptances for loans denominated in Canadian dollars, (iii) the Bank Bill Swap Reference Bid rate for loans denominated in Australian dollars, or (iv) the rate designated with respect to the applicable alternative currency for loans denominated in a non-LIBOR quoted currency (other than Canadian or Australian dollars). The Base Rate is, for any day, a fluctuating rate per annum equal to the highest of (i) the federal funds rate plus 1/2 of 1%, (ii) the rate of interest in effect for such day as publicly announced from time to time by Bank of America as its prime rate, and (iii) the Eurocurrency Rate plus 1.00%. The Applicable Margin for LIBOR borrowings under the unsecured senior line of credit as of December 31, 2014 , was 1.10% , which is based on our existing credit rating as set by certain rating agencies. Our unsecured senior line of credit is subject to an annual facility fee of 0.20% based on the aggregate commitments outstanding. Cash and cash equivalents As of December 31, 2014 , and December 31, 2013 , we had $86.0 million and $57.7 million , respectively, of cash and cash equivalents. We expect existing cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operating activities, proceeds from asset sales, borrowings under our unsecured senior line of credit, secured construction loan borrowings, issuances of unsecured notes payable, and issuances of common stock to continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities, such as regular quarterly dividends, scheduled debt repayments, and certain capital expenditures, including expenditures related to construction activities. 86 Restricted cash Restricted cash consisted of the following as of December 31, 2014 , and December 31, 2013 (in thousands): December 31, 2014 December 31, 2013 Funds held in trust under the terms of certain secured notes payable $ 19,350 $ 14,572 Funds held in escrow related to construction projects 4,539 5,655 Other restricted funds 2,995 7,482 Total $ 26,884 $ 27,709 The funds held in escrow related to construction projects will be used to pay for certain construction costs. Other sources Under our current shelf registration statement filed with the SEC, we may offer common stock, preferred stock, debt, and other securities. These securities may be issued from time to time at our discretion based on our needs and market conditions, including as necessary to balance our use of incremental debt capital. We hold interests, together with certain third parties, in companies that we consolidate in our financial statements. These third parties may contribute equity into these entities primarily related to their share of funds for construction-related and financing-related activities. In January 2014, our joint venture partner funded approximately $20.9 million related to the repayment of our $208.7 million secured note payable collateralized by Alexandria Technology Square . We also hold an interest, together with certain third parties, in a joint venture that is not consolidated in our financial statements. The following table presents information related to debt held by our unconsolidated joint venture (dollars in thousands): Loan Collateral Total Commitments Total Outstanding Partners Share ARE 27.5% Share Maturity Date Interest Rate 360 Longwood Avenue $ 213,200 $ 159,881 $ 115,914 $ 43,967 4/1/17 (1) 5.25 % (2) (1) We have two, one-year options to extend the stated maturity date to April 1, 2019, subject to certain conditions. (2) Secured construction loan bears interest at LIBOR+3.75%, with a floor of 5.25%. Uses of capital Summary of capital expenditures Our primary use of capital relates to the development, redevelopment, predevelopment, and construction of properties. In North America, we currently have development projects under way for 2,166,746 RSF of office/laboratory and tech office space, includin g two unconsolidated joint venture development projects . We also have two pr ojects undergoing redevelopment in North America aggregating 167,713 RSF. We incur construction costs related to development, redevelopment, predevelopment, and other construction activities and additional project costs, including interest, property taxes, insurance, and other costs directly related and essential to the development or construction of a project during periods when activities necessary to prepare an asset for its intended use are in progress. Refer to Item 2 Summary of Capital Expenditures for more information on our capital expenditures. 87 We capitalize interest cost as a cost of the project only during the period for which activities necessary to prepare an asset for its intended use are ongoing, provided that expenditures for the asset have been made and interest cost has been incurred. Capitalized interest for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 , of approximately $47.1 million and $60.6 million , respectively, is classified in investments in real estate. Indirect project costs, including construction administration, legal fees, and office costs that clearly relate to projects under development or construction, are capitalized as incurred during the period an asset is undergoing activities to prepare it for its intended use. We capitalized payroll and other indirect project costs related to development, redevelopment, and construction projects, aggregating approximately $17.6 million and $17.5 million , for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively. Additionally, should we cease activities necessary to prepare an asset for its intended use, the interest, taxes, insurance, and certain other direct project costs related to this asset would be expensed as incurred. When construction activities cease, the asset is transferred out of construction in progress and classified as rental property. Also, if vertical aboveground construction is not initiated at completion of predevelopment activities, the land parcel will be classified as land held for future development. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. Fluctuations in our development, redevelopment, and construction activities could result in significant changes to total expenses and net income. For example, had we experienced a 10% reduction in development, redevelopment, and construction activities without a corresponding decrease in indirect project costs, including interest and payroll, total expenses would have increased by approximately $6.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 . We also capitalize and defer initial direct costs to originate leases with independent third parties related to evaluating a prospective lessee financial condition, negotiating lease terms, preparing the lease agreement, and closing the lease transaction. Costs that we have capitalized and deferred relate to successful leasing transactions, result directly from and are essential to the lease transaction, and would not have been incurred had that leasing transaction not occurred. The initial direct costs capitalized and deferred also include the portion of our employees total compensation and payroll-related fringe benefits directly related to time spent performing activities previously described and related to the respective lease that would not have been performed but for that lease. Total initial direct leasing costs capitalized during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 , were approximately $40.3 million and $43.8 million , respectively, of which approximately $10.6 million and $11.0 million , respectively, represented capitalized and deferred payroll costs directly related and essential to our leasing activities during such periods. Acquisitions Since the beginning of 2014, we have completed a total of seven real estate asset acquisitions, including the acquisition of one land parcel in our SoMa submarket and six operating properties in our Route 128, Torrey Pines, University Town Center, and Sorrento Valley submarkets. Please see additional information in our External Growth Acquisitions section of this report. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2014, we formed a new joint venture described below that acquired two land parcels in the San Francisco Bay Area market for a total purchase price of $125.0 million. Refer to Note 3 Investments in Real Estate, to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K for detailed information on our acquisitions. Refer to Acquisition of 640 Memorial Drive and Acquisition of Alexandria Technology Square Interest in Note 18 Subsequent Events section of the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K for a discussion of acquisitions which occurred in January 2015. 2016 Unsecured Senior Bank Term Loan repayment As part of our continuing transition from bank debt financing to unsecured senior notes payable, from variable-rate debt to fixed-rate debt, and from short-term debt to long-term debt, we repaid $125.0 million of our 2016 Unsecured Senior Bank Term Loan during the year ended December 31, 2014 . As a result of this prepayment, we recognized a loss on early extinguishment of debt related to the write-off of a portion of unamortized loan fees during the year ended December 31, 2014 , aggregating $525 thousand . 88 Contractual obligations and commitments Contractual obligations as of December 31, 2014 , consisted of the following (in thousands): Payments by Period Total 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 Thereafter Secured and unsecured debt (1) (2) $ 3,680,940 $ 61,190 $ 821,528 $ 911,468 $ 1,886,754 Estimated interest payments on fixed-rate and hedged variable-rate debt (3) 705,834 105,205 180,103 159,010 261,516 Estimated interest payments on variable-rate debt (4) 32,061 8,849 15,074 8,138 Ground lease obligations 667,082 9,828 20,942 19,573 616,739 Other obligations 8,299 1,501 3,051 3,747 Total $ 5,094,216 $ 186,573 $ 1,040,698 $ 1,101,936 $ 2,765,009 (1) Amounts represent principal amounts due and exclude unamortized premiums/discounts reflected on the consolidated balance sheets. (2) Payment dates include any extension options that we control. (3) Estimated interest payments on our fixed-rate debt and hedged variable-rate debt were based upon contractual interest rates, including the impact of interest rate swap agreements, interest payment dates, and scheduled maturity dates. (4) The interest payments on variable-rate debt were based on the interest rates in effect as of December 31, 2014 . Secured notes payable Secured notes payable as of December 31, 2014 , consisted of 14 notes secured by 33 properties. Our secured notes payable typically require monthly payments of principal and interest and had weighted average interest rates of approximately 4.59% as of December 31, 2014 . The total book values of rental properties, land held for future development, and construction in progress securing debt were approximately $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2014 . As of December 31, 2014 , our secured notes payable, including unamortized discounts, were composed of approximately $404.0 million and $248.2 million of fixed and variable-rate debt, respectively. In January 2014, we repaid a $208.7 million secured note payable related to Alexandria Technology Square that bore interest at a rate of 5.59%. Our joint venture partner funded approximately $20.9 million of the proceeds required to repay the secured note payable. In April 2014, we repaid a $6.4 million secured note payable related to a San Diego property that bore interest at a rate of 4.88%. In August 2014, we repaid a $7.4 million secured note payable related to a San Diego property that bore interest at a rate of 4.00%. Estimated interest payments Estimated interest payments on our fixed-rate debt and hedged variable-rate debt were calculated based upon contractual interest rates, including the impact of interest rate swap agreements, interest payment dates, and scheduled maturity dates. As of December 31, 2014 , approximately 84% of our debt was fixed-rate debt or variable-rate debt subject to interest rate swap agreements. See additional information regarding our interest rate swap agreements under Liquidity and Capital Resources Contractual Obligations and Commitments Interest Rate Swap Agreements. The remaining 16% of our debt as of December 31, 2014 , was unhedged variable-rate debt based primarily on LIBOR. Interest payments on our unhedged variable-rate debt have been calculated based on interest rates in effect as of December 31, 2014 . For additional information regarding our debt, refer to Note 7 Secured and Unsecured Senior Debt, to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014 . Interest rate swap agreements We utilize interest rate swap agreements to hedge a portion of our exposure to variable interest rates primarily associated with our unsecured senior line of credit and unsecured senior bank term loans. These agreements involve the receipt of variable-rate amounts from a counterparty in exchange for our payment of fixed-rate amounts to the counterparty over the life of the agreement without the exchange of the underlying notional amount. Interest received under all our interest rate swap agreements is based on the one-month LIBOR. The net difference between the interest paid and the interest received is reflected as an adjustment to interest expense in our consolidated statements of income. 89 We have entered into master derivative agreements with each counterparty. These master derivative agreements (all of which are adapted from the standard International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc., form) define certain terms between us and each of our counterparties to address and minimize certain risks associated with our interest rate swap agreements. In order to limit our risk of non-performance by an individual counterparty under our interest rate swap agreements, our interest rate swap agreements are spread among various counterparties. As of December 31, 2014 , the largest aggregate notional amount of the interest rate swap agreements in effect at any single point in time with an individual counterparty was $250.0 million . If one or more of our counterparties fail to perform under our interest rate swap agreements, we may incur higher costs associated with our variable-rate LIBOR-based debt than the interest costs we originally anticipated. We have not posted any collateral related to our interest rate swap agreements. Other resources and liquidity requirements Under our current shelf registration statement filed with the SEC, we may offer common stock, preferred stock, debt, and other securities. These securities may be issued from time to time at our discretion based on our needs and market conditions, including as necessary to balance our use of incremental debt capital. We hold interests, together with certain third parties, in companies that we consolidate in our financial statements. These third parties may contribute equity into these entities primarily related to their share of funds for construction and financing-related activities. In June 2012, we established an at the market common stock offering program under which we may sell, from time to time, up to an aggregate of $250.0 million of our common stock through our sales agents, BNY Mellon Capital Markets, LLC and Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, during a three-year period. As of December 31, 2014 , approximately $150.0 million of our common stock remained available for issuance under the at the market common stock offering program. Ground lease obligations Ground lease obligations as of December 31, 2014 , included leases for 28 of our properties, which accounted for approximately 15% of our total number of properties, and two land development parcels. Excluding one ground lease related to one operating property that expires in 2036 with a net book value of approximately $10.0 million as of December 31, 2014 , our ground lease obligations have remaining lease terms generally ranging from 40 to 100 years, including extension options. Refer to Note 12 Commitments and Contingencies, to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K for further information on our ground leases. Commitments As of December 31, 2014 , remaining aggregate costs under contract for the construction of properties undergoing development, redevelopment, and improvements under the terms of leases approximated $525.0 million . We expect payments for these obligations to occur over one to two years, subject to capital planning adjustments from time to time. We may have the ability to cease the construction of certain properties resulting in the reduction of our commitments. We are also committed to funding approximately $75.0 million for certain investments over the next several years. We are also committed to contribute our 51% share of equity into our joint venture with Uber to complete the development of our 1455/1515 Third Street project. The additional funding commitment as of December 31, 2014 , for this joint venture was pending completion of the final design of the building. In addition, we have letters of credit and performance obligations of $13.6 million primarily related to our construction management requirements. We have minimum development requirements under project development agreements with government entities for some of our future value-creation projects. As of December 31, 2014 , we had land and land improvements with an aggregate book value of $22.1 million for which we had construction commitment obligations aggregating approximately 300,000 RSF and 100,000 RSF that need to be fulfilled by 2016 and 2017, respectively. The estimated cost to develop these projects is approximately $125 to $175 per square foot. If we do not meet, extend, or eliminate these commitments, we may default under our existing agreements. The government entities, in turn, have certain obligations to us under those project development agreements. We are working with these entities to fulfill or amend certain existing obligations in a mutually beneficial manner. 90 Exposure to environmental liabilities In connection with the acquisition of all of our properties, we have obtained Phase I environmental assessments to ascertain the existence of any environmental liabilities or other issues. The Phase I environmental assessments of our properties have not revealed any environmental liabilities that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations taken as a whole, nor are we aware of any material environmental liabilities that have occurred since the Phase I environmental assessments were completed. In addition, we carry a policy of pollution legal liability insurance covering exposure to certain environmental losses at substantially all of our properties. Cash flows We report and analyze our cash flows based on operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities. The following table summarizes changes in our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2014 2013 Change Net cash provided by operating activities $ 334,325 $ 312,727 $ 21,598 Net cash used in investing activities $ (634,829 ) $ (591,375 ) $ (43,454 ) Net cash provided by financing activities $ 331,312 $ 197,570 $ 133,742 Operating activities Cash flows provided by operating activities consisted of the following amounts (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2014 2013 Change Net cash provided by operating activities $ 334,325 $ 312,727 $ 21,598 Add back: changes in operating assets and liabilities 15,628 4,785 10,843 Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities $ 349,953 $ 317,512 $ 32,441 Cash flows provided by operating activities are primarily dependent on the occupancy level of our asset base, the rental rates of our leases, the collectability of rent and recovery of operating expenses from our client tenants, the delivery of development projects, the timing and delivery of redevelopment projects, and the timing of acquisitions of operating properties. Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 , increased to $334.3 million , compared to $312.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 . Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2014 , increased by $32.4 million , or 10.2% , to $350.0 million , compared to $317.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 . This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in our Same Properties NOI (cash basis) of $20.0 million , or 5.5% , to $385.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 , compared to $365.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 . In addition, the increase in operating cash flows was attributable to our delivery of development and redevelopment projects aggregating 1,521,836 RSF that were delivered after January 1, 2013, and operating properties aggregating 546,899 RSF that were acquired in North America after January 1, 2013 . These increases were partially offset by the sale of 10 non-strategic properties aggregating 731,656 RSF over the same period. 91 Investing activities Cash flows used in investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 , consisted of the following (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2014 2013 Change Proceeds from sales of properties $ 81,580 $ 153,968 $ (72,388 ) Additions to properties (497,773 ) (593,389 ) 95,616 Purchase of properties (127,887 ) (122,069 ) (5,818 ) Proceeds from repayment of notes receivable 29,883 29,883 Investment in unconsolidated real estate entity (70,758 ) (17,987 ) (52,771 ) Other (49,874 ) (11,898 ) (37,976 ) Net cash used in investing activities $ (634,829 ) $ (591,375 ) $ (43,454 ) The change in net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 , is primarily due to a higher use of cash for investment in unconsolidated real estate entities, and a lower source of cash from property dispositions, offset by lower capital expenditures incurred on our development and redevelopment projects. These cash flows used in investing activities were partially offset by the repayment of a note receivable during the year ended December 31, 2014 , as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 . Value-creation opportunities and external growth For information on our key development and redevelopment projects for the year ended December 31, 2014 , refer to Development, Redevelopment, and Future Value-Creation Projects located earlier within Item 2 of this report. Financing activities Cash flows provided by financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 , consisted of the following (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2014 2013 Change Borrowings from secured notes payable $ 126,215 $ 28,489 $ 97,726 Repayments of borrowings from secured notes payable (231,051 ) (36,219 ) (194,832 ) Proceeds from issuance of unsecured senior notes payable 698,908 498,561 200,347 Principal borrowings from unsecured senior line of credit 1,168,000 729,000 439,000 Repayments of borrowings from unsecured senior line of credit (1,068,000 ) (1,091,000 ) 23,000 Repayments of unsecured senior bank term loan (125,000 ) (250,000 ) 125,000 Repurchase of unsecured senior convertible notes (384 ) 384 Total changes related to debt 569,072 (121,553 ) 690,625 Proceeds from common stock offerings 534,469 (534,469 ) Dividend payments (228,271 ) (194,961 ) (33,310 ) Other (9,489 ) (20,385 ) 10,896 Net cash provided by financing activities $ 331,312 $ 197,570 $ 133,742 92 $700 million offering of unsecured senior notes payable In July 2014, we completed public offerings of $400 million aggregate principal amount and $300 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes payable at stated interest rates of 2.75% and 4.50% , respectively, at a weighted average interest rate of 3.50% and a weighted average tenor of 9.6 years. Refer to the 2.75% and 4.50% Unsecured Senior Notes Payable section under Sources and Uses of Capital in Item 7 of this report for details. Secured and unsecured bank loans As of December 31, 2014, our secured construction loans had an aggregate outstanding balance of $172.2 million and remaining available commitments of $169.2 million . Refer to Note 7 Secured and Unsecured Senior Debt, to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K for a discussion of our secured construction loans, secured notes payable, unsecured senior bank term loans, and our unsecured senior line of credit. Dividends During the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 , we paid the following dividends (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2014 2013 Change Common stock dividends $ 202,386 $ 169,076 $ 33,310 Series D Convertible Preferred Stock dividends 17,500 17,500 Series E Preferred Stock dividends 8,385 8,385 $ 228,271 $ 194,961 $ 33,310 The increase in dividends paid on our common stock was primarily due to an increase in the related dividends to $2.82 per common share for the year ended December 31, 2014 , from $2.49 per common share for the year ended December 31, 2013 . Inflation As of December 31, 2014 , approximately 95% of our leases (on an RSF basis) were triple net leases, requiring client tenants to pay substantially all real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, common area expenses, and other operating expenses (including increases thereto) in addition to base rent. Approximately 94% of our leases (on an RSF basis) contained effective annual rent escalations that were either fixed (generally ranging from 3% to 3.5% ) or indexed based on a consumer price index or another index. Accordingly, we do not believe that our cash flow or earnings from real estate operations are subject to any significant risk from inflation. An increase in inflation, however, could result in an increase in the cost of our variable-rate borrowings, including borrowings related to our unsecured senior line of credit and unsecured senior bank term loans. Critical accounting policies Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our significant accounting policies are described under the heading Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements under Item 15 of this Report. The preparation of these financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. We base these estimates, judgments, and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Changes in estimates could affect our financial position and specific items in our results of operations that are used by our stockholders, potential investors, industry analysts, and lenders in their evaluation of our performance. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 93 REIT compliance We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code. Qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the Internal Revenue Code to our operations and financial results, and the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control. We believe that our current organization and method of operation comply with the rules and regulations promulgated under the Internal Revenue Code to enable us to qualify, and continue to qualify, as a REIT. However, it is possible that we have been organized or have operated in a manner that would not allow us to qualify as a REIT, or that our future operations could cause us to fail to qualify. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, then we will be required to pay federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on our taxable income at regular corporate rates. If we lose our REIT status, then our net earnings available for investment or distribution to our stockholders will be significantly reduced for each of the years involved and we will no longer be required to make distributions to our stockholders. Investments in real estate and properties classified as held for sale We recognize real estate acquired (including the intangible value of above or below market leases, acquired in-place leases, client tenant relationships, and other intangible assets or liabilities), liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in an acquired entity at their fair value as of the acquisition date. If there is a bargain fixed-rate renewal option for the period beyond the non-cancelable lease term of an in-place lease, we evaluate factors such as the business conditions in the industry in which the lessee operates, the economic conditions in the area in which the property is located, and the ability of the lessee to sublease the property during the renewal term, in order to determine the likelihood that the lessee will renew. When we determine there is reasonable assurance that such bargain purchase option will be exercised, we consider its impact in determining the intangible value of such lease and its related amortization period. The value of tangible assets acquired is based upon our estimation of value on an as if vacant basis. The value of acquired in-place leases includes the estimated costs during the hypothetical lease-up period and other costs that would have been incurred in the execution of similar leases, considering market conditions at the acquisition date of the acquired in-place lease. We assess the fair value of tangible and intangible assets based on numerous factors, including estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and capitalization rates and available market information. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors, including the historical operating results, known trends, and market/economic conditions that may affect the property. We also recognize the fair values of assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in acquisitions of less than a 100% interest when the acquisition constitutes a change in control of the acquired entity. Acquisition-related costs related to the acquisition of businesses, including real estate acquired with in-place leases, are expensed as incurred. The values allocated to buildings and building improvements, land improvements, tenant improvements, and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis using the shorter of the term of the respective ground lease and up to 40 years for buildings and building improvements, an estimated life of 20 years for land improvements, the respective lease term for tenant improvements, and the estimated useful life for equipment. The values of acquired above and below market leases are amortized over the terms of the related leases and recognized as either an increase (for below market leases) or a decrease (for above market leases) to rental income. The values of acquired in-place leases are classified in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, and amortized over the remaining terms of the related leases. A property is classified as held for sale when all of the following criteria for a plan of sale have been met: (i) management, having the authority to approve the action, commits to a plan to sell the property; (ii) the property is available for immediate sale in its present condition, subject only to terms that are usual and customary; (iii) an active program to locate a buyer and other actions required to complete the plan to sell have been initiated; (iv) the sale of the property is probable and is expected to be completed within one year ; (v) the property is being actively marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value; and (vi) actions necessary to complete the plan of sale indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn. Depreciation of assets ceases upon designation of a property as held for sale. Prior to adoption of the new discontinued ASU mentioned above, the operations of properties held for sale were classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of income, and amounts for all prior periods presented were reclassified from continuing operations to discontinued operations. 94 Subsequent to the adoption of the new discontinued operations ASU mentioned above, if the disposal of the property represents a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on our operations or financial results, such as (i) a major line of business, (ii) a major geographic area, (iii) a major equity method investment, or (iv) other major parts of an entity, then the operations of the property held for sale, including any interest expense directly attributable to it, are classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of income, and amounts for all prior periods presented are reclassified from continuing operations to discontinued operations. The disposal of an individual property generally will not represent a strategic shift and therefore not meet the criteria for classification as discontinued operations. Impairment of long-lived assets Long-lived assets to be held and used, including our rental properties, CIP, land held for development, and intangibles, are individually evaluated for impairment when conditions exist that may indicate that the amount of a long-lived asset may not be recoverable. The amount of a long-lived asset to be held and used is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. Impairment indicators or triggering events for long-lived assets to be held and used, including our rental properties, CIP, and land held for development, are assessed by project and include significant fluctuations in estimated revenue less rental operating expense, occupancy changes, significant near-term lease expirations, current and historical operating and/or cash flow losses, construction costs, estimated completion dates, rental rates, and other market factors. We assess the expected undiscounted cash flows based upon numerous factors, including, but not limited to, construction costs, available market information, current and historical operating results, known trends, current market/economic conditions that may affect the property, and our assumptions about the use of the asset, including, if necessary, a probability-weighted approach if multiple outcomes are under consideration. Upon determination that an impairment has occurred, a write-down is recognized to reduce the carrying amount to its estimated fair value. If an impairment loss is not required to be recognized, the recognition of depreciation is adjusted prospectively, as necessary, to reduce the carrying amount of the real estate to its estimated disposition value over the remaining period that the real estate is expected to be held and used. We may adjust depreciation of properties that are expected to be disposed of or redeveloped prior to the end of their useful lives. We use the held for sale impairment model for our properties classified as held for sale. The held for sale impairment model is different from the held and used impairment model. Under the held for sale impairment model, an impairment loss is recognized if the amount of the long-lived asset classified as held for sale exceeds its fair value less cost to sell. Because of these two different models, it is possible for a long-lived asset previously classified as held and used to require the recognition of an impairment charge upon classification as held for sale. Capitalization of costs We are required to capitalize project costs, including predevelopment costs, interest, property taxes, insurance, and other costs directly related and essential to the acquisition, development, redevelopment, or construction of a project. Capitalization of development, redevelopment, and construction costs is required while activities are ongoing to prepare an asset for its intended use. Costs incurred after a project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use are expensed as incurred. Should development, redevelopment, or construction activity cease, interest, property taxes, insurance, and certain other costs would no longer be eligible for capitalization and would be expensed as incurred. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance and demolition are expensed as incurred. We also capitalize costs directly related and essential to our leasing activities. These costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the related leases. Costs related to unsuccessful leasing opportunities are expensed as incurred. 95 Investments We hold equity investments in certain publicly traded companies and investments in certain privately held entities and limited partnerships primarily involved in the science and technology industries. All of our investments in actively traded public companies are considered available for sale and are reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at fair value. Fair value has been determined based upon the closing price as of each balance sheet date, with unrealized gains and losses shown as a separate component of comprehensive income. The classification of each investment is determined at the time each investment is made, and such determination is reevaluated at each balance sheet date. The cost of each investment sold is determined by the specific identification method, with realized gains or losses classified in other income in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. Investments in privately held entities are generally accounted for under the cost method when our interest in the entity is so minor that we have virtually no influence over the entity operating and financial policies. Certain investments in privately held entities are accounted for under the equity method unless our interest in the entity is deemed to be so minor that we have virtually no influence over the entity operating and financial policies. Under the equity method of accounting, we recognize our investment initially at cost and adjust the amount of the investment to recognize our share of the earnings or losses of the investee subsequent to the date of our investment. Additionally, we limit our ownership percentage in the voting stock of each individual entity to less than 10% . As of December 31, 2014 and 2013 , our ownership percentage in the voting stock of each individual entity was less than 10% . We monitor each of our equity investments throughout the year for new developments, including operating results, results of clinical trials, capital-raising events, and mergers and acquisitions activities. Individual investments are evaluated for impairment when changes in conditions may indicate an impairment exists. The factors that we consider in making these assessments include, but are not limited to, market prices, market conditions, available financing, prospects for favorable or unfavorable clinical trial results, new product initiatives, and new collaborative agreements. If there are no identified events or changes in circumstances that might have an adverse effect on our cost method investments, we do not estimate the investment fair value. For all of our investments, if a decline in the fair value of an investment below the carrying value is determined to be other than temporary, such investment is written down to its estimated fair value with a charge to current earnings. Interest rate swap agreements We are exposed to certain risks arising from both our business operations and economic conditions. We principally manage our exposures to a wide variety of business and operational risks through management of our core business activities. We manage economic risks, including interest rate, liquidity, and credit risk, primarily by managing the amount, sources, and duration of our debt funding and the use of interest rate swap agreements. Specifically, we enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage exposures that arise from business activities that result in the payment of future known and uncertain cash amounts, the value of which are determined by interest rates. Our interest rate swap agreements are used to manage differences in the amount, timing, and duration of our known or expected cash payments principally related to our borrowings based on LIBOR. We do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes and currently all of our derivatives are designated as hedges. Our objectives in using interest rate swap agreements are to add stability to interest expense and to manage our exposure to interest rate movements in accordance with our interest rate risk management strategy. All of our interest rate swaps are designated as cash flow hedges. Interest rate swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable-rate amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making fixed-rate payments over the life of the interest rate swap agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount of interest rate swap agreements. We utilize interest rate swap agreements to hedge a portion of our exposure to variable interest rates primarily associated with borrowings based on LIBOR. We recognize our interest rate swap agreements as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet at fair value. The accounting for changes in fair value (i.e., gains or losses) of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and, further, on the type of hedging relationship. For those derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments, a company must designate the hedging instrument, based on the hedged exposure, as a fair value hedge, a cash flow hedge, or a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation. Our interest rate swap agreements are considered cash flow hedges because they are designated and qualify as hedges of the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows. Hedge accounting generally provides for the matching of the timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging instrument with the recognition of the changes in the earnings effect of the hedged transactions in a cash flow hedge. All of our interest rate swap agreements meet the criteria to be deemed highly effective in reducing our exposure to variable interest rates. We formally document all relationships between interest rate swap agreements and hedged items, including the method for evaluating effectiveness and the risk strategy. We make an assessment at the inception of each interest rate swap agreement and on an ongoing basis to determine whether these instruments are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows associated with the hedged items. The ineffective portion of each interest rate swap agreement is immediately recognized in earnings. While we intend to continue to meet the conditions for such hedge accounting, if swaps did not qualify as highly effective, the changes in the fair values of the derivatives used as hedges would be reflected in earnings. 96 The effective portion of changes in the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements that are designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income. Amounts classified in accumulated other comprehensive income will be reclassified into earnings in the period during which the hedged transactions affect earnings. The fair value of each interest rate swap agreement is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analyses on the expected cash flows of each derivative. These analyses reflect the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity, and use observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves and implied volatilities. The fair values of our interest rate swap agreements are determined using the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future fixed cash payments and the discounted expected variable cash receipts. The variable cash receipts are based on an expectation of future interest rates (forward curves) derived from observable market interest rate curves. The fair value calculation also includes an amount for risk of non-performance of our counterparties using significant unobservable inputs such as estimates of current credit spreads to evaluate the likelihood of default, which we have determined to be insignificant to the overall fair value of our interest rate swap agreements. Recognition of rental income and tenant recoveries Rental income from leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the respective lease terms. We classify amounts currently recognized as income, and expected to be received in later years, as an asset classified as deferred rent in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Amounts received currently, but recognized as income in future years, are classified in accounts payable, accrued expenses, and tenant security deposits in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. We commence recognition of rental income at the date the property is ready for its intended use and the client tenant takes possession of or controls the physical use of the property. Tenant recoveries related to reimbursement of real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, repairs and maintenance, common area expenses, and other operating expenses are recognized as revenue in the period during which the applicable expenses are incurred. Tenant receivables consist primarily of amounts due for contractual lease payments, reimbursements of common-area maintenance expenses, property taxes, and other expenses recoverable from client tenants. Tenant receivables are expected to be collected within one year. We may maintain an allowance for estimated losses that may result from the inability of our client tenants to make payments required under the terms of the lease and for tenant recoveries due. If a client tenant fails to make contractual payments beyond any allowance, we may recognize additional bad debt expense in future periods equal to the amount of uncollectible rent and deferred rent receivables arising from the straight-lining of rent. As of December 31, 2014 and 2013 , we had no allowance for estimated losses. As of December 31, 2014 , approximately 95% of our leases (on an RSF basis) were triple net leases, requiring client tenants to pay substantially all real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, common area expenses, and other operating expenses (including increases thereto) in addition to base rent. Approximately 94% of our leases (on an RSF basis) contained effective annual rent escalations that were either fixed or based on a consumer price index or another index. Additionally, approximately 93% of our leases (on an RSF basis) provided for the recapture of certain capital expenditures. Monitoring client tenant credit quality During the term of each lease, we monitor the credit quality of our client tenants by (i) reviewing the credit rating of client tenants that are rated by a nationally recognized credit rating agency, (ii) reviewing financial statements of the client tenants that are publicly available or that are required to be delivered to us pursuant to the applicable lease, (iii) monitoring news reports regarding our client tenants and their respective businesses, and (iv) monitoring the timeliness of lease payments. We have a team of employees who, among them, have graduate and undergraduate degrees in biology, chemistry, and industrial biotechnology and experience in the science and technology industries, as well as in finance. Our research team is responsible for assessing and monitoring the credit quality of our client tenants and any material changes in credit quality. 97 Non-GAAP measures FFO and FFO, as adjusted GAAP basis accounting for real estate assets utilizes historical cost accounting and assumes that real estate values diminish over time. In an effort to overcome the difference between real estate values and historical cost accounting for real estate assets, the Board of Governors of the NAREIT established the measurement tool of FFO. Since its introduction, FFO has become a widely used non-GAAP financial measure among equity REITs. We believe that FFO is helpful to investors as an additional measure of the performance of an equity REIT. Moreover, we believe that FFO, as adjusted, is also helpful because it allows investors to compare our performance to the performance of other real estate companies on a consistent basis, without having to account for differences caused by investment and disposition decisions, financing decisions, terms of securities, capital structures, and capital market transactions. We compute FFO in accordance with standards established by the Board of Governors of NAREIT in its April 2002 White Paper and related implementation guidance ( NAREIT White Paper ). The NAREIT White Paper defines FFO as net income (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (losses) from sales of depreciable real estate and land parcels and impairments of depreciable real estate (excluding land parcels), plus real estate related depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Impairments of real estate relate to decreases in the fair value of real estate due to changes in general market conditions and do not necessarily reflect the operating performance of the properties during the corresponding period. Impairments of real estate represent the write-down of assets when fair value over the recoverability period is less than the carrying value. We compute FFO, as adjusted, as FFO calculated in accordance with the NAREIT White Paper, plus losses on early extinguishment of debt, preferred stock redemption charges, impairments of real estate land parcels, impairments of investments, deal costs, realized gain on equity investment primarily related to one non-tenant life science entity, and the amount of such items that is allocable to our unvested restricted stock awards. Our calculations of both FFO and FFO, as adjusted, may differ from those methodologies utilized by other equity REITs for similar performance measurements, and, accordingly, may not be comparable to those of other equity REITs. Neither FFO nor FFO, as adjusted, should be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indication of financial performance, or to cash flows from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of liquidity, nor are they indicative of the availability of funds for our cash needs, including funds available to make distributions. AFFO AFFO is a non-GAAP financial measure that we use as a supplemental measure of our performance. We compute AFFO by adding to or deducting from FFO, as adjusted: (i) non-revenue-enhancing building improvements (excluding amounts recoverable from our client tenants), non-revenue-enhancing tenant improvements and leasing commissions (excluding revenue-enhancing and development and redevelopment expenditures); (ii) effects of straight-line rent revenue and straight-line rent expense on ground leases; (iii) capitalized income from development projects; (iv) amortization of acquired above and below market leases, loan fees, and debt premiums/discounts; (v) stock compensation expense; and (vi) allocation of AFFO attributable to unvested restricted stock awards. We believe that AFFO is a useful supplemental performance measure because it further adjusts FFO to: (i) deduct certain expenditures that, although capitalized and classified in depreciation expense, do not enhance the revenue or cash flows of our properties; (ii) eliminate the effect of straight-lining our rental income and capitalizing income from development projects; and (iii) eliminate the effect of items that are not indicative of our core operations and that do not actually reduce the amount of cash generated by our operations. We believe that eliminating the effect of charges related to share-based compensation facilitates a comparison of our operations across periods and among other equity REITs without the variances caused by different valuation methodologies, the volatility of the expense (which depends on market forces outside our control), and the assumptions and the variety of award types that a company can use. We believe that AFFO provides useful information by excluding certain items that are not representative of our core operating results because such items are dependent upon historical costs or are subject to judgmental valuation inputs and the timing of our decisions. AFFO is not intended to represent cash flow for the period, and is intended only to provide an additional measure of performance. We believe that net income attributable to Alexandria common stockholders is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to AFFO. We believe that AFFO is a widely recognized measure of the operations of equity REITs, and presenting AFFO will enable investors to assess our performance in comparison to other equity REITs. However, other equity REITs may use different methodologies for calculating AFFO and, accordingly, our AFFO may not be comparable to AFFO calculated by other equity REITs. AFFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indication of financial performance, or to cash flows from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of our liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make distributions. 98 The following table presents a reconciliation of net income attributable to Alexandria common stockholders basic, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, to FFO attributable to Alexandria common stockholders basic, FFO attributable to Alexandria common stockholders diluted, as adjusted, and AFFO attributable to Alexandria common stockholders diluted, for the periods below. Amounts in the table below include our share of unconsolidated joint venture amounts.

We use Adjusted EBITDA to assess the performance of our core operations, for financial and operational decision making, and as a supplemental or additional means of evaluating period-to-period comparisons on a consistent basis. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as EBITDA, excluding stock compensation expense, gains or losses on early extinguishment of debt, gains or losses on sales of real estate, deal costs, and impairments. We believe Adjusted EBITDA provides investors relevant and useful information because it permits investors to view income from our operations on an unleveraged basis before the effects of taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock compensation expense, gains or losses on early extinguishment of debt, gains or losses on sales of real estate, deal costs, and impairments, including our share from our unconsolidated joint ventures. By excluding interest expense and gains or losses on early extinguishment of debt, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA allow investors to measure our performance independent of our capital structure and indebtedness and, therefore, allow for a more meaningful comparison of our performance to that of other companies, both in the real estate industry and in other industries. We believe that excluding charges related to share-based compensation facilitates a comparison of our operations across periods and among other equity REITs without the variances caused by different valuation methodologies, the volatility of the expense (which depends on market forces outside our control), and the assumptions and the variety of award types that a company can use. We believe that adjusting for the effects of gains or losses on sales of real estate, deal costs, and impairments provides useful information by excluding certain items that are not representative of our core operating results. These items are dependent upon historical costs, and are subject to judgmental inputs and the timing of our decisions. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have limitations as measures of our performance. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect our historical cash expenditures or future cash requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments. While EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are relevant and widely used measures of performance, they do not represent net income or cash flows from operations as defined by GAAP, and they should not be considered as alternatives to those indicators in evaluating performance or liquidity. Further, our computation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similar measures reported by other companies. The following table reconciles net (loss) income, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA (in thousands): Three Months Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2014 2013 2014 2013 Net (loss) income $ (6,030 ) $ 44,222 $ 106,778 $ 140,249 Interest expense: Consolidated 22,188 17,783 79,299 67,952 Unconsolidated JVs 35 35 Total interest expense 22,223 17,783 79,334 67,952 Depreciation and amortization: Continuing operations 57,973 48,084 224,096 189,123 Discontinued operations 17 1,655 Unconsolidated JVs 329 329 Total depreciation and amortization 58,302 48,101 224,425 190,778 EBITDA 74,495 110,106 410,537 398,979 Stock compensation expense 4,624 4,011 13,996 15,552 Loss on early extinguishment of debt 525 1,992 (Gain) loss on sales of real estate rental properties (1,838 ) (1,838 ) 121 Gain on sales of real estate land parcels (5,598 ) (4,052 ) (6,403 ) (4,824 ) Impairment of real estate 51,675 51,675 Impairment of investments 853 853 Deal costs 1,446 1,446 Adjusted EBITDA $ 123,358 $ 112,364 $ 468,492 $ 414,119 101 Adjusted EBITDA margins Our total revenues exclude revenues from discontinued operations, and for the purposes of calculating the Adjusted EBITDA margin ratio, we exclude Adjusted EBITDA generated by our discontinued operations to improve the consistency and comparability from period to period. The following table reconciles Adjusted EBITDA to Adjusted EBITDA excluding discontinued operations (dollars in thousands): Three Months Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2014 2013 2014 2013 Adjusted EBITDA $ 123,358 $ 112,364 $ 468,492 $ 414,119 Add back: operating loss (income) from discontinued operations 116 126 605 (2,676 ) Adjusted EBITDA excluding discontinued operations $ 123,474 $ 112,490 $ 469,097 $ 411,443 Total revenues $ 188,674 $ 168,823 $ 726,877 $ 631,151 Adjusted EBITDA margins 65% 67% 65% 65% Fixed charge coverage ratio The fixed charge coverage ratio is the ratio of Adjusted EBITDA to fixed charges. This ratio is useful to investors as a supplemental measure of our ability to satisfy financing obligations and preferred stock dividends. Cash interest is equal to interest expense calculated in accordance with GAAP, plus capitalized interest, less amortization of loan fees and amortization of debt premiums/discounts. The fixed charge coverage ratio calculation below is not directly comparable to the computation of Consolidated Ratio of Earnings to Fixed Charges and Consolidated Ratio of Earnings to Combined Fixed Charges and Preferred Stock Dividends included in Exhibit 12.1 to this annual report on Form 10-K, as of December 31, 2014 . The following table presents a reconciliation of interest expense, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to cash interest and fixed charges (dollars in thousands): Three Months Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2014 2013 2014 2013 Adjusted EBITDA $ 123,358 $ 112,364 $ 468,492 $ 414,119 Interest expense $ 22,188 $ 17,783 $ 79,299 $ 67,952 Add: capitalized interest 11,665 14,116 47,105 60,615 Less: amortization of loan fees (2,822 ) (2,636 ) (10,912 ) (9,936 ) Less: amortization of debt discounts (17 ) (146 ) (117 ) (529 ) Cash interest 31,014 29,117 115,375 118,102 Dividends on preferred stock 6,284 6,471 25,698 25,885 Fixed charges $ 37,298 $ 35,588 $ 141,073 $ 143,987 Fixed charge coverage ratio: period annualized 3.3x 3.2x 3.3x 2.9x trailing 12 months 3.3x 2.9x 3.3x 2.9x 102 Initial stabilized yield (unlevered) Initial stabilized yield is calculated as the quotient of the estimated amounts of NOI at stabilization and our investment in the property. Our initial stabilized yield excludes the impact of leverage. Our cash rents related to our value-creation projects are expected to increase over time and our average cash yields are expected, in general, to be greater than our initial stabilized yields (cash basis). Our estimates for initial stabilized yields, initial stabilized yields (cash basis), and total costs at completion, represent our initial estimates at the commencement of the project. We expect to update this information upon completion of the project, or sooner, if there are significant changes to the expected project yields or costs. Initial stabilized yield: reflects rental income, including contractual rent escalations and any rent concessions over the term(s) of the lease(s), calculated on a straight-line basis. Initial stabilized yield cash basis: reflects cash rents at the stabilization date after initial rental concessions, if any, have elapsed. Average cash yield reflects cash rents, including contractual rent escalations after initial rental concessions have elapsed, calculated on a straight-line basis. Net debt to Adjusted EBITDA Net debt to Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that we believe is useful to investors as a supplemental measure in evaluating our balance sheet leverage. Net debt is equal to the sum of total consolidated debt less cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash. Refer to Adjusted EBITDA for further information on the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA. The following table summarizes the calculation of net debt to Adjusted EBITDA as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 (dollars in thousands): As of December 31, 2014 2013 Secured notes payable $ 652,209 $ 708,831 Unsecured senior notes payable 1,747,370 1,048,230 Unsecured senior line of credit 304,000 204,000 Unsecured senior bank term loans 975,000 1,100,000 Less: cash and cash equivalents (86,011 ) (57,696 ) Less: restricted cash (26,884 ) (27,709 ) Net debt $ 3,565,684 $ 2,975,656 Adjusted EBITDA: quarter annualized $ 493,432 $ 449,456 trailing 12 months $ 468,492 $ 414,119 Net debt to Adjusted EBITDA: quarter annualized 7.2 x 6.6 x trailing 12 months 7.6 x 7.2 x NOI NOI is a non-GAAP financial measure equal to income from continuing operations, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, excluding loss on early extinguishment of debt, impairment of real estate, depreciation and amortization, interest expense, and general and administrative expense, including our share from our unconsolidated joint ventures. We believe NOI provides useful information to investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations because it primarily reflects those income and expense items that are incurred at the property level. Therefore, we believe NOI is a useful measure for evaluating the operating performance of our real estate assets. NOI on a cash basis is NOI, adjusted to exclude the effect of straight-line rent 103 adjustments required by GAAP. We believe that NOI on a cash basis is helpful to investors as an additional measure of operating performance because it eliminates straight-line rent adjustments to rental revenue. Further, we believe NOI is useful to investors as a performance measure because when compared across periods, NOI reflects the impact on operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, and operating costs, providing perspective not immediately apparent from income from continuing operations. NOI can be used to measure the initial stabilized yields of our properties by calculating the quotient of NOI generated by a property on a straight-line basis, and our investment in the property, excluding the impact of leverage. NOI excludes certain components from income from continuing operations in order to provide results that are more closely related to the results of operations of our properties. For example, interest expense is not necessarily linked to the operating performance of a real estate asset and is often incurred at the corporate level rather than at the property level. In addition, depreciation and amortization, because of historical cost accounting and useful life estimates, may distort operating performance at the property level. Impairments of real estate has been excluded in deriving NOI because we do not consider impairments of real estate to be property-level operating expenses. Impairments of real estate relate to changes in the values of our assets and do not reflect the current operating performance with respect to related revenues or expenses. Our impairments of real estate represent the write-down in the value of the assets to the estimated fair value less cost to sell. These impairments result from investing decisions and the deterioration in market conditions that adversely impact underlying real estate values. Our calculation of NOI also excludes charges incurred from changes in certain financing decisions, such as losses on early extinguishment of debt, as these charges often relate to the timing of corporate strategy. Property operating expenses that are included in determining NOI consist of costs that are related to our operating properties, such as utilities, repairs and maintenance; rental expense related to ground leases; contracted services, such as janitorial, engineering, and landscaping; property taxes and insurance; and property-level salaries. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of accounting and corporate compensation, corporate insurance, professional fees, office rent, and office supplies that are incurred as part of corporate office management. NOI presented by us may not be comparable to NOI reported by other equity REITs that define NOI differently. We believe that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of our operating results, NOI should be examined in conjunction with income from continuing operations as presented in our consolidated statements of income. NOI should not be considered as an alternative to income from continuing operations as an indication of our performance, or as an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity or our ability to make distributions. Same Properties NOI Refer to discussion of Same Properties and reconciliation of NOI to income from continuing operations in Results of Operations. Unencumbered NOI as a percentage of total NOI Unencumbered NOI as a percentage of total NOI from continuing operations is a non-GAAP financial measure that we believe is useful to investors as a performance measure of the results of operations of our unencumbered real estate assets, as it primarily reflects those income and expense items that are incurred at the unencumbered property level. We use unencumbered NOI as a percentage of total NOI from continuing operations in order to assess our compliance with our financial covenants under our debt obligations because the measure serves as a proxy for a financial measure under such debt obligations. Unencumbered NOI is derived from assets classified in continuing operations that are not subject to any mortgage, deed of trust, lien, or other security interest as of the period for which income is presented. Refer to the reconciliation of NOI to income from continuing operations in Results of Operations. The following table summarizes unencumbered NOI as a percentage of total NOI for the three months and years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 (dollars in thousands): Three Months Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2014 2013 2014 2013 Unencumbered NOI $ 111,741 $ 82,267 $ 426,943 $ 305,028 Encumbered NOI 20,970 36,664 81,688 137,084 Total NOI from continuing operations $ 132,711 $ 118,931 $ 508,631 $ 442,112 Unencumbered NOI as a percentage of total NOI 84% 69% 84% 69% 104
