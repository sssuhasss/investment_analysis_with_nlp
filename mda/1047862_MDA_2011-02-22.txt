As used in this report, the term the Companies refers to Con Edison and CECONY. CECONY is a subsidiary of Con Edison and, as such, information in this management discussion and analysis about CECONY applies to Con Edison. Information in any item of this report referred to in this discussion and analysis is incorporated by reference herein. The use of terms such as see or refer to shall be deemed to incorporate by reference into this discussion and analysis the information to which reference is made. Corporate Overview Con Edison principal business operations are those of the Utilities. Con Edison also has competitive energy businesses. See The Utilities and Competitive Energy Businesses in Item 1. Certain financial data of Con Edison businesses is presented below: Twelve months ended December 31, 2010 At December 31, 2010 (millions of dollars, except percentages) Operating Revenues Net Income Assets CECONY $ 10,573 79 % $ 893 90 % $ 32,435 90 % O&R 910 7 % 49 5 % 2,337 6 % Total Utilities 11,483 86 % 942 95 % 34,772 96 % Con Edison Development 3 % 1 % 467 1 % Con Edison Energy(a) 369 3 % 5 1 % 96 % Con Edison Solutions(a) 1,520 11 % 60 6 % 295 1 % Other(b) (50 ) % (16 ) (2 )% 516 2 % Total Con Edison $ 13,325 100 % $ 992 100 % $ 36,146 100 % (a) Net income from the competitive energy businesses for the twelve months ended December 31, 2010 includes $11 million of net after-tax mark-to-market gains (Con Edison Energy, $11 million). (b) Represents inter-company and parent company accounting. See Results of Operations, below. Con Edison net income for common stock in 2010 was $992 million or $3.49 a share ($3.47 on a diluted basis). Net income for common stock in 2009 and 2008 was $868 million or $3.16 a share ($3.14 on a diluted basis) and $1,196 million or $4.38 a share ($4.37 on a diluted basis), respectively. See Results of Operations Summary, below. For segment financial information, see Note N to the financial statements in Item 8 and Results of Operations, below. Results of Operations Summary Net income for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 was as follows: (millions of dollars) 2010 2009 2008 CECONY $ 893 $ 781 $ 783 O&R 49 43 44 Competitive energy businesses(a) 66 59 73 Other(b) (16 ) (15 ) 22 Total continuing operations 992 868 922 Discontinued operations(c) 274 Con Edison $ 992 $ 868 $ 1,196 (a) Includes $11 million, $19 million and $(59) million of net after-tax mark-to-market gains/(losses) in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. In 2008, also includes $131 million after-tax from the gain on sale of Con Edison Development ownership interests in electricity generating plants. See Note U to the financial statements in Item 8. (b) Consists of inter-company and parent company accounting. In 2008, also includes $30 million of after-tax net income related to the resolution of Con Edison legal proceeding with Northeast Utilities. See Results of Operations, below. (c) Represents the discontinued operations of certain of Con Edison Development ownership interests in electricity generating plants. See Note U to the financial statements in Item 8. 44 Table of Contents The Companies results of operations for 2010, as compared with 2009, reflect changes in the Utilities rate plans (including additional revenues designed to recover expected increases in certain operations and maintenance expenses, depreciation and property taxes and interest charges), and the operating results of the competitive energy businesses (including net mark-to-market effects). The results of operations for 2010 as compared with 2009 include a higher allowed electric return on common equity for CECONY. Operations and maintenance expenses were higher in 2010 compared with 2009 reflecting primarily higher costs for demand side management programs and employee health insurance, offset in part by savings in operating expenses through cost control efforts. The increase also reflects higher New York State assessments that are collected from customers and higher costs for pension and other postretirement benefits. Depreciation and property taxes were higher in 2010 compared with 2009 reflecting primarily the impact from higher utility plant balances. The following table presents the estimated effect on earnings per share and net income for common stock for 2010 as compared with 2009 and 2009 as compared with 2008, resulting from these and other major factors: 2010 vs. 2009 2009 vs. 2008 Earnings per Share Net Income (Millions of Dollars) Earnings per Share Net Income (Millions of Dollars) CECONY Rate plans, primarily to recover increases in certain costs $ 1.48 $ 410 $ 1.28 $ 351 Operations and maintenance expense (0.67 ) (184 ) (0.62 ) (169 ) Depreciation and property taxes (0.41 ) (116 ) (0.55 ) (151 ) Net interest expense 0.02 6 (0.14 ) (38 ) Other (includes dilutive effect of new stock issuances) (0.12 ) (5 ) 5 Total CECONY 0.30 111 (0.03 ) (2 ) O&R 0.01 6 (1 ) Competitive energy businesses Earnings excluding net mark-to-market effects, gain on the sale of ownership interests in electricity generating plants and discontinued operations 0.05 15 0.15 39 Net mark-to-market effects (0.03 ) (8 ) 0.29 78 Gain on the sale of ownership interests in electricity generating plants and discontinued operations (1.49 ) (405 ) Total competitive energy businesses 0.02 7 (1.05 ) (288 ) Northeast Utilities litigation settlement (0.11 ) (30 ) Other, including parent company expenses (0.03 ) (7 ) Total variations $ 0.33 $ 124 $ (1.22 ) $ (328 ) See Results of Operations below for further discussion and analysis of results of operations. Risk Factors The Companies businesses are influenced by many factors that are difficult to predict, and that involve uncertainties that may materially affect actual operating results, cash flows and financial condition. See Risk Factors in Item 1A. Application of Critical Accounting Policies The Companies financial statements reflect the application of their accounting policies, which conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The Companies critical accounting policies include industry-specific accounting applicable to regulated public utilities and accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits, contingencies, long-lived assets, derivative instruments, goodwill and leases. Accounting for Regulated Public Utilities The Utilities are subject to the accounting rules for regulated operations and the accounting requirements of the FERC and the state public utility regulatory commissions having jurisdiction. The accounting rules for regulated operations specify the economic effects that result from the causal relationship of costs and revenues in the rate-regulated environment and how these effects are to be accounted for by a regulated enterprise. Revenues intended to 45 Table of Contents cover some costs may be recorded either before or after the costs are incurred. If regulation provides assurance that incurred costs will be recovered in the future, these costs would be recorded as deferred charges or regulatory assets under the accounting rules for regulated operations. If revenues are recorded for costs that are expected to be incurred in the future, these revenues would be recorded as deferred credits or regulatory liabilities under the accounting rules for regulated operations. The Utilities principal regulatory assets and liabilities are listed in Note B to the financial statements in Item 8. The Utilities are each receiving or being credited with a return on all regulatory assets for which a cash outflow has been made. The Utilities are each paying or being charged with a return on all regulatory liabilities for which a cash inflow has been received. The regulatory assets and liabilities will be recovered from customers, or applied for customer benefit, in accordance with rate provisions approved by the applicable public utility regulatory commission. In the event that regulatory assets of the Utilities were no longer probable of recovery, as required by the accounting rules for regulated operations, these regulatory assets would be charged to earnings. At December 31, 2010, the regulatory assets for Con Edison and CECONY were $7,846 million and $7,209 million, respectively. Accounting for Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits The Utilities provide pensions and other postretirement benefits to substantially all of their employees and retirees. Con Edison competitive energy businesses also provide such benefits to certain of their employees. The Companies account for these benefits in accordance with the accounting rules for retirement benefits. In addition, the Utilities apply the accounting rules for regulated operations to account for the regulatory treatment of these obligations (which, as described in Note B to the financial statements in Item 8, reconciles the amounts reflected in rates for the costs of the benefit to the costs actually incurred). In applying these accounting policies, the Companies have made critical estimates related to actuarial assumptions, including assumptions of expected returns on plan assets, discount rates, health care cost trends and future compensation. See Notes A, E and F to the financial statements in Item 8 for information about the Companies pension and other postretirement benefits, the actuarial assumptions, actual performance, amortization of investment and other actuarial gains and losses and calculated plan costs for 2010, 2009 and 2008. The cost of pension and other postretirement benefits in future periods will depend on actual returns on plan assets, assumptions for future periods, contributions and benefit experience. Con Edison and CECONY current estimates for 2011 are increases, compared with 2010, in their pension and other postretirement benefits cost of $110 million and $103 million, respectively. The discount rates used to determine 2011 pension and other postretirement benefit accounting costs are 5.60 percent and 5.40 percent, respectively, and the expected return on plan assets (tax-exempt assets for postretirement benefit accounting costs) is 8.50 percent. The discount rate for determining the present value of future period benefit payments is determined using a model to match the durations of highly-rated (Aa and Aaa, by Moody s) corporate bonds with the projected stream of benefit payments. In determining the health care cost trend rate, the Companies review actual recent cost trends and projected future trends. The following table illustrates the effect on 2011 pension and other postretirement costs of changing the critical actuarial assumptions discussed above, while holding all other actuarial assumptions constant: Actuarial Assumption Change in Assumption Pension Other Postretirement Benefits Total (millions of dollars) Increase in accounting cost: Discount rate Con Edison (0.25 %) $ 30 $ 5 $ 35 CECONY (0.25 %) $ 28 $ 4 $ 32 Expected return on plan assets Con Edison (0.25 %) $ 20 $ 3 $ 23 CECONY (0.25 %) $ 19 $ 2 $ 21 Health care trend rate Con Edison 1.00 % $ $ 5 $ 5 CECONY 1.00 % $ $ $ Increase in projected benefit obligation: Discount rate Con Edison (0.25 %) $ 321 $ 47 $ 368 CECONY (0.25 %) $ 301 $ 40 $ 341 Health care trend rate Con Edison 1.00 % $ $ 27 $ 27 CECONY 1.00 % $ $ 3 $ 3 46 Table of Contents A 5.0 percentage point variation in the actual annual return in 2011, as compared with the expected annual asset return of 8.50 percent, would change pension and other postretirement benefit costs for both Con Edison and CECONY by approximately $19 million and $18 million, respectively, in 2012. Pension benefits are provided through a pension plan maintained by Con Edison to which CECONY, O&R and the competitive energy businesses make contributions for their participating employees. Pension accounting by the Utilities includes an allocation of plan assets. The Companies policy is to fund their pension and other postretirement benefit accounting costs to the extent tax deductible, and for the Utilities, to the extent these costs are recovered under their rate agreements. The Companies were not required to make cash contributions to the pension plan in 2010 under funding regulations and tax laws. However, CECONY and O&R made discretionary contributions to the plan in 2010 of $429 million and $39 million, respectively, and expect to make discretionary contributions in 2011 for CECONY and O&R of $502 million and $41 million, respectively. See Expected Contributions in Notes E and F to the financial statements in Item 8. Accounting for Contingencies The accounting rules for contingencies apply to an existing condition, situation or set of circumstances involving uncertainty as to possible loss that will ultimately be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. Known material contingencies, which are described in the notes to the financial statements, include the Utilities responsibility for hazardous substances, such as asbestos, PCBs and coal tar that have been used or generated in the course of operations (Note G); certain tax matters (Notes J and L); and other contingencies (Note H). In accordance with the accounting rules, the Companies have accrued estimates of losses relating to the contingencies as to which loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated and no liability has been accrued for contingencies as to which loss is not probable or cannot be reasonably estimated. The Utilities generally recover costs for asbestos lawsuits, workers compensation and environmental remediation pursuant to their current rate plans. Changes during the terms of the rate plans to the amounts accrued for these contingencies would not impact earnings. Accounting for Long-Lived Assets The accounting rules for property, plant and equipment require that certain long-lived assets must be tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. The carrying amount of a long-lived asset is deemed not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. Under the accounting rules an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount is not recoverable from such cash flows, and exceeds its fair value, which approximates market value. Accounting for Goodwill In accordance with the accounting rules for goodwill and intangible assets, Con Edison is required to test goodwill for impairment annually. See Notes K and T to the financial statements in Item 8. Goodwill is tested for impairment using a two-step approach. The first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value, including goodwill. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired. If the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The second step requires a calculation of the implied fair value of goodwill. Goodwill was $429 million at December 31, 2010. The most recent test, which was performed during the first quarter of 2010, did not require any second-step assessment and did not result in any impairment. The company most significant assumptions surrounding the goodwill impairment test relate to the estimates of reporting unit fair values. The company estimated fair values based primarily on discounted cash flows and on market values for a proxy group of companies. 47 Table of Contents Accounting for Derivative Instruments The Companies apply the accounting rules for derivatives and hedging to their derivative financial instruments. The Companies use derivative financial instruments to hedge market price fluctuations in related underlying transactions for the physical purchase and sale of electricity and gas and interest rate risk on certain debt securities. The Utilities are permitted by their respective regulators to reflect in rates all reasonably incurred gains and losses on these instruments. See Financial and Commodity Market Risks, below and Note O to the financial statements in Item 8. Where the Companies are required to make mark-to-market estimates pursuant to the accounting rules, the estimates of gains and losses at a particular period end do not reflect the end results of particular transactions, and will most likely not reflect the actual gain or loss at the conclusion of a transaction. Substantially all of the estimated gains or losses are based on prices supplied by external sources such as the fair value of exchange traded futures and options and the fair value of positions for which price quotations are available through or derived from brokers or other market sources. Accounting for Leases The Companies apply the accounting rules for leases and other related pronouncements to their leasing transactions. See Note J to the financial statements in Item 8 for information about Con Edison Development Lease In/Lease Out or LILO transactions, a disallowance of tax losses by the IRS and a favorable court decision in the company litigation with the IRS. In accordance with the accounting rules, Con Edison accounted for the two LILO transactions as leveraged leases. Accordingly, the company investment in these leases, net of non-recourse debt, is carried as a single amount in Con Edison consolidated balance sheet and income is recognized pursuant to a method that incorporates a level rate of return for those years when net investment in the lease is positive, based upon the after-tax cash flows projected at the inception of the leveraged leases. Liquidity and Capital Resources The Companies liquidity reflects cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as shown on their respective consolidated statement of cash flows and as discussed below. The principal factors affecting Con Edison liquidity are its investments in the Utilities, the dividends it pays to its shareholders and the dividends it receives from the Utilities and cash flows from financing activities discussed below. The principal factors affecting CECONY liquidity are its cash flows from operating activities, cash used in investing activities (including construction expenditures), the dividends it pays to Con Edison and cash flows from financing activities discussed below. The Companies generally maintain minimal cash balances and use short-term borrowings to meet their working capital needs and other cash requirements. The Companies repay their short-term borrowings using funds from long-term financings and operating activities. The Utilities cost of capital, including working capital, is reflected in the rates they charge to their customers. Each of the Companies believes that it will be able to meet its reasonably likely short-term and long-term cash requirements. See The Companies Require Access to Capital Market to Satisfy Funding Requirements and The Companies Also Face Other Risks That Are Beyond Their Control in Item 1A, Application of Critical Accounting Policies Accounting for Contingencies, above, and Utility Regulation in Item 1. 48 Table of Contents Changes in the Companies cash and temporary cash investments resulting from operating, investing and financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 are summarized as follows: Con Edison (millions of dollars) 2010 2009 Variance 2010 vs. 2009 2008 Variance 2009 vs. 2008 Operating activities $ 2,381 $ 2,466 $ (85 ) $ 640 $ 1,826 Investing activities (2,175 ) (2,360 ) 185 (1,071 ) (1,289 ) Financing activities (128 ) 80 (208 ) 295 (215 ) Net change 78 186 (108 ) (136 ) 322 Balance at beginning of period 260 74 186 210 (136 ) Balance at end of period $ 338 $ 260 $ 78 $ 74 $ 186 CECONY (millions of dollars) 2010 2009 Variance 2010 vs. 2009 2008 Variance 2009 vs. 2008 Operating activities $ 2,205 $ 2,222 $ (17 ) $ 1,036 $ 1,186 Investing activities (1,998 ) (2,108 ) 110 (2,448 ) 340 Financing activities (260 ) (20 ) (240 ) 1,328 (1,348 ) Net change (53 ) 94 (147 ) (84 ) 178 Balance at beginning of period 131 37 94 121 (84 ) Balance at end of period $ 78 $ 131 $ (53 ) $ 37 $ 94 Cash Flows from Operating Activities The Utilities cash flows from operating activities reflect principally their energy sales and deliveries and cost of operations. The volume of energy sales and deliveries is dependent primarily on factors external to the Utilities, such as growth of customer demand, weather, market prices for energy, economic conditions and measures that promote energy efficiency. Under the revenue decoupling mechanisms in CECONY electric and gas rate plans and O&R New York electric and gas rate plans, changes in delivery volumes from levels assumed when rates were approved may affect the timing of cash flows but not net income. See Note B to the financial statements in Item 8. The prices at which the Utilities provide energy to their customers are determined in accordance with their rate agreements. In general, changes in the Utilities cost of purchased power, fuel and gas may affect the timing of cash flows but not net income because the costs are recovered in accordance with rate agreements. See Recoverable Energy Costs in Note A to the financial statements in Item 8. The Companies cash flows from operating activities also reflect the timing of the deduction for income tax purposes of their construction expenditures. Cash paid by Con Edison for income taxes, net of any refunds received was $(25) million, $5 million and $394 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively (including $(18) million, $18 million and $(1) million for CECONY in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively). For 2010 and 2009, the Companies had no current federal income tax liability as a result, among other things, of the bonus depreciation provisions of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 and the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization and Job Creation Act of 2010. In addition, the company changed its method of determining the timing of deduction of certain repairs to utility plant. See Note L to the financial statements in Item 8. The Companies expect that they also will have no 2011 current federal income tax liability. Net income is the result of cash and non-cash (or accrual) transactions. Only cash transactions affect the Companies cash flows from operating activities. Principal non-cash charges include depreciation, deferred income tax expense and net derivative losses. Principal non-cash credits include amortizations of 49 Table of Contents certain net regulatory liabilities and the 2008 pre-tax gain on the sale of Con Edison Development ownership interests in electricity generating plants. Non-cash charges or credits may also be accrued under the revenue decoupling and cost reconciliation mechanisms in the Utilities electric and gas rate plans in New York. See Rate Agreements CECONY Electric and O&R Electric in Note B to the financial statements in Item 8. Net cash flows from operating activities in 2010 for Con Edison and CECONY were $85 million and $17 million lower, respectively, than in 2009. The decreases in net cash flows reflect the January 2010 semi-annual payment of CECONY New York City property taxes. A comparable semi-annual payment was not made in January 2009 because the company paid its 2008-2009 New York City fiscal year property taxes in July 2008. Net cash flows from operating activities in 2009 for Con Edison and CECONY were $1,826 million and $1,186 million higher, respectively, than in the 2008 period. The increases in net cash flows reflect the January 2008 semi-annual payment and July 2008 annual payment of CECONY New York City property taxes, compared with a semi-annual payment in July 2009. The Company achieved a 1.5 percent reduction in its New York City property taxes for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2009 by prepaying the annual tax amount in July 2008. The increase is offset by the effect of changes in commodity prices on cash collateral requirements under the Companies derivative instruments. For Con Edison, the increase also reflects the 2008 payment of income taxes on the gain on the sale of Con Edison Development ownership interests in electricity generating plants. The change in net cash flows also reflects the timing of payments for and recovery of energy costs. This timing issue is reflected within changes to accounts receivable customers, recoverable energy costs and accounts payable balances. The changes in regulatory assets principally reflect changes in deferred pension costs in accordance with the accounting rules for retirement benefits and changes in future federal income taxes associated with increased removal costs. See Notes A, B and E to the financial statements in Item 8. Cash Flows Used in Investing Activities Net cash flows used in investing activities for Con Edison and CECONY were $185 million and $110 million lower, respectively, in 2010 than in 2009. The decrease reflects primarily decreased construction expenditures in 2010, offset in part for CECONY by repayment of loans by O&R to CECONY in 2009. See Note S to the financial statements in Item 8. Net cash flows used in investing activities for Con Edison in 2009 were $1,289 million higher compared with 2008. The increase reflects primarily the absence of, in 2009, proceeds from the sale of Con Edison Development ownership interests in electricity generating plants in 2008, offset in part by decreased construction expenditures in 2009. Net cash flows used in investing activities for CECONY were $340 million lower in 2009 compared with 2008 reflecting primarily decreased construction expenditures and the repayment of loans by O&R. See Note S to the financial statements in Item 8. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Net cash flows from financing activities in 2010 for Con Edison and CECONY were $208 million and $240 million lower, respectively, than in 2009. In 2009, cash flows from financing activities for Con Edison and CECONY were $215 million and $1,348 lower, respectively, than in 2008. Con Edison cash flows from financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, reflect the issuance through public offerings of 6.3 million and 5.0 million Con Edison common shares resulting in net proceeds of $305 million and $213 million, respectively. The proceeds from these offerings were invested by Con Edison in CECONY. For CECONY, cash flows from financing activities in 2008 also reflect a $752 million capital contribution from Con Edison. Cash flows from financing activities for 2010, 2009 and 2008 also reflect the issuance of Con Edison common shares through its dividend reinvestment and employee 50 Table of Contents stock plans (2010: 4.2 million shares for $133 million, 2009: 2.4 million shares for $68 million, 2008: 1.7 million shares for $42 million). In addition, as a result of the stock plan issuances, cash used to pay common stock dividends was reduced by $48 million in 2010 and 2009 and $21 million in 2008. Net cash flows from financing activities during the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 also reflect the following CECONY transactions: 2010 Issued $350 million 4.45% 10-year debentures and $350 million 5.70% 30-year debentures; Redeemed at maturity $325 million 8.125% 10-year debentures and $300 million 7.50% 10-year debentures; and Issued $224.6 million of 1.45%, tax-exempt debt (subject to mandatory tender in 2012); the proceeds of which were used to refund 4.70% tax-exempt debt (that was also subject to redemption in 2012). 2009 Issued $275 million 5.55% 5-year debentures, $475 million 6.65% 10-year debentures and $600 million 5.50% 30-year debentures, the proceeds of which were used to redeem in advance of maturity $105 million 7.10% debentures and $75 million 6.90% debentures due 2028, to repay short-term borrowings and for other general corporate purposes; and Redeemed at maturity $275 million 4.70% 5-year debentures and $200 million 7.15% 10-year debentures. 2008 Issued $600 million 5.85% 10-year debentures, $600 million 6.75% 30-year debentures and $600 million 7.125% 10-year debentures, the proceeds of which were used to repay short-term borrowings and for other general corporate purposes; and Redeemed at maturity $180 million 6.25% 10-year debentures and $100 million 6.15% 10-year debentures. In 2008, Con Edison issued $326 million of unsecured notes in exchange for a like amount of secured project debt and redeemed at maturity $200 million 3.625% 5-year debentures. Con Edison net cash flows from financing activities also reflect the following O&R transactions: 2010 Issued $115 million 5.50% 30-year debentures; Redeemed in advance of maturity $45 million 7.00% 30-year debentures due 2029; Issued $55 million 2.50% 5-year debentures; the proceeds of which were used to purchase and cancel $55 million variable rate, tax-exempt debt that was due in 2014; and Redeemed at maturity $55 million 7.50% 10-year debentures. 2009 Issued $60 million 4.96% 10-year debentures and $60 million 6.00% 30-year debentures, the proceeds of which were used to redeem (in January 2010) $45 million 7.00% debentures due 2029, to repay short-term debt and for other general corporate purposes. 2008 Issued $50 million 6.15% 10-year debentures, the net proceeds of which were used for general corporate purposes, including repayment of short-term debt. 51 Table of Contents Cash flows from financing activities of the Companies also reflect commercial paper issuance (included on the consolidated balance sheets as Notes payable ). The commercial paper amounts outstanding at December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 and the average daily balances for 2010, 2009 and 2008 for Con Edison and CECONY were as follows: 2010 2009 2008 (millions of dollars, except weighted average yield) Outstanding at December 31 Daily average Outstanding at December 31 Daily average Outstanding at December 31 Daily average Con Edison $ $ 370 $ $ 277 $ 363 $ 517 CECONY $ $ 352 $ $ 169 $ 253 $ 380 Weighted average yield % 0.4 % % 0.4 % 2.4 % 3.4 % Common stock issuances and external borrowings are sources of liquidity that could be affected by changes in credit ratings, financial performance and capital market conditions. For information about the Companies credit ratings and certain financial ratios, see Capital Requirements and Resources in Item 1. Other Changes in Assets and Liabilities The following table shows changes in certain assets and liabilities at December 31, 2010, compared with December 31, 2009. (millions of dollars) Con Edison 2010 vs. 2009 Variance CECONY 2010 vs. 2009 Variance Assets Prepayments $ 210 $ Accounts receivable from affiliated companies 125 Regulatory asset Environmental remediation costs 303 241 Regulatory asset Unrecognized pension and other postretirement costs (101 ) (107 ) Liabilities Deferred income taxes and investment tax credits 993 932 Superfund and other environmental costs 300 233 Pension and retiree benefits (76 ) (78 ) Prepayments, Accounts Receivable from Affiliated Companies and Deferred Income Taxes and Investment Tax Credits The increase in prepayments for Con Edison, and in accounts receivable from affiliated companies for CECONY, reflects estimated federal income tax payments by the company that were made prior to the determination that the company had no current federal income tax liability for 2010. See Cash Flows from Operating Activities, above and Note L to the financial statements in Item 8. The increase in the liability for deferred income taxes and investment tax credits reflects the timing of the deduction of expenditures for utility plant which resulted in amounts being collected from customers to pay income taxes in advance of when the income tax payments will be required. See Cash Flows from Operating Activities, above. Regulatory Asset for Environmental Remediation Costs and Liability for Superfund and Other Environmental Costs The increase in the regulatory asset for environmental remediation costs and Superfund and other environmental costs liability reflects an increased estimate of costs for site investigation and remediation. See Note G to the financial statements in Item 8. Regulatory Asset for Unrecognized Pension and Other Postretirement Costs and Non-current Liability for Pension and Retiree Benefits The decreases in the regulatory asset for unrecognized pension and other postretirement benefit costs and the non-current liability for pension and retiree benefits reflects the final actuarial valuation of the underfunding of the pension and other retiree benefit plans as measured at December 31, 2010 in accordance with the accounting rules for pensions and the year amortization of accounting costs. The decrease in the non-current liability for pension and retiree benefits also reflects the contributions to the pension plan made by CECONY in 2010. See Notes B, E and F to the financial statements in Item 8. 52 Table of Contents Capital Requirements and Resources For information about capital requirements, contractual obligations and capital resources, see Capital Requirements and Resources in Item 1. Regulatory Matters For Information about the Utilities rate plans and other regulatory matters affecting the Companies, see Utility Regulation in Item 1 and Note B to the financial statements in Item 8. Financial and Commodity Market Risks The Companies are subject to various risks and uncertainties associated with financial and commodity markets. The most significant market risks include interest rate risk, commodity price risk, credit risk and investment risk. Interest Rate Risk The interest rate risk relates primarily to variable rate debt and to new debt financing needed to fund capital requirements, including the construction expenditures of the Utilities and maturing debt securities. Con Edison and its businesses manage interest rate risk through the issuance of mostly fixed-rate debt with varying maturities and through opportunistic refinancing of debt. Con Edison and CECONY estimate that at December 31, 2010, a 10 percent variation in interest rates applicable to its variable rate debt would not result in a material change in annual interest expense. Under CECONY current gas, steam and (beginning in April 2011) electric rate plans and O&R current New York gas rate plan, variations in long-term debt costs are reconciled to levels reflected in rates. Under O&R current New York electric rate plan, variations in variable tax-exempt debt interest expense are reconciled to the level set in rates. In addition, from time to time, Con Edison and its businesses enter into derivative financial instruments to hedge interest rate risk on certain debt securities. See Interest Rate Swaps in Note O to the financial statements in Item 8. Commodity Price Risk Con Edison commodity price risk relates primarily to the purchase and sale of electricity, gas and related derivative instruments. The Utilities and Con Edison competitive energy businesses have risk management strategies to mitigate their related exposures. See Note O to the financial statements in Item 8. Con Edison estimates that, as of December 31, 2010, a 10 percent decline in market prices would result in a decline in fair value of $106 million for the derivative instruments used by the Utilities to hedge purchases of electricity and gas, of which $85 million is for CECONY and $21 million is for O&R. Con Edison expects that any such change in fair value would be largely offset by directionally opposite changes in the cost of the electricity and gas purchased. In accordance with provisions approved by state regulators, the Utilities generally recover from customers the costs they incur for energy purchased for their customers, including gains and losses on certain derivative instruments used to hedge energy purchased and related costs. See Recoverable Energy Costs in Note A to the financial statements in Item 8. Con Edison competitive energy businesses use a value-at-risk (VaR) model to assess the market risk of their electricity and gas commodity fixed-price purchase and sales commitments, physical forward contracts and commodity derivative instruments. VaR represents the potential change in fair value of instruments or the portfolio due to changes in market factors, for a specified time period and confidence level. These businesses estimate VaR across their electricity and natural gas commodity businesses using a delta-normal variance/covariance model with a 95 percent confidence level. Since the VaR calculation involves complex methodologies and estimates and assumptions that are based on past experience, it is not necessarily indicative of future results. VaR for transactions associated with hedges on generating assets and commodity contracts, assuming a one-day holding period, for the years ended December 31, 2010, and 2009, respectively, was as follows: 95% Confidence Level, One-Day Holding Period 2010 2009 (millions of dollars) Average for the period $ 1 $ 1 High 1 2 Low 53 Table of Contents Credit Risk The Companies are exposed to credit risk related to transactions entered into primarily for the various energy supply and hedging activities by the Utilities and the competitive energy businesses. Credit risk relates to the loss that may result from a counterparty nonperformance. The Companies use credit policies to manage this risk, including an established credit approval process, monitoring of counterparty limits, netting provisions within agreements and collateral or prepayment arrangements, credit insurance and credit default swaps. The Companies measure credit risk exposure as the replacement cost for open energy commodity and derivative positions plus amounts owed from counterparties for settled transactions. The replacement cost of open positions represents unrealized gains, net of any unrealized losses where the company has a legally enforceable right of setoff. The Utilities had $38 million of credit exposure in connection with energy supply and hedging activities, net of collateral, at December 31, 2010, of which $2 million was with investment grade counterparties and $36 million was with commodity exchange brokers. Con Edison competitive energy businesses had $119 million of credit exposure in connection with energy supply and hedging activities, net of collateral, at December 31, 2010, of which $74 million was with investment grade counterparties, $19 million was with commodity exchange brokers and $26 million was with independent system operators. Investment Risk The Companies investment risk relates to the investment of plan assets for their pension and other postretirement benefit plans. See Application of Critical Accounting Policies Accounting for Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits, above. The Companies current investment policy for pension plan assets includes investment targets of 65 percent equities and 35 percent fixed income and other securities. At December 31, 2010, the pension plan investments consisted of 67 percent equity and 33 percent fixed income and other securities. Environmental Matters For information concerning climate change, environmental sustainability, potential liabilities arising from laws and regulations protecting the environment and other environmental matters, see Environmental Matters in Item 1 and Note G to the financial statements in Item 8. Impact of Inflation The Companies are affected by the decline in the purchasing power of the dollar caused by inflation. Regulation permits the Utilities to recover through depreciation only the historical cost of their plant assets even though in an inflationary economy the cost to replace the assets upon their retirement will substantially exceed historical costs. The impact is, however, partially offset by the repayment of the Companies long-term debt in dollars of lesser value than the dollars originally borrowed. Material Contingencies For information concerning potential liabilities arising from the Companies material contingencies, see Application of Critical Accounting Policies Accounting for Contingencies, above, and Notes B, G, H, J and L to the financial statements in Item 8. Results of Operations Results of operations reflect, among other things, the Companies accounting policies (see Application of Critical Accounting Policies, above) and rate plans that limit the rates the Utilities can charge their customers (see Utility Regulation in Item 1). Under the revenue decoupling mechanisms currently applicable to CECONY electric and gas businesses and O&R electric and gas businesses in New York, the Utilities delivery revenues generally will not be affected by changes in delivery volumes from levels assumed when rates were approved. Revenues for CECONY steam business and O&R businesses in New Jersey and Pennsylvania are affected by changes in delivery volumes resulting from weather, economic conditions and other factors. See Note B to the financial statements in Item 8. The Companies results of operations for 2010, as compared with 2009, reflect changes in the Utilities 54 Table of Contents rate plans (including additional revenues designed to recover expected increases in certain operations and maintenance expenses, depreciation and property taxes and interest charges), and the operating results of the competitive energy businesses (including net mark-to-market effects). The results of operations for 2010 as compared with 2009 include a higher allowed electric return on common equity for CECONY. Operations and maintenance expenses were higher in 2010 compared with 2009 reflecting primarily higher costs for demand side management programs and employee health insurance, offset in part by savings in operating expenses through cost control efforts. The increases also reflect higher New York State assessments that are collected from customers and higher costs for pension and other postretirement benefits. Depreciation and property taxes were higher in 2010 compared with 2009 reflecting primarily the impact from higher utility plant balances. For additional information about major factors affecting earnings, see Results of Operations Summary, above. In general, the Utilities recover on a current basis the fuel, gas purchased for resale and purchased power costs they incur in supplying energy to their full-service customers (see Recoverable Energy Costs in Note A and Regulatory Matters in Note B to the financial statements in Item 8). Accordingly, such costs do not generally affect the Companies results of operations. Management uses the term net revenues (operating revenues less such costs) to identify changes in operating revenues that may affect the Companies results of operations. Management believes that, although net revenues may not be a measure determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, the measure facilitates the analysis by management and investors of the Companies results of operations. A discussion of the results of operations by principal business segment for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 follows. For additional business segment financial information, see Note N to the financial statements in Item 8. Year Ended December 31, 2010 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2009 The Companies results of operations (which were discussed above under Results of Operations Summary ) in 2010 compared with 2009 were: CECONY O&R Competitive Energy Businesses and Other(a) Con Edison(b) (millions of dollars) Increases (Decreases) Amount Increases (Decreases) Percent Increases (Decreases) Amount Increases (Decreases) Percent Increases (Decreases) Amount Increases (Decreases) Percent Increases (Decreases) Amount Increases (Decreases) Percent Operating revenues $ 537 5.4 % $ 20 2.2 % $ (264 ) (12.5 )% $ 293 2.2 % Purchased power 100 3.9 7 2.1 (270 ) (14.5 ) (163 ) (3.4 ) Fuel (45 ) (8.9 ) N/A N/A (45 ) (8.9 ) Gas purchased for resale (266 ) (32.5 ) (37 ) (27.2 ) 1 11.1 (302 ) (31.4 ) Operating revenues less purchased power, fuel and gas purchased for resale (net revenues) 748 12.2 50 11.7 5 2.2 803 11.8 Other operations and maintenance 329 15.1 28 11.3 (2 ) (1.6 ) 355 13.9 Depreciation and amortization 43 5.8 2 4.8 4 80.0 49 6.2 Taxes, other than income taxes 170 11.4 4 8.9 4 28.6 178 11.5 Operating income 206 12.0 16 17.4 (1 ) (1.1 ) 221 11.6 Other income less deductions (7 ) (21.2 ) 16 Large 9 29.0 Net interest expense (4 ) (0.7 ) 7 25.0 (5 ) (16.7 ) (2 ) (0.3 ) Income, before taxes 203 17.0 9 13.6 20 35.1 232 17.6 Incomes taxes 91 22.5 3 13.0 14 Large 108 24.5 Net income for common stock $ 112 14.3 % $ 6 14.0 % $ 6 13.6 % $ 124 14.3 % (a) Includes inter-company and parent company accounting.

CECONY electric operating revenues increased $702 million in 2010 compared with 2009 due primarily to the electric rate plans ($772 million, which among other things, reflected a 10.15 percent return on common equity, effective April 2010, a 10.0 percent return, effective April 2009 and a 9.1 percent return, effective April 2008) and higher purchased power costs ($100 million), offset in part by the accrual for the revenue decoupling mechanism (a reduction of $124 million of revenues in 2010 compared with increased revenues of $116 million in 2009). CECONY revenues from electric sales are subject to a revenue 56 Table of Contents decoupling mechanism, as a result of which delivery revenues generally are not affected by changes in delivery volumes from levels assumed when rates were approved. Other electric operating revenues generally reflect changes in regulatory assets and liabilities in accordance with the revenue decoupling mechanism and other provisions of the company rate plans. See Note B to the financial statements in Item 8. Electric delivery volumes in CECONY service area increased 3.6 percent in 2010 compared with 2009. After adjusting for variations, principally weather and billing days, electric delivery volumes in CECONY service area increased 0.5 percent in 2010 compared with 2009. CECONY electric purchased power costs increased $100 million in 2010 compared with 2009 due to an increase in unit costs ($110 million), offset by a decrease in purchased volumes ($10 million). Electric fuel costs increased $9 million in 2010 compared with 2009 due to higher sendout volumes from the company electric generating facilities ($65 million), offset by lower unit costs ($56 million). CECONY electric operating income increased $181 million in 2010 compared with 2009. The increase reflects primarily higher net revenues ($593 million, due primarily to the electric rate plan, including the collection of a surcharge for a New York State assessment and the recovery of higher pension expense). The higher net revenues were offset by higher operations and maintenance costs ($229 million, due primarily to higher demand side management expenses ($120 million), the surcharge for a New York State assessment ($68 million), higher pension expense ($20 million), and higher costs for injuries and damages ($16 million), offset in part by reduced operating expenses due to cost control efforts), taxes other than income taxes ($147 million, principally property taxes) and depreciation and amortization ($36 million). The increased operating expenses in the first quarter of 2010 resulting from two severe winter storms were deferred as a regulatory asset, and did not affect electric operating income. See Regulatory Assets and Liabilities in Note B to the financial statements in Item 8. Gas CECONY results of gas operations for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared with the year ended December 31, 2009 is as follows: Twelve Months Ended (millions of dollars) December 31, 2010 December 31, 2009 Variation Operating revenues $ 1,541 $ 1,701 $ (160 ) Gas purchased for resale 552 818 (266 ) Net revenues 989 883 106 Operations and maintenance 368 281 87 Depreciation and amortization 102 98 4 Taxes, other than income taxes 209 195 14 Gas operating income $ 310 $ 309 $ 1 57 Table of Contents CECONY gas sales and deliveries, excluding off-system sales, in 2010 compared with 2009 were: Thousands of dths Delivered Revenues in Millions Twelve Months Ended Twelve Months Ended Description December 31, 2010 December 31, 2009 Variation Percent Variation December 31, 2010 December 31, 2009 Variation Percent Variation Residential 37,963 39,749 (1,786 ) (4.5 )% $ 733 $ 808 $ (75 ) (9.3 )% General 25,629 28,245 (2,616 ) (9.3 ) 366 421 (55 ) (13.1 ) Firm transportation 51,859 48,671 3,188 6.6 347 266 81 30.5 Total firm sales and transportation 115,451 116,665 (1,214 ) (1.0 ) 1,446 1,495 (49 ) (3.3 ) Interruptible sales(a) 8,521 8,225 296 6.6 60 75 (15 ) (20.0 ) NYPA 24,890 37,764 (12,874 ) (34.1 ) 2 4 (2 ) (50.0 ) Generation plants 78,880 68,157 10,723 15.7 36 34 2 5.9 Other 20,786 18,297 2,489 13.6 51 39 12 30.8 Other operating revenues (54 ) 54 (108 ) Large Total 248,528 249,108 (580 ) (0.2 )% $ 1,541 $ 1,701 $ (160 ) (9.4 )% (a) Includes 3,385 and 2,851 thousands of dths for 2010 and 2009, respectively, which are also reflected in firm transportation and other. CECONY gas operating revenues decreased $160 million in 2010 compared with 2009 due primarily to a decrease in gas purchased for resale costs ($266 million), offset in part by the gas rate plans ($78 million). CECONY revenues from gas sales are subject to a weather normalization clause and a revenue decoupling mechanism as a result of which delivery revenues are generally not affected by changes in delivery volumes from levels assumed when rates were approved. Other gas operating revenues generally reflect changes in regulatory assets and liabilities in accordance with the company rate plans. See Note B to the financial statements in Item 8. CECONY sales and transportation volumes for firm customers decreased 1.0 percent in 2010 compared with 2009. After adjusting for variations, principally weather and billing days, firm gas sales and transportation volumes in the company service area increased 2.1 percent in 2010, reflecting primarily new business and transfers of interruptible customers to firm service. CECONY purchased gas cost decreased $266 million in 2010 compared with 2009 due to lower unit costs ($246 million) and sendout volumes ($20 million). CECONY gas operating income increased $1 million in 2010 compared with 2009. The increase reflects primarily higher net revenues ($106 million), offset by higher operations and maintenance expense ($87 million, due primarily to a surcharge for a New York State assessment ($30 million) and higher pension expense ($28 million)), taxes other than income taxes ($14 million, principally property taxes) and depreciation ($4 million). Steam CECONY results of steam operations for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared with the year ended December 31, 2009 is as follows: Twelve Months Ended (millions of dollars) December 31, 2010 December 31, 2009 Variation Operating revenues $ 656 $ 661 $ (5 ) Purchased power 54 54 Fuel 202 256 (54 ) Net revenues 400 351 49 Operations and maintenance 184 171 13 Depreciation and amortization 62 59 3 Taxes, other than income taxes 91 82 9 Steam operating income $ 63 $ 39 $ 24 58 Table of Contents CECONY steam sales and deliveries in 2010 compared with 2009 were: Millions of Pounds Delivered Revenues in Millions Twelve Months Ended Twelve Months Ended Description December 31, 2010 December 31, 2009 Variation Percent Variation December 31, 2010 December 31, 2009 Variation Percent Variation General 257 786 (529 ) (67.3 )% $ 21 $ 28 $ (7 ) (25.0 )% Apartment house 5,870 5,962 (92 ) (1.5 ) 160 165 (5 ) (3.0 ) Annual power 16,903 16,269 634 3.9 459 446 13 2.9 Other operating revenues 16 22 (6 ) (27.3 ) Total 23,030 23,017 13 0.1 % $ 656 $ 661 $ (5 ) (0.8 )% CECONY steam operating revenues decreased $5 million in 2010 compared with 2009 due primarily to lower fuel costs ($54 million), offset in part by the net change in rates under the steam rate plan ($53 million). Other steam operating revenues generally reflect changes in regulatory assets and liabilities in accordance with the company rate plans. See Note B to the financial statements in Item 8. Steam sales and delivery volumes increased 0.1 percent in 2010 compared with 2009. After adjusting for variations, principally weather and billing days, steam sales and deliveries decreased 1.3 percent in 2010, reflecting the impact of lower average normalized use per customer. CECONY steam purchased power costs were the same in 2010 compared with 2009. Steam fuel costs decreased $54 million in 2010 compared with 2009 due to lower unit costs ($59 million), offset by higher sendout volumes ($5 million). Steam operating income increased $24 million in 2010 compared with 2009. The increase reflects primarily higher net revenues ($49 million), offset by higher operations and maintenance expense ($13 million, due primarily to a surcharge for a New York State assessment ($8 million) and higher pension expense ($7 million), offset in part by lower customer accounts expense ($3 million)), taxes other than income taxes ($9 million, principally property taxes) and depreciation ($3 million). Taxes Other Than Income Taxes At over $1 billion, taxes other than income taxes remain one of CECONY largest operating expenses. The principal components of, and variations in, taxes other than income taxes were: (millions of dollars) 2010 2009 Increase/ (Decrease) Property taxes $ 1,271 $ 1,135 $ 136 (a) State and local taxes related to revenue receipts 315 282 33 Payroll taxes 65 59 6 Other taxes 5 10 (5 ) Total $ 1,656 (b) $ 1,486 (b) $ 170 (a) Property taxes increased $136 million reflecting primarily higher capital investments. (b) Including sales tax on customers bills, total taxes other than income taxes, billed to customers in 2010 and 2009 were $2,122 million and $1,866 million, respectively. Income Taxes Income taxes increased $91 million in 2010 compared with 2009 due primarily to higher taxable income in 2010. Other Income (Deductions) Other income (deductions) decreased $7 million in 2010 compared with 2009 due primarily to a penalty in 2010 ($5 million) from the NYSDEC relating to pollutants at the company steam generating facilities. See Permit Non-Compliance and Pollution Discharges in Item 3. Net Interest Expense Net interest expense decreased $4 million in 2010 compared with 2009 due primarily to lower interest charges on customer deposits ($6 million), offset in part by new debt issuances in 2010 and late in 2009 ($3 million). 59 Table of Contents O&R Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2010 Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2009 (millions of dollars) Electric Gas 2010 Total Electric Gas 2009 Total 2010-2009 Variation Operating revenues $ 692 $ 218 $ 910 $ 648 $ 242 $ 890 $ 20 Purchased power 335 335 328 328 7 Gas purchased for resale 99 99 136 136 (37 ) Net revenues 357 119 476 320 106 426 50 Operations and maintenance 216 59 275 193 54 247 28 Depreciation and amortization 32 12 44 30 12 42 2 Taxes, other than income taxes 35 14 49 33 12 45 4 Operating income $ 74 $ 34 $ 108 $ 64 $ 28 $ 92 $ 16 Electric O&R results of electric operations for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared with the year ended December 31, 2009 is as follows: Twelve Months Ended (millions of dollars) December 31, 2010 December 31, 2009 Variation Operating revenues $ 692 $ 648 $ 44 Purchased power 335 328 7 Net revenues 357 320 37 Operations and maintenance 216 193 23 Depreciation and amortization 32 30 2 Taxes, other than income taxes 35 33 2 Electric operating income $ 74 $ 64 $ 10 O&R electric sales and deliveries, excluding off-system sales, in 2010 compared with 2009 were: Millions of kWhs Delivered Revenues in Millions Twelve Months Ended Twelve Months Ended Description December 31, 2010 December 31, 2009 Variation Percent Variation December 31, 2010 December 31, 2009 Variation Percent Variation Residential/Religious(a) 1,893 1,799 94 5.2 % $ 347 $ 309 $ 38 12.3 % Commercial/Industrial 1,495 1,763 (268 ) (15.2 ) 211 231 (21 ) (9.1 ) Retail access customers 2,330 1,901 429 22.6 132 95 37 38.9 Public authorities 110 111 (1 ) (0.9 ) 12 11 1 9.1 Other operating revenues (10 ) 2 (12 ) Large Total 5,828 5,574 254 4.6 % $ 692 $ 648 $ 44 6.8 % (a) Residential/Religious generally includes single-family dwellings, individual apartments in multi-family dwellings, religious organizations and certain other not-for-profit organizations. O&R electric operating revenues increased $44 million in 2010 compared with 2009 due primarily to the New York electric rate plan ($19 million) and for O&R New Jersey and Pennsylvania operations the warmer summer weather in the 2010 period ($3 million). O&R New York electric delivery revenues are subject to a revenue decoupling mechanism, as a result of which, delivery revenues are generally not affected by changes in delivery volumes from levels assumed when rates were approved. O&R electric sales in New Jersey and Pennsylvania are not subject to a decoupling mechanism, and as a result, changes in such volumes do impact revenues. Other electric operating revenues generally reflect changes in regulatory assets and liabilities in accordance with the company electric rate plan. See Note B to the financial statements in Item 8. 60 Table of Contents Electric delivery volumes in O&R service area increased 4.6 percent in 2010 compared with 2009. After adjusting for weather variations and unbilled volumes, electric delivery volumes in O&R service area increased 0.7 percent in 2010 compared with 2009. Electric operating income increased $10 million in 2010 compared with 2009. The increase reflects primarily higher net revenues ($37 million), offset by higher operations and maintenance expense ($23 million), due primarily to a surcharge for a New York State assessment ($7 million) and higher pension expense ($6 million)), taxes other than income taxes ($2 million, principally state and local taxes) and depreciation ($2 million).

Effective November 2009, O&R New York gas delivery revenues became subject to a revenue decoupling mechanism. Sales and transportation volumes for firm customers decreased 4.9 percent in 2010 compared with 2009. After adjusting for weather and other variations, total firm sales and transportation volumes decreased 1.2 percent in 2010 compared with 2009. O&R New York revenues from gas sales are subject to a weather normalization clause that moderates, but does not eliminate, the effect of weather-related changes on net income. Gas operating income increased $6 million in 2010 compared with 2009. The increase reflects primarily higher net revenues ($13 million), offset by higher operations and maintenance costs ($5 million) and taxes other than income taxes ($2 million, principally property taxes). 61 Table of Contents Taxes Other Than Income Taxes Taxes, other than income taxes, increased $4 million in 2010 compared with 2009.

CECONY electric operating revenues decreased $204 million in 2009 compared with 2008 due primarily to lower purchased power ($563 million) and fuel costs ($129 million), offset in part by the 2009 electric rate plan ($368 million, which among other things, reflected a 10.0 percent return on common equity, effective April 2009, as compared with the 9.1 percent return previously reflected in rates) and an accrual for the revenue decoupling mechanism ($124 million). Effective April 2008, CECONY revenues from electric sales are subject to a revenue decoupling mechanism, as a result of which delivery revenues generally are not affected by changes in delivery volumes from levels assumed when rates were approved. Other electric operating revenues generally reflect changes in regulatory assets and liabilities in accordance with the revenue decoupling mechanism and other provisions of the company rate plans. See Note B to the financial statements in Item 8. Electric delivery volumes in CECONY service area decreased 2.8 percent in 2009 compared with 2008.

O&R electric operating revenues decreased $85 million in 2009 compared with 2008 due primarily to decreased recoverable purchased power costs ($105 million). Effective July 2008, O&R New York electric delivery revenues are subject to a revenue decoupling mechanism, as a result of which, delivery revenues are generally not affected by changes in delivery volumes from levels assumed when rates were approved. O&R electric sales in New Jersey and Pennsylvania are not part of a decoupling mechanism, and as a result, they do impact revenues. Other electric operating revenues generally reflect changes in regulatory assets and liabilities in accordance with the company electric rate plan. See Note B to the financial statements in Item 8. Electric delivery volumes in O&R service area decreased 5.6 percent in 2009 compared with 2008. After adjusting for weather variations and unbilled volumes, electric delivery volumes in O&R service area decreased 3.9 percent in 2009 compared with 2008, reflecting the impact of lower average normalized use per customer.
