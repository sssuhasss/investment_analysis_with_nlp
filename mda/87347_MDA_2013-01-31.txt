Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, statements relating to our plans, strategies, objectives, expectations, intentions and resources. Such forward-looking statements should be read in conjunction with our disclosures under Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Form 10-K. Executive Overview Schlumberger revenue reached a new high of $42.15 billion in 2012 an increase of 14% over 2011 driven by robust exploration and development both offshore and in key land markets. Outside North America, revenue grew 16%, while North America revenue grew 9%, with strong offshore activity in the US Gulf of Mexico outweighing a challenging land market. Global demand for oil recorded annual growth of some 0.8 million barrels per day for the second year running following the exceptionally strong recovery of 2010. Lower demand in the OECD countries through energy efficiency gains tempered stronger growth in the non-OECD economies and in China in particular. Oil supply grew by more than one million barrels per day in North America as light tight oil production accelerated although this was partially offset by decline in a number of non-OPEC countries. Within OPEC, production in Libya continued to recover leading to a slight increase in spare capacity, which remained relatively slim. This, together with ongoing geopolitical tension and the associated risk of supply disruption, continued to support oil prices. For natural gas, the three main markets continued to behave independently. In North America, storage levels remained at record highs throughout the year as a result of growing domestic production and mild weather that pushed spot prices to 10-year lows in April. Toward the end of the year, however, storage levels returned closer to historical averages. In Asia, natural gas prices remained close to oil parity, supported by sustained high demand in Japan following the 2011 nuclear incident and by strong demand in China. In Europe, lower demand was offset by declining domestic supply and the effect of demand in Asia. In this environment, Schlumberger achieved a record high for revenue, with strong contributions from all Areas. International performance was led by the Europe/CIS/Africa Area, where revenue was up 18%, mainly from strength in Russia and in the Nigeria & Gulf of Guinea, Angola, East Africa and North Sea GeoMarkets. In Latin America, revenue grew by 17%, driven by Integrated Project Management contracts on land, and activity for Wireline services and Drilling Group product and services offshore mainly in the Mexico & Central America; Venezuela, Trinidad & Tobago; and Ecuador GeoMarkets. Revenue in the Middle East & Asia Area increased by 13% on strong results in the Saudi Arabia & Bahrain, Australasia, Brunei, Malaysia & Philippines, and China GeoMarkets. And in North America, revenue grew by $1.2 billion to reach $13.5 billion, driven by a robust 38% increase in demand for deepwater and exploration services offshore, particularly in the US Gulf of Mexico. Revenue from North America land also improved a modest 4% on strong demand for Production Group technology, although this was tempered by weakness in the hydraulic fracturing market. All Product Groups recorded double-digit revenue growth. Reservoir Characterization revenue of $11.4 billion increased by 15%, with all Technologies also posting double-digit growth driven by offshore exploration activity across the Areas. Drilling Group revenue increased 15% to $16.0 billion, led by strong growth in M-I SWACO, Drilling & Measurements, and Drilling Tools & Remedial technologies. Production Group revenue of $14.9 billion increased 13%, with double-digit growth in Well Intervention, Completions and Artificial Lift Technologies. Well Services revenue also increased, primarily from offshore activity. Entering 2013, the world macroeconomic environment remains uncertain with the GDP growth outlook unchanged. However, global oil demand is expected to grow at similar levels to those seen in 2012 and 2011 and supply will see further growth in North America as light tight oil production increases. Other non-OPEC production, however, can be expected to continue to face delays and decline challenges. As a result, global spare capacity should remain largely unchanged absent any unexpected macroeconomic or geopolitical events, and this will support oil prices within the band we have seen since 2011. For natural gas, little change is expected in the behavior of the main geographical markets in 2013. 15 The following discussion and analysis of results of operations should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements . Fourth Quarter 2012 Results Product Groups (Stated in millions) Fourth Quarter 2012 Third Quarter 2012 Revenue Income before taxes Revenue Income before taxes Oilfield Services Reservoir Characterization $ 3,150 $ 917 $ 2,910 $ 838 Drilling 4,137 696 4,048 733 Production 3,924 590 3,675 548 Eliminations & other (37 ) (39 ) (25 ) 23 11,174 2,164 10,608 2,142 Corporate & other (1) (180 ) (176 ) Interest income (2) 6 8 Interest expense (3) (90 ) (85 ) Charges & credits (4) (93 ) (32 ) $ 11,174 $ 1,807 $ 10,608 $ 1,857 Geographic Areas (Stated in millions) Fourth Quarter 2012 Third Quarter 2012 Revenue Income before taxes Revenue Income before taxes Oilfield Services North America $ 3,409 $ 655 $ 3,290 $ 610 Latin America 2,071 377 1,860 333 Europe/CIS/Africa 2,958 579 2,985 646 Middle East & Asia 2,577 601 2,352 570 Eliminations & other 159 (48 ) 121 (17 ) 11,174 2,164 10,608 2,142 Corporate & other (1) (180 ) (176 ) Interest income (2) 6 8 Interest expense (3) (90 ) (85 ) Charges & credits (4) (93 ) (32 ) $ 11,174 $ 1,807 $ 10,608 $ 1,857 ( 1 ) Comprised principally of corporate expenses not allocated to the segments, interest on postretirement medical benefits, stock-based compensation costs, amortization expense associated with intangible assets recorded as a result of the 2010 acquisition of Smith International, Inc. ( Smith ) and certain other nonoperating items. ( 2 ) Excludes interest income included in the segments income (fourth quarter 2012 $- million; third quarter 2012 $- million). ( 3 ) Excludes interest expense included in the segments income (fourth quarter 2012 $3 million; third quarter 2012 $3 million). ( 4 ) Charges and credits are described in detail in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Oilfield Services Fourth-quarter revenue of $11.17 billion increased $567 million or 5% sequentially, on robust international activity. Of the revenue increase, approximately 36% came from the typical year-end surge in product and software sales, and 12% came from the increase in WesternGeco multiclient sales. Reservoir Characterization Group revenue grew 8% to reach $3.2 billion, while Drilling Group revenue of $4.1 billion was 2% higher. Production Group revenue increased 7% to $3.9 billion. Geographically, International revenue of $7.6 billion increased $409 million or 6% sequentially, while North America revenue of $3.4 billion grew by $118 million or 4% sequentially. 16 The sequential increase in Reservoir Characterization Group revenue resulted mainly from robust international end-of-year Schlumberger Information Solutions (SIS) software sales. Testing Services grew for the third successive quarter from higher activity in the Saudi Arabia & Bahrain GeoMarket. PetroTechnical Services posted double-digit revenue growth on strong consulting activity in the Mexico & Central America GeoMarket. WesternGeco increased slightly as the end-of-year multiclient sales and UniQ* land seismic technology direct sale in Russia were partly offset by a sharp seasonal decline in Marine revenue on lower vessel utilization following the seasonal transits out of the North Sea. Wireline revenue grew from increased activity in the US Gulf of Mexico but this was largely offset by a seasonal activity decline in Asia. Drilling Group revenue increased on international and offshore demand for Drilling & Measurements and M-I SWACO technologies. Drilling Tools & Remedial Services also contributed to growth with the full-quarter revenue from Radius services. IPM improved slightly as the combination of an increase in projects in Australia and new start-ups in Iraq and Argentina was partly offset by project completions in North Africa. The increase in Production Group revenue resulted primarily from stronger Completions and Artificial Lift product year- end sales coupled with new Framo subsea projects in the US Gulf of Mexico and in the North Sea and Angola GeoMarkets. Well Intervention Services revenue also increased on higher activity in the Mexico & Central America and Saudi Arabia & Bahrain GeoMarkets. Well Services revenue grew mainly due to higher activity in international and offshore North America markets. Well Services stage count in North America land also increased, but revenue declined from continued pricing weakness as a result of hydraulic horsepower oversupply. Among the Areas, Middle East & Asia revenue of $2.6 billion grew 10% sequentially led by the start of new IPM turnkey projects in Iraq; higher Testing, Well Intervention and Drilling Group services in addition to year-end product sales in the Saudi Arabia & Bahrain GeoMarket; the start of the Jurassic seismic project as well as strong product and year-end software sales in Kuwait; and the increase in IPM onshore projects and strong drilling activity in the Australasia GeoMarket. In Latin America, revenue of $2.1 billion increased 11% sequentially led by robust year-end software and product sales, strong PetroTechnical Services consulting activity, unconventional fracturing and well intervention stimulation activity in the Mexico & Central America GeoMarket. Higher WesternGeco vessel utilization for new seismic acquisition surveys in Brazil, Trinidad and Uruguay, coupled with the start of an IPM project in Argentina, also contributed to the increase. In Europe/CIS/Africa, revenue of $3.0 billion declined 1% mainly due to lower WesternGeco vessel utilization following the seasonal transit of vessels out of the North Sea. Completed IPM projects and service contract delays in North Africa and the completion of the WesternGeco survey in the Kara Sea in Russia also contributed to the decline. The sequential decrease, however, was partially offset by increased activity in Angola and higher product and software sales in the Russia and Central Asia region and the Continental Europe GeoMarket. North America revenue of $3.4 billion increased 4% sequentially mainly from offshore which rose by 24%, while land fell by 2%. The increase in offshore revenue resulted from both higher drilling activity as the number of deepwater drilling rigs increased and stronger year-end WesternGeco multiclient sales. The decline in land revenue was mainly due to continued pricing weakness for Well Services hydraulic fracturing activities. A seasonal decline in deviated and horizontal land drilling activity paired with pricing weakness also affected the Drilling Group segment in North America. On a worldwide basis, fourth-quarter pretax operating income of $2.2 billion increased 1% sequentially. International pretax operating income of $1.6 billion grew 1%, while North America pretax operating income of $655 million increased 7%. Pretax operating margin of 19.4% declined 83 basis points (bps) sequentially. International pretax operating margin of 20.5% declined 104 bps, which stemmed from a higher-than-usual seasonal slowdown and contractual delays in the Europe/CIS/Africa Area that traditionally attract higher margins. In North America, pretax operating margin of 19.2% increased 65 bps sequentially due to the increased contribution of high-margin offshore services, particularly in the US Gulf of Mexico, which more than offset margin decline in Drilling Group and Well Services activities on land. By segment, Reservoir Characterization Group pretax operating margin reached 29.1% while the pretax operating margins of the Drilling and Production Groups were 16.8% and 15.0%, respectively. Reservoir Characterization Group Fourth-quarter revenue of $3.15 billion increased $240 million or 8% sequentially. Pretax operating income of $917 million was 9% higher sequentially. Revenue increased mainly through robust international end-of-year SIS software sales while Testing Services grew for the third successive quarter from higher activity in the Saudi Arabia & Bahrain and Mexico & Central America 17 GeoMarkets. PetroTechnical Services revenue also posted double-digit growth on strong consulting activity in the Mexico & Central America GeoMarket. WesternGeco increased slightly as the end-of-year multiclient sales and UniQ land seismic technology direct sale in Russia were partly offset by the sharp seasonal decline in Marine revenue on lower vessel utilization following seasonal transits out of the North Sea. Wireline grew slightly on increased activity in the US Gulf of Mexico following the recovery from the activity shut-down associated with Hurricane Isaac in the previous quarter, but this was offset by a seasonal activity decline in Asia, mainly in the Australasia and China GeoMarkets. Pretax operating margin of 29.1% increased 31 bps sequentially. Margin expansion was primarily due to traditionally strong end-of-year sales of Schlumberger Information Services (SIS) software and WesternGeco multiclient licenses. Testing Services, Wireline and PetroTechnical Services margins also expanded on a more favorable technology mix in exploration and development projects. These improvements were, however, subdued by lower WesternGeco Marine margin as a result of lower vessel utilization. Drilling Group Fourth-quarter revenue of $4.1 billion increased $88 million or 2% sequentially. Pretax operating income of $696 million was 5% lower sequentially. Revenue increased on international and offshore demand for Drilling & Measurements and M-I SWACO products and services. Drilling Tools & Remedial Services activity also contributed to growth with a full-quarter of revenue for Radius services. IPM revenue grew slightly, as increased projects in Australia and new start-ups in Iraq and Argentina were partly offset by project completions in North Africa. The overall revenue increase was tempered by a decline in drilling-related services, mainly in North America land, due to a seasonal decline in deviated and horizontal drilling activity coupled with pricing weakness. Pretax operating margin of 16.8% decreased 128 bps sequentially. Among the Group Technologies, sequential margins in Drilling & Measurements and Drilling Tools & Remedial Services were flat, while margin contractions were recorded at M-I SWACO and IPM due to geographical mix and operational and start-up delays. Production Group Fourth-quarter revenue of $3.9 billion increased $249 million or 7% sequentially. Pretax operating income of $590 million was 8% higher sequentially. The increase in revenue resulted primarily from stronger Completions and Artificial Lift product year-end sales coupled with new Framo subsea projects in the US Gulf of Mexico and in the North Sea and Angola GeoMarkets. Well Intervention Services revenue increased on higher activity in the Mexico & Central America and Saudi Arabia & Bahrain GeoMarkets. Well Services revenue grew mainly due to higher activity in the international and the North America offshore markets. International activities were strong from stimulation vessel operations in Brazil, unconventional fracturing activity in Mexico, and new projects in Kuwait and Iraq. Well Services stage count in North America land also grew but land revenue declined on continued pricing weakness from the oversupply of hydraulic horsepower. Pretax operating margin increased 13 bps sequentially to 15%. The increase was largely attributable to the favorable impact of year-end Completions and Artificial Lift product sales coupled with improved profitability from new Framo subsea projects. This margin increase was largely offset by continued Well Services pricing weakness. 18 Full-Year 2012 Results Product Groups (Stated in millions) 2012 2011 Revenue Income before taxes Revenue Income before taxes Oilfield Services Reservoir Characterization $ 11,424 $ 3,212 $ 9,929 $ 2,449 Drilling (1) 15,971 2,824 13,860 2,254 Production (1) 14,875 2,371 13,136 2,637 Eliminations & other (121 ) (60 ) 34 (35 ) 42,149 8,347 36,959 7,305 Corporate & other (2) (694 ) (590 ) Interest income (3) 30 37 Interest expense (4) (331 ) (290 ) Charges & credits (5) (161 ) (223 ) $ 42,149 $ 7,191 $ 36,959 $ 6,239 Geographic Areas (Stated in millions) 2012 2011 Revenue Income before taxes Revenue Income before taxes Oilfield Services North America $ 13,485 $ 2,736 $ 12,323 $ 3,052 Latin America 7,554 1,387 6,467 1,074 Europe/CIS/Africa 11,443 2,245 9,676 1,477 Middle East & Asia 9,194 2,152 8,102 1,874 Eliminations & other 473 (173 ) 391 (172 ) 42,149 8,347 36,959 7,305 Corporate & other (2) (694 ) (590 ) Interest income (3) 30 37 Interest expense (4) (331 ) (290 ) Charges & credits (5) (161 ) (223 ) $ 42,149 $ 7,191 $ 36,959 $ 6,239 (1) Effective January 1, 2012, a component of the Drilling Group was reallocated to the Production Group.

(5) Charges and credits are described in detail in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Oilfield Services Full-year 2012 revenue of $42.15 billion increased 14% versus the same period last year with North America Area 9% higher and international activity 16% higher. Internationally, higher exploration and development activities in a 19 number of GeoMarkets both offshore and in key land markets contributed to the increase. The increase was led by the Europe/CIS/Africa Area which increased 18%, mainly in Russia and in the Nigeria & Gulf of Guinea, Angola, the East Africa and North Sea Africa GeoMarkets. Latin America was higher by 17%, mainly in the Mexico & Central America; Venezuela, Trinidad & Tobago; and Ecuador GeoMarkets driven by strong Integrated Project Management (IPM) activity on land and robust offshore activity for Wireline and Drilling Group services and products. Middle East & Asia increased 13% on strong results in the Saudi Arabia & Bahrain; Australasia; Brunei, Malaysia & Philippines; and China GeoMarkets. The increase in North America was due to strong growth in North America offshore driven by robust deepwater and exploration activity that benefited the Reservoir Characterization and Drilling Groups Technologies. There was also an improvement in activity in North America land for the Production Group Technologies although the increase slowed in the second half of the year due to the weakness in the hydraulic fracturing market. Full-year 2012 pretax operating income of $8.3 billion increased 14% year-on-year as international pretax operating income of $5.8 billion increased 31% while North America pretax operating income of $2.7 billion declined by 10% year-on-year. Pretax operating margin was essentially flat at 19.8% as international pretax operating margin expanded 226 bps to 20.5% while North America pretax operating margin declined 448 bps to 20.3%. Europe/CIS/Africa posted a 435 bps improvement to reach 19.6% and Latin America increased 175 bps to 18.4% and Middle East & Asia reported a 27 bps increase to 23.4%. North America margin decline was due to Well Services production technologies, as a result of pricing pressure and cost inflation. Reservoir Characterization Group Full-year revenue of $11.42 billion was 15% higher than the same period last year led by Wireline, Testing Services, WesternGeco and SIS Technologies driven by improved offshore exploration activities across all Areas Pretax operating margin increased 345 bps to 28.1% largely due to the higher-margin exploration activities that benefited Wireline and Testing Services, higher SIS software sales, higher WesternGeco marine vessel utilization and improved UniQ land seismic productivity. Drilling Group Full-year revenue of $15.97 billion was 15% higher than the previous year primarily due to the significantly improved exploration and development activities of M-I SWACO, Drilling & Measurements, and the other Drilling Group Technologies in North America offshore and in the international markets. Pretax operating margin increased 142 bps to 17.7% primarily due to the increase in higher-margin activities of Drilling & Measurements, M-I SWACO and Drilling Tools & Remedial technologies all of which benefited from exploration activities in North America offshore and in the international markets mainly in the Europe/CIS/Africa Area. Production Group Full-year revenue of $14.88 billion increased 13% year-on-year, both in North America and the international markets. Well Intervention, Artificial Lift and Completions Technologies posted strong growth across all Areas. Well Services grew both in North America and internationally, with international growth led by Latin America and by Europe/CIS/Africa. Pretax operating margin decreased 414 bps to 15.9% mainly due to a decline in margins for Well Services production technologies, primarily in North America, as a result of pricing pressure and cost inflation. This was mitigated by margin expansion for the other Production Group Technologies led by Well Intervention Services and Completions. 20 Full-Year 2011 Results Product Groups (Stated in millions) 2011 2010 Revenue Income before taxes Revenue Income before taxes Oilfield Services Reservoir Characterization $ 9,929 $ 2,449 $ 9,321 $ 2,321 Drilling (1) 13,860 2,254 7,917 1,313 Production (1) 13,136 2,637 9,366 1,389 Eliminations & other 34 (35 ) 68 48 36,959 7,305 26,672 5,071 Corporate & other (2) (590 ) (405 ) Interest income (3) 37 43 Interest expense (4) (290 ) (202 ) Charges & credits (5) (223 ) 625 $ 36,959 $ 6,239 $ 26,672 $ 5,132 Geographic Areas (Stated in millions) 2011 2010 Revenue Income before taxes Revenue Income before taxes Oilfield Services North America $ 12,323 $ 3,052 $ 6,730 $ 1,145 Latin America 6,467 1,074 4,985 807 Europe/CIS/Africa 9,676 1,477 7,850 1,449 Middle East & Asia 8,102 1,874 6,652 1,762 Eliminations & other 391 (172 ) 455 (92 ) 36,959 7,305 26,672 5,071 Corporate & other (2) (590 ) (405 ) Interest income (3) 37 43 Interest expense (4) (290 ) (202 ) Charges & credits (5) (223 ) 625 $ 36,959 $ 6,239 $ 26,672 $ 5,132 (1) Effective January 1, 2012, a component of the Drilling Group was reallocated to the Production Group. Historical information has been reclassified to conform to this presentation.

( 5 ) Charges and credits are described in detail in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements . 21 Oilfield Services Full-year 2011 revenue of $37.0 billion was 39% higher than 2010 primarily reflecting the acquisition of Smith on August 27, 2010 as well as the significantly improved activity, pricing and asset efficiency for Well Services Technologies in North America as the market transitioned to liquid-rich plays demanding increasing service intensity in drilling and completing horizontal wells. Year-on-year pretax operating margin increased 79 bps to 19.8% largely due to the improved pricing and asset efficiency for Well Services Technologies in North America and the resumption of higher-margin activity in the US Gulf of Mexico. However, the margin expansion was tempered by activity disruptions from the geopolitical unrest in North Africa and in the Middle East during the first quarter of 2011. Reservoir Characterization Group Full-year revenue of $9.93 billion was 7% higher than the previous year on stronger Wireline activity, higher WesternGeco marine and multiclient sales, and increased SIS software sales. Year-on-year, pretax operating margin decreased 23 bps to 24.7% led by margin declines in Wireline and Testing Services, largely due to the revenue mix, as well as the impact of geopolitical events which prevailed during the first quarter of 2011. The margin decline however was partially offset by a favorable WesternGeco multiclient sales mix and improved marine vessel utilization. Drilling Group Full-year revenue of $13.86 billion was 75% higher than the previous year reflecting the acquisitions of Smith, in August 2010, and Geoservices, in April 2010, partially offset by a decrease in IPM activities in Mexico. The ramp-up of IPM projects in Iraq also contributed to the revenue increase. Year-on-year, pretax operating margin decreased 32 bps to 16.3% largely due to the addition of the Smith and Geoservices activities as well as the effects of the geopolitical events. Production Group Full-year revenue of $13.14 billion was 40% higher than the previous year while pretax operating margin increased 525 bps to 20.1%. Well Services revenue and margins expanded strongly in North America on higher pricing, capacity additions and improved asset utilization and efficiency as the market transitioned to liquid-rich plays. Internationally, Well Services also posted growth on the strength of higher activity, despite the exceptional geopolitical events that occurred during the first quarter of 2011. Interest and Other Income Interest and other income consisted of the following: (Stated in millions) 2012 2011 2010 Interest income $ 30 $ 40 $ 50 Equity in net earnings of affiliated companies: M-I SWACO 78 Others 142 90 87 $ 172 $ 130 $ 215 Equity income from the M-I SWACO joint venture in 2010 represented eight months of equity income through the closing of the Smith transaction. Interest Expense Interest expense of $340 million in 2012 increased by $42 million compared to 2011 primarily due to the $1 billion of $1.25% Senior Notes due 2017 and $1 billion of 2.40% Senior Notes due 2022 that Schlumberger issued during 2012. Interest expense of $298 million in 2011 increased by $91 million compared to 2010 primarily due to the $4.6 billion of long-term debt that Schlumberger issued during 2011. 22 Other Research & engineering and General & administrative expenses, as a percentage of Revenue , were as follows: 2012 2011 2010 Research & engineering 2.8 % 2.9 % 3.4 % General & administrative 1.0 % 1.1 % 1.2 % Although Research & engineering decreased as a percentage of revenue in 2011 as compared to 2010, it increased in absolute dollars by $154 million. This increase in absolute dollars was driven in large part by the impact of the Smith acquisition. Income Taxes The Schlumberger effective tax rate was 24.0% in 2012, 24.2% in 2011, and 17.1% in 2010. The Schlumberger effective tax rate is sensitive to the geographic mix of earnings. When the percentage of pretax earnings generated outside of North America increases, the Schlumberger effective tax rate will generally decrease. Conversely, when the percentage of pretax earnings generated outside of North America decreases, the Schlumberger effective tax rate will generally increase. The effective tax rate for both 2011 and 2010 was impacted by the charges and credits described in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Excluding the impact of these charges and credits, the effective tax rate in 2011 was 23.8% compared to 20.5% in 2010. This increase in the effective tax rate, excluding the impact of the charges and credits, was primarily attributable to the fact that Schlumberger generated a larger proportion of its pretax earnings in North America in 2011 as compared to 2010 as a result of improved market conditions and the effect of a full year activity from the acquired Smith businesses. Charges and Credits Schlumberger recorded significant charges and credits in continuing operations during 2012, 2011 and 2010. These charges and credits, which are summarized below, are more fully described in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements .

Schlumberger maintains a 3.0 billion Euro Medium Term Note program. This program provides for the issuance of various types of debt instruments such as fixed or floating rate notes in Euro, US dollar or other currencies. 25 During the fourth quarter of 2010, Schlumberger issued 1.0 billion 2.75% Guaranteed Notes due under this program. Schlumberger entered into agreements to swap these euro notes for US dollars on the date of issue until maturity, effectively making this a US denominated debt on which Schlumberger will pay interest in US dollars at a rate of 2.56%. During the first quarter of 2009, Schlumberger issued 1.0 billion 4.50% Guaranteed Notes due 2014 under this program. Schlumberger entered into agreements to swap these euro notes for US dollars on the date of issue until maturity, effectively making this a US dollar denominated debt on which Schlumberger will pay interest in US dollars at a rate of 4.95%. On April 17, 2008, the Schlumberger Board of Directors approved an $8 billion share repurchase program for shares of Schlumberger common stock, to be acquired in the open market before December 31, 2011. On July 21, 2011, the Schlumberger Board of Directors approved an extension of this repurchase program to December 31, 2013. Schlumberger had repurchased $7.12 billion of shares under this program as of December 31, 2012. The following table summarizes the activity under this share repurchase program during 2012, 2011 and 2010: (Stated in thousands except per share amounts) Total cost of shares purchased Total number of shares purchased Average price paid per share 2012 $ 971,883 14,087.8 $ 68.99 2011 $ 2,997,688 36,940.4 $ 81.15 2010 $ 1,716,675 26,624.8 $ 64.48 Cash flow provided by operations was $6.8 billion in 2012, $6.1 billion in 2011 and $5.5 billion in 2010. In recent years, Schlumberger has actively managed its activity levels in Venezuela relative to its accounts receivable balance, and has recently experienced an increased delay in payment from its national oil company customer there. Schlumberger operates in approximately 85 countries. At December 31, 2012, only five of those countries (including Venezuela) individually accounted for greater than 5% of Schlumberger accounts receivable balance of which only one, the United States, represented greater than 10%. Dividends paid during 2012, 2011 and 2010 were $1.43 billion, $1.30 billion and $1.04 billion, respectively. On January 17, 2013, Schlumberger announced that its Board of Directors had approved an increase in the quarterly dividend of 13.6%, to $0.3125. On January 19, 2012, Schlumberger announced that its Board of Directors had approved an increase in the quarterly dividend of 10%, to $0.275. On January 21, 2011, Schlumberger announced that its Board of Directors had approved an increase in the quarterly dividend of 19%, to $0.25. Capital expenditures were $4.7 billion in 2012, $4.0 billion in 2011 and $2.9 billion in 2010. Capital expenditures are expected to approach $3.9 billion for the full year 2013. During 2012, 2011 and 2010 Schlumberger made contributions of $673 million, $601 million and $868 million, respectively, to its postretirement benefit plans. The US pension plans were 82% funded at December 31, 2012 based on the projected benefit obligation. This compares to 87% funded at December 31, 2011. Schlumberger international defined benefit pension plans are a combined 88% funded at December 31, 2012 based on the projected benefit obligation. This compares to 88% funded at December 31, 2011. Schlumberger currently anticipates contributing approximately $650 million to its postretirement benefit plans in 2013, subject to market and business conditions. There were $321 million outstanding Series B debentures at December 31, 2009. During 2010, the remaining $320 million of the 2.125% Series B Convertible Debentures due June 1, 2023 were converted by holders into 8.0 million shares of Schlumberger common stock and the remaining $1 million of outstanding Series B debentures were redeemed for cash. 26 As of December 31, 2012, Schlumberger had approximately $6.3 billion of cash and short-term investments on hand. Schlumberger had separate committed debt facility agreements aggregating $4.1 billion with commercial banks, of which $3.8 billion was available and unused as of December 31, 2012. This included $3.5 billion of committed facilities which support commercial paper borrowings in the United States and Europe. Schlumberger believes that these amounts are sufficient to meet future business requirements for at least the next 12 months. Schlumberger did not have any commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2012.

( 3 ) Represents an estimate of contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business. Although these contractual obligations are considered enforceable and legally binding, the terms generally allow Schlumberger the option to reschedule and adjust its requirements based on business needs prior to the delivery of goods. Refer to Note 18 Pension and Other Benefit Plans of the Consolidated Financial Statements for details regarding Schlumberger pension and other postretirement benefit obligations. As discussed in Note 14 Income Taxes of the Consolidated Financial Statements , included in the Schlumberger Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2012 is approximately $1.45 billion of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions in the over 100 jurisdictions in which Schlumberger conducts business. Due to the uncertain and complex application of tax regulations, combined with the difficulty in predicting when tax audits throughout the world may be concluded, Schlumberger cannot make reliable estimates of the timing of cash outflows relating to these liabilities. Schlumberger has outstanding letters of credit/guarantees which relate to business performance bonds, custom/excise tax commitments, facility lease/rental obligations, etc. These were entered into in the ordinary course of business and are customary practices in the various countries where Schlumberger operates. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires Schlumberger to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses. The following accounting policies involve critical accounting estimates because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by Schlumberger about matters that are inherently uncertain. A summary of all of Schlumberger significant accounting policies is included in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Schlumberger bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Multiclient Seismic Data The WesternGeco business capitalizes the costs associated with obtaining multiclient seismic data. The carrying value of the multiclient seismic data library at December 31, 2012 and 2011 was $518 million and $425 million, respectively. Such costs are charged to Cost of revenue based on the percentage of the total costs to the estimated total revenue that Schlumberger expects to receive from the sales of such data. However, under no circumstances will an individual survey carry a net book value greater than a 4-year, straight-line amortized value. The carrying value of surveys is reviewed for impairment annually as well as when an event or change in circumstance indicates an impairment may have occurred. Adjustments to the carrying value are recorded when it is 27 determined that estimated future revenues, which involve significant judgment on the part of Schlumberger, would not be sufficient to recover the carrying value of the surveys. Significant adverse changes in Schlumberger estimated future cash flows could result in impairment charges in a future period. For purposes of performing the annual impairment test of the multiclient library, future cash flows are analyzed primarily based on two pools of surveys: United States and non-United States. The United States and non-United States pools were determined to be the most appropriate level at which to perform the impairment review based upon a number of factors including (i) various macroeconomic factors that influence the ability to successfully market surveys and (ii) the focus of the sales force and related costs. Certain larger surveys, which are typically prefunded by customers, are analyzed for impairment on a survey by survey basis. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Schlumberger maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts in order to record accounts receivable at their net realizable value. Judgment is involved in recording and making adjustments to this reserve. Allowances have been recorded for receivables believed to be uncollectible, including amounts for the resolution of potential credit and other collection issues such as disputed invoices. Depending on how such potential issues are resolved, or if the financial condition of Schlumberger customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, adjustments to the allowance may be required. Goodwill, Intangible Assets and Long-Lived Assets Schlumberger records the excess of purchase price over the fair value of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired as goodwill. The goodwill relating to each of Schlumberger reporting units is tested for impairment annually as well as when an event, or change in circumstances, indicates an impairment may have occurred. Under generally accepted accounting principles, Schlumberger has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of one of its reporting units is greater than its carrying amount. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, Schlumberger determines it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, then there is no need to perform any further testing. However, if Schlumberger concludes otherwise, then it is required to perform the first step of a two-step impairment test by calculating the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing the fair value with the carrying amount of the reporting unit. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the implied fair value of the goodwill of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value. Schlumberger has the option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to performing the first step of the two-step goodwill impairment test. For purposes of performing the impairment test for goodwill, Schlumberger reporting units are its three Groups: Reservoir Characterization, Drilling and Production. Schlumberger elected to perform the qualitative assessment described above for purposes of its annual goodwill impairment test. Based on this assessment, Schlumberger concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair value of each of its reporting units was greater than its carrying amount. Accordingly, no further testing was required. Long-lived assets, including fixed assets and intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. In reviewing for impairment, the carrying value of such assets is compared to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition. If such cash flows are not sufficient to support the asset recorded value, an impairment charge is recognized to reduce the carrying value of the long-lived asset to its estimated fair value. The determination of future cash flows as well as the estimated fair value of long-lived assets involves significant estimates on the part of management. If there is a material change in economic conditions or other circumstances influencing the estimate of future cash flows or fair value, Schlumberger could be required to recognize impairment charges in the future. Schlumberger evaluates the remaining useful life of its intangible assets on a periodic basis to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining estimated amortization period. Income Taxes Schlumberger conducts business in more than 100 tax jurisdictions, a number of which have tax laws that are not fully defined and are evolving. Schlumberger tax filings are subject to regular audits by the tax authorities. These 28 audits may result in assessments for additional taxes which are resolved with the authorities or, potentially, through the courts. Tax liabilities are recorded based on estimates of additional taxes which will be due upon the conclusion of these audits. Estimates of these tax liabilities are made based upon prior experience and are updated in light of changes in facts and circumstances. However, due to the uncertain and complex application of tax regulations, it is possible that the ultimate resolution of audits may result in liabilities which could be materially different from these estimates. In such an event, Schlumberger will record additional tax expense or tax benefit in the period in which such resolution occurs. Pension and Postretirement Benefits Schlumberger pension and postretirement benefit obligations are described in detail in Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements . The obligations and related costs are calculated using actuarial concepts, which include critical assumptions related to the discount rate, expected rate of return on plan assets and medical cost trend rates. These assumptions are important elements of expense and/or liability measurement and are updated on an annual basis, or upon the occurrence of significant events. The discount rate Schlumberger uses reflects the prevailing market rate of a portfolio of high-quality debt instruments with maturities matching the expected timing of the payment of the benefit obligations. The following summarizes the discount rates utilized by Schlumberger for its various pension and postretirement benefit plans: The discount rate utilized to determine the liability for Schlumberger United States pension plans and postretirement medical plans was 4.25% at December 31, 2012 and 5.00% at December 31, 2011. The weighted-average discount rate utilized to determine the liability for Schlumberger international pension plans was 4.38% at December 31, 2012 and 4.95% at December 31, 2011. The weighted-average discount rate utilized to determine expense for Schlumberger United States pension plans and postretirement medical plans decreased from 5.50% in 2011 to 5.00% in 2012. The weighted-average discount rate utilized to determine expense for Schlumberger international pension plans decreased from 5.47% in 2011 to 4.95% in 2012. A higher discount rate decreases the present value of benefit obligations and decreases expense. The expected rate of return for our retirement benefit plans represents the average rate of return expected to be earned on plan assets over the period that benefits included in the benefit obligation are expected to be paid. The expected rate of return for Schlumberger United States pension plans has been determined based upon expectations regarding future rates of return for the investment portfolio, with consideration given to the distribution of investments by asset class and historical rates of return for each individual asset class. The weighted average expected rate of return on plan assets for each of the United States and international pension plans was 7.50% in both 2012 and 2011. A lower expected rate of return would increase pension expense. Schlumberger medical cost trend rate assumptions are developed based on historical cost data, the near-term outlook and an assessment of likely long-term trends. The overall medical cost trend rate assumption utilized to determine the 2012 postretirement medical expense was 8% graded to 5% over the next seven years. The overall medical trend rate assumption utilized to determine the postretirement medical liability at December 31, 2012 was 7.5% graded to 5% over the next eleven years. The following illustrates the sensitivity to changes in certain assumptions, holding all other assumptions constant, for the United States and international pension plans: (Stated in millions) Change in Assumption Effect on 2012 Pretax Pension Expense Effect on Dec. 31, 2012 Liability 25 basis point decrease in discount rate + $39 + $377 25 basis point increase in discount rate - $38 - $356 25 basis point decrease in expected return on plan assets + $17 25 basis point increase in expected return on plan assets - $17 29 The following illustrates the sensitivity to changes in certain assumptions, holding all other assumptions constant, for Schlumberger United States postretirement medical plans: (Stated in millions) Change in Assumption Effect on 2012 Pretax Postretirement Medical Expense Effect on Dec. 31, 2012 Liability 25 basis point decrease in discount rate + $5 +$55 25 basis point increase in discount rate - $4 - $52 100 basis point decrease per annum in medical cost trend rate - $14 -$203 100 basis point increase per annum in medical cost trend rate +$18 +$287 Investments in Affiliated Companies Investments in Affiliated Companies on the consolidated balance sheet primarily reflects Schlumberger investments in privately held companies, some of which are in the startup or development stages and are often still defining their strategic direction. Such investments are inherently risky and their success is dependent on factors such as technology development, market acceptance and their ability to raise additional funds. The technology being developed by these companies may never materialize and they could fail. Schlumberger monitors its portfolio to determine if any investment is other-than-temporarily impaired. If an investment is considered to be other-than-temporarily impaired, it is written down to its fair value. 30
