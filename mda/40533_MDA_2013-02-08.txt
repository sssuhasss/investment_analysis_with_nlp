ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS For an overview of our business groups, including a discussion of products and services provided, see the Business discussion contained in Part I, Item 1, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT As approximately two-thirds of our revenues are from the U.S. government, our financial performance is impacted by the level of U.S. defense spending. Currently, the U.S. government, including the Department of Defense (DoD), is operating under a continuing resolution (CR) that provides funding at fiscal year (FY) 2012 levels through March 2013. A CR does not generally fund new program starts or new multi-year contracts. A series of CRs over the past several years has negatively impacted the flow of contract awards, particularly in our shorter-cycle Information Systems and Technology business group. While U.S. military budgets are generally driven by national security requirements, the country current fiscal shortfall is negatively influencing defense spending. The Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA) mandated a $487 billion, or approximately 8 percent, reduction to previously-planned defense funding over the next decade. These cuts were incorporated into the FY 2013 proposed defense budget. In addition, the BCA included a sequester mechanism that would impose an additional $500 billion of defense cuts over nine years starting in FY 2013, which represents approximately 9 percent of planned defense funding over the period. If sequestration is triggered, the FY 2013 defense budget could be lowered by as much as $40 to $50 billion, or approximately 9 percent. However, how these reductions would be implemented has not been defined. Congress recently extended the deadline for resolving sequestration to March 1, 2013. As of February 7, 2013, a solution has not been identified. For FY 2013, the President requested total defense funding of $525 billion, which is down from FY 2012 funding of $531 billion. We anticipate that Congress will consider the FY 2013 defense spending bill in conjunction with the expiration of the current CR at the end of March. At that time, the CR will either be extended through the government year end, thereby keeping FY 2013 spending at FY 2012 levels, or the FY 2013 funding bill will be passed. The President has not yet published the FY 2014 budget request, although the FY 2014 topline mandated by budget reduction legislation is $527 billion. Because budget expenditures lag congressional funding, our associated revenues and earnings in a given year do not correspond directly with the current year budgeted amounts. In addition to the impact of U.S. budget deficit reduction negotiations, defense spending decisions over the next several years may also be shaped by the ongoing Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR), an analysis of military priorities and requirements commissioned every four years. We expect defense funding requirements to continue to be influenced by the following: the imperative to provide support for the warfighter in the face of threats posed by an uncertain global security environment, including the DoD increased emphasis on the Asia-Pacific region; the number of troops deployed globally, coupled with the overall size of the U.S. military; the need to reset and replenish equipment and supplies damaged and consumed in Iraq and Afghanistan since 2001; and the need to modernize defense infrastructure to address the evolving requirements of modern-day warfare, including an emphasis on soldier survivability, enhanced battlefield communications and new 26 technologies in the intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, unmanned systems and cyberspace arenas. Despite these budget uncertainties, the long-term outlook for our U.S. defense business is buoyed by the relevance of our programs to the military funding priorities, the diversity of our programs and customers within the budget, our insight into customer requirements stemming from our incumbency on core programs, our ability to evolve our products to address a fast-changing threat environment and our proven track record of successful contract execution. We continue to pursue opportunities presented by international demand for military equipment and information technologies from our indigenous international operations and through exports from our U.S. businesses. While the revenue potential can be significant, international defense budgets, much like U.S. budgets, are subject to unpredictable issues of contract award timing, changing priorities and overall spending pressures. As a result of the demonstrated success of our products and services, we would expect our international sales and exports to grow subject to overall economic conditions. In our Aerospace group, business-jet market conditions were steady in 2012. The group benefited from robust flying hours across the installed base of Gulfstream aircraft, improved large-cabin order interest from North American corporate customers and lower customer contract defaults. We expect our continued investment in new aircraft products to support Aerospace long-term growth, as evidenced by the group newest aircraft offerings, the G280 and the G650. Similarly, we believe that aircraft-service revenues provide the group diversified exposure to aftermarket sales fueled by continued growth in the global installed business-jet fleet. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS INTRODUCTION An understanding of our accounting practices is important to an evaluation of our operating results. We recognize the majority of our revenues using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting. The following paragraphs explain how this method is applied in recognizing revenues and operating costs in our Aerospace and defense business groups. In the Aerospace group, contracts for new aircraft have two major phases: the manufacture of the green aircraft and the aircraft outfitting, which includes exterior painting and installation of customer-selected interiors. We record revenues on these contracts at the completion of these two phases: when green aircraft are delivered to and accepted by the customer, and when the customer accepts final delivery of the outfitted aircraft. Revenues in the Aerospace group other original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) completions and services businesses are recognized as work progresses or upon delivery of services. Changes in revenues result from the number and mix of new aircraft deliveries (green and outfitted), progress on aircraft completions and the level of aircraft service activity during the period. The majority of the Aerospace group operating costs relates to new aircraft production for firm orders and consists of labor, material and overhead costs. The costs are accumulated in production lots and recognized as operating costs at green aircraft delivery based on the estimated average unit cost in a production lot. While changes in the estimated average unit cost for a production lot impact the level of operating costs, the amount of operating costs reported in a given period is based largely on the number and type of aircraft delivered. Operating costs in the Aerospace group completions and services businesses are generally recognized as incurred. 27 For new aircraft, operating earnings and margins are a function of the prices of our aircraft, our operational efficiency in manufacturing and outfitting the aircraft and the mix of aircraft deliveries between the higher-margin large-cabin and lower-margin mid-cabin aircraft. Additional factors affecting the group earnings and margins include the volume, mix and profitability of completions and services work performed, the market for pre-owned aircraft and the level of general and administrative (G&A) and net research and development (R&D) costs incurred by the group. In the defense groups, revenue on long-term government contracts is recognized as work progresses, either as products are produced or services are rendered. As a result, changes in revenues are discussed generally in terms of volume, typically measured by the level of activity on individual contracts or programs. Year-over-year variances attributed to volume are due to changes in production or service levels and delivery schedules. Operating costs for the defense groups consist of labor, material, subcontractor and overhead costs and are generally recognized as incurred. Variances in costs recognized from period to period primarily reflect increases and decreases in production or activity levels on individual contracts and, therefore, result largely from the same factors that drive variances in revenues. Operating earnings and margins in the defense groups are driven by changes in volume, performance or contract mix. Performance refers to changes in profitability based on revisions to estimates at completion on individual contracts. These revisions may result from increases or decreases to the estimated value of the contract, the estimated costs to complete or both. Therefore, changes in costs incurred in the period do not necessarily impact profitability. It is only when total estimated costs at completion change that profitability may be impacted. Contract mix refers to changes in the volume of higher- vs. lower-margin work. Higher or lower margins can be inherent in the contract type (e.g., fixed-price/cost-reimbursable) or type of work (e.g., development/production). 28 CONSOLIDATED OVERVIEW Year Ended December 31 2010 2011 2012 Revenues Operating Earnings Revenues Operating Earnings Revenues Operating Earnings Aerospace $ 5,299 $ 860 $ 5,998 $ 729 $ 6,912 $ 858 Combat Systems 8,878 1,275 8,827 1,283 7,992 663 Marine Systems 6,677 674 6,631 691 6,592 750 Information Systems and Technology 11,612 1,219 11,221 1,200 10,017 (1,369 ) Corporate (83 ) (77 ) (69 ) $ 32,466 $ 3,945 $ 32,677 $ 3,826 $ 31,513 $ 833 REVIEW OF 2011 VS. 2012 Year Ended December 31 2011 2012 Variance Revenues $ 32,677 $ 31,513 $ (1,164 ) (3.6 )% Operating costs and expenses 28,851 30,680 1,829 6.3 % Operating earnings 3,826 833 (2,993 ) (78.2 )% Operating margins 11.7 % 2.6 % Our revenues decreased in 2012 compared with 2011. Revenues decreased in the Information Systems and Technology mobile communication systems business and on several international wheeled vehicle contracts in the Combat Systems group. These decreases were partially offset by higher revenues in the Aerospace group due to increased deliveries of G650 aircraft. Operating costs increased in 2012 due to several discrete charges discussed below in conjunction with our business groups operating results, most significantly the $2 billion goodwill impairment recorded in the Information Systems and Technology group. As a result, operating earnings and margins decreased in 2012. Product Revenues and Operating Costs Year Ended December 31 2011 2012 Variance Revenues $ 21,440 $ 19,784 $ (1,656 ) (7.7 )% Operating costs 17,230 16,228 (1,002 ) (5.8 )% Product revenues were lower in 2012 compared with 2011 . The decrease in product revenues consisted of the following: Aircraft manufacturing and outfitting $ 791 Mobile communication products (1,177 ) European vehicle production (636 ) Ship construction (404 ) Other, net (230 ) Total decrease $ (1,656 ) In 2012 , aircraft manufacturing and outfitting revenues increased due to green deliveries of G650 aircraft, which began in the fourth quarter of 2011 . More than offsetting this increase, mobile communication 29 products revenues decreased due to protracted customer acquisition cycles and a slower than expected transition to follow-on work on several programs. Lower European vehicle production revenues were largely due to several contracts nearing completion and the revenue impact of the termination of the contract to provide Pandur vehicles to the Portuguese government. Ship construction revenues decreased due to the completion of the T-AKE combat-logistics ship program and timing of activity on the Virginia-class submarine program as the group transitions from the Block II to the Block III contract. Product operating costs were lower in 2012 compared with 2011. The change in product operating costs primarily due to volume consisted of the following: Primary changes due to volume: Aircraft manufacturing and outfitting $ 585 Mobile communication products (850 ) European vehicle production (377 ) Ship construction (422 ) (1,064 ) Discrete charges 179 Other changes, net (117 ) Total decrease $ (1,002 ) Discrete charges discussed in conjunction with the Combat Systems and Information Systems and Technology business groups operating results include $89 related to the termination of the contract to provide Pandur vehicles to the Portuguese government, $58 of ruggedized hardware inventory write-downs for products that ceased production in 2012 and $32 for cost growth associated with the demonstration phase of the Specialist Vehicle (SV) program for the U.K. Ministry of Defence. No other changes were material. Service Revenues and Operating Costs Year Ended December 31 2011 2012 Variance Revenues $ 11,237 $ 11,729 $ 492 4.4 % Operating costs 9,591 10,182 591 6.2 % Service revenues increased in 2012 compared with 2011. The increase in service revenues consisted of the following: Ship engineering and repair $ 358 Mobile communication support 91 Other, net 43 Total increase $ 492 In 2012 , the increase in ship engineering and repair revenues was driven by the recent acquisition of two East Coast surface-ship repair operations and higher volume on the U.S. Navy Ohio-class replacement engineering program. Mobile communication support revenues increased in 2012 primarily due to higher maintenance and long-term support activity on the U.K.-based Bowman communications systems program. 30 Service operating costs increased in 2012 compared with 2011. The increase in service operating costs primarily due to volume consisted of the following: Primary changes due to volume: Ship engineering and repair $ 298 Mobile communication support 76 374 Intangible asset impairment 191 Other changes, net 26 Total increase $ 591 The intangible asset impairment is in Jet Aviation maintenance business and discussed in conjunction with the Aerospace business group operating results. No other changes were material. REVIEW OF 2010 VS. 2011 Year Ended December 31 2010 2011 Variance Revenues $ 32,466 $ 32,677 $ 211 0.6 % Operating costs and expenses 28,521 28,851 330 1.2 % Operating earnings 3,945 3,826 (119 ) (3.0 )% Operating margin 12.2 % 11.7 % Our revenues and operating costs were up slightly in 2011 compared with 2010. Revenues increased in the Aerospace group, primarily driven by initial green deliveries of the new G650 aircraft. This increase was partially offset by lower revenues in the Information Systems and Technology group mobile communication systems business. Operating costs also increased due to the impairment of an intangible asset in our Aerospace group. As a result, operating earnings and margins declined in 2011. Product Revenues and Operating Costs Year Ended December 31 2010 2011 Variance Revenues $ 21,723 $ 21,440 $ (283 ) (1.3 )% Operating costs 17,359 17,230 (129 ) (0.7 )% Product revenues were lower in 2011 compared with 2010 due to lower revenues on mobile communication products and on several ship construction programs, most significantly on the DDG-1000 and DDG-51 destroyers and commercial product-carrier programs. These decreases were partially offset by higher aircraft manufacturing, outfitting and completions revenues due to initial green deliveries of the G650 aircraft. Product operating costs were lower in 2011 compared with 2010 primarily due to volume. However, the decrease in volume was partially offset by an impairment of an intangible asset in the completions business in our Aerospace group. Service Revenues and Operating Costs Year Ended December 31 2010 2011 Variance Revenues $ 10,743 $ 11,237 $ 494 4.6 % Operating costs 9,198 9,591 393 4.3 % 31 Service revenues increased in 2011 compared with 2010 as growth on IT support and modernization programs for the DoD and the intelligence community, coupled with the acquisition of Vangent, Inc., resulted in higher IT services revenues. Additionally, the growing global installed base of business-jet aircraft and increased flying hours across the installed base resulted in higher aircraft services revenues. Service operating costs increased in 2011 compared with 2010 primarily due to volume. OTHER INFORMATION Goodwill Impairment In 2012, we recorded a $2 billion goodwill impairment in the Information Systems and Technology group discussed below in conjunction with the business group operating results and in the Application of Critical Accounting Policies. G&A Expenses As a percentage of revenues, G&A expenses were 6 percent in 2010 , 6.2 percent in 2011 and 7.2 percent in 2012 . The increase in 2012 is due, in part, to restructuring-related charges in our European military vehicles business discussed below in conjunction with the Combat Systems business group operating results. We expect G&A expenses in 2013 to be approximately 6.5 percent of revenues. Interest, Net Net interest expense was $157 in 2010 , $141 in 2011 and $156 in 2012 . The 2012 increase in interest expense is due to the $750 net increase in long-term debt beginning in July 2011 . We expect full-year 2013 net interest expense to be approximately $90 . The significant expected decrease from 2012 results from our debt refinancing completed in December 2012 that lowered the weighted-average interest rate on our outstanding debt from 3.9 percent to 2.2 percent. See Note J to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our debt obligations. Other, Net In 2012, other expense included a $123 loss on the redemption of debt associated with the refinancing discussed above. In 2011 , other income consisted primarily of a $38 gain from the sale of a business in our Combat Systems group. Effective Tax Rate Our effective tax rate was 30.7 percent in 2010 , 31.4 percent in 2011 and 161.4 percent in 2012 . The significant increase in 2012 was primarily due to the largely non-deductible goodwill impairment of $2 billion recorded in the Information Systems and Technology group and, to a lesser extent, the establishment of valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets in our international operations. For further discussion and a reconciliation of our effective tax rate from the statutory federal rate, see Note E to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We anticipate an effective tax rate of approximately 32 percent in 2013 . Discontinued Operations In 2011 , we recognized a $13 loss, net of taxes, in discontinued operations from the settlement of an environmental matter associated with a former operation of the company. We also increased our estimate of the continued legal costs associated with the A-12 litigation as a result of the U.S. Supreme Court decision that extended the timeline associated with the litigation, resulting in a $13 loss, net of taxes. See Note N to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the A-12 litigation. 32 REVIEW OF BUSINESS GROUPS Following is a discussion of the operating results and outlook for each of our business groups. For the Aerospace group, results are analyzed with respect to specific lines of products and services, consistent with how the group is managed. For the defense groups, the discussion is based on the types of products and services each group offers with a supplemental discussion of specific contracts and programs when significant to the group results. Information regarding our business groups also can be found in Note Q to the Consolidated Financial Statements. AEROSPACE Review of 2011 vs. 2012 Year Ended December 31 2011 2012 Variance Revenues $ 5,998 $ 6,912 $ 914 15.2 % Operating earnings 729 858 129 17.7 % Operating margin 12.2 % 12.4 % Gulfstream aircraft deliveries (in units): Green 107 121 14 13.1 % Outfitted 99 94 (5 ) (5.1 )% The Aerospace group revenues increased in 2012 compared to 2011 . The increase consisted of the following: Aircraft manufacturing, outfitting and completions $ 917 Aircraft services (30 ) Pre-owned aircraft 27 Total increase $ 914 Aircraft manufacturing, outfitting and completions revenues include the manufacture and outfitting of Gulfstream business-jet aircraft as well as completions of aircraft produced by other OEMs. Aircraft manufacturing, outfitting and completions revenues increased in 2012 primarily due to increased deliveries of the G650 aircraft. The group operating earnings increased in 2012 . The increase consisted of the following: Aircraft manufacturing, outfitting and completions $ 333 Aircraft services (198 ) Pre-owned aircraft (1 ) G&A/other expenses (5 ) Total increase $ 129 Earnings from the manufacture and outfitting of Gulfstream aircraft increased $136, or over 10 percent, in 2012 compared with 2011 primarily due to green deliveries of the G650 aircraft. Earnings from other OEM completions were up $197 in 2012 as operational performance improved. Operating earnings in 2011 were negatively impacted by $78 of losses on several completions projects and a $111 impairment of the completions business contract and program intangible asset as a result of these losses and lower revenues. 33 Aircraft services earnings decreased in 2012 primarily due to a $191 impairment charge on intangible assets in Jet Aviation maintenance business, which has been negatively impacted by an increasingly competitive marketplace, particularly in Europe. Most significantly, certain OEMs are performing maintenance work that historically was performed by third-party service providers, including Jet Aviation. As a result of these market trends, we reviewed the long-lived assets of Jet Aviation maintenance business in the fourth quarter of 2012 and eliminated the remaining value of the contract and program and related technology intangible assets. We are aligning our Jet Aviation maintenance business with anticipated future demand, and as a result sold three European-based maintenance facilities in December 2012. We believe that we have right-sized Jet Aviation maintenance business to remain profitable, albeit smaller, in the future. Review of 2010 vs. 2011 Year Ended December 31 2010 2011 Variance Revenues $ 5,299 $ 5,998 $ 699 13.2 % Operating earnings 860 729 (131 ) (15.2 )% Operating margin 16.2 % 12.2 % Gulfstream aircraft deliveries (in units): Green 99 107 8 8.1 % Outfitted 89 99 10 11.2 % The Aerospace group revenues increased in 2011 primarily due to additional Gulfstream large-cabin green and outfitted deliveries, including initial green deliveries of the new G650 aircraft. Higher aircraft services revenues in 2011, reflecting the growing global installed base and increased flying hours of business-jet aircraft, were offset by lower completions revenues as a result of manufacturing delays and lower volume. The group operating earnings decreased in 2011 compared with 2010 due to the contract losses and intangible asset impairment in our completions business discussed above and from higher R&D and selling expenses. 2013 Outlook We expect an increase of approximately 16 percent in the group revenues in 2013 compared with 2012 , led by Gulfstream, and operating margins in the mid- 15 percent range. COMBAT SYSTEMS Review of 2011 vs. 2012 Year Ended December 31 2011 2012 Variance Revenues $ 8,827 $ 7,992 $ (835 ) (9.5 )% Operating earnings 1,283 663 (620 ) (48.3 )% Operating margins 14.5 % 8.3 % The Combat Systems group revenues decreased in 2012 compared with 2011 . The decrease consisted of the following: 34 U.S. military vehicles $ 12 Weapon systems and munitions (212 ) European military vehicles (635 ) Total decrease $ (835 ) In 2012, revenues were up slightly in the group U.S. military vehicles business. Revenues increased due to the December 2011 acquisition of Force Protection, Inc., higher volume on several international light armored vehicle (LAV) programs and the start of the Technology Development phase of the Army Ground Combat Vehicle (GCV) program. These increases were largely offset by lower volume on the domestic Stryker, Abrams and Mine-Resistant, Ambush-Protected (MRAP) vehicle programs. Lower volume across several U.S. armament and munitions programs, including vehicle armor, MK47 grenade launchers and Hydra rockets, due to slowed defense spending, combined with the sale of the detection systems business in the second quarter of 2011 , resulted in the decrease in revenues in the weapons systems and munitions business. In the group European military vehicle business, revenues were down in 2012 due to lower volume on multiple wheeled vehicle contracts for various international customers that are nearing completion. In 2012, final deliveries occurred under several of these contracts, including Piranha vehicles for the Belgian Army, Duro vehicles for the Swiss government and Eagle vehicles for the German government. The Combat Systems group operating earnings and margins decreased in 2012 . In addition to lower volume, operating results in 2012 include the negative impact of three discrete charges in our European military vehicles business: $292 for contract disputes accruals, primarily related to the termination of the contract to provide Pandur vehicles for Portugal ($169 of this amount was recorded as a reduction of revenues); $98 of restructuring-related charges, primarily severance, for activities associated with eliminating excess capacity and aligning our European military vehicles business for anticipated lower demand; and $67 of out-of-period adjustments recorded in the first quarter of 2012 ($48 of this amount was recorded as a reduction of revenues). For further discussion of the status of the Portugal program and the restructuring costs, see Note N to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The impact on the group operating margins from the charges was approximately 530 basis points. Review of 2010 vs. 2011 Year Ended December 31 2010 2011 Variance Revenues $ 8,878 $ 8,827 $ (51 ) (0.6 )% Operating earnings 1,275 1,283 8 0.6 % Operating margins 14.4 % 14.5 % The Combat Systems group revenues were down slightly in 2011 compared with 2010 due to reduced volume in the group U.S. military vehicles business. Volume was down due to less refurbishment and upgrade work for the Abrams tank, fewer survivability kits for the Stryker vehicle and a decline in activity on the Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle program as the system design and development neared completion. Increased volume to provide LAVs for several international customers partially offset these decreases. 35 Partially offsetting the decrease in the group U.S. military vehicles business, revenues were higher in the group European military vehicles business due to increased volume on Duro and Eagle wheeled vehicles for a variety of European customers. The group operating earnings and margins were up slightly in 2011 due to higher profitability on several major programs in our U.S. military vehicle business. 2013 Outlook We expect the Combat Systems group revenues in 2013 to be down approximately 6 percent from 2012 with operating margins in the mid-13 percent range. The expected decline in revenues is due to anticipated lower services revenues in our U.S. military vehicles business and lower overall revenues in our weapons systems business. Our 2013 outlook assumes the U.S. government operates under a CR in FY 2013 and there are no significant reductions to the proposed defense budget. MARINE SYSTEMS Review of 2011 vs. 2012 Year Ended December 31 2011 2012 Variance Revenues $ 6,631 $ 6,592 $ (39 ) (0.6 )% Operating earnings 691 750 59 8.5 % Operating margins 10.4 % 11.4 % Operating Results The Marine Systems group revenues decreased in 2012 compared with 2011 . The decrease consisted of the following: Ship construction $ (336 ) Ship engineering, repair and other services 297 Total decrease $ (39 ) The group U.S. Navy ship-construction programs include Virginia-class submarines, DDG-1000 and DDG-51 destroyers, and T-AKE combat-logistics and Mobile Landing Platform (MLP) auxiliary support ships. Decreased revenues in 2012 of $580 on the Virginia-class and the remainder of the ships in the T-AKE programs were partially offset by an increase of $244 on the MLP and DDG destroyer programs. Revenues were lower on the Virginia-class program in 2012 due to timing as the group transitions from the Block II to the Block III contract. In 2012, the group delivered the final ship under the T-AKE program, resulting in a decrease in revenues. Revenues increased in 2012 on the MLP and DDG-51 programs as two ships are now under construction on both programs. Revenues were higher on engineering and repair programs for the Navy in 2012 . The increase in revenues was driven by recent acquisitions of two East Coast surface-ship repair operations and higher volume on the Ohio-class replacement engineering program. Despite the decline in revenues, the Marine Systems group operating earnings increased in 2012 , resulting in a 100 basis-point increase in operating margin compared with 2011 . Increases in the T-AKE profit rate contributed $53 of operating earnings, approximately 70 basis points of margin expansion, as the program continued to experience favorable cost performance through construction of the final ship. 36 Review of 2010 vs. 2011 Year Ended December 31 2010 2011 Variance Revenues $ 6,677 $ 6,631 $ (46 ) (0.7 )% Operating earnings 674 691 17 2.5 % Operating margin 10.1 % 10.4 % Revenues in the Marine Systems group decreased slightly in 2011 due to lower volume on the DDG programs, the completion of a five-ship commercial product-carrier construction program in 2010 and the wind down of the T-AKE program. These decreases were partially offset by higher volume on the MLP ship construction program, the Ohio-class replacement program and surface-ship repair work. The group operating earnings and margins increased in 2011 due to favorable cost performance on the mature T-AKE program. 2013 Outlook We expect the Marine Systems group 2013 revenues to increase approximately 2 percent from 2012 . With the completion of the T-AKE program, operating margins are expected to decline to the low- to mid- 9 percent range in 2013 . Our 2013 outlook assumes the U.S. government operates under a CR in FY 2013 and there are no significant reductions to the proposed defense budget. INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY Review of 2011 vs. 2012 Year Ended December 31 2011 2012 Variance Revenues $ 11,221 $ 10,017 $ (1,204 ) (10.7 )% Operating earnings (loss) 1,200 (1,369 ) (2,569 ) (214.1 )% Operating margins 10.7 % (13.7 )% Operating Results The Information Systems and Technology group revenues decreased in 2012 compared with 2011 . The decrease consisted of the following: Mobile communication systems $ (1,086 ) Information technology (IT) solutions and mission support services (56 ) Intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) systems (62 ) Total decrease $ (1,204 ) The decrease in revenues in the mobile communication systems business was driven by slowed defense spending, protracted U.S. customer acquisition cycles and a slower than expected transition to follow-on work on several contracts. This resulted in lower revenues in 2012 on key programs, including the Warfighter Information Network Tactical (WIN-T) and Common Hardware Systems (CHS), and for encryption and ruggedized hardware products. In addition, over 10 percent of the decline in the group revenues was due to lower volume on the U.K.-based Bowman communications system program, which has been successfully fielded and has now moved into maintenance and long-term support. In the group IT solutions and services business, decreased volume in 2012 due to the completion of several large-scale IT infrastructure and support programs for the intelligence community and the DoD, 37 including the New Campus East, Mark Center and Walter Reed National Military Medical Center programs, was largely offset by revenues from the 2011 acquisition of Vangent, Inc. Revenues were down in 2012 compared with 2011 in the group ISR business primarily due to lower optical products revenues as demand was impacted negatively by pressured defense budgets and the broader economic environment. Actions taken in 2012 to align the business with anticipated future demand are expected to stabilize performance in 2013. Operating earnings and margins decreased significantly in 2012 compared with 2011 . This decrease was driven by the negative impact of four discrete charges: $2 billion goodwill impairment resulting from a decline in the estimated fair value of the group caused by topline pressure from slowed defense spending and the threat of sequestration, and margin compression due to mix shift impacting the projected cash flows of the group; $110 of intangible asset impairments on several assets in our optical products business, most significantly the contract and program intangible asset, as a result of competitive losses and delays in the fourth quarter of 2012 indicative of lower overall demand caused by the economic downturn; $58 write-down of substantially all of the remaining ruggedized hardware inventory, including $25 in the third quarter, based on anticipated remaining demand for products that ceased production in 2012; and $26 for cost growth associated with the demonstration phase of the SV program (an additional $6 was recorded by the Combat Systems group European military vehicles business). For further discussion of the impairment charges, see Note B to the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Application of Critical Accounting Policies later in this section. Review of 2010 vs. 2011 Year Ended December 31 2010 2011 Variance Revenues $ 11,612 $ 11,221 $ (391 ) (3.4 )% Operating earnings 1,219 1,200 (19 ) (1.6 )% Operating margins 10.5 % 10.7 % The Information Systems and Technology group revenues were down in 2011 compared with 2010. Revenues in the mobile communication systems business were impacted unfavorably by CRs and protracted U.S. customer acquisition cycles that slowed orders, resulting in lower revenues on ruggedized hardware products, including CHS, and other products with shorter-term delivery timeframes. Additionally, revenues on the Canadian Maritime Helicopter Project (MHP) were down in 2011 as the group transitioned from production to the training and support phase of the program. Lower revenues in the group ISR business resulted from the sale of a satellite facility in 2010 and lower optical products volume. Offsetting these decreases were increased revenues in the IT solutions and services business due to the 2011 acquisition of Vangent, Inc., and higher volume on the group large-scale IT infrastructure and support programs. Operating earnings decreased at a lower rate than revenues, resulting in a 20-basis-point increase in operating margins. Higher margins in our mobile communication systems business were in part due to $95 of overhead reduction initiatives, but were largely offset by growth in our lower-margin IT solutions and services business. 38 2013 Outlook We expect 2013 revenues in the Information Systems and Technology group to be down approximately 5 percent from 2012 with operating margins in the low-8 percent range. Our 2013 outlook assumes the U.S. government operates under a CR in FY 2013 and there are no significant reductions to the proposed defense budget. Due to its shorter-cycle businesses, the Information Systems and Technology outlook is more sensitive than our other defense groups to any additional budget reductions that may occur. CORPORATE Corporate results consist primarily of compensation expense for stock options. Corporate operating costs totaled $83 in 2010 , $77 in 2011 and $69 in 2012 . We expect 2013 full-year Corporate operating costs of approximately $90 , an increase from 2012 due to less income from the advanced funding of our primary pension plan. BACKLOG AND ESTIMATED POTENTIAL CONTRACT VALUE Our total backlog, including funded and unfunded portions, was $51.3 billion at the end of 2012 compared with $57.4 billion at year-end 2011 . Our backlog does not include work awarded on unfunded indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contracts or unexercised options associated with existing firm contracts, which we refer to collectively as estimated potential contract value. IDIQ contracts provide customers with flexibility when they have not defined the exact timing and quantity of deliveries or services that will be required at the time the contract is executed. Contract options represent agreements to perform additional work under existing contracts at the election of the customer. The actual amount of funding received in the future may be higher or lower than our estimate of potential contract value. On December 31, 2012 , estimated potential contract value associated with IDIQ contracts and contract options was approximately $26.9 billion , down 4 percent from $28 billion at the end of 2011 . We expect to realize this value over the next several years. AEROSPACE Aerospace funded backlog represents aircraft orders for which we have definitive purchase contracts and deposits from customers. Unfunded backlog consists of agreements to provide future aircraft maintenance and support services. The Aerospace group finished 2012 with a total backlog of $15.7 billion , down from $17.9 billion at year-end 2011 . Order activity included demand for products across our portfolio, although orders were lower than in 2011 as we have experienced an elongated order cycle. Weaker order activity in the first half of 2012 improved somewhat in the second half of the year, including several North American Fortune 500 multi-aircraft orders. Customer defaults were down significantly from 2011 to the lowest level in five years. 39 We balance aircraft production rates with customer demand to maximize profitability and stabilize production over time. This has enabled us to maintain an appropriate window between customer order and delivery for our G450 and G550 large-cabin aircraft, but we have accumulated approximately five years of backlog for the G650. Backlog will likely decrease over the next several years as we deliver on our G650 backlog and the time period between customer order and delivery of that aircraft normalizes. The group customer base is diverse across customer types and geographic regions. Approximately 60 percent of the group year-end backlog was composed of private companies and individual buyers. While the installed base of aircraft is predominately in North America, international customers represent nearly 60 percent of the group backlog. Over 55 percent of the group orders in 2012 were from North American customers, as Fortune 500 companies took steps in 2012 to re-capitalize their fleets. DEFENSE GROUPS The total backlog for our defense groups represents the estimated remaining value of work to be performed under firm contracts. The funded portion of this backlog includes amounts that have been authorized and appropriated by the Congress and funded by the customer, as well as commitments by international customers that are similarly approved and funded by their governments. While there is no guarantee that future budgets and appropriations will provide funding for a given program, we have included in total backlog only firm contracts at the amounts we believe are likely to receive funding. Total backlog in our defense groups was $35.6 billion on December 31, 2012 , down 10 percent from $39.5 billion at the end of 2011 . The decrease occurred in our Combat Systems and Marine Systems groups as work continued on large, multi-year contracts awarded in prior periods. COMBAT SYSTEMS Combat Systems total backlog was $8.7 billion at the end of 2012, down from $11.4 billion at year-end 2011. The group backlog primarily consists of long-term production contracts. The group backlog on December 31, 2012, included $1.6 billion for M1 Abrams main battle tank modernization and upgrade programs for the Army and U.S. allies around the world. In 2012, the group received awards totaling $1 billion for all Abrams-related programs, including a $395 multi-year contract to conduct development efforts for additional upgrade opportunities designed to increase the efficiency and capability of the tank. The group was also awarded $170 to continue work on a multi-year contract awarded in 2008 to upgrade M1A1 tanks to the M1A2 System Enhancement Package (SEP) configuration. Abrams backlog also included $225 for production of M1A1 tank kits for the Egyptian Land Forces under an Egyptian tank co-production program, $315 for Merkava Armored Personnel Carrier hulls and material 40 kits for the Israeli Ministry of Defense and $160 for the production of an M1A2 variant for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The Army Stryker wheeled combat vehicle program represented $1.2 billion of the group backlog at year end with vehicles scheduled for delivery through 2014. The group received over $1.1 billion of Stryker orders in 2012, including awards for production of 62 new vehicles, the conversion of previously delivered vehicles to the double-V-hull configuration, contractor logistics support and engineering services. The group backlog at year end also included $195 for the Technology Development phase of the Army GCV program, $140 for the Buffalo mine clearance vehicle and $80 under the MRAP program, largely for upgrade kits for previously-delivered vehicles. The Combat Systems group has several significant international military vehicle production contracts in backlog. The backlog at the end of the year included: $870 for the upgrade and modernization of LAV III combat vehicles for the Canadian Army, including a $135 contract modification awarded in 2012 to upgrade an additional 66 vehicles bringing the total to approximately 600 vehicles; $800 for LAVs under several foreign military sales (FMS) contracts; $115 for 151 Foxhound armored vehicles for the U.K. Ministry of Defence; $150 for Pizarro Advanced Infantry Fighting Vehicles scheduled for delivery to the Spanish Army through 2016; and $110 for the design, integration and production of seven prototypes under the U.K. SV program, in addition to the integration work being performed by the Information Systems and Technology group. The Combat Systems group backlog at year end also included $2.4 billion in weapons systems and munitions programs. In 2012, the group received awards totaling $390 for axles in the military and commercial markets and $265 for the production of Hydra-70 rockets. The group also received awards worth $180 from the Canadian government to supply various calibers of ammunition. Combat Systems estimated potential contract value of $2.8 billion decreased approximately 20 percent since year-end 2011 due to the funding of IDIQ contracts and options that were then transferred to backlog, such as for the Hydra-70 rocket program. MARINE SYSTEMS The Marine Systems group total backlog consists of long-term submarine and ship construction programs, as well as numerous engineering and repair contracts. The group periodically receives large contract awards that provide backlog for several years. As the group performs on the contracts, backlog decreases. Consistent 41 with this historical pattern, the backlog has decreased to $17.1 billion at year-end 2012, compared to $18.5 billion at the end of 2011. The Virginia-class submarine program was the company largest program in 2012 and is the largest contract in the group and company backlog. The group backlog at year end included $9 billion for nine Virginia-class submarines scheduled for delivery through 2018. As the prime contractor on the Virginia-class program, we report the entire backlog and revenues associated with the program but share the construction activity and the earnings with our teaming partner. We have submitted a proposal for the next block of submarines under the program expected to be awarded near the end of 2013. In 2012, we received $385 of awards for long-lead materials for the first three boats under the next block of submarines. Navy destroyer programs represented $2.4 billion of the group backlog at year-end 2012. Under the Navy restart of the DDG-51 program, we have construction contracts for two destroyers scheduled for deliveries in 2016 and 2017 . We have submitted a bid for a multi-ship construction contract that is expected to be awarded in the first half of 2013. Backlog at year end also includes three ships under the DDG-1000 program scheduled for deliveries in 2015, 2016 and 2018 . The Marine Systems group backlog at year end included $605 for the MLP program. In 2012, the group was awarded a construction contract for the third ship in the program. Delivery of one ship per year is scheduled beginning in 2013, and the Navy long-term shipbuilding plan includes procurement of a fourth ship in 2014. The year-end backlog also included $335 for two liquefied natural gas (LNG)-powered containerships. Construction of these ships is scheduled to begin in 2014 with deliveries in 2015 and 2016. In addition, the Marine Systems group backlog at year end included approximately $4.7 billion for engineering, repair, overhaul and other services. This includes $1.9 billion for design and development efforts on the Ohio-class replacement engineering program, including $1.8 billion awarded in the fourth quarter of 2012. Year-end backlog for maintenance and repair services totaled $1.4 billion. INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY The Information Systems and Technology group total backlog was $9.8 billion at the end of 2012, up from $9.6 billion at year-end 2011. The group backlog does not include approximately $21 billion of estimated potential contract value associated with its anticipated share of IDIQ contracts and unexercised options. In 2012, funding under IDIQ contracts and options contributed over $5.1 billion to the group backlog, over half of the group orders, resulting in a slight decrease in the estimated potential contract value from year-end 2011. When combined, the group backlog and estimated potential contract value totaled $30.8 billion. Unlike our other defense businesses, the Information Systems and Technology group backlog consists of thousands of contracts and must be reconstituted each year with new program and task order awards. Nonetheless, there are several significant contracts that provide a solid foundation for the business. 42 The group backlog at year-end 2012 included approximately $645 for the Army WIN-T program. The backlog does not include over $300 of estimated potential contract value for the WIN-T program awarded as an IDIQ contract. The Information Systems and Technology group backlog at year end also included $370 for the Handheld, Manpack and Small Form-Fit (HMS) program. In 2012, the group received $315 in orders from the Army for production of nearly 17,000 Rifleman and Manpack radios and accessory kits. The group backlog at the end of 2012 included approximately $520 for a number of support and modernization programs for the intelligence community and the DoD and Department of Homeland Security, including the St. Elizabeths campus, New Campus East and NETCENTS infrastructure programs. Programs for the U.K. Ministry of Defence comprised $495 of the group backlog at the end of 2012. Work continued in 2012 on the demonstration phase of the SV program. In this phase, the group manages the design, integration and production of seven prototype vehicles. Work and the backlog under the contract are shared with the Combat Systems group. The group also has successfully fielded the Bowman communications system and is now performing maintenance and long-term support and enhancement activities for the program. In addition to these programs, the group received a number of significant contract awards in 2012, including the following: $155 from Austal USA for combat and seaframe control systems for two Littoral Combat Ships, bringing the value in backlog to $295. Options to provide these systems for six additional ships will be recognized as orders as they are exercised. $150 from the U.S. Department of State to provide supply chain management services. The program has a maximum potential value of $1.2 billion over five years. $125 for production and support of U.S. and U.K. Trident II submarine weapons systems. $95 from the Army for ruggedized computing equipment under the Common Hardware Systems-4 (CHS-4) program, bringing the value in backlog to $155. The backlog does not include $3.5 billion of estimated potential contract value awarded under an IDIQ contract. $80 for support of the Trident missile D5 life-extension program, which extends the life of existing missiles by replacing and upgrading obsolete components. $65 for the Warfighter Field Operations Customer Support (FOCUS) program to provide support for the Army live, virtual and constructive training operations, bringing the value in backlog to $145. Information Systems and Technology was awarded several significant IDIQ contracts during 2012, including the following: An award from the Federal Aviation Administration to deliver radios that allow air traffic control personnel to communicate with aircraft. The program has a maximum potential value of $365 over 10 years. An award from the U.S. Department of Energy to provide cybersecurity and cloud-computing support services. The program has a maximum potential value of $140 over four years. An award from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services to combine the Coordination of Benefits and the Medicare Secondary Payer systems. The program has a maximum potential value of $100 over five years. 43 FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES We place a strong emphasis on cash flow generation. This focus has afforded us the financial flexibility to deploy our cash resources while preserving a strong balance sheet to position us for future opportunities. The $8.9 billion of cash generated by operating activities over the past three years was deployed to fund acquisitions and capital expenditures, repurchase our common stock, pay dividends and repay maturing debt. Our net debt was $613 at year-end 2012 , down by $420 from the end of 2011 . Our cash balances are invested primarily in time deposits from highly rated banks and commercial paper rated A1/P1 or higher. On December 31, 2012 , $1 billion of our cash was held by international operations and therefore, not immediately available to fund domestic operations unless repatriated. While we do not intend to do so, should this cash be repatriated, it would be subject to U.S. federal income tax but would generate partially offsetting foreign tax credits. Year Ended December 31 2010 2011 2012 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 2,986 $ 3,238 $ 2,687 Net cash used by investing activities (408 ) (1,974 ) (656 ) Net cash used by financing activities (2,226 ) (1,201 ) (1,382 ) Net cash used by discontinued operations (2 ) (27 ) (2 ) Net increase in cash and equivalents 350 36 647 Cash and equivalents at beginning of year 2,263 2,613 2,649 Cash and equivalents at end of year 2,613 2,649 3,296 Marketable securities 212 248 Short- and long-term debt (3,203 ) (3,930 ) (3,909 ) Net debt (a) $ (378 ) $ (1,033 ) $ (613 ) Debt-to-equity (b) 24.1 % 29.7 % 34.3 % Debt-to-capital (c) 19.4 % 22.9 % 25.6 % (a) Net debt is calculated as total debt less cash and equivalents and marketable securities. (b) Debt-to-equity ratio is calculated as total debt divided by total equity. (c) Debt-to-capital ratio is calculated as total debt divided by the sum of total debt plus total equity. We expect to continue to generate funds in excess of our short- and long-term liquidity needs. We believe we have adequate funds on hand and sufficient borrowing capacity to execute our financial and operating strategy. The following is a discussion of our major operating, investing and financing activities for each of the past three years, as classified on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. OPERATING ACTIVITIES We generated cash from operating activities of $3 billion in 2010 , $3.2 billion in 2011 and $2.7 billion in 2012 . In all three years, the primary driver of cash flows was net earnings (loss) after removing the impact of non-cash charges. Operating cash flow is also impacted by contributions to our pension plans, which have grown from $300 in 2010 to $530 in 2012 , with contributions of $600 expected in 2013 . Termination of A-12 Program. As discussed further in Note N to the Consolidated Financial Statements, litigation on the A-12 program termination has been ongoing since 1991 . If, contrary to our expectations, the default termination ultimately is sustained and the government prevails on its recovery theories, we, along with The Boeing Company, could collectively be required to repay the U.S. government as much as $1.4 billion for progress payments received for the A-12 contract, plus interest, which was approximately $1.6 billion on December 31, 2012 . If this were the outcome, we would owe half of the total, or approximately $1.5 billion pretax. Our after-tax cash obligation would be approximately $740 . We believe we have sufficient resources, including access to capital markets, to pay such an obligation if required. 44 INVESTING ACTIVITIES We used $408 in 2010 , $2 billion in 2011 and $656 in 2012 for investing activities. The primary uses of cash for investing activities were acquisitions and capital expenditures. Business Acquisitions. We completed 16 acquisitions over the last three years totaling $2.3 billion. We used cash on hand to fund these acquisitions. See Note B to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of acquisition activity. Capital Expenditures. Capital expenditures were $370 in 2010 , $458 in 2011 and $450 in 2012 . The increase in 2011 and 2012 compared with 2010 is largely due to Gulfstream Savannah, Georgia, facilities expansion project announced in 2010. We expect capital expenditures of approximately $640 in 2013 , or 2 percent of anticipated revenues, as work on Gulfstream facilities project continues. On December 31, 2012, the project was approximately 35 percent complete. Marketable Securities. To bolster liquidity in an uncertain business environment, we received cash of $219 from the net sales and maturity of marketable securities in 2012, including $211 from the sale of held-to-maturity securities. We held no marketable securities on December 31, 2012. Other, Net. Investing activities also included proceeds from the sale of a satellite facility in our Information Systems and Technology group in 2010 and the detection systems business in our Combat Systems group in 2011. FINANCING ACTIVITIES We used $2.2 billion in 2010 , $1.2 billion in 2011 and $1.4 billion in 2012 for financing activities including issuances and repayments of debt, payment of dividends and repurchases of common stock. Debt Proceeds, Net. In August 2010 , we repaid $700 of maturing fixed-rate notes. In 2011 , we issued $1.5 billion of fixed-rate notes and used the proceeds to repay $750 of maturing fixed-rate notes. In 2012, we issued $2.4 billion of fixed-rate notes and used the proceeds to redeem, prior to maturity, an equal amount of fixed-rate notes with higher interest rates. We have no material repayments of long-term debt expected until 2015. See Note J to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our debt obligations, including scheduled debt maturities. We ended 2012 with no commercial paper outstanding. We have $2 billion in bank credit facilities that remain available. These facilities provide backup liquidity to our commercial paper program. We also have an effective shelf registration on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Dividends. On March 7, 2012 , our board of directors declared an increased quarterly dividend of $0.51 per share the 15 th consecutive annual increase. The board had previously increased the quarterly dividend to $0.47 per share in March 2011 and $0.42 per share in March 2010 . In advance of possible tax increases in 2013, we accelerated our first quarter 2013 dividend payment to December 2012. Share Repurchases. Our board of directors typically authorizes repurchases in 10 million-share increments. We repurchased 18.9 million shares on the open market in 2010 , 20 million shares in 2011 and 9.1 million shares in 2012 . As a result, we reduced our shares outstanding by over 8 percent since 2009. On December 31, 2012, approximately 10.9 million shares remained authorized by our board of directors for repurchase, approximately 3 percent of our total shares outstanding. 45 NON-GAAP MANAGEMENT METRICS We emphasize the efficient conversion of net earnings into cash and the deployment of that cash to maximize shareholder returns. As described below, we use free cash flow and return on invested capital (ROIC) to measure our performance in these areas. While we believe that these metrics provide useful information, they are not operating measures under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and there are limitations associated with their use. Our calculation of these metrics may not be completely comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential differences in the method of calculation. As a result, the use of these metrics should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, other GAAP measures. Free Cash Flow. We define free cash flow from operations as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. We believe free cash flow from operations is a useful measure for investors, because it portrays our ability to generate cash from our operations for purposes such as repaying maturing debt, funding business acquisitions, repurchasing our common stock and paying dividends. We use free cash flow from operations to assess the quality of our earnings and as a performance measure in evaluating management. The following table reconciles the free cash flow from operations with net cash provided by operating activities, as classified on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows: Year Ended December 31 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 3,124 $ 2,855 $ 2,986 $ 3,238 $ 2,687 Capital expenditures (490 ) (385 ) (370 ) (458 ) (450 ) Free cash flow from operations $ 2,634 $ 2,470 $ 2,616 $ 2,780 $ 2,237 Cash flow as a percentage of earnings (loss) from continuing operations: Net cash provided by operating activities 126 % 119 % 114 % 127 % NM* Free cash flow from operations 106 % 103 % 100 % 109 % NM* * Not meaningful (NM) due to net loss in 2012. Return on Invested Capital. We believe ROIC is a useful measure for investors because it reflects our ability to generate returns from the capital we have deployed in our operations. We use ROIC to evaluate investment decisions and as a performance measure in evaluating management. We define ROIC as net operating profit after taxes divided by the sum of the average debt and shareholders equity for the year. Net operating profit after taxes is defined as earnings (loss) from continuing operations plus after-tax interest and amortization expense. ROIC is calculated as follows: Year Ended December 31 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Earnings (loss) from continuing operations $ 2,478 $ 2,407 $ 2,628 $ 2,552 $ (332 ) After-tax interest expense 91 117 116 106 109 After-tax amortization expense 100 149 155 163 152 Net operating profit (loss) after taxes $ 2,669 $ 2,673 $ 2,899 $ 2,821 $ (71 ) Average debt and equity $ 14,390 $ 15,003 $ 16,587 $ 17,123 $ 17,203 Return on invested capital 18.5 % 17.8 % 17.5 % 16.5 % (0.4 )% 46 ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS On December 31, 2012 , other than operating leases, we had no material off-balance sheet arrangements. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS The following tables present information about our contractual obligations and commercial commitments on December 31, 2012 : Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations Total Amount Committed Less Than 1 Year 1-3 Years 4-5 Years More Than 5 Years Long-term debt (a) $ 4,923 $ 89 $ 673 $ 1,546 $ 2,615 Capital lease obligations 34 3 4 4 23 Operating leases 1,099 239 341 188 331 Purchase obligations (b) 19,841 11,440 5,385 1,659 1,357 Other long-term liabilities (c) 18,331 3,259 2,035 1,790 11,247 $ 44,228 $ 15,030 $ 8,438 $ 5,187 $ 15,573 (a) Includes scheduled interest payments. See Note J to the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of long-term debt. (b) Includes amounts committed under legally enforceable agreements for goods and services with defined terms as to quantity, price and timing of delivery. This amount includes $13.5 billion of purchase orders for products and services to be delivered under firm government contracts under which we have full recourse under normal contract termination clauses. (c) Represents other long-term liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, including the current portion of these liabilities. The projected timing of cash flows associated with these obligations is based on management estimates, which are based largely on historical experience. This amount also includes all liabilities under our defined-benefit retirement plans. See Note P for information regarding these liabilities and the plan assets available to satisfy them. Amount of Commitment Expiration by Period Commercial Commitments Total Amount Committed Less Than 1 Year 1-3 Years 4-5 Years More Than 5 Years Letters of credit and guarantees* $ 1,895 $ 1,193 $ 409 $ 6 $ 287 * See Note N to the Consolidated Financial Statements. APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based on our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including most pervasively those related to various assumptions and projections for our long-term contracts and programs. Other significant estimates include those related to goodwill and other intangible assets, income taxes, pensions and other post-retirement benefits, workers compensation, warranty obligations, and litigation and other contingencies. We employ judgment in making our estimates but they are based on historical experience and currently available information and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources. Actual results could differ from these estimates. We believe that our judgment is applied consistently and produces financial information that fairly depicts the results of operations for all periods presented. 47 We believe the following policies are critical and require the use of significant judgment in their application: Revenue Recognition. We account for revenues and earnings using the percentage-of-completion method. Under this method, contract revenue and profit are recognized as work progresses, either as products are produced or as services are rendered. We determine progress using either input measures (e.g., costs incurred) or output measures (e.g., contract milestones or units delivered), as appropriate to the circumstances. An input measure is used in most cases unless an output measure is identified that is reliably determinable and representative of progress toward completion. We estimate the profit on a contract as the difference between the total estimated revenue and the total estimated costs of a contract and recognize that profit over the life of the contract. If at any time the estimate of contract profitability reveals an anticipated loss on the contract, we recognize the loss in the quarter it is identified. We generally measure progress toward completion on contracts in our defense businesses based on the proportion of costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion (input measure). For our contracts for the manufacture of business-jet aircraft, we record revenue at two contractual milestones: when green aircraft are delivered to, and accepted by, the customer and when the customer accepts final delivery of the fully outfitted aircraft (output measure). We do not recognize revenue at green delivery unless (1) a contract has been executed with the customer and (2) the customer can be expected to satisfy its obligations under the contract, as evidenced by the receipt of significant deposits from the customer and other factors. Accounting for long-term contracts and programs involves the use of various techniques to estimate total contract revenues and costs. Contract estimates are based on various assumptions that utilize the professional knowledge and experience of our engineers, program and operations managers and finance and accounting personnel to project the outcome of future events that often span several years. These assumptions include labor productivity and availability; the complexity of the work to be performed; the cost and availability of materials; the performance of subcontractors; and the availability and timing of funding from the customer. We include in our contract estimates additional revenues for submitted contract modifications or claims against the customer when the amount can be estimated reliably and its realization is probable. In evaluating these criteria, we consider the contractual/legal basis for the claim, the cause of any additional costs incurred, the reasonableness of those costs and the objective evidence available to support the claim. We include award or incentive fees in the estimated contract value when there is a basis to reasonably estimate the amount of the fee. Estimates of award or incentive fees are based on historical award experience and anticipated performance. These estimates are based on our best judgment at the time. As a significant change in one or more of these estimates could affect the profitability of our contracts, we review our performance monthly and update our contract estimates at least annually and often quarterly, as well as when required by specific events or circumstances. We recognize changes in the estimated profit on contracts under the reallocation method. Under this method, the impact of revisions in estimates is recognized prospectively over the remaining contract term. We use this method because we believe the majority of factors that typically result in changes in estimates on our long-term contracts affect the period in which the change is identified and future periods. These changes generally reflect our current expectations as to future performance and, therefore, the reallocation method is the method that best matches our profits to the periods in which they are earned. Most government contractors recognize the impact of a change in estimated profit immediately under the cumulative catch-up method. The impact on operating earnings in the period the change is identified is generally lower under the reallocation method as compared to the cumulative catch-up method. The net increase in our operating earnings (and on a per-share basis) from the quarterly impact of revisions in contract estimates totaled $350 48 ( $0.60 ) in 2010, $356 ( $0.63 ) in 2011 and $180 ( $0.33 ) in 2012 . Other than revisions discussed in the Marine Systems and Information Systems and Technology business groups results of operations, no revisions on any one contract were material in 2012. Goodwill and Intangible Assets. Since 1995, we have acquired more than 65 businesses at a total cost of approximately $23 billion , including seven in 2012 . We have recognized goodwill and intangible assets as a result of these acquisitions. Goodwill represents the purchase price paid in excess of the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized but is subject to an impairment test on an annual basis and when circumstances indicate that an impairment is more likely than not. Such circumstances include a significant adverse change in the business climate for one of our reporting units or a decision to dispose of a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit. The test for goodwill impairment is a two-step process that requires a significant level of estimation and use of judgment by management, particularly the estimate of the fair value of our reporting units. We estimate the fair value of our reporting units primarily based on the discounted projected cash flows of the underlying operations. This requires numerous assumptions, including the timing of work embedded in our backlog, our performance and profitability under our contracts, our success in securing future business, the appropriate risk-adjusted interest rate used to discount the projected cash flows, and terminal value growth and earnings rates applied to the final year of projected cash flows. Due to the variables inherent in our estimate of fair value, differences in assumptions may have a material effect on the result of our impairment analysis. To assess the reasonableness of our discounted projected cash flows, we compare the sum of our reporting units fair value to our market capitalization and calculate an implied control premium (the excess of the sum of the reporting units fair values over the market capitalization). We evaluate the reasonableness of this control premium by comparing it to control premiums for recent comparable market transactions. We also review market multiples of earnings from comparable publicly-traded companies with similar operating characteristics to ensure the reasonableness of our discounted projected cash flows. We conducted and completed the required goodwill impairment test as of December 31, 2012. Step one of the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of our reporting units to their carrying values. As it relates to the test, our reporting units are consistent with our business groups. Slowed defense spending, the threat of sequestration and margin compression due to mix shift have impacted operating results and tempered the projected cash flows of the Information Systems and Technology reporting unit, negatively impacting our estimate of its fair value. Step one of the impairment test concluded that the book value of our Information Systems and Technology reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value. For our remaining three reporting units, the estimated fair values were at least double their respective book values. For the Information Systems and Technology reporting unit, we performed the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of the impairment loss, if any. The second step of the test requires the allocation of the reporting unit fair value to its assets and liabilities, including any unrecognized intangible assets, in a hypothetical analysis that calculates the implied fair value of goodwill as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination. If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value, the difference is recorded as an impairment loss. Based on the results of the step two analysis, we recorded a $2 billion goodwill impairment in 2012. We review intangible assets subject to amortization for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Impairment losses, where identified, are determined as the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value of the long-lived asset. We assess the recoverability of the carrying value of assets held for use based on a review of projected undiscounted cash flows. Prior to conducting step one of our 2012 goodwill impairment test, 49 we reviewed certain of our long-lived assets for recoverability and recorded intangible asset impairment losses of $191 and $110 in our Aerospace and Information Systems and Technology groups, respectively, as discussed in the business groups results of operations. Commitments and Contingencies. We are subject to litigation and other legal proceedings arising either from the ordinary course of our business or under provisions relating to the protection of the environment. Estimating liabilities and costs associated with these matters requires the use of judgment. We record a charge against earnings when a liability associated with claims or pending or threatened litigation is probable and when our exposure is reasonably estimable. The ultimate resolution of our exposure related to these matters may change as further facts and circumstances become known. Deferred Contract Costs. Certain costs incurred in the performance of our government contracts are recorded under GAAP but are not allocable currently to contracts. Such costs include a portion of our estimated workers compensation obligations, other insurance-related assessments, pension and other post-retirement benefits, and environmental expenses. These costs will become allocable to contracts generally after they are paid. We have elected to defer (or inventory) these costs in contracts in process until they can be allocated to contracts. We expect to recover these costs through ongoing business, including existing backlog and probable follow-on contracts. We regularly assess the probability of recovery of these costs under our current and probable follow-on contracts. This assessment requires that we make assumptions about future contract costs, the extent of cost recovery under our contracts and the amount of future contract activity. These estimates are based on our best judgment. If the backlog in the future does not support the continued deferral of these costs, the profitability of our remaining contracts could be adversely affected. Retirement Plans. Our defined-benefit pension and other post-retirement benefit costs and obligations depend on a series of assumptions and estimates. The key assumptions relate to the interest rates used to discount estimated future liabilities and projected long-term rates of return on plan assets. We determine the discount rate used each year based on the rate of return currently available on a portfolio of high-quality fixed-income investments with a maturity that is consistent with the projected benefit payout period. We determine the long-term rate of return on assets based on consideration of historical and forward-looking returns and the current and expected asset allocation strategy. These estimates are based on our best judgment, including consideration of current and future market conditions. In the event a change in any of the assumptions is warranted, pension and post-retirement benefit cost could increase or decrease. For the impact of hypothetical changes in the discount rate and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets for our pension and post-retirement benefit plans, see Note P to the Consolidated Financial Statements. As discussed under Deferred Contract Costs, our contractual arrangements with the U.S. government provide for the recovery of benefit costs for our government retirement plans. We have elected to defer recognition of the benefit costs that cannot currently be allocated to contracts to provide a better matching of revenues and expenses. Accordingly, the impact on the retirement benefit cost for these plans that results from annual changes in assumptions does not impact our earnings either positively or negatively. 50
