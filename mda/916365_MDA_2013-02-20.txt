Item 7 . Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis is intended to provide the reader with information that will assist in understanding the significant factors affecting our consolidated operating results, financial condition, liquidity and capital resources during the three-year period ended December 29, 2012 (our fiscal years 2012, 2011 and 2010). Fiscal year 2011 contains 53 weeks of operating results compared to fiscal years 2012 and 2010 which contain 52 weeks. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements. See "Forward-Looking Statements" and "Risk Factors" included elsewhere in this report. Overview Tractor Supply Company is the largest operator of retail farm and ranch stores in the United States and is focused on supplying the lifestyle needs of recreational farmers and ranchers and those who enjoy the rural lifestyle, as well as tradesmen and small businesses. As of December 29, 2012, we operated 1,176 retail stores in 45 states under the names Tractor Supply Company and Del Feed & Farm Supply. We also operate a website under the name TractorSupply.com . Our stores are located in towns outlying major metropolitan markets and in rural communities, and they offer the following comprehensive selection of merchandise: Equine, livestock, pet and small animal products, including items necessary for their health, care, growth and containment; Hardware, truck, towing and tool products; Seasonal products, including lawn and garden items, power equipment, gifts and toys; Maintenance products for agricultural and rural use; and Work/recreational clothing and footwear. Our current and long-term growth strategy is to: (1) expand geographic market presence through opening new retail stores, (2) enhance financial performance through same-store sales growth achieved through targeted merchandising programs with an everyday value price philosophy and supported by strong customer service, (3) enhance product margin through strategic product sourcing and regional allocation, a strong exclusive brand offering, and optimization of product pricing, transportation and distribution costs, (4) leverage operating costs, especially advertising, distribution and corporate overhead by focusing on opportunities for continuous improvement and elimination of waste in all of our processes, (5) expand market opportunities via internet sales accomplished by improving our website product content and enhancing our customers online experience and (6) expand through selective acquisition, as such opportunities arise, to enhance penetration into new and existing markets to complement organic growth. Over the past five years we have experienced considerable growth in stores, growing from 764 stores at the end of 2007 to 1,176 stores at the end of fiscal 2012, and in sales, with a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 11.5% . Given the size of the communities that we target, we believe that there is ample opportunity for new store growth in existing and new markets. We have developed a proven method for selecting store sites and have identified over 900 additional markets for new Tractor Supply stores. Executive Summary We opened 93 new stores in 2012 and 85 new stores in 2011 , a selling square footage increase of approximately 8.1% and 7.8% , respectively. During 2012, we opened our first stores in Colorado, and in 2013, we expect to continue our expansion into new markets, including Arizona. We achieved strong performance in fiscal 2012, delivering diluted earnings per share of $3.80 versus $3.01 in fiscal 2011 . As stated in the prior year, we estimate that the 53rd week in fiscal 2011 represented a benefit of approximately $0.09 per diluted share. Net sales increased to $4.66 billion in 2012, or 10.2% over the prior-year's 53-week period (11.6% adjusted for the extra sales week in fiscal 2011 as part of the Company's 53-week calendar). Same-store sales increased 5.3%, driven primarily by continued strong results in key consumable, usable and edible (C.U.E.) products, principally animal and pet-related merchandise. As a percent of sales, gross margin improved to 33.6% from 33.2% in the prior year. Our gross margin rate continues to benefit from key margin-driving initiatives, including strategic sourcing, inventory and markdown management and price optimization. We ended the year with $147 million in cash and restricted cash, after returning nearly $323 million to our stockholders through stock repurchases and dividends. 19 Index Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates Management discussion and analysis of our financial position and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make informed estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Our financial position and/or results of operations may be materially different when reported under different conditions or when using different assumptions in the application of such policies. In the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual amounts, adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information. Our significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. The following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies, which are those that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require significant judgment or use of complex estimates. Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions Inventory Valuation: Inventory Impairment We identify potentially excess and slow-moving inventory by evaluating turn rates, historical and expected future sales trends, age of merchandise, overall inventory levels, current cost of inventory and other benchmarks. The estimated inventory valuation reserve to recognize any impairment in value (i.e., an inability to realize the full carrying value) is based on our aggregate assessment of these valuation indicators under prevailing market conditions and current merchandising strategies. We do not believe our merchandise inventories are subject to significant risk of obsolescence in the near term. However, changes in market conditions or consumer purchasing patterns could result in the need for additional reserves. Our impairment reserve contains uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding forecasted customer demand and the promotional environment. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to recognize inventory impairment reserves in the financial periods presented. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate impairment. However, if assumptions regarding consumer demand or clearance potential for certain products are inaccurate, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. A 10% change in our impairment reserve at December 29, 2012, would have affected net income by approximately $0.5 million in fiscal 2012. 20 Index Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions Shrinkage We perform physical inventories at each store at least once a year, and we have established reserves for estimating inventory shrinkage between physical inventory counts. The reserve is established by assessing the chain-wide average shrinkage experience rate, applied to the related periods' sales volumes. Such assessments are updated on a regular basis for the most recent individual store experiences. The estimated store inventory shrink rate is based on historical experience. We believe historical rates are a reasonably accurate reflection of future trends. Our shrinkage reserve contains uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding future shrinkage trends, the effect of loss prevention measures and new merchandising strategies. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to recognize shrinkage in the financial periods presented. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our shrinkage reserve. However, if our estimates regarding inventory losses are inaccurate, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. A 10% change in our shrinkage reserve at December 29, 2012, would have affected net income by approximately $0.9 million in fiscal 2012. Vendor Funding We receive funding from substantially all of our significant merchandise vendors, in support of our business initiatives, through a variety of programs and arrangements, including guaranteed vendor support funds ("vendor support") and volume-based rebate funds ("volume rebates"). The amounts received are subject to terms of vendor agreements, most of which are "evergreen", reflecting the on-going relationship with our significant merchandise vendors. Certain of our agreements, primarily volume rebates, are renegotiated annually, based on expected annual purchases of the vendor product. Vendor funding is initially deferred as a reduction of the purchase price of inventory and then recognized as a reduction of cost of merchandise as the related inventory is sold. During interim periods, the amount of vendor support is known and is debited to vendors systematically; however, volume rebates are estimated during interim periods based upon initial commitments and anticipated purchase levels with applicable vendors. The estimated purchase volume (and related vendor funding through volume rebates) is based on our current knowledge of inventory levels, sales trends and expected customer demand, as well as planned new store openings and relocations. Although we believe we can reasonably estimate purchase volume and related volume rebates at interim periods, it is possible that actual year-end results could differ from previously estimated amounts. Our allocation methodology contains uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding customer demand, purchasing activity, target thresholds, vendor attrition and collectibility. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our vendor support reserves in the financial periods presented. At the end of each fiscal year, a significant portion of the actual purchase activity is known. Thus, we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the amounts recorded as vendor support. We do not believe there is a significant collectibility risk related to vendor support amounts due us at the end of fiscal 2012. If a 10% reserve had been applied against our outstanding vendor support due as of December 29, 2012, net income would have been affected by approximately $0.8 million. Although it is unlikely that there will be any significant reduction in historical levels of vendor support, if such a reduction were to occur in future periods, the Company could experience a higher inventory balance and higher cost of sales. Freight We incur various types of transportation and delivery costs in connection with inventory purchases and distribution. Such costs are included as a component of the overall cost of inventories (on an aggregate basis) and recognized as a component of cost of merchandise sold as the related inventory is sold. We allocate freight as a component of total cost of sales without regard to inventory mix or unique freight burden of certain categories. This assumption has been consistently applied for all years presented. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our capitalized freight balance or freight allocation in the financial periods presented. If a 10% increase or decrease had been applied against our current inventory capitalized freight balance as of December 29, 2012, net income would have been affected by approximately $4.6 million in fiscal 2012. 21 Index Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions Self-Insurance Reserves: We self-insure a significant portion of our employee medical insurance, workers' compensation and general liability insurance plans. We have stop-loss insurance policies to protect from individual losses over specified dollar values. When estimating our self-insured liabilities, we consider a number of factors, including historical claims experience, demographic factors and severity factors. The full extent of certain claims, especially workers' compensation and general liability claims, may not become fully determined for several years. Our self-insured liabilities contain uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the ultimate cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not reported as of the balance sheet date. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our self-insurance reserves in the financial periods presented. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the assumptions we use to calculate insurance reserves. However, if we experience a significant increase in the number of claims or the cost associated with these claims, we may be exposed to losses that could be material. A 10% change in our self-insurance reserves at December 29, 2012, would have affected net income by approximately $2.4 million in fiscal 2012. Sales Tax Audit Reserve: A portion of our sales are to tax-exempt customers, predominantly agricultural-based. We obtain exemption information as a necessary part of each tax-exempt transaction. Many of the states in which we conduct business will perform audits to verify our compliance with applicable sales tax laws. The business activities of our customers and the intended use of the unique products sold by us create a challenging and complex compliance environment. These circumstances also create some risk that we could be challenged as to the accuracy of our sales tax compliance. While we believe we appropriately enforce sales tax compliance with our customers and endeavor to fully comply with all applicable sales tax regulations, there can be no assurance that we, upon final completion of such audits, would not have a significant liability for disallowed exemptions. We review our past audit experience and assessments with applicable states to continually determine if we have potential exposure for non-compliance. Any estimated liability is based on an initial assessment of compliance risk and our historical experience with each state. We continually reassess the exposure based on historical audit results, changes in policies, preliminary and final assessments made by state sales tax auditors, and additional documentation that may be provided to reduce the assessment. Our sales tax audit reserve contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding the complexity of agricultural-based exemptions, the ambiguity in state tax regulations, the number of ongoing audits, and the length of time required to settle with the state taxing authorities. We have not made any material changes to our sales tax audit assessment methodology in the financial periods presented. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate the sales tax liability reserve. However, if our estimates regarding the ultimate sales tax liability are inaccurate, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. A 10% change in our sales tax audit reserve at December 29, 2012, would have affected net income by approximately $0.6 million in fiscal 2012. 22 Index Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions Tax Contingencies: Our income tax returns are periodically audited by U.S. federal and state tax authorities. These audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. At any time, multiple tax years are subject to audit by the various tax authorities. In evaluating the exposures associated with our various tax filing positions, we record a liability for uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter, for which we have established a reserve, is audited and fully resolved or clarified. We recognize the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained. Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized. Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs. We adjust our tax contingencies reserve and income tax provision in the period in which actual results of a settlement with tax authorities differs from our established reserve, the statute of limitations expires for the relevant tax authority to examine the tax position or when more information becomes available. Our tax contingencies reserve contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions and whether or not the minimum requirements for recognition of tax benefits have been met. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our tax contingencies in the financial periods presented. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the reserves established for tax benefits not recognized. Although management believes that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable, actual results could differ, and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. To the extent we prevail in matters for which reserves have been established, or are required to pay amounts in excess of our reserves, our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected. An unfavorable tax settlement would require use of our cash and would result in an increase in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution. A favorable tax settlement would be recognized as a reduction in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution. A 10% change in our uncertain tax position reserve at December 29, 2012 would have affected net income by approximately $0.5 million in fiscal 2012. 23 Index Description Judgments and Uncertainties Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions Impairment of Long-Lived Assets: Long-lived assets other than goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, which are separately tested for impairment, are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. When evaluating long-lived assets for potential impairment, we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset estimated future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges). The evaluation for long-lived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is generally the individual store level. The significant assumptions used to determine estimated undiscounted cash flows include cash inflows and outflows directly resulting from the use of those assets in operations, including margin on net sales, payroll and related items, occupancy costs, insurance allocations and other costs to operate a store. If the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, we calculate an impairment loss. The impairment loss calculation compares the carrying value of the asset to the asset estimated fair value, which may be based on an estimated future cash flow model. We recognize an impairment loss if the amount of the asset carrying value exceeds the asset estimated fair value. If we recognize an impairment loss, the adjusted carrying amount of the asset becomes its new cost basis. For a depreciable long-lived asset, the new cost basis will be depreciated (amortized) over the remaining estimated useful life of that asset. Our impairment loss calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values, including forecasting useful lives of the assets and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows. We have not made any material changes in our impairment loss assessment methodology in the financial periods presented. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate long-lived asset impairment losses. None of these estimates and assumptions are significantly sensitive, and a 10% change in any of these estimates would not have a material impact on our analysis. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values, we may be exposed to losses that could be material. 24 Index Quarterly Financial Data Our unaudited quarterly operating results for each fiscal quarter of 2012 and 2011 are shown below (in thousands, except per share amounts): First Quarter Second Quarter Third Quarter Fourth Quarter Total 2012 (13 weeks) (13 weeks) (13 weeks) (13 weeks) (52 weeks) Net sales $ 1,020,417 $ 1,291,899 $ 1,065,638 $ 1,286,166 $ 4,664,120 Gross margin 332,800 451,461 357,171 424,622 1,566,054 Operating income 64,393 169,844 77,779 124,776 436,792 Net income 40,328 106,621 50,021 79,487 276,457 Net income per share: (a) Basic $ 0.56 $ 1.48 $ 0.71 $ 1.13 $ 3.89 Diluted $ 0.55 $ 1.45 $ 0.69 $ 1.11 $ 3.80 Same-store sales increase 11.5 % 3.2 % 2.9 % 4.7 % 5.3 % First Quarter Second Quarter Third Quarter Fourth Quarter Total 2011 (13 weeks) (13 weeks) (13 weeks) (14 weeks) (53 weeks) Net sales $ 836,576 $ 1,178,363 $ 977,776 $ 1,240,028 $ 4,232,743 Gross margin 273,606 402,497 327,603 403,166 1,406,872 Operating income 28,766 144,263 68,129 111,545 352,703 Net income 18,335 91,160 42,733 70,512 222,740 Net income per share: (a) Basic $ 0.25 $ 1.27 $ 0.60 $ 0.99 $ 3.10 Diluted $ 0.24 $ 1.23 $ 0.58 $ 0.96 $ 3.01 Same-store sales increase (b) 10.7 % 4.6 % 11.5 % 7.6 % 8.2 % (a) Due to the nature of interim earnings per share calculations, the sum of quarterly earnings per share amounts may not equal the reported earnings per share for the year. (b) Due to the 53-week fiscal 2011, each quarter of fiscal 2012 started one week later than the same quarter of fiscal 2011. The chart below presents same-store sales for 2011 as originally reported and as adjusted to represent the same 13-week period as the 2012 fiscal quarters. The adjusted 13-week periods ended on April 2, 2011, July 2, 2011, October 1, 2011 and December 31, 2011, respectively. Fiscal 2011 First Quarter Second Quarter Third Quarter Fourth Quarter Full Year Same-store sales increase (originally reported) 10.7% 4.6% 11.5% 7.6% 8.2% Same-store sales increase (adjusted for week shift) 7.6% 7.1% 11.9% 7.1% 8.3% Impact of week shift (3.1)% 2.5% 0.4% (0.5)% 0.1% 25 Index Results of Operations Our fiscal year includes 52 or 53 weeks and ends on the last Saturday of the calendar year. References to fiscal year mean the year in which that fiscal year ended. The fiscal year ended December 29, 2012 consisted of 52 weeks; the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011 consisted of 53 weeks; and the fiscal year ended December 25, 2010 contained 52 weeks. The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain items in our Consolidated Statements of Income expressed as a percentage of net sales. 2012 2011 2010 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of merchandise sold (a) 66.4 66.8 66.9 Gross margin (a) 33.6 33.2 33.1 Selling, general and administrative expenses (a) 22.3 23.0 23.9 Depreciation and amortization 1.9 1.9 1.9 Income before income taxes 9.4 8.3 7.3 Income tax provision 3.4 3.0 2.7 Net income 6.0 % 5.3 % 4.6 % _________________ (a) Our gross margin amounts may not be comparable to those of other retailers since some retailers include all of the costs related to their distribution network in cost of merchandise sold and others like us exclude a portion of these distribution network costs from gross margin and instead include them in selling, general and administrative ( SG&A ) expenses; refer to Note 1 Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Fiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011 Net sales increased 10.2% to $4.66 billion in fiscal 2012 from $4.23 billion in fiscal 2011 . Fiscal 2012 included one less sales week compared to fiscal 2011 as a part of the Company's 53-week calendar in the prior year. Adjusting for the impact of the extra sales week in fiscal 2011, our fiscal 2012 net sales increase was 11.6%. Same-store sales for fiscal 2012 were $4.39 billion , a 5.3% increase over fiscal 2011 . This compares to a 8.2% same-store sales increase in the prior year. The same-store transaction count increased 3.0% , while same-store average ticket increased 2.0% for fiscal 2012 . The same-store sales increase was driven by continued strong results in core consumable, usable and edible (C.U.E.) products, principally animal and pet-related merchandise. We estimate that same-store sales were favorably impacted by approximately 250 basis points due to inflation, principally in key C.U.E. categories. In addition to same-store sales growth in fiscal 2012 , sales from new stores and stores opened less than one year were $276.2 million in fiscal 2012 , which represented 6.5 percentage points of the 10.2% increase over fiscal 2011 net sales. The following chart summarizes our store growth during fiscal 2012 and 2011 : 2012 2011 Store Count, Beginning of Period 1,085 1,001 New Stores Opened 93 85 Stores Closed (2 ) (1 ) Store Count, End of Period 1,176 1,085 Stores Relocated 1 3 26 Index The following chart indicates the percentage of sales represented by each of our major product categories during fiscal 2012 and 2011 : Percent of Sales Product Category: 2012 2011 Livestock and Pet 42 % 40 % Hardware, Tools,Truck and Towing 23 23 Seasonal, Gift and Toy Products 20 21 Clothing and Footwear 9 10 Agriculture 6 6 Total 100 % 100 % Gross margin increased 11.3% to $1.57 billion compared to $1.41 billion in 2011 . As a percent of sales, gross margin increased 40 basis points to 33.6% for fiscal 2012 compared to 33.2% for fiscal 2011 . These changes reflect improved direct product margin, partially offset by increased transportation costs. Direct product margin increased as we continue to make progress on our four strategic margin initiatives which include inventory and markdown management, strategic sourcing, exclusive branding and price optimization. Transportation costs increased primarily as a result of higher fuel costs, coupled with the continued mix shift to more freight-intensive C.U.E. products. We expect transportation costs to continue to rise as a result of higher planned import volume as a percent of total purchases, as well as increased costs related to the continued mix shift to more freight-intensive C.U.E. products. However, we expect that we will be able to mitigate these factors through effective sourcing of product and retail price management. As a percent of sales, SG&A expenses, including depreciation and amortization, improved 70 basis points to 24.2% in fiscal 2012 from 24.9% in fiscal 2011 . This improvement was primarily attributable to the leverage of continued strong same-store sales, expense control related to store operating costs and lower year-over-year incentive compensation expense. Total SG&A expenses for fiscal 2012 increased 7.1% to $1.13 billion from $1.05 billion in fiscal 2011 . The increase in SG&A primarily reflects new store growth as well as operating costs relating to our new Franklin, Kentucky distribution center, which became operational in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, offset in part by the favorable impact of one less week in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 , as part of the Company's 53-week calendar in the prior year. Our effective tax rate increased to 36.6% for fiscal 2012 compared to 36.5% in fiscal 2011 . The change in the effective tax rate was principally due to a reduction in the benefit provided by certain federal tax credits during fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011. As a result of the foregoing factors, net income for fiscal 2012 increased 24.1% to $276.5 million , or $3.80 per diluted share, as compared to net income of $222.7 million , or $3.01 per diluted share, in fiscal 2011 . During fiscal 2012 , we repurchased approximately 3.1 million shares of the Company's common stock at a total cost of $271.8 million as part of our previously announced $1 billion share repurchase program. In fiscal 2011 , we repurchased approximately 3.1 million shares at a total cost of $180.0 million . Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010 Net sales increased 16.3% to $4.23 billion in fiscal 2011 from $3.64 billion in fiscal 2010. Fiscal 2011 included an additional week compared to fiscal 2010, representing approximately 170 basis points of the net sales increase. Same-store sales for fiscal 2011 were $3.99 billion, an 8.2% increase over fiscal 2010. This compares to a 7.0% same-store sales increase in the prior year. The same-store transaction count increased 5.0%, while same-store average ticket increased 3.1% for fiscal 2011. The same-store sales increase was driven by strong results in C.U.E. products, principally animal and pet-related merchandise. Emergency response related merchandise also performed well during the year as a result of Hurricane Irene and tornadoes across the southeast. We estimate that same-store sales were favorably impacted by approximately 340 basis points due to inflation, principally in key C.U.E. categories. Additionally, fiscal 2011 had one additional comp sales day in the year, which had a favorable impact on same-store sales of approximately 30 basis points. In addition to same-store sales growth in fiscal 2011, sales from new stores and stores opened less than one year were $237.5 million in fiscal 2011, which represented 6.4 percentage points of the 16.3% increase over fiscal 2010 net sales. 27 Index The following chart summarizes our store growth during fiscal 2011 and 2010 : 2011 2010 Store Count, Beginning of Period 1,001 930 New Stores Opened 85 74 Stores Closed (1 ) (3 ) Store Count, End of Period 1,085 1,001 Stores Relocated 3 The following chart indicates the percentage of sales represented by each of our major product categories during fiscal 2011 and 2010: Percent of Sales Product Category: 2011 2010 Livestock and Pet 40 % 39 % Hardware, Tools, Truck and Towing 23 23 Seasonal, Gift and Toy Products 21 22 Clothing and Footwear 10 10 Agriculture 6 6 Total 100 % 100 % Gross margin increased 16.9% to $1.41 billion compared to $1.20 billion in 2010. As a percent of sales, gross margin increased 10 basis points to 33.2% for fiscal 2011 compared to 33.1% for fiscal 2010. The increase in gross margin reflects improved direct product margin, partially offset by increased transportation costs. Direct product margin increased as we continued to make progress on our four strategic margin initiatives which include inventory management, strategic sourcing, exclusive branding and price optimization. As a percent of sales, SG&A expenses, including depreciation and amortization, improved 90 basis points to 24.9% in fiscal 2011 from 25.8% in fiscal 2010. This change was primarily attributable to the leverage of strong same-store sales and expense control with respect to store operating costs. Total SG&A expenses for fiscal 2011 increased 12.5% to $1.05 billion from $937.4 million in fiscal 2010. The increase in SG&A expense primarily reflects new store growth, variable costs associated with our same-store sales performance, increased advertising for print media and special promotional events and expansion of our distribution center capacity and ongoing implementation of the new warehouse management system. The Company new Franklin, Kentucky distribution center opened in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. Our effective tax rate decreased to 36.5% for fiscal 2011 compared to 36.6% in fiscal 2010. This reduction in the effective tax rate resulted from the favorable impact of certain federal tax credits as well as the utilization of various state income tax credits during fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010. As a result of the foregoing factors, net income for fiscal 2011 increased 32.6% to $222.7 million, or $3.01 per diluted share, as compared to net income of $168.0 million, or $2.25 per diluted share, in fiscal 2010. During fiscal 2011, we repurchased approximately 3.1 million shares of stock at a total cost of $180.0 million as part of our previously announced $1 billion share repurchase program. In fiscal 2010, we repurchased approximately 0.8 million shares at a total cost of $38.2 million. Liquidity and Capital Resources In addition to normal operating expenses, our primary ongoing cash requirements are for new store expansion, remodeling and relocation programs (including inventory purchases and capital expenditures), distribution center and store support center capacity and improvements, information technology, share repurchases and cash dividends. Our primary ongoing sources of liquidity are existing cash balances, funds provided from operations, borrowings available under our Senior Credit Facility, capital and operating leases and normal trade credit. Our inventory and accounts payable levels typically build in the first and third fiscal quarters in anticipation of the spring and cold-weather selling seasons, respectively. 28 Index Working Capital At December 29, 2012 , we had working capital of $569.5 million , which decreased $60.1 million from December 31, 2011 . This change was attributable to the following components of current assets and current liabilities (in millions): 2012 2011 Variance Current assets: Cash and cash equivalents $ 138.6 $ 176.9 $ (38.3 ) Restricted cash 8.4 21.9 (13.5 ) Inventories 908.1 830.8 77.3 Prepaid expenses and other current assets 51.8 51.7 0.1 Deferred income taxes 23.1 8.9 14.2 Total current assets 1,130.0 1,090.2 39.8 Current liabilities: Accounts payable 320.4 266.4 54.0 Accrued employee compensation 48.4 48.3 0.1 Other accrued expenses 148.3 134.0 14.3 Income taxes payable 43.4 11.9 31.5 Total current liabilities 560.5 460.6 99.9 Working capital $ 569.5 $ 629.6 $ (60.1 ) Working capital at December 29, 2012 was impacted most significantly by changes in our cash, inventory, accounts payable and income taxes payable. The decrease in cash is primarily attributable to share repurchases and capital expenditures, offset in part by increased earnings. In fiscal 2012 , we repurchased approximately 3.1 million shares under the share repurchase program at a total cost of $271.8 million compared to approximately 3.1 million shares at a cost of $180.0 million in fiscal 2011. Capital expenditures of $152.9 million in fiscal 2012 reflect funding to support new store growth, distribution center capacity, technology upgrades to enhance our customer experience in our retail stores and on-line, as well as the purchase of an undeveloped parcel of land in Brentwood, Tennessee for our new store support center. We aggressively manage our inventory balances and in-stock levels at our stores. The increase in inventory was primarily due to new store growth. Average inventory per store increased 0.6% compared to the prior year. The increase in inventory levels on a per-store basis is primarily due to inflation. Accounts payable increased primarily as a result of new store growth and the related higher inventory requirements, offset in part by the timing of vendor payments compared to the prior year. Income taxes payable increased due to higher income in the period as well as timing of estimated tax payments, as a result of changes in allowable deductions for depreciation expense. Borrowings and Credit Facilities The Senior Credit Facility provides for borrowings of up to $250 million (with sub-limits of $250 million and $20 million for letters of credit and swing-line loans, respectively). This agreement is unsecured and matures in October 2016 , with proceeds available to be used for working capital, capital expenditures, dividends, share repurchases and other matters. At December 29, 2012 and December 31, 2011 , there were no outstanding borrowings under the Senior Credit Facility. There were $51.4 million and $15.0 million outstanding letters of credit as of December 29, 2012 and December 31, 2011 , respectively. Borrowings bear interest at either the bank base rate ( 3.25% at December 29, 2012 ) or the London Inter-Bank Offer Rate ( LIBOR ) ( 0.21% at December 29, 2012 ) plus an additional amount ranging from 0.40% to 1.00% per annum, adjusted quarterly based on our leverage ratio ( 0.50% at December 29, 2012 ). We are also required to pay, quarterly in arrears, a commitment fee for unused capacity ranging from 0.08% to 0.20% per annum and adjusted quarterly based on our leverage ratio, ( 0.10% at December 29, 2012 ). There are no compensating balance requirements associated with the Senior Credit Facility. The Senior Credit Facility requires quarterly compliance with respect to two material covenants: a fixed charge coverage ratio and a leverage ratio. The fixed charge coverage ratio compares earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, stock compensation and rent expense ( consolidated EBITDAR ) to the sum of interest paid and rental expense (excluding any straight-line rent adjustments). The leverage ratio compares total debt plus rental expense (excluding any straight-line rent adjustments) multiplied by a factor of six to consolidated EBITDAR. The Senior Credit Facility also contains certain other restrictions regarding 29 Index additional indebtedness, capital expenditures, business operations, guarantees, investments, mergers, consolidations and sales of assets, transactions with subsidiaries or affiliates, and liens. We were in compliance with all covenants at December 29, 2012 . Sources and Uses of Cash Our primary source of liquidity is cash provided by operations. Principal uses of cash for investing activities are capital expenditures, while uses of cash for financing activities are repurchase of the Company common stock and payment of common stock dividends. The following table presents a summary of cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the last three fiscal years (in millions): 2012 2011 2010 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 378.3 $ 254.1 $ 222.6 Net cash used in investing activities (139.1 ) (171.3 ) (112.1 ) Net cash used in financing activities (277.5 ) (163.2 ) (26.0 ) Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents $ (38.3 ) $ (80.4 ) $ 84.5 Operating Activities Cash flow from operating activities continues to provide the primary source of our liquidity. The $124.2 million increase in net cash provided by operations in fiscal 2012 over fiscal 2011 was primarily due to stronger earnings, working capital management and the timing of tax payments as shown below (in millions): 2012 2011 Variance Net income $ 276.5 $ 222.7 $ 53.8 Depreciation and amortization 89.0 80.3 8.7 Stock compensation expense 17.6 15.1 2.5 Deferred income taxes (26.6 ) 1.9 (28.5 ) Inventories and accounts payable (23.3 ) (75.3 ) 52.0 Prepaid expenses and other current assets (0.1 ) (17.8 ) 17.7 Accrued expenses 9.0 20.0 (11.0 ) Income taxes payable 31.5 3.6 27.9 Other, net 4.7 3.6 1.1 Net cash provided by operations $ 378.3 $ 254.1 $ 124.2 The change in deferred income taxes is due primarily to temporary differences related to tax law changes regarding depreciation. Inventory, net of accounts payable, increased at a lesser rate compared to prior year, as we achieved a higher increase in accounts payable relative to inventory primarily due to timing of payments. Income taxes payable increased due to higher income in the period as well as timing of estimated tax payments, as a result of changes in allowable deductions for depreciation expense. 30 Index The $31.5 million increase in net cash provided by operations in fiscal 2011 over fiscal 2010 is primarily due to changes in the following operating activities (in millions): 2011 2010 Variance Net income $ 222.7 $ 168.0 $ 54.7 Depreciation and amortization 80.3 69.8 10.5 Stock compensation expense 15.1 11.8 3.3 Deferred income taxes 1.9 2.7 (0.8 ) Inventories and accounts payable (75.3 ) (74.3 ) (1.0 ) Prepaid expenses and other current assets (17.8 ) (3.2 ) (14.6 ) Accrued expenses 20.0 38.5 (18.5 ) Income taxes payable 3.6 1.0 2.6 Other, net 3.6 8.3 (4.7 ) Net cash provided by operations $ 254.1 $ 222.6 $ 31.5 The increase in net cash provided by operations in fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 was primarily due to stronger net income and the impact of higher depreciation and amortization expense partially offset by a decrease in cash provided by accrued expenses and an increase in cash used for prepaid expenses and other current assets. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense is related to store growth and capital expenditures associated with the construction of a new distribution center. The decrease in cash provided by accrued expenses was primarily due to timing of payments. The increase in cash used for prepaid expenses and other current assets is primarily due to timing of payments due from our vendors. Investing Activities Investing activities used cash of $139.1 million , $171.3 million and $112.1 million in fiscal 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively. The majority of this cash requirement relates to our capital expenditures. In fiscal 2012 , the $152.9 million of capital expenditures was partially offset by a $13.5 million decrease in restricted cash. Our significant store expansion, coupled with distribution network and store support center expansion and other required investments in infrastructure, resulted in the following capital expenditures (in millions): 2012 2011 2010 New and relocated stores and stores not yet opened $ 60.4 $ 44.9 $ 28.6 Information technology 28.2 12.3 14.9 Existing stores 22.2 18.7 17.6 Distribution center capacity and improvements 16.4 56.3 22.5 Corporate and other 13.8 1.8 1.3 Purchase of previously leased and self developed stores 11.9 32.2 11.6 Total capital expenditures $ 152.9 $ 166.2 $ 96.5 The above table reflects 93 new stores and one relocation during fiscal 2012 , compared to 85 new stores and three relocations during fiscal 2011 . We also purchased five of our existing leased stores during fiscal 2012 compared to 12 existing leased stores in fiscal 2011 . The capital expenditures in fiscal 2012 for distribution center capacity and improvements primarily reflect the construction of our new distribution center in Macon, Georgia, which we expect to be operational in late 2013. The increase in expenditures for information technology in fiscal 2012 is related to point-of-sale system and e-commerce site upgrades, as well as store and store support center hardware refreshes. The increase in corporate and other primarily reflects the purchase of an undeveloped parcel of land in Brentwood, Tennessee for our future store support center. The spending in fiscal 2011 for distribution center capacity is primarily due to the construction of our distribution center in Franklin, Kentucky and the implementation of a new warehouse management system in two of our seven distribution centers. We currently estimate that capital expenditures will range between $240 million and $250 million in fiscal 2013 . We plan to open between 100 to 105 stores in fiscal 2013 . We estimate that we will spend approximately $40 to $45 million in fiscal 2013 on our distribution center network, principally to relocate our southeast distribution center to Macon, Georgia, as well as continued improvements in existing distribution centers such as conveyor systems. 31 Index We plan to spend approximately $45 to $50 million in fiscal 2013 to develop and construct our new store support center, which we expect to be completed by late 2014. We also plan to invest in information technology upgrades, including an upgrade of our e-commerce site, which will include the integration of order management, drop shipment, fulfillment and call center activities. Financing Activities Financing activities used cash of $277.5 million, $163.2 million , and $26.0 million in fiscal 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively. The cash used by financing activities in fiscal 2012 was mainly the result of repurchases of common stock and quarterly cash dividends paid to stockholders, partially offset by net proceeds from issuance of common stock related to share-based compensation and excess tax benefits recognized on options exercised. Our Board of Directors authorized share repurchases under the share repurchase program up to $1.0 billion of common stock, exclusive of any fees, commissions, or other expenses related to such repurchases, through April 2015 . The repurchases may be made from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. The timing and amount of any shares repurchased under the program will depend on a variety of factors, including price, corporate and regulatory requirements, capital availability, and other market conditions. Repurchased shares will be held in treasury. The program may be limited or terminated at any time without prior notice. We repurchased approximately 3.1 million , 3.1 million and 0.8 million shares under the share repurchase program at a total cost of $271.8 million , $180.0 million and $38.2 million in fiscal 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively. Repurchased shares are accounted for at cost and will be held in treasury for future issuance. As of December 29, 2012 , we had remaining authorization under the share repurchase program of $291.2 million exclusive of any fees, commissions, or other expenses. In the second quarter of fiscal 2012, we increased our quarterly dividend from $0.12 per share to $0.20 per share. We paid dividends totaling $51.3 million , $30.9 million and $20.4 million in fiscal 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively. We believe that our existing cash balances, expected cash flow from future operations, borrowings available under the Senior Credit Facility, operating and capital leases and normal trade credit will be sufficient to fund our operations and our capital expenditure needs, including new store openings, store acquisitions, relocations and renovations, and distribution center capacity, over the next several years. Significant Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following table reflects our future obligations and commitments as of December 29, 2012 (in thousands): Payment Due by Period Total 2013 2014-2015 2016-2017 Thereafter Operating leases $ 1,738,375 $ 205,862 $ 387,434 $ 341,329 $ 803,750 Capital leases (a) 2,365 146 292 292 1,635 Purchase obligations (b) 3,303 3,303 Construction commitments (c) 28,559 28,559 $ 1,772,602 $ 237,870 $ 387,726 $ 341,621 $ 805,385 (a) Capital lease obligations include related interest. (b) Relates to the obligation to purchase a previously leased store. (c) Reflects $3.1 million for the land and construction of stores expected to be opened in fiscal 2013, $24.4 million for construction of our distribution center in Macon, Georgia, and $1.1 million for development of our new store support center. In addition, in January 2013 we signed a contract related to the construction of our new store support center in the amount of $59.0 million. At December 29, 2012 , there were $51.4 million outstanding letters of credit under the Senior Credit Facility and a $7.3 million outstanding letter of credit at a financial institution outside of the Senior Credit Facility which is collateralized by a time deposit classified as restricted cash. 32 Index Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Our off-balance sheet arrangements are limited to operating leases and outstanding letters of credit. The balances for these arrangements are previously discussed. We typically lease buildings for retail stores and offices rather than acquiring these assets which allows us to utilize financial capital to operate the business rather than invest in fixed assets. Letters of credit allow us to purchase inventory, primarily sourced overseas, in a timely manner and support certain risk management programs. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In June 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2011-05 Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Presentation of Comprehensive Income, which provides new guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income. ASU 2011-05 eliminates the option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in stockholders equity and instead requires an entity to present the total of comprehensive income, the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement or in two separate but consecutive statements. This guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2011. The Company adopted the standard for the interim period ended March 31, 2012. There are no items of other comprehensive income for the periods presented; thus, there was no impact on the Company consolidated financial statements. In September 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-08, Intangibles Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Testing Goodwill for Impairment. The ASU gives an entity the option in its annual goodwill impairment test to first assess revised qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not (a likelihood of more than 50%) that the fair value of a reporting unit is more than its carrying amount ( qualitative assessment ). If it is more likely than not the fair value of a reporting unit is more than its carrying amount, an entity would not be required to perform the existing two-step impairment test. The amendments to Topic 350 are effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011. The Company adopted the standard for the interim period ended March 31, 2012. There was no impact on the Company consolidated financial statements. I tem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Interest Rate Risk We may be exposed to changes in interest rates primarily from the Senior Credit Facility. The Senior Credit Facility bears interest at either the bank base rate ( 3.25% at both December 29, 2012 and December 31, 2011 ) or LIBOR ( 0.21% and 0.30% at December 29, 2012 and December 31, 2011 , respectively) plus an additional amount per annum adjusted quarterly (ranging from 0.40% to 1.00% ) based on our leverage ratio ( 0.50% at both December 29, 2012 and December 31, 2011 ). We are also required to pay (quarterly in arrears) a commitment fee (ranging from 0.08% to 0.20% ) based on the daily average unused portion of the credit line ( 0.10% at both December 29, 2012 and December 31, 2011 ). Seasonality and Weather Our business is seasonal. Historically, our sales and profits have been the highest in the second and fourth fiscal quarters due to the sale of seasonal products. In past years, extreme weather conditions, including snow and ice storms, flood and wind damage, hurricanes, tornadoes and droughts have also affected our sales and results of operations. Our strategy is to reduce or mitigate the impact of extreme weather conditions through geographic dispersion of our stores and taking advantage of our ability to effectively manage inventory allocation. We experience our highest inventory and accounts payable levels during our first fiscal quarter for purchases of seasonal product in anticipation of the spring selling season and again during our third fiscal quarter in anticipation of the cold-weather selling season. Purchase Price Volatility Although we cannot determine the full effect of inflation and deflation on our operations, we believe our sales and results of operations are affected by both. We are subject to market risk with respect to the pricing of certain products and services, which include, among other items, steel, grain, petroleum, corn, cotton and other commodities as well as transportation services. Therefore, we may experience both inflationary and deflationary pressure on product cost, which may impact consumer demand and, as a result, sales and gross margin. Our strategy is to reduce or mitigate the effects of purchase price volatility principally by taking advantage of vendor incentive programs, economies of scale from increased volume of purchases, adjusting retail prices and selectively buying from the most competitive vendors without sacrificing quality. Should our strategy to mitigate purchase price volatility not be effective, our financial performance could be adversely impacted. 33 Index
