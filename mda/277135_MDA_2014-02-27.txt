Item 7: Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview General . Grainger is a broad-line distributor of maintenance, repair and operating supplies, and other related products and services used by businesses and institutions. Grainger operations are primarily in the United States and Canada, with a presence in Europe, Asia and Latin America. Grainger uses a multichannel business model to provide customers with a range of options for finding and purchasing products utilizing sales representatives, catalogs, direct marketing materials and eCommerce. Grainger serves more than 2 million customers worldwide through a network of highly integrated branches, distribution centers, multiple websites and export services. Grainger two reportable segments are the United States and Canada. The United States segment reflects the results of Grainger U.S. operating segment. The Canada segment reflects the results for Acklands Grainger Inc., Grainger Canadian operating segment. Other Businesses include operations in Europe, Asia, Latin America and other U.S. operations, which are not material individually. Business Environment . Given Grainger's large number of customers and the diverse industries it serves, several economic factors and industry trends tend to shape Grainger business environment. The overall economy and leading economic indicators provide general insight into projecting Grainger growth. Grainger sales in the United States and Canada tend to positively correlate with Gross Domestic Product (GDP), Industrial Production, Exports and Business Investment. In the United States, sales also tend to positively correlate with Business Inventory. The table below provides these estimated indicators for 2013 and 2014: United States Canada Estimated 2013 Forecasted 2014 Estimated 2013 Forecasted 2014 GDP 1.9% 2.7% 1.8% 2.4% Industrial Production 2.6% 3.2% 1.3% 2.5% Exports 2.8% 4.9% 1.2% 2.9% Business Investment 2.9% 6.3% 1.2% 6.6% Business Inventory 4.2% 3.0% Source: Global Insight (February 2014) The light and heavy manufacturing customer sectors, which comprised approximately 30% of Grainger total 2013 sales, have historically correlated with manufacturing employment levels and manufacturing production. Manufacturing employment levels in the United States increased approximately 0.6% from December 2012 to December 2013 , while manufacturing output increased 2.6% . These increases contributed to a high single-digit percent sales increase in the light manufacturing customer sector and a mid single-digit percent sales increase in the heavy manufacturing customer sector for Grainger in 2013. As oil production represents a large segment of the Canadian economy, fluctuations in crude oil prices can have a significant impact on the sales and business conditions in Grainger's Canadian business. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, crude oil prices increased from $88 to $98 per barrel, or an 11% increase from December 2012 to December 2013. Outlook . In 2014, Grainger plans to continue to make investments in its supply chain, eCommerce, sales force and inventory management services. These investments are expected to accelerate market share growth and increase Grainger's size and scale. Grainger is also taking appropriate steps to strengthen areas of the business that are not performing to expectations. On January 24, 2014, Grainger revised its 2014 earnings per share guidance from a range of $12.25 to $13.00 to a range of $12.10 to $12.85 and also revised its 2014 sales guidance from a range of 6 to 10 percent to a range of 5 to 9 percent. This change is primarily driven by unfavorable foreign exchange and the divestiture of the four direct marketing brands, which were sold on December 31, 2013. 13 Matters Affecting Comparability . Grainger completed several acquisitions throughout 2013 , 2012 and 2011, all of which were immaterial individually and in the aggregate. Grainger operating results have included the results of each business acquired since the respective acquisition dates. Results of Operations The following table is included as an aid to understanding changes in Grainger's Consolidated Statements of Earnings: For the Years Ended December 31, As a Percent of Net Sales Percent Increase/(Decrease) from Prior Year 2013 2012 2011 2013 2012 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 5.4 % 10.8 % Cost of merchandise sold 56.2 56.2 56.5 5.3 10.2 Gross profit 43.8 43.8 43.5 5.6 11.5 Operating expenses 30.1 31.2 30.5 2.0 13.3 Operating earnings 13.7 12.6 13.0 14.7 7.5 Other income (expense) (0.1 ) (0.1 ) (30.6 ) Income taxes 5.1 4.7 4.8 14.5 8.8 Noncontrolling interest 0.1 0.1 0.1 19.5 12.3 Net earnings attributable to W.W.

The 5% increase for the year consisted of the following contributors: Percent Increase/ (Decrease) Volume 3 Business acquisitions 2 Price 1 Foreign exchange (1) Total 5% Net sales to most customer end markets increased for 2013 . The increase in net sales was led by growth in sales to heavy and light manufacturing customers, followed by diversified commercial services customers. Refer to the Segment Analysis below for further details. Gross profit of $ 4,136 million for 2013 increased 6% . The gross profit margin for 2013 was 43.8% , flat versus 2012 , primarily driven by price increases exceeding product cost increases, offset by lower margins from the acquired businesses and faster growth with lower margin customers. Operating expenses of $ 2,840 million for 2013 increased 2% from $ 2,785 million for 2012 . Operating expenses in 2013 included a $26 million expense related to the impairment charges for the business in Brazil and Grainger Lighting Services in the United States. Also included was $10 million of expense related to restructuring charges for improving the long-term performance of the businesses in Europe and China. Operating expenses in 2012 included a $76 million expense related to the settlement of disputes involving the GSA and USPS contracts. Also included in 2012 was $24 million of expense related to branch closure costs, restructuring charges related to improving the long-term performance of the businesses in Europe, India and China and an impairment charge for Grainger Lighting Services. Excluding these expenses from both years, operating expenses increased 4%, primarily driven by the acquisitions and an incremental $132 million in growth-related spending on new sales representatives, eCommerce and inventory management solutions, primarily in the United States. 14 Operating earnings of $ 1,297 million for 2013 increased 15% from $ 1,131 million for 2012 . Excluding the expenses mentioned above for both years, operating earnings increased 8%, primarily due to higher sales and operating expenses increasing at a slower rate than sales. Net earnings attributable to Grainger for 2013 increased by 16% to $ 797 million from $ 690 million in 2012 . The increase in net earnings primarily resulted from an increase in operating earnings. Diluted earnings per share of $11.13 in 2013 were 17% higher than $9.52 for 2012 , due to increased net earnings and lower average shares outstanding. The table below reconciles reported diluted earnings per share determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States to adjusted diluted earnings per share, a non-GAAP measure. Management believes adjusted diluted earnings per share is an important indicator of operations because it excludes items that may not be indicative of core operating results. Because non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare this financial measure with other companies' non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names. Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2013 2012 % Diluted earnings per share reported $11.13 $9.52 17 % GSA/USPS settlement 0.66 Goodwill impairment 0.29 0.04 Restructuring 0.10 0.18 Charge for U.S. branch closures 0.03 Subtotal 0.39 0.91 Diluted earnings per share adjusted $11.52 $10.43 10 % Segment Analysis The following comments at the reportable segment and other business unit level include external and intersegment net sales and operating earnings.

United States Net sales were $ 7,414 million for 2013 , an increase of $ 488 million , or 7% , when compared with net sales of $ 6,926 million for 2012 . The 7% increase for the year consisted of the following contributors: Percent Increase Volume 4 Business acquisitions 2 Price 1 Total 7% Net sales to most customer end markets increased for 2013 . The increase was led by high single digit growth to light manufacturing customers, followed by mid-single digit growth to heavy manufacturing, commercial services, contractors and natural resources customers. Government was up in the low single digits and net sales to resellers were down in the low single digits. The segment gross profit margin decreased 0.3 percentage point in 2013 compared to 2012 , primarily driven by lower margins from the acquired businesses and faster growth with lower margin customers, partially offset by price increases exceeding product cost increases.

Excluding the expenses mentioned above in both years, operating earnings were up 8%. The improvement in operating earnings for 2013 was due to an increase in net sales and operating expenses increasing at a slower rate than sales. Canada Net sales were $ 1,114 million for 2013 , an increase of $ 8 million , or 1% , when compared with $ 1,106 million for 2012 . In local currency, sales increased 4% for 2013. The 1% increase for the year consisted of the following contributors: Percent Increase/ (Decrease) Volume 4 Foreign exchange (3) Total 1% Sales performance in Canada was driven by double digit growth in the forestry market, followed by high single digit growth to the light manufacturing, commercial services and oil and gas end markets. Net sales to heavy manufacturing customers were down in the mid-single digits and the government end market was down in the low single digits. The segment gross profit margin increased 0.4 percentage point in 2013 over 2012 , primarily driven by price increases exceeding product cost increases and favorable freight rates, partially offset by the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange on purchases. Operating expenses increased 2% in 2013 . In local currency, operating expenses increased 5% , primarily due to higher volume-related payroll, occupancy and technology investments, partially offset by lower warehouse expenses. Operating earnings of $ 129 million for 2013 were up $ 1 million , or 1% , versus 2012 . In local currency, operating earnings increased 4% . The increase in earnings was due to sales growth and improved gross profit margins, partially offset by operating expenses increasing at a faster rate than sales. Other Businesses Net sales were $1,040 million for 2013 , an increase of $33 million, or 3%, when compared with $1,007 million for 2012 . The net sales increase was primarily due to incremental sales from Zoro Tools, Brazil and Mexico, partially offset by lower sales in India due to a change in its business model.

The year 2011 included $18 million of branch closure costs. Excluding these expenses from both years, operating expenses increased 10%, primarily driven by the Fabory and AnFreixo acquisitions and incremental growth-related spending on new sales representatives, eCommerce and advertising, primarily in the United States. Operating earnings of $1,131 million for 2012 increased 7% from $1,052 million for 2011. Excluding the expenses mentioned above for both years, operating earnings increased 15%, primarily due to higher sales and gross profit margins, and operating expenses increasing at a slightly slower rate than sales.

Operating expenses increased 9% in 2012. In local currency, operating expenses increased 10% primarily due to higher volume-related payroll and travel costs, and higher advertising and depreciation expense, partially offset by lower occupancy costs. Operating earnings of $127 million for 2012 were up $20 million, or 18%, versus 2011. In local currency, operating earnings increased 19%. The increase in earnings was due to strong sales growth, an improved gross profit margin and expense leverage. Other Businesses Net sales for other businesses, which include operations in Europe, Asia, Latin America and other U.S. operations were up 55% for 2012. The sales increase was due primarily to a full year of sales from Fabory, acquired in August 2011, and incremental sales from AnFreixo, acquired in April 2012, as well as strong growth from the businesses in Japan and Mexico. Operating earnings for other businesses were $20 million for 2012 compared to $31 million for 2011. The decrease was primarily due to restructuring charges related to improving the long-term performance of the businesses in Europe, India and China. Excluding these charges, operating earnings were up $3 million, primarily driven by improved performance in Japan and Mexico, partially offset by losses from the acquired businesses in Europe and Brazil, along with losses in some start-up businesses in developing markets. Other Income and Expense Other income and expense was $13 million of expense in 2012 compared with $1 million of expense in 2011. The following table summarizes the components of other income and expense (in thousands of dollars): For the Years Ended December 31, 2012 2011 Interest income (expense) - net $ (13,418 ) $ (7,023 ) Equity in net income of unconsolidated entity 314 Gain on sale of investment in unconsolidated entity 7,639 Other non-operating income 1,866 709 Other non-operating expense (1,784 ) (2,541 ) Total $ (13,336 ) $ (902 ) Net interest expense increased in 2012 due to higher average outstanding debt, higher average interest rates and interest expense related to capital leases for the acquired business in Europe. In 2011, Grainger divested its 49% ownership in the MRO Korea Co., Ltd. joint venture , resulting in a gain of approximately $8 million. 19 Income Taxes Income taxes of $419 million in 2012 increased 9% as compared with $385 million in 2011. Grainger's effective tax rates were 37.5% and 36.6% in 2012 and 2011, respectively. The 2011 rate benefited from a tax law change in Japan and the settlement of various tax reviews. Excluding these benefits in 2011, the effective tax rate was 38.1%. The effective tax rate in 2012 benefited primarily from a lower blended state tax rate. Financial Condition Grainger expects its strong working capital position, cash flows from operations and borrowing capacity to continue, allowing it to fund its operations, including growth initiatives, capital expenditures, acquisitions and repurchase of shares, as well as to pay cash dividends. Cash Flow Fiscal year 2013 compared with fiscal year 2012 Cash from operating activities continues to serve as Grainger's primary source of liquidity. Net cash flows from operations in 2013 were $986 million and increased $170 million from $816 million in 2012. The primary driver of the improvement was an increase in net earnings of $109 million. In addition, changes in operating assets and liabilities resulted in a net use of cash of $58 million for 2013 compared to $129 million for 2012. The lower use of cash for operating assets and liabilities was driven primarily by higher trade accounts payable due to higher inventory purchases at year-end in 2013 compared to 2012, partially offset by higher accounts receivable from increased sales. Net cash used in investing activities was $399 million and $306 million in 2013 and 2012, respectively. The higher use of cash in 2013 compared to 2012 was primarily driven by the increased cash paid for acquisitions and cash expended for property, buildings, equipment and software. Net cash used in financing activities of $591 million in 2013 increased $197 million from $394 million in 2012. The increase was primarily due to higher treasury share repurchases. Cash paid for treasury share purchases was $438 million in 2013 versus $341 million in 2012, an increase of $97 million. The prior year also included $300 million in proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt. Fiscal year 2012 compared with fiscal year 2011 Cash from operating activities served as Grainger's primary source of liquidity. Net cash flows from operations in 2012 were $816 million and increased $70 million from $746 million in 2011. The primary driver of the improvement was an increase in net earnings of $32 million as well as an increase of $34 million in net non-cash expenses. Net cash used in investing activities of $306 million in 2012 was driven by net cash expended for property, buildings, equipment and software of $241 million and net cash paid for business acquisitions of $65 million. Additional information regarding capital spending is detailed in the Capital Expenditures section below. Net cash used in investing activities was $229 million less than in 2011 due primarily to a decrease in net cash paid for business acquisitions of $294 million versus 2011. Net cash used in financing activities of $394 million in 2012 increased $217 million from $177 million in 2011. The increase was primarily due to higher treasury shares repurchases and higher dividends paid in 2012 versus 2011. Cash paid for treasury share purchases was $341 million in 2012 versus $151 million in 2011, an increase of $190 million. Cash dividends paid were $220 million in 2012, an increase of $39 million versus 2011. 20 Working Capital Internally generated funds are the primary source of working capital and funds used in business expansion, supplemented by debt. In addition, funds are expended to support growth initiatives, as well as for business and systems development and other infrastructure improvements. Working capital consists of current assets (less non-operating cash) and current liabilities (less short-term debt and current maturities of long-term debt). Working capital was $1,621 million at December 31, 2013 , compared with $1,604 million at December 31, 2012 . At these dates, the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 2.5 and 2.6 , respectively. Capital Expenditures In each of the past three years, a portion of operating cash has been used for additions to property, buildings, equipment and capitalized software as summarized in the following table (in thousands of dollars): For the Years Ended December 31, 2013 2012 2011 Land, buildings, structures and improvements $ 60,419 $ 57,929 $ 51,249 Furniture, fixtures, machinery and equipment 152,328 145,483 118,228 Subtotal 212,747 203,412 169,477 Capitalized software 59,398 46,448 27,465 Total $ 272,145 $ 249,860 $ 196,942 In 2013 and 2012, Grainger made significant capital investments to build new distribution centers in the United States and Canada. In the United States, Grainger opened a new 1 million square-foot and highly automated Chicago-area distribution center in 2013. In Canada, Grainger began construction of a 500,000 square-foot distribution center in the Toronto area. Grainger also invested in vending machines for KeepStock, as this program continues to grow. Other significant investments in 2013 and 2012 included investing in a new eCommerce platform, sustaining capital investments for Grainger's branches and distribution centers and other technology infrastructure. In 2011, significant expenditures were made to build new distribution centers in the United States and for distribution center expansion in Canada. Also, a large investment was made to update and improve the eCommerce platform in the United States business. Finally, Grainger continued to invest in new and existing international businesses, as well as for normal recurring replacement of equipment. In 2014, capital expenditures are expected to range from $375 million to $425 million. Projected spending includes continued investments in the supply chain, technology infrastructure, eCommerce and in support of sales initiatives. Grainger expects to fund 2014 capital spending from operating cash. Debt Grainger maintains a debt ratio and liquidity position that provides flexibility in funding working capital needs and long-term cash requirements. In addition to internally generated funds, Grainger has various sources of financing available, including bank borrowings under lines of credit. Refer to Note 6 and Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Total debt as a percent of total capitalization was 14.0% and 15.3% as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 , respectively. The reduction in total debt as a percent of total capitalization was primarily due to increased retained earnings associated with higher earnings in 2013 . Grainger believes any circumstances that would trigger early payment or acceleration with respect to any outstanding debt obligations would not have a material impact on its results of operations or financial position. 21 Commitments and Other Contractual Obligations At December 31, 2013, Grainger's contractual obligations, including estimated payments due by period, are as follows (in thousands of dollars): Payments Due by Period Total Amounts Committed Less than 1 Year 1 - 3 Years 4 - 5 Years More than 5 Years Debt obligations $ 542,799 $ 97,286 $ 429,010 $ 2,498 $ 14,005 Interest on debt 28,367 9,992 13,574 4,771 30 Operating lease obligations 230,644 67,993 97,929 44,785 19,937 Purchase obligations: Uncompleted additions to property, buildings and equipment 65,536 65,536 Commitments to purchase inventory 402,935 402,935 Other purchase obligations 261,773 176,651 63,233 21,833 56 Other liabilities 303,324 185,272 23,862 24,554 69,636 Total $ 1,835,378 $ 1,005,665 $ 627,608 $ 98,441 $ 103,664 Purchase obligations for inventory are made in the normal course of business to meet operating needs. While purchase orders for both inventory purchases and non-inventory purchases are generally cancelable without penalty, certain vendor agreements provide for cancellation fees or penalties depending on the terms of the contract. Other liabilities represent future payments for profit sharing and employee benefits plans as determined by actuarial projections, and other employee benefit plans. Other employment-related benefits costs of $50 million have not been included in this table as the timing of benefit payments is not predictable. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. See also Note 7 and Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail related to the interest on long-term debt and operating lease obligations, respectively. Grainger has recorded a noncurrent liability of approximately $44 million for tax uncertainties and interest at December 31, 2013 . This amount is excluded from the table above, as Grainger cannot make reliable estimates of these cash flows by period. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Grainger does not have any material exposures to off-balance sheet arrangements. Grainger does not have any variable interest entities or activities that include non-exchange-traded contracts accounted for at fair value. 22 Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of financial statements, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses in the financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and other assumptions, which it believes are reasonable. If actual amounts are ultimately different from these estimates, the revisions are included in Grainger's results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known. Accounting policies are considered critical when they require management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimates are made and when there are different estimates that management reasonably could have made, which would have a material impact on the presentation of Grainger's financial condition, changes in financial condition or results of operations. Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. The most significant areas involving management judgments and estimates follow. Actual results in these areas could differ materially from management's estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts . Grainger considers several factors to estimate the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable including the age of the receivables, the percent past due and the historical ratio of actual write-offs to the age of the receivables. The analyses performed also take into consideration economic conditions that may have an impact on a specific industry, group of customers or a specific customer. Based on analysis of actual historical write-offs of uncollectible accounts receivable, Grainger's estimates and assumptions have been materially accurate in regards to the valuation of its allowance for doubtful accounts. However, write-offs could be materially different than the reserves established if business or economic conditions change or actual results deviate from historical trends, and Grainger's estimates and assumptions may be revised as appropriate to reflect these changes. For fiscal years 2013, 2012 and 2011 , actual results did not vary materially from estimated amounts. Inventory Reserves . Grainger establishes inventory reserves for obsolete inventory. Grainger regularly reviews inventory to evaluate continued demand and identify any obsolete or excess quantities. Grainger records provisions for the difference between excess and obsolete inventory and its estimated realizable value. Estimated realizable value is based on anticipated future product demand, market conditions and liquidation values. As Grainger's inventory consists of approximately 1.4 million stocked products, it is not practical to quantify the actual disposition of excess and obsolete inventory against estimated amounts at a stock keeping unit (SKU) level and no individual SKU is material. There were no material differences noted between reserve levels compared to the level of write-offs historically. Grainger's methodology for estimating reserves is continually evaluated based on current experience and the methodology provides for a materially accurate level of reserves at any reporting date. Actual results could differ materially from projections and require changes to reserves which could have a material effect on Grainger's results of operations based on significant changes in product demand, market conditions or liquidation value. If business or economic conditions change, Grainger's estimates and assumptions may be revised as appropriate. For fiscal years 2013, 2012 and 2011 , actual results did not vary materially from estimated amounts. Goodwill and Indefinite Lived Intangible Assets . Business acquisitions result in the recording of goodwill and identified intangible assets which affect the amount of amortization expense and possible impairment write-downs that may occur in future periods. Grainger annually reviews goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment in the fourth quarter and when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values. Grainger tests for goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level and performs a qualitative assessment of factors such as a reporting unit's current performance and overall economic factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the goodwill might be impaired and whether it is necessary to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test. In the two-step test, Grainger compares the carrying value of assets of the reporting unit to its calculated fair value. If the carrying value of assets of the reporting unit exceeds its calculated fair value, the second step is performed, where the implied fair value of goodwill is compared to the carrying value of assets, to determine the amount of impairment. 23 The fair value of reporting units is calculated primarily using the discounted cash flow (DCF) method and incorporating value indicators from a market approach to evaluate the reasonableness of the resulting fair values. The DCF method incorporates various assumptions including the amount and timing of future expected cash flows, including revenues, gross margins, operating expenses, capital expenditures and working capital based on operational budgets, long range strategic plans and other estimates. The terminal value growth rate is used to calculate the value of cash flows beyond the last projected period and reflects management best estimates for perpetual growth for the reporting units. Estimates of market-participant risk-adjusted weighted average cost of capital (WACC) are used as a basis for determining the discount rates to apply to the reporting units future expected cash flows and terminal value. Grainger completed the annual impairment testing using the qualitative approach for seven reporting units and the two-step quantitative test for four of these reporting units during the fourth quarter. For two of these reporting units, Grainger Lighting Services (GLS) and Grainger Brazil (GB), the two-step quantitative test indicated that the carrying value of assets exceeded the calculated fair value and step two impairment calculations were required. As part of the review of the strategic plans for GLS during the fourth quarter, Grainger evaluated the impact of planned changes to the business model and level of investment in the business. Grainger estimates of future projected sales growth, operating earnings, and cash flows were revised to reflect lower estimates for new customers and projects. As a result of the lower projections, Grainger recognized impairment charges of $13 million on the GLS reporting unit. During the fourth quarter, management provided strategic plans which included changes to the business model and level of investment required for GB based on insights gained from owning the business since the acquisition in the second quarter of 2012. Grainger assumptions were revised to reflect changes related to realization of expected deal synergies and anticipated short-term and long-term operating results of GB that were different from pre-acquisition projections. As a result of the lower performance expectations, Grainger estimates for future projected sales growth, operating earnings, and cash flows were revised accordingly. These lowered expectations, as well as an increase in relevant risk factors that increased the discount rate used in the calculations, resulted in the calculated fair value of GB being lower than the carrying value of assets in the step one analysis. As a result of the completion of step two, Grainger recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $11 million. For the two other reporting units, the fair values calculated in the step one analysis exceeded the carrying value of assets and therefore the step two calculation was not required. Fabory, with $134 million of goodwill, had a calculated fair value which exceeded the carrying value of assets by 17%. The risk of potential failure of step one of the impairment test for Fabory in future reporting periods is highly dependent upon key assumptions including the amount and timing of future expected cash flows, sales growth rates, gross margins, capital expenditures, discount rates and estimates of market-participant risk-adjusted WACC. These assumptions require considerable management judgment and are subject to uncertainty. Changes in assumptions regarding the future performance and a continued unfavorable economic environment in Europe may also have a significant impact on cash flows in the future. Given the sensitivity of the calculated fair value to changes in these key assumptions, Grainger may be required to recognize an impairment for Fabory goodwill in the future due to changes in market conditions or other factors related to these key assumptions. Grainger Colombia, with $14 million of goodwill, had a calculated fair value which exceeded the carrying value of assets by 26% as of the test date. 24 Stock Incentive Plans . Grainger maintains stock incentive plans under which a variety of incentive grants may be awarded to employees and directors. Grainger uses a binomial lattice option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock option grants. The model requires projections of the risk-free interest rate, expected life, volatility, dividend yield and forfeiture rate of the stock option grants. The fair value of options granted used the following assumptions: For the Years Ended December 31, 2013 2012 2011 Risk-free interest rate 0.9% 1.1% 2.6% Expected life 6 years 6 years 6 years Expected volatility 25.5% 25.9% 24.6% Expected dividend yield 1.5% 1.6% 1.8% The risk-free interest rate is selected based on yields from U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term approximately equal to the expected term of the options being valued. The expected life selected for options granted during each year presented represents the period of time that the options are expected to be outstanding based on historical data of option holders' exercise and termination behavior. Expected volatility is based upon implied and historical volatility of the closing price of Grainger's stock over a period equal to the expected life of each option grant. Historical information is also the primary basis for selection of the expected dividend yield assumptions. Because stock option compensation expense is based on awards ultimately expected to vest, it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures, using historical forfeiture experience. The amount of stock option compensation expense is significantly affected by the valuation model and these assumptions. If a different valuation model or different assumptions were used, the stock option compensation expense could be significantly different from what is recorded in the current period. Compensation expense for other stock-based awards is based upon the closing market price on the last trading date preceding the date of the grant. Because the expense for other stock-based awards should reflect the awards ultimately expected to vest, it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures, using historical forfeiture experience. For additional information concerning stock incentive plans, see Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Postretirement Healthcare Benefits . Postretirement healthcare obligation and net periodic cost are dependent on assumptions and estimates used in calculating such amounts. The assumptions used include, among others, discount rates, assumed rates of return on plan assets and healthcare cost trend rates, and certain employee-related factors, such as turnover, retirement age and mortality rates. Changes in these and other assumptions (caused by conditions in equity markets or plan experience, for example) could have a material effect on Grainger's postretirement benefit obligation and expense, and could affect its results of operations and financial condition. These changes in assumptions may also affect voluntary decisions to make additional contributions to the trust established for funding the postretirement benefit obligation. The discount rate assumptions used by management reflect the rates available on high-quality fixed income debt instruments as of December 31, the measurement date, of each year. A higher discount rate reduces the present value of benefit obligations and net periodic benefit costs. As of December 31, 2013 , Grainger increased the discount rate used in the calculation of the postretirement plan obligation from 4.0% to 4.9% to reflect the increase in market interest rates. Grainger estimates that this increase could increase 2014 pretax earnings by approximately $4 million. However, other changes in assumptions may increase, decrease or eliminate this effect. Grainger considers the long-term historical actual return on plan assets and the historical performance of the Standard & Poor's 500 Index and the Total International Composite Index in developing its expected long-term return on plan assets. In 2013, Grainger decreased the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets from 6.0% (net of tax) to 5.7% (net of tax) based on the historical average of long-term rates of return. Grainger estimates this change could reduce 2014 pretax earnings by approximately $0.4 million. The Company s healthcare trend rate is selected based on historical experience and expected experience. Grainger changed the duration of the healthcare trend rate from an assumed rate of increase of 7.5% declining 50 basis points a year until reaching the ultimate trend rate of 5% to an assumed rate of increase of 7.5% declining 25 basis points a year until reaching the ultimate trend rate of 4.5%. Grainger estimates this change could reduce 2014 pretax earnings by approximately $1 million. 25 A 1 percentage point change in assumed healthcare cost trend rates would have had the following effects on December 31, 2013 results (in thousands of dollars): 1 Percentage Point Increase (Decrease) Effect on total of service and interest cost $ 2,205 $ (1,777 ) Effect on postretirement benefit obligation 29,776 (24,196 ) Grainger changed the mortality improvement scale used to project mortality rates into the future from Mortality Improvement Scale AA to Mortality Improvement Scale BB at December 31, 2013. Grainger estimates this change could reduce 2014 pretax earnings by approximately $2 million . Grainger may terminate or modify the postretirement plan at any time, subject to the provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and the Internal Revenue Code, as amended. In the event the postretirement plan is terminated, all assets of the Group Benefit Trust inure to the benefit of the participants. The foregoing assumptions are based on the presumption that the postretirement plan will continue. Were the postretirement plan to terminate, different actuarial assumptions and other factors might be applicable. Grainger has used its best judgment in making assumptions and estimates and believes such assumptions and estimates used are appropriate. Changes to the assumptions may be required in future years as a result of actual experience or new trends or plan changes and, therefore, may affect Grainger's retirement plan obligations and future expense. For additional information concerning postretirement healthcare benefits, see Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Insurance Reserves . Grainger retains a significant portion of the risk of certain losses related to workers' compensation, general liability and property losses through the utilization of high deductibles and self-insured retentions. There are also certain other risk areas for which Grainger does not maintain insurance. Grainger is responsible for establishing accounting policies on insurance reserves. Although it relies on outside parties to project future claims costs, it retains control over actuarial assumptions, including loss development factors and claim payment patterns. Grainger performs ongoing reviews of its insured and uninsured risks, which it uses to establish the appropriate reserve levels. In calculating the liability, historical trends, claims experience and loss development patterns are analyzed and appropriate loss development factors are applied to the incurred costs associated with the claims made. The use of assumptions in the analysis leads to fluctuations in required reserves over time. Any change in the required reserve balance is reflected in the current period's results of operations. Grainger believes its estimates are reasonable based on the information currently available and the methodology used to estimate these reserves has been consistently applied. There were no material adjustments based on Grainger's historical experience in 2013, 2012 and 2011 . If actual trends, including the nature, severity or frequency of claims differ from Grainger's estimates, or if business or economic conditions change, Grainger's estimates and assumptions may be revised as appropriate and the results of operations could be materially impacted. Income Taxes . Grainger recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The tax balances and income tax expense recognized by Grainger are based on management's interpretations of the tax laws of multiple jurisdictions. Income tax expense reflects Grainger's best estimates and assumptions regarding, among other items, the level of future taxable income, interpretation of tax laws and tax planning opportunities, plans for reinvestment of cash overseas and uncertain tax positions. Future rulings by tax authorities and future changes in tax laws and their interpretation, changes in projected levels of taxable income, changes in planned need for cash overseas and future tax planning strategies could impact the actual effective tax rate and tax balances recorded by Grainger. 26 Contingent Liabilities . At any time, Grainger may be subject to investigations, legal proceedings, or claims related to the ongoing operation of its business, including claims both by and against Grainger. Such proceedings typically involve claims related to product liability, general negligence, contract disputes, environmental issues, wage and hour laws, intellectual property, employment practices, regulatory compliance or other matters and actions brought by employees, consumers, competitors, suppliers or governmental entities. Grainger routinely assesses the likelihood of any adverse outcomes related to these matters on a case by case basis, as well as the potential ranges of losses and fees. Grainger establishes accruals for its potential exposure, as appropriate, for claims against Grainger when losses become probable and reasonably estimable. Where Grainger is able to reasonably estimate a range of potential losses, Grainger records the amount within that range that constitutes Grainger's best estimate. Grainger also discloses the nature of and range of loss for claims against Grainger when losses are reasonably possible and material. These accruals and disclosures are determined based on the facts and circumstances related to the individual cases and require estimates and judgments regarding the interpretation of facts and laws, as well as the effectiveness of strategies or other factors beyond Grainger's control. Other . Other significant accounting policies, not involving the same level of measurement uncertainties as those discussed above, are nevertheless important to an understanding of the financial statements. Policies such as revenue recognition, depreciation, intangibles, long-lived assets, fair value measurements and valuations, and warranties require judgments on complex matters that are often subject to multiple external sources of authoritative guidance such as the Financial Accounting Standards Board and the Securities and Exchange Commission. Possible changes in estimates or assumptions associated with these policies are not expected to have a material effect on the financial condition or results of operations of Grainger. More information on these additional accounting policies can be found in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Inflation Inflation during the last three years has not had a significant effect on operations. The predominant use of the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method of accounting for inventories and accelerated depreciation methods for financial reporting and income tax purposes result in a substantial recognition of the effects of inflation in the financial statements. Some of Grainger's products contain significant amounts of commodity-priced materials, such as steel, copper, petroleum derivatives or rare earth minerals, and are subject to price changes based upon fluctuations in the commodities market. Grainger has been able to successfully pass on cost increases to its customers minimizing the effect of inflation on results of operations. Grainger believes the most positive means to combat inflation and advance the interests of investors lie in the continued application of basic business principles, which include improving productivity, maintaining working capital turnover and offering products and services that can command appropriate prices in the marketplace. 27 Forward-Looking Statements This Form 10-K contains statements that are not historical in nature but concern future results and business plans, strategies and objectives and other matters that may be deemed to be forward-looking statements under the federal securities laws. Grainger has generally identified such forward-looking statements by using words such as anticipated, assumed, assumes, assumptions, believe, believes, can, continue, continued, continues, could, estimate, estimated, estimates, expect, expectation, expectations, expected, expects, forecasted, forecasts, guidance, if, intended, intends, maintain, maintains, may, might, no assurance, plans, predict, predictable, presumption, project, projected, projecting, projections, potential, potentially, reasonably likely, risk, scheduled, should, tend, unanticipated, will, and would or similar expressions. Grainger cannot guarantee that any forward-looking statement will be realized, although Grainger does believe that its assumptions underlying its forward-looking statements are reasonable. Achievement of future results is subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause Grainger's results to differ materially from those which are presented. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those presented or implied in a forward-looking statement include, without limitation: higher product costs or other expenses; a major loss of customers; loss or disruption of source of supply; increased competitive pricing pressures; failure to develop or implement new technologies or business strategies; the outcome of pending and future litigation or governmental or regulatory proceedings; investigations, inquiries, audits and changes in laws and regulations; disruption of information technology or data security systems; general industry or market conditions; general global economic conditions; currency exchange rate fluctuations; market volatility; commodity price volatility; labor shortages; litigation involving appropriate payment for wages; facilities disruptions or shutdowns; higher fuel costs or disruptions in transportation services; natural and other catastrophes; unanticipated weather conditions; and the factors identified in Item 1A, Risk Factors. Caution should be taken not to place undue reliance on Grainger's forward-looking statements and Grainger undertakes no obligation to publicly update the forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. 28
