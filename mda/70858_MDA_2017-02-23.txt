Following a soft start to the year partly reflecting severe winter weather, domestic demand grew at a moderate pace over the remainder of the year. Suppressed by a slowdown in housing gains and a decrease in state and local government purchases, domestic spending growth was less than two percent, while weak exports, in part a lagged response to the sharp U.S. dollar appreciation of recent years, and continued inventory reductions by businesses also had a negative impact on GDP growth. Meanwhile, the labor market continued to tighten, and average hourly earnings increased at the fastest pace since 2008. Payroll gains remained solid, and the unemployment rate trended downward, with the decline limited by stabilizing labor force participation. With employment and wages both rising, consumer spending, the largest component of the U.S. economy, was an economic bright spot. Core inflation (which, unlike headline inflation, excludes certain items subject to frequent volatile price change such as food and energy) also increased during 2016 , but remained below the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve) longer-term target of two percent. Meanwhile, headline inflation recovered, as energy costs began to reverse some of their large declines of recent years. Following a weak start, equity markets advanced in 2016 . Higher energy costs improved the trajectory of the manufacturing sector and the outlook for business investment. Treasury yields decreased in the first half of the year, but more than reversed their declines during the second half, especially in the fourth quarter. The U.S. dollar followed a similar pattern, depreciating in the first half only to reverse the losses later in the year. For a second consecutive year, the Federal Open Market Committee raised its target range for the Federal funds rate by 25 basis points (bps) at the year final meeting. With a stronger economy, rising inflation and continued labor market tightening, Federal Reserve members raised expectations that if economic growth continued, the pace of rate increases will pick up in 2017, although the removal of accommodation would remain gradual. The contrast between U.S. tightening and quantitative easing in Europe and Japan remained a source of dollar strength. Internationally, the Eurozone grew moderately in 2016 amid increasing political uncertainty and fragmentation which led to political impasse and fragile governments in many countries, including Italy and Spain. In this context, the European Central Bank extended its quantitative easing program, albeit at a slower pace. At the same time, the U.K. surprised financial markets by voting in favor of leaving the EU. Despite this decision, the U.K. economy proved resilient. Activity in Japan continued to expand in 2016 . However, inflation fell back into negative territory for most of the year, forcing the Bank of Japan to adopt a new monetary policy framework aimed at targeting sovereign yields. Aided in part by the increase in oil prices, the Russian and Brazilian economies showed signs of stabilizing following their deep recessions. China economy decelerated modestly during the year, as its transition towards a growth model less focused on trade, and public investment continued. Recent Events Capital Management During 2016, we repurchased approximately $5.1 billion of common stock pursuant to the Board of Directors (the Board) authorization of our 2016 and 2015 Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) capital plans and to offset equity-based compensation awards. Also, in addition to the previously announced repurchases associated with the 2016 CCAR capital plan, on January 13, 2017, we announced a plan to repurchase an additional $1.8 billion of common stock during the first half of 2017, to which the Federal Reserve did not object. For additional information, see Capital Management on page 45 . Sale of Non-U.S. Consumer Credit Card Business On December 20, 2016, we entered into an agreement to sell our non-U.S. consumer credit card business to a third party. Subject to regulatory approval, this transaction is expected to close by mid-2017. After closing, we will retain substantially all payment protection insurance (PPI) exposure above existing reserves. We have considered this exposure in our estimate of a small after-tax gain on the sale. This transaction, once completed, will reduce risk-weighted assets and goodwill, benefiting regulatory capital. At December 31, 2016, the assets of this business, which are presented in assets of business held for sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, included non-U.S. credit card loans of $9.2 billion. This business is included in All Other for reporting purposes. For more information on the assets and liabilities of this business, see Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Bank of America 2016 21 Selected Financial Data Table 1 provides selected consolidated financial data for 2016 and 2015 . Table 1 Selected Financial Data (Dollars in millions, except per share information) 2016 2015 Income statement Revenue, net of interest expense $ 83,701 $ 82,965 Net income 17,906 15,836 Diluted earnings per common share 1.50 1.31 Dividends paid per common share 0.25 0.20 Performance ratios Return on average assets 0.82 % 0.73 % Return on average common shareholders' equity 6.71 6.24 Return on average tangible common shareholders equity (1) 9.54 9.08 Efficiency ratio 65.65 69.59 Balance sheet at year end Total loans and leases $ 906,683 $ 896,983 Total assets 2,187,702 2,144,287 Total deposits 1,260,934 1,197,259 Total common shareholders equity 241,620 233,903 Total shareholders equity 266,840 256,176 (1) Return on average tangible common shareholders' equity is a non-GAAP financial measure. For additional information, see Supplemental Financial Data on page 27 , and for corresponding reconciliations to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) financial measures, see Statistical Table XV. Financial Highlights Net income was $17.9 billion , or $1.50 per diluted share in 2016 compared to $15.8 billion , or $1.31 per diluted share in 2015 . The results for 2016 compared to 2015 were driven by higher net interest income and lower noninterest expense, partially offset by a decline in noninterest income and higher provision for credit losses. Table 2 Summary Income Statement (Dollars in millions) 2016 2015 Net interest income $ 41,096 $ 38,958 Noninterest income 42,605 44,007 Total revenue, net of interest expense 83,701 82,965 Provision for credit losses 3,597 3,161 Noninterest expense 54,951 57,734 Income before income taxes 25,153 22,070 Income tax expense 7,247 6,234 Net income 17,906 15,836 Preferred stock dividends 1,682 1,483 Net income applicable to common shareholders $ 16,224 $ 14,353 Per common share information Earnings $ 1.58 $ 1.37 Diluted earnings 1.50 1.31 Net Interest Income Net interest income increased $2.1 billion to $41.1 billion in 2016 compared to 2015 . The net interest yield increased seven bps to 2.21 percent for 2016 . These increases were primarily driven by growth in commercial loans, the impact of higher short-end interest rates and increased debt securities balances, as well as a charge of $612 million in 2015 related to the redemption of certain trust preferred securities, partially offset by lower loan spreads and market-related hedge ineffectiveness. We expect net interest income to increase approximately $600 million per quarter beginning in the first quarter of 2017, assuming interest rates remain at the year-end 2016 level and modest growth in loans and deposits. Noninterest Income Table 3 Noninterest Income (Dollars in millions) 2016 2015 Card income $ 5,851 $ 5,959 Service charges 7,638 7,381 Investment and brokerage services 12,745 13,337 Investment banking income 5,241 5,572 Trading account profits 6,902 6,473 Mortgage banking income 1,853 2,364 Gains on sales of debt securities 490 1,138 Other income 1,885 1,783 Total noninterest income $ 42,605 $ 44,007 Noninterest income decreased $1.4 billion to $42.6 billion for 2016 compared to 2015 . The following highlights the significant changes. Service charges increased $257 million primarily due to higher treasury-related revenue. Investment and brokerage services income decreased $592 million driven by lower transactional revenue, and decreased asset management fees due to lower market valuations, partially offset by the impact of higher long-term assets under management (AUM) flows. Investment banking income decreased $331 million driven by lower equity issuance fees and advisory fees due to a decline in market fee pools . Trading account profits increased $429 million due to a stronger performance across credit products led by mortgages and continued strength in rates products, partially offset by reduced client activity in equities. Mortgage banking income decreased $511 million primarily driven by a decline in production income, higher representations and warranties provision and lower servicing income, partially offset by more favorable mortgage servicing rights (MSR) results, net of the related hedge performance. Gains on sales of debt securities decreased $648 million primarily driven by lower sales volume. 22 Bank of America 2016 Other income increased $102 million primarily due to lower debit valuation adjustment (DVA) losses on structured liabilities, improved results from loans and the related hedging activities in the fair value option portfolio, and lower PPI expense, partially offset by lower gains on asset sales. DVA losses related to structured liabilities were $97 million in 2016 compared to $633 million in 2015 . Provision for Credit Losses The provision for credit losses increased $436 million to $3.6 billion for 2016 compared to 2015 due to a slower pace of credit quality improvement in the consumer portfolio and an increase in energy sector reserves for the higher risk energy sub-sectors in the commercial portfolio. For more information on the provision for credit losses, see Provision for Credit Losses on page 75 . For more information on our energy sector exposure, see Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management Industry Concentrations on page 71 . Noninterest Expense Table 4 Noninterest Expense (Dollars in millions) 2016 2015 Personnel $ 31,616 $ 32,868 Occupancy 4,038 4,093 Equipment 1,804 2,039 Marketing 1,703 1,811 Professional fees 1,971 2,264 Amortization of intangibles 730 834 Data processing 3,007 3,115 Telecommunications 746 823 Other general operating 9,336 9,887 Total noninterest expense $ 54,951 $ 57,734 Noninterest expense decreased $2.8 billion to $55.0 billion for 2016 compared to 2015 . Personnel expense decreased $1.3 billion as we continue to manage headcount and achieve cost savings. Continued expense management, as well as the expiration of advisor retention awards, more than offset the increases in client-facing professionals. Professional fees decreased $293 million primarily due to lower legal fees. Other general operating expense decreased $551 million primarily driven by lower foreclosed properties expense and lower brokerage fees, partially offset by higher FDIC expense. We have previously announced an annual noninterest expense target of approximately $53 billion for full-year 2018. Income Tax Expense Table 5 Income Tax Expense (Dollars in millions) 2016 2015 Income before income taxes $ 25,153 $ 22,070 Income tax expense 7,247 6,234 Effective tax rate 28.8 % 28.2 % The effective tax rate for 2016 was driven by our recurring tax preferences and net tax benefits related to various tax audit matters , partially offset by a charge for the impact of the U.K. tax law changes discussed below. The effective tax rate for 2015 was driven by our recurring tax preferences and by tax benefits related to certain non-U.S. restructurings, partially offset by a charge for the impact of the U.K. tax law change enacted in 2015. The U.K. Finance Bill 2016 was enacted on September 15, 2016. The changes included reducing the U.K. corporate income tax rate by one percent to 17 percent, effective April 1, 2020. This reduction favorably affects income tax expense on future U.K. earnings, but required a remeasurement of our U.K. net deferred tax assets using the lower tax rate. Accordingly, upon enactment, we recorded an income tax charge of $348 million. In addition, for banking companies, the portion of U.K. taxable income that can be reduced by existing net operating loss carryforwards in any one taxable year has been reduced from 50 percent to 25 percent retroactive to April 1, 2016. Our U.K. deferred tax assets, which consist primarily of net operating losses, are expected to be realized by certain subsidiaries over a number of years. Significant changes to management's earnings forecasts for those subsidiaries, changes in applicable laws, further changes in tax laws or changes in the ability of our U.K. subsidiaries to conduct business in the EU, could lead management to reassess our ability to realize the U.K. deferred tax assets.

Bank of America 2016 23 Balance Sheet Overview Table 6 Selected Balance Sheet Data December 31 (Dollars in millions) 2016 2015 % Change Assets Cash and cash equivalents $ 147,738 $ 159,353 (7 )% Federal funds sold and securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell 198,224 192,482 3 Trading account assets 180,209 176,527 2 Debt securities 430,731 406,888 6 Loans and leases 906,683 896,983 1 Allowance for loan and lease losses (11,237 ) (12,234 ) (8 ) All other assets 335,354 324,288 3 Total assets $ 2,187,702 $ 2,144,287 2 Liabilities Deposits $ 1,260,934 $ 1,197,259 5 Federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase 170,291 174,291 (2 ) Trading account liabilities 63,031 66,963 (6 ) Short-term borrowings 23,944 28,098 (15 ) Long-term debt 216,823 236,764 (8 ) All other liabilities 185,839 184,736 1 Total liabilities 1,920,862 1,888,111 2 Shareholders equity 266,840 256,176 4 Total liabilities and shareholders equity $ 2,187,702 $ 2,144,287 2 Assets At December 31, 2016 , total assets were approximately $2.2 trillion , up $43.4 billion from December 31, 2015 . The increase in assets was primarily due to higher debt securities driven by the deployment of deposit inflows, an increase in loans and leases driven by client demand for commercial loans, and higher securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell due to increased customer financing activity. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in cash and cash equivalents as excess cash was deployed. Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents decreased $11.6 billion primarily driven by loan growth, net securities purchases and net debt maturities. Federal Funds Sold and Securities Borrowed or Purchased Under Agreements to Resell Federal funds transactions involve lending reserve balances on a short-term basis. Securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell are collateralized lending transactions utilized to accommodate customer transactions, earn interest rate spreads, and obtain securities for settlement and for collateral. Federal funds sold and securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell increased $5.7 billion due to a higher level of customer financing activity. Trading Account Assets Trading account assets consist primarily of long positions in equity and fixed-income securities including U.S. government and agency securities, corporate securities and non-U.S. sovereign debt. Trading account assets increased $3.7 billion primarily driven by client demand within Global Markets . Debt Securities Debt securities primarily include U.S. Treasury and agency securities, mortgage-backed securities (MBS), principally agency MBS, non-U.S. bonds, corporate bonds and municipal debt. We use the debt securities portfolio primarily to manage interest rate and liquidity risk and to take advantage of market conditions that create economically attractive returns on these investments. Debt securities increased $23.8 billion primarily driven by the deployment of deposit inflows. For more information on debt securities, see Note 3 Securities to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Loans and Leases Loans and leases increased $9.7 billion compared to December 31, 2015 . The increase consisted of $18.9 billion in net loan growth driven by strong client demand for commercial loans, partially offset by $9.2 billion in non-U.S. credit card loans that were reclassified from loans and leases to assets of business held for sale, which is included in all other assets in the table above. For more information on the loan portfolio, see Credit Risk Management on page 55 . Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses The allowance for loan and lease losses decreased $1.0 billion primarily due to the impact of improvements in credit quality from a stronger economy. For additional information, see Allowance for Credit Losses on page 75 . 24 Bank of America 2016 All Other Assets All other assets increased $11.1 billion driven by the reclassification of $10.7 billion in assets related to our non-U.S. credit card business primarily from loans and leases and debt securities to assets of business held for sale, which is included in all other assets in Table 6 . Liabilities At December 31, 2016 , total liabilities were approximately $1.9 trillion , up $32.8 billion from December 31, 2015 , primarily due to an increase in deposits, partially offset by a decrease in long-term debt. Deposits Deposits increased $63.7 billion primarily due to an increase in retail deposits. Federal Funds Purchased and Securities Loaned or Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase Federal funds transactions involve borrowing reserve balances on a short-term basis. Securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase are collateralized borrowing transactions utilized to accommodate customer transactions, earn interest rate spreads and finance assets on the balance sheet. Federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase decreased $4.0 billion primarily due to a decrease in repurchase agreements. Trading Account Liabilities Trading account liabilities consist primarily of short positions in equity and fixed-income securities including U.S. Treasury and agency securities, corporate securities and non-U.S. sovereign debt. Trading account liabilities decreased $3.9 billion primarily due to lower levels of short U.S. Treasury positions driven by less client demand within Global Markets . Short-term Borrowings Short-term borrowings provide an additional funding source and primarily consist of Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) short-term borrowings, notes payable and various other borrowings that generally have maturities of one year or less. Short-term borrowings decreased $4.2 billion primarily due to a decrease in short-term bank notes, partially offset by an increase in short-term FHLB Advances. For more information on short-term borrowings, see Note 10 Federal Funds Sold or Purchased, Securities Financing Agreements and Short-term Borrowings to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Long-term Debt Long-term debt decreased $19.9 billion primarily driven by maturities and redemptions outpacing issuances. For more information on long-term debt, see Note 11 Long-term Debt to the Consolidated Financial Statements . All Other Liabilities All other liabilities increased $1.1 billion due to an increase in derivative liabilities. Shareholders Equity Shareholders equity increased $10.7 billion driven by earnings and preferred stock issuances, partially offset by returns of capital to shareholders of $9.4 billion through common and preferred stock dividends and share repurchases, as well as a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income (OCI) primarily due to an increase in unrealized losses on available-for-sale (AFS) debt securities as a result of higher interest rates. Cash Flows Overview The Corporation operating assets and liabilities support our global markets and lending activities. We believe that cash flows from operations, available cash balances and our ability to generate cash through short- and long-term debt are sufficient to fund our operating liquidity needs. Our investing activities primarily include the debt securities portfolio and loans and leases. Our financing activities reflect cash flows primarily related to customer deposits, securities financing agreements and long-term debt. For additional information on liquidity, see Liquidity Risk on page 51 .

Supplemental Financial Data In this Form 10-K, we present certain non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures exclude certain items or otherwise include components that differ from the most directly comparable measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures are provided as additional useful information to assess our financial condition, results of operations (including period-to-period operating performance) or compliance with prospective regulatory requirements. These non-GAAP financial measures are not intended as a substitute for GAAP financial measures and may not be defined or calculated the same way as non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. We view net interest income and related ratios and analyses on an fully taxable-equivalent (FTE) basis, which when presented on a consolidated basis, are non-GAAP financial measures. To derive the FTE basis, net interest income is adjusted to reflect tax-exempt income on an equivalent before-tax basis with a corresponding increase in income tax expense. For purposes of this calculation, we use the federal statutory tax rate of 35 percent and a representative state tax rate. In addition, certain performance measures including the efficiency ratio and net interest yield utilize net interest income (and thus total revenue) on an FTE basis. The efficiency ratio measures the costs expended to generate a dollar of revenue, and net interest yield measures the bps we earn over the cost of funds. We believe that presentation of these items on an FTE basis allows for comparison of amounts from both taxable and tax-exempt sources and is consistent with industry practices. We may present certain key performance indicators and ratios excluding certain items (e.g., DVA) which result in non-GAAP Bank of America 2016 27 financial measures. We believe that the presentation of measures that exclude these items are useful because they provide additional information to assess the underlying operational performance and trends of our businesses and to allow better comparison of period-to-period operating performance. We also evaluate our business based on certain ratios that utilize tangible equity, a non-GAAP financial measure. Tangible equity represents an adjusted shareholders equity or common shareholders equity amount which has been reduced by goodwill and certain acquired intangible assets (excluding MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. These measures are used to evaluate our use of equity. In addition, profitability, relationship and investment models use both return on average tangible common shareholders equity and return on average tangible shareholders equity as key measures to support our overall growth goals. These ratios are as follows: Return on average tangible common shareholders equity measures our earnings contribution as a percentage of adjusted common shareholders equity. The tangible common equity ratio represents adjusted ending common shareholders equity divided by total assets less goodwill and certain acquired intangible assets (excluding MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. Return on average tangible shareholders equity measures our earnings contribution as a percentage of adjusted average total shareholders equity. The tangible equity ratio represents adjusted ending shareholders equity divided by total assets less goodwill and certain acquired intangible assets (excluding MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. Tangible book value per common share represents adjusted ending common shareholders equity divided by ending common shares outstanding. We believe that the use of ratios that utilize tangible equity provides additional useful information because they present measures of those assets that can generate income. Tangible book value per share provides additional useful information about the level of tangible assets in relation to outstanding shares of common stock. The aforementioned supplemental data and performance measures are presented in Table 7 and Statistical Table XII. Statistical Tables XV and XVI on pages 108 and 109 provide reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures.

The primary activities, products and businesses of the business segments and All Other are shown below. We periodically review capital allocated to our businesses and allocate capital annually during the strategic and capital planning processes. We utilize a methodology that considers the effect of regulatory capital requirements in addition to internal risk-based capital models. Our internal risk-based capital models use a risk-adjusted methodology incorporating each segment credit, market, interest rate, business and operational risk components. For more information on the nature of these risks, see Managing Risk on page 41 . The capital allocated to the business segments is referred to as allocated capital. For purposes of goodwill impairment testing, we utilize allocated equity as a proxy for the carrying value of our reporting units. Allocated equity in the reporting units is comprised of allocated capital plus capital for the portion of goodwill and intangibles specifically assigned to the reporting unit. For additional information, see Note 8 Goodwill and Intangible Assets to the Consolidated Financial Statements .

As a result, total earning assets and total assets of the businesses may not equal total Consumer Banking . Consumer Banking, which is comprised of Deposits and Consumer Lending, offers a diversified range of credit, banking and investment products and services to consumers and small businesses . Our customers and clients have access to a coast to coast network including financial centers in 33 states and the District of Columbia . Our network includes approximately 4,600 financial centers, 15,900 ATMs, nationwide call centers, and online and mobile platforms . Consumer Banking Results Net income for Consumer Banking increased $524 million to $7.2 billion in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily driven by lower noninterest expense and higher revenue, partially offset by higher provision for credit losses. Net interest income increased $862 million to $21.3 billion primarily due to the beneficial impact of an increase in investable assets as a result of higher deposits. Noninterest income decreased $656 million to $10.4 billion due to lower mortgage banking income and gains in 2015 on certain divestitures. The provision for credit losses increased $369 million to $2.7 billion in 2016 primarily driven by a slower pace of improvement in the credit card portfolio. Noninterest expense decreased $1.1 billion to $17.7 billion driven by improved operating efficiencies and lower fraud costs, partially offset by higher FDIC expense. The return on average allocated capital was 21 percent, up from 20 percent, reflecting higher net income. For additional information on capital allocations, see Business Segment Operations on page 29 . Deposits Deposits includes the results of consumer deposit activities which consist of a comprehensive range of products provided to consumers and small businesses. Our deposit products include traditional savings accounts, money market savings accounts, CDs and IRAs, noninterest- and interest-bearing checking accounts, as well as investment accounts and products . The revenue is allocated to the deposit products using our funds transfer pricing process that matches assets and liabilities with similar interest rate sensitivity and maturity characteristics. Deposits generates fees such as account service fees, non-sufficient funds fees, overdraft charges and ATM fees, as well as investment and brokerage fees from Merrill Edge accounts. Merrill Edge is an integrated investing and banking service targeted at customers with less than $250,000 in investable assets. Merrill Edge provides investment advice and guidance, client brokerage asset services, a self-directed online investing platform and key banking capabilities including access to the Corporation network of financial centers and ATMs. 30 Bank of America 2016 Deposits includes the net impact of migrating customers and their related deposit and brokerage asset balances between Deposits and GWIM as well as other client-managed businesses. For more information on the migration of customer balances to or from GWIM , see GWIM - Net Migration Summary on page 34 . Net income for Deposits increased $758 million to $3.4 billion in 2016 driven by higher revenue and lower noninterest expense. Net interest income increased $1.1 billion to $10.7 billion primarily due to the beneficial impact of an increase in investable assets as a result of higher deposits. Noninterest income decreased $41 million to $4.6 billion due to gains in the prior year on certain divestitures. The provision for credit losses decreased $26 million to $174 million . Noninterest expense decreased $178 million to $9.7 billion primarily driven by improved operating efficiencies, partially offset by higher FDIC expense. Average deposits increased $47.7 billion to $592.4 billion in 2016 driven by a continuing customer shift to more liquid products in the low rate environment. Growth in checking, traditional savings and money market savings of $53.8 billion was partially offset by a decline in time deposits of $6.1 billion. As a result of our continued pricing discipline and the shift in the mix of deposits, the rate paid on average deposits declined by one bp to four bps. Key Statistics Deposits 2016 2015 Total deposit spreads (excludes noninterest costs) (1) 1.65 % 1.62 % Year end Client brokerage assets (in millions) $ 144,696 $ 122,721 Online banking active accounts (units in thousands) 33,811 31,674 Mobile banking active users (units in thousands) 21,648 18,705 Financial centers 4,579 4,726 ATMs 15,928 16,038 (1) Includes deposits held in Consumer Lending. Client brokerage assets increased $22.0 billion in 2016 driven by client flows and strong market performance. Mobile banking active users increased 2.9 million reflecting continuing changes in our customers banking preferences. The number of financial centers declined 147 driven by changes in customer preferences to self-service options as we continue to optimize our consumer banking network and improve our cost-to-serve. Consumer Lending Consumer Lending offers products to consumers and small businesses across the U.S. The products offered include credit and debit cards, residential mortgages and home equity loans, and direct and indirect loans such as automotive, recreational vehicle and consumer personal loans. In addition to earning net interest spread revenue on its lending activities, Consumer Lending generates interchange revenue from credit and debit card transactions, late fees, cash advance fees, annual credit card fees, mortgage banking fee income and other miscellaneous fees. Consumer Lending products are available to our customers through our retail network, direct telephone, and online and mobile channels. Consumer Lending results also include the impact of servicing residential mortgages and home equity loans in the core portfolio, including loans held on the balance sheet of Consumer Lending and loans serviced for others. We classify consumer real estate loans as core or non-core based on loan and customer characteristics such as origination date, product type, loan-to-value (LTV), Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) score and delinquency status. Total owned loans in the core portfolio held in Consumer Lending increased $10.6 billion to $101.2 billion in 2016 primarily driven by higher residential mortgage balances, partially offset by a decline in home equity balances. For more information on the core and non-core portfolios, see Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management on page 56 . Consumer Lending includes the net impact of migrating customers and their related loan balances between Consumer Lending and GWIM . For more information on the migration of customer balances to or from GWIM , see GWIM on page 33 . Net income for Consumer Lending decreased $234 million to $3.8 billion in 2016 driven by a decline in revenue and higher provision for credit losses, partially offset by lower noninterest expense. Net interest income decreased $204 million to $10.6 billion primarily driven by higher funding costs, partially offset by the impact of an increase in consumer auto lending balances. Noninterest income decreased $615 million to $5.9 billion driven by lower mortgage banking income and gains in 2015 on certain divestitures. The provision for credit losses increased $395 million to $2.5 billion in 2016 primarily driven by a slower pace of improvement in the credit card portfolio. Noninterest expense decreased $885 million to $8.0 billion primarily driven by improved operating efficiencies and lower fraud costs due to the benefit of the Europay, MasterCard and Visa (EMV) chip implementation, as well as lower personnel expense. Average loans increased $13.3 billion to $241.0 billion in 2016 primarily driven by increases in residential mortgages and consumer vehicle loans, partially offset by lower home equity loans.

During 2016 , the total U.S. credit card risk-adjusted margin decreased 27 bps primarily driven by the impact of gains in 2015 on certain divestitures and a decrease in net interest margin, partially offset by an improvement in credit quality in the U.S. Card portfolio. Total U.S. credit card purchase volumes increased $5.1 billion to $226.4 billion and debit card purchase volumes increased $7.9 billion to $285.6 billion , reflecting higher levels of consumer spending. The increase in total U.S. credit card purchase volumes was partially offset by the impact of certain divestitures. Mortgage Banking Income Mortgage banking income is earned primarily in Consumer Banking and All Other . Total production income within mortgage banking income is comprised primarily of revenue from the fair value gains and losses recognized on our interest rate lock commitments (IRLCs) and loans held-for-sale (LHFS), the related secondary market execution, and costs related to representations and warranties made in the sales transactions along with other obligations incurred in the sales of mortgage loans. Servicing Bank of America 2016 31 income within mortgage banking income includes income earned in connection with servicing activities and MSR valuation adjustments, net of results from risk management activities used to hedge certain market risks of the MSRs. Servicing income for the core portfolio is recorded in Consumer Banking . Servicing income for the non-core portfolio, including hedge ineffectiveness on MSR hedges, is recorded in All Other . The costs associated with our servicing activities are included in noninterest expense. The table below summarizes the components of mortgage banking income. Amounts for mortgage banking income in All Other are included in this Consumer Banking table to show the components of consolidated mortgage banking income.

For additional information, see Note 23 Mortgage Servicing Rights to the Consolidated Financial Statements . (3) Includes $ 889 million and $ 1.0 billion of mortgage banking income recorded in All Other for 2016 and 2015 . Total production income for Consumer Banking decreased $287 million to $663 million in 2016 due to a decrease in production volume to be sold, resulting from a decision to retain certain residential mortgage loans in Consumer Banking . Servicing The costs associated with servicing activities related to the residential mortgage and home equity loan portfolios, including owned loans and loans serviced for others (collectively, the mortgage serviced portfolio) are allocated to the business segment that owns the loans or MSRs or All Other . Servicing activities include collecting cash for principal, interest and escrow payments from borrowers, disbursing customer draws for lines of credit, accounting for and remitting principal and interest payments to investors and escrow payments to third parties, and responding to customer inquiries. Our home retention efforts, including single point of contact resources, are also part of our servicing activities, along with supervision of foreclosures and property dispositions. Prior to foreclosure, we evaluate various workout options in an effort to help our customers avoid foreclosure. Consumer Banking ervicing income decreased $85 million to $297 million in 2016 driven by lower servicing fees, partially offset by lower amortization of expected cash flows due to a smaller servicing portfolio. Servicing fees declined $147 million to $708 million in 2016 reflecting the decline in the size of the servicing portfolio. Mortgage Servicing Rights At December 31, 2016 , the core MSR portfolio, held within Consumer Lending, was $2.1 billion compared to $2.3 billion at December 31, 2015 . The decrease was primarily driven by the amortization of expected cash flows, which exceeded new additions, as well as changes in fair value due to changes in inputs and assumptions. For more information on MSRs, see Note 23 Mortgage Servicing Rights to the Consolidated Financial Statements .

(2) In addition to loan production in Consumer Banking , there is also first mortgage and home equity loan production in GWIM. First mortgage loan originations in Consumer Banking and for the total Corporation increased $3.6 billion and $7.2 billion in 2016 compared to 2015 driven by improving housing trends and a lower rate environment. Home equity production for the total Corporation increased $2.2 billion in 2016 compared to 2015 due to a higher demand in the market based on improving housing trends, as well as improved financial center engagement with customers and more competitive pricing. 32 Bank of America 2016 Global Wealth & Investment Management (Dollars in millions) 2016 2015 % Change Net interest income (FTE basis) $ 5,759 $ 5,527 4 % Noninterest income: Investment and brokerage services 10,316 10,792 (4 ) All other income 1,575 1,715 (8 ) Total noninterest income 11,891 12,507 (5 ) Total revenue, net of interest expense (FTE basis) 17,650 18,034 (2 ) Provision for credit losses 68 51 33 Noninterest expense 13,182 13,943 (5 ) Income before income taxes (FTE basis) 4,400 4,040 9 Income tax expense (FTE basis) 1,629 1,473 11 Net income $ 2,771 $ 2,567 8 Net interest yield (FTE basis) 2.09 % 2.13 % Return on average allocated capital 21 21 Efficiency ratio (FTE basis) 74.68 77.32 Balance Sheet Average Total loans and leases $ 142,429 $ 132,499 7 Total earning assets 275,800 259,020 6 Total assets 291,479 275,950 6 Total deposits 256,425 244,725 5 Allocated capital 13,000 12,000 8 Year end Total loans and leases $ 148,179 $ 139,039 7 Total earning assets 283,152 279,597 1 Total assets 298,932 296,271 1 Total deposits 262,530 260,893 1 GWIM consists of two primary businesses: Merrill Lynch Global Wealth Management (MLGWM) and U.S. Trust, Bank of America Private Wealth Management (U.S. Trust). MLGWM advisory business provides a high-touch client experience through a network of financial advisors focused on clients with over $250,000 in total investable assets . MLGWM provides tailored solutions to meet our clients needs through a full set of investment management, brokerage, banking and retirement products. U.S. Trust, together with MLGWM Private Banking & Investments Group, provides comprehensive wealth management solutions targeted to high net worth and ultra high net worth clients, as well as customized solutions to meet clients wealth structuring, investment management, trust and banking needs, including specialty asset management services. Client assets managed under advisory and/or discretion of GWIM are AUM and are typically held in diversified portfolios. The majority of client AUM have an investment strategy with a duration of greater than one year and are, therefore, considered long-term AUM. Fees earned on long-term AUM are calculated as a percentage of total AUM. The asset management fees charged to clients per year are dependent on various factors, but are generally driven by the breadth of the client relationship and generally range from 50 to 150 bps on their total AUM. The net client long-term AUM flows represent the net change in clients long-term AUM balances over a specified period of time, excluding market appreciation/depreciation and other adjustments. Client assets under advisory and/or discretion of GWIM in which the investment strategy seeks current income, while maintaining liquidity and capital preservation, are considered liquidity AUM. The duration of these strategies is primarily less than one year. The change in AUM balances from the prior year is primarily the net client flows for liquidity AUM. Net income for GWIM increased $204 million to $2.8 billion in 2016 compared to 2015 driven by a decrease in noninterest expense, partially offset by a decrease in revenue. Net interest income increased $232 million to $5.8 billion driven by the impact of growth in loan and deposit balances. Noninterest income, which primarily includes investment and brokerage services income, decreased $616 million to $11.9 billion . The decline in noninterest income was driven by lower transactional revenue and decreased asset management fees primarily due to lower market valuations in 2016 , partially offset by the impact of long-term AUM flows. Noninterest expense decreased $761 million to $13.2 billion primarily due to the expiration of advisor retention awards, lower revenue-related incentives and lower operating and support costs, partially offset by higher FDIC expense. Return on average allocated capital was 21 percent for both 2016 and 2015 .

(3) Includes financial advisors in the Consumer Banking segment of 2,201 and 2,187 at December 31, 2016 and 2015 . (4) Associate headcount computation is based upon full-time equivalents. (5) Financial advisor productivity is defined as MLGWM total revenue, excluding the allocation of certain asset and liability management (ALM) activities, divided by the total number of financial advisors (excluding financial advisors in the Consumer Banking segment). Client balances increased $50.5 billion , or two percent , to more than $2.5 trillion at December 31, 2016 , driven by market valuation increases and positive net flows, partially offset by the impact of the sale of BofA Global Capital Management's AUM. The number of wealth advisors increased one percent , due to continued investment in the advisor development programs, competitive recruiting and near historically low advisor attrition levels. In 2016 , revenue from MLGWM of $14.5 billion was down three percent driven by a decline in noninterest income due to lower transactional revenue and asset management fees primarily related to lower market valuations, partially offset by the impact of long-term AUM flows. Net interest income was up, primarily driven by growth in loan and deposit balances. U.S. Trust revenue of $3.1 billion was up one percent primarily driven by higher net interest income due to higher loan and deposit balances. Net Migration Summary GWIM results are impacted by the net migration of clients and their corresponding deposit, loan and brokerage balances primarily to or from Consumer Banking, as presented in the table below. Migrations result from the movement of clients between business segments to better align with client needs.

Our lending products and services include commercial loans, leases, commitment facilities, trade finance, real estate lending and asset-based lending . Our treasury solutions business includes treasury management, foreign exchange and short-term investing options . We also provide investment banking products to our clients such as debt and equity underwriting and distribution, and merger-related and other advisory services . Underwriting debt and equity issuances, fixed-income and equity research, and certain market-based activities are executed through our global broker-dealer affiliates which are our primary dealers in several countries. Within Global Banking, Global Commercial Banking clients generally include middle-market companies, commercial real estate firms and not-for-profit companies . Global Corporate Banking clients generally include large global corporations, financial institutions and leasing clients . Business Banking clients include mid-sized U.S.-based businesses requiring customized and integrated financial advice and solutions . Net income for Global Banking increased $380 million to $5.7 billion in 2016 compared to 2015 as higher revenue more than offset an increase in the provision for credit losses. Revenue increased $809 million to $18.4 billion in 2016 compared to 2015 driven by higher net interest income, which increased $698 million to $9.9 billion driven by the impact of growth in loans and leases and higher deposits. Noninterest income increased $111 million to $8.5 billion primarily due to the impact from loans and the related loan hedging activities in the fair value option portfolio and higher treasury-related revenues, partially offset by lower investment banking fees. The provision for credit losses increased $197 million to $883 million in 2016 driven by increases in energy-related reserves as well as loan growth. For additional information, see Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management Industry Concentrations on page 71 . Noninterest expense of $8.5 billion remained relatively unchanged in 2016 as investments in client-facing professionals in Commercial and Business Banking, higher severance costs and an increase in FDIC expense were largely offset by lower operating and support costs. The return on average allocated capital remained unchanged at 15 percent , as higher net income was partially offset by an increased capital allocation. For more information on capital allocated to the business segments, see Business Segment Operations on page 29 . Bank of America 2016 35 Global Corporate, Global Commercial and Business Banking Global Corporate, Global Commercial and Business Banking each include Business Lending and Global Transaction Services activities.

Global Transaction Services revenue increased $294 million in 2016 compared to 2015 driven by growth in treasury-related revenue as well as higher net interest income driven by the beneficial impact of an increase in investable assets as a result of higher deposits. Average loans and leases increased 10 percent in 2016 compared to 2015 driven by growth in the commercial and industrial, and leasing portfolios. Average deposits increased three percent due to continued portfolio growth with new and existing clients. Global Investment Banking Client teams and product specialists underwrite and distribute debt, equity and loan products, and provide advisory services and tailored risk management solutions. The economics of certain investment banking and underwriting activities are shared primarily between Global Banking and Global Markets under an internal revenue-sharing arrangement. To provide a complete discussion of our consolidated investment banking fees, the following table presents total Corporation investment banking fees and the portion attributable to Global Banking. Investment Banking Fees Global Banking Total Corporation (Dollars in millions) 2016 2015 2016 2015 Products Advisory $ 1,156 $ 1,354 $ 1,269 $ 1,503 Debt issuance 1,407 1,296 3,276 3,033 Equity issuance 321 460 864 1,236 Gross investment banking fees 2,884 3,110 5,409 5,772 Self-led deals (49 ) (57 ) (168 ) (200 ) Total investment banking fees $ 2,835 $ 3,053 $ 5,241 $ 5,572 Total Corporation investment banking fees of $5.2 billion , excluding self-led deals, included within Global Banking and Global Markets, decreased six percent in 2016 compared to 2015 driven by lower equity issuance fees and advisory fees due to a decline in market fee pools . 36 Bank of America 2016 Global Markets (Dollars in millions) 2016 2015 % Change Net interest income (FTE basis) $ 4,558 $ 4,191 9 % Noninterest income: Investment and brokerage services 2,102 2,221 (5 ) Investment banking fees 2,296 2,401 (4 ) Trading account profits 6,550 6,109 7 All other income 584 91 n/m Total noninterest income 11,532 10,822 7 Total revenue, net of interest expense (FTE basis) 16,090 15,013 7 Provision for credit losses 31 99 (69 ) Noninterest expense 10,170 11,374 (11 ) Income before income taxes (FTE basis) 5,889 3,540 66 Income tax expense (FTE basis) 2,072 1,117 85 Net income $ 3,817 $ 2,423 58 Return on average allocated capital 10 % 7 % Efficiency ratio (FTE basis) 63.21 75.75 Balance Sheet Average Trading-related assets: Trading account securities $ 185,135 $ 195,650 (5 ) Reverse repurchases 89,715 103,506 (13 ) Securities borrowed 87,286 79,494 10 Derivative assets 50,769 54,519 (7 ) Total trading-related assets (1) 412,905 433,169 (5 ) Total loans and leases 69,641 63,443 10 Total earning assets (1) 423,579 430,468 (2 ) Total assets 585,342 594,057 (1 ) Total deposits 34,250 38,074 (10 ) Allocated capital 37,000 35,000 6 Year end Total trading-related assets (1) $ 380,562 $ 373,926 2 Total loans and leases 72,743 73,208 (1 ) Total earning assets (1) 397,023 384,046 3 Total assets 566,060 548,790 3 Total deposits 34,927 37,038 (6 ) (1) Trading-related assets include derivative assets, which are considered non-earning assets. n/m = not meaningful Global Markets offers sales and trading services, including research, to institutional clients across fixed-income, credit, currency, commodity and equity businesses . Global Markets product coverage includes securities and derivative products in both the primary and secondary markets . Global Markets provides market-making, financing, securities clearing, settlement and custody services globally to our institutional investor clients in support of their investing and trading activities. We also work with our commercial and corporate clients to provide risk management products using interest rate, equity, credit, currency and commodity derivatives, foreign exchange, fixed-income and mortgage-related products . As a result of our market-making activities in these products, we may be required to manage risk in a broad range of financial products including government securities, equity and equity-linked securities, high-grade and high-yield corporate debt securities , syndicated loans, MBS, commodities and asset-backed securities (ABS). The economics of certain investment banking and underwriting activities are shared primarily between Global Markets and Global Banking under an internal revenue-sharing arrangement . Global Banking originates certain deal-related transactions with our corporate and commercial clients that are executed and distributed by Global Markets . For information on investment banking fees on a consolidated basis, see page 36 . Net income for Global Markets increased $1.4 billion to $3.8 billion in 2016 compared to 2015 . Net DVA losses were $238 million compared to losses of $786 million in 2015 . Excluding net DVA, net income increased $1.1 billion to $4.0 billion in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily driven by higher sales and trading revenue and lower noninterest expense, partially offset by lower investment banking fees and investment and brokerage services revenue. Sales and trading revenue, excluding net DVA, increased $638 million primarily due to a stronger performance globally across credit products led by mortgages and continued strength in rates products. The increase was partially offset by challenging credit market conditions in early 2016 as well as reduced client activity in equities, most notably in Asia, and a less favorable trading environment for equity derivatives. Noninterest expense decreased $1.2 billion to $10.2 billion primarily due to lower litigation expense and lower revenue-related expenses. Bank of America 2016 37 Average earning assets decreased $6.9 billion to $423.6 billion in 2016 primarily driven by a decrease in match book financing activity and a reduction in trading inventory, partially offset by higher loans and other customer financing. Year-end trading-related assets increased $6.6 billion in 2016 primarily driven by higher securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell due to increased customer financing activity as well as higher trading account assets due to client demand. The return on average allocated capital was 10 percent , up from seven percent , reflecting an increase in net income, partially offset by an increase in allocated capital. Sales and Trading Revenue Sales and trading revenue includes unrealized and realized gains and losses on trading and other assets, net interest income, and fees primarily from commissions on equity securities. Sales and trading revenue is segregated into fixed-income (government debt obligations, investment and non-investment grade corporate debt obligations, commercial MBS, residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS), collateralized loan obligations (CLOs), interest rate and credit derivative contracts), currencies (interest rate and foreign exchange contracts), commodities (primarily futures, forwards, swaps and options) and equities (equity-linked derivatives and cash equity activity). The following table and related discussion present sales and trading revenue, substantially all of which is in Global Markets, with the remainder in Global Banking . In addition, the following table and related discussion present sales and trading revenue excluding the impact of net DVA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. We believe the use of this non-GAAP financial measure provides additional useful information to assess the underlying performance of these businesses and to allow better comparison of period-to-period operating performance. Sales and Trading Revenue (1, 2) (Dollars in millions) 2016 2015 Sales and trading revenue Fixed-income, currencies and commodities $ 9,373 $ 7,869 Equities 4,017 4,335 Total sales and trading revenue $ 13,390 $ 12,204 Sales and trading revenue, excluding net DVA (3) Fixed-income, currencies and commodities $ 9,611 $ 8,632 Equities 4,017 4,358 Total sales and trading revenue, excluding net DVA $ 13,628 $ 12,990 (1) Includes FTE adjustments of $184 million and $182 million for 2016 and 2015 . For more information on sales and trading revenue, see Note 2 Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements . (2) Includes Global Banking sales and trading revenue of $406 million and $424 million for 2016 and 2015 . (3) Fixed-income, currencies and commodities (FICC) and Equities sales and trading revenue, excluding net DVA, is a non-GAAP financial measure. FICC net DVA losses were $238 million for 2016 compared to net DVA losses of $763 million in 2015 . Equities net DVA losses were $0 for 2016 compared to net DVA losses of $23 million in 2015 . The explanations for period-over-period changes in sales and trading, FICC and Equities revenue, as set forth below, would be the same if net DVA was included. FICC revenue, excluding net DVA, increased $979 million as rates products improved on increased customer flow, and mortgages recorded strong results. This was partially offset by a weaker performance in commodities, as lower volatility dampened client activity. Equities revenue, excluding net DVA, decreased $341 million to $4.0 billion primarily driven by lower levels of client activity, primarily in Asia, which benefited in 2015 from increased market volumes relating to stock markets rallies in the region, as well as weaker trading performance in derivatives. For more information on sales and trading revenue, see Note 2 Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements . 38 Bank of America 2016 All Other (Dollars in millions) 2016 2015 % Change Net interest income (FTE basis) $ 447 $ 457 (2 )% Noninterest income: Card income 189 260 (27 ) Mortgage banking income 889 1,022 (13 ) Gains on sales of debt securities 490 1,126 (56 ) All other loss (1,315 ) (1,204 ) 9 Total noninterest income 253 1,204 (79 ) Total revenue, net of interest expense (FTE basis) 700 1,661 (58 ) Provision for credit losses (100 ) (21 ) n/m Noninterest expense 5,460 5,220 5 Loss before income taxes (FTE basis) (4,660 ) (3,538 ) 32 Income tax benefit (FTE basis) (3,085 ) (2,395 ) 29 Net loss $ (1,575 ) $ (1,143 ) 38 Balance Sheet (1) Average Total loans and leases $ 108,735 $ 144,506 (25 ) Total deposits 28,131 25,452 11 Year end Total loans and leases (2) $ 96,713 $ 122,198 (21 ) Total deposits 24,257 25,334 (4 ) (1) In segments where the total of liabilities and equity exceeds assets, which are generally deposit-taking segments, we allocate assets from All Other to those segments to match liabilities (i.e., deposits) and allocated shareholders equity. Such allocated assets were $500.0 billion and $463.4 billion for 2016 and 2015 , and $518.7 billion and $489.0 billion at December 31, 2016 and 2015 . (2) Includes $9.2 billion of non-U.S. credit card loans, which are included in assets of business held for sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. n/m = not meaningful All Other consists of ALM activities , equity investments, the non-U.S. consumer credit card business, non-core mortgage loans and servicing activities, the net impact of periodic revisions to the MSR valuation model for both core and non-core MSRs, other liquidating businesses, residual expense allocations and other. ALM activities encompass certain residential mortgages, debt securities, interest rate and foreign currency risk management activities, the impact of certain allocation methodologies and accounting hedge ineffectiveness . The results of certain ALM activities are allocated to our business segments. For more information on our ALM activities, see Note 24 Business Segment Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Equity investments include our merchant services joint venture as well as Global Principal Investments (GPI) which is comprised of a portfolio of equity, real estate and other alternative investments. For more information on our merchant services joint venture, see Note 12 Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements . On December 20, 2016, we entered into an agreement to sell our non-U.S. consumer credit card business to a third party. Subject to regulatory approval, this transaction is expected to close by mid-2017. For more information on the sale of our non-U.S. consumer credit card business, see Recent Events on page 21 and Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements . The Corporation classifies consumer real estate loans as core or non-core based on loan and customer characteristics such as origination date, product type, LTV, FICO score and delinquency status. Residential mortgage loans that are held for interest rate or liquidity risk management purposes are presented on the balance sheet of All Other . For more information on our interest rate and liquidity risk management activities, see Liquidity Risk on page 51 and Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book on page 84 . During 2016 , residential mortgage loans held for ALM activities decreased $8.5 billion to $34.7 billion at December 31, 2016 primarily as a result of payoffs, paydowns and loan sales outpacing new volume. Non-core residential mortgage and home equity loans, which are principally run-off portfolios, including certain loans accounted for under the fair value option and MSRs pertaining to non-core loans serviced for others, are also held in All Other . During 2016 , total non-core loans decreased $15.7 billion to $53.1 billion at December 31, 2016 due largely to payoffs and paydowns, as well as loan sales. The net loss for All Other increased $432 million to $1.6 billion in 2016 primarily due to lower gains on the sale of debt securities, lower mortgage banking income, lower gains on sales of consumer real estate loans and an increase in noninterest expense, partially offset by an improvement in the provision for credit losses and a decrease of $174 million in PPI costs. Mortgage banking income decreased $133 million primarily due to higher representations and warranties provision, partially offset by more favorable MSR results, net of the related hedge performance, which includes a net $306 million increase in MSR fair value due to a revision of certain MSR valuation assumptions. Gains on the sales of loans, including nonperforming and other delinquent loans were $232 million compared to gains of $1.0 billion in 2015. The benefit in the provision for credit losses improved $79 million to a benefit of $100 million in 2016 primarily driven by lower loan and lease balances from continued run-off of non-core consumer real estate loans. Noninterest expense increased $240 million to $5.5 billion driven by litigation expense. The income tax benefit was $3.1 billion in 2016 compared to a benefit of $2.4 billion in 2015 with the increase driven by the Bank of America 2016 39 change in the pretax loss and net tax benefits related to various tax audit matters , partially offset by a $348 million tax charge in 2016 related to the change in the U.K. corporate tax rate compared to a $290 million charge in 2015. Both periods include income tax benefit adjustments to eliminate the FTE treatment of certain tax credits recorded in Global Banking . Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations We have contractual obligations to make future payments on debt and lease agreements. Additionally, in the normal course of business, we enter into contractual arrangements whereby we commit to future purchases of products or services from unaffiliated parties. Purchase obligations are defined as obligations that are legally binding agreements whereby we agree to purchase products or services with a specific minimum quantity at a fixed, minimum or variable price over a specified period of time. Included in purchase obligations are vendor contracts, the most significant of which include communication services, processing services and software contracts. Debt, lease and other obligations are more fully discussed in Note 11 Long-term Debt and Note 12 Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Other long-term liabilities include our contractual funding obligations related to the Qualified Pension Plan, Non-U.S. Pension Plans, Nonqualified and Other Pension Plans, and Postretirement Health and Life Plans (collectively, the Plans). Obligations to the Plans are based on the current and projected obligations of the Plans, performance of the Plans assets, and any participant contributions, if applicable. During 2016 and 2015 , we contributed $256 million and $234 million to the Plans, and we expect to make $215 million of contributions during 2017 . The Plans are more fully discussed in Note 17 Employee Benefit Plans to the Consolidated Financial Statements . We enter into commitments to extend credit such as loan commitments, standby letters of credit (SBLCs) and commercial letters of credit to meet the financing needs of our customers. For a summary of the total unfunded, or off-balance sheet, credit extension commitment amounts by expiration date, see Credit Extension Commitments in Note 12 Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Table 9 includes certain contractual obligations at December 31, 2016 and 2015 . Table 9 Contractual Obligations December 31, 2016 December 31 2015 (Dollars in millions) Due in One Year or Less Due After One Year Through Three Years Due After Three Years Through Five Years Due After Five Years Total Total Long-term debt $ 43,964 $ 60,106 $ 26,034 $ 86,719 $ 216,823 $ 236,764 Operating lease obligations 2,324 3,877 2,908 4,511 13,620 13,681 Purchase obligations 2,089 2,019 604 1,030 5,742 5,350 Time deposits 65,112 5,961 3,369 502 74,944 73,974 Other long-term liabilities 1,991 837 648 1,091 4,567 4,311 Estimated interest expense on long-term debt and time deposits (1) 4,814 9,852 4,910 19,871 39,447 43,898 Total contractual obligations $ 120,294 $ 82,652 $ 38,473 $ 113,724 $ 355,143 $ 377,978 (1) Represents forecasted net interest expense on long-term debt and time deposits based on interest rates at December 31, 2016 . Forecasts are based on the contractual maturity dates of each liability, and are net of derivative hedges, where applicable. Representations and Warranties We securitize first-lien residential mortgage loans generally in the form of RMBS guaranteed by the government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs), which include Freddie Mac (FHLMC) and Fannie Mae (FNMA), or by the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) in the case of Federal Housing Administration (FHA)-insured, U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)-guaranteed and Rural Housing Service-guaranteed mortgage loans, and sell pools of first-lien residential mortgage loans in the form of whole loans. In addition, in prior years, legacy companies and certain subsidiaries sold pools of first-lien residential mortgage loans and home equity loans as private-label securitizations or in the form of whole loans. In connection with these transactions, we or certain of our subsidiaries or legacy companies made various representations and warranties. Breaches of these representations and warranties have resulted in and may continue to result in the requirement to repurchase mortgage loans or to otherwise make whole or provide other remedies to investors, securitization trusts, guarantors, insurers or other parties (collectively, repurchases). At December 31, 2016 , we had $18.3 billion of unresolved repurchase claims, predominately related to subprime and pay option first-lien loans and home equity loans, compared to $18.4 billion at December 31, 2015 . Outstanding repurchase claims remain unresolved primarily due to (1) the level of detail, support and analysis accompanying such claims, which impact overall claim quality and, therefore, claim resolution and (2) the lack of an established process to resolve disputes related to these claims. In addition to unresolved repurchase claims, we have received notifications from sponsors of third-party securitizations with whom we engaged in whole-loan transactions indicating that we may have indemnity obligations with respect to loans for which we have not received a repurchase request. These outstanding notifications totaled $1.3 billion and $1.4 billion at December 31, 2016 and 2015 . The liability for representations and warranties and corporate guarantees is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the related provision is included in mortgage banking income in the Consolidated 40 Bank of America 2016 Statement of Income. At December 31, 2016 and 2015 , the liability for representations and warranties was $2.3 billion and $11.3 billion . The representations and warranties provision was $106 million for 2016 compared to a benefit of $39 million for 2015. In addition, we currently estimate that the range of possible loss for representations and warranties exposures could be up to $2 billion over existing accruals at December 31, 2016 . The estimated range of possible loss represents a reasonably possible loss, but does not represent a probable loss, and is based on currently available information, significant judgment and a number of assumptions that are subject to change. Future provisions and/or ranges of possible loss associated with obligations under representations and warranties may be significantly impacted if future experiences are different from historical experience or our understandings, interpretations or assumptions. Adverse developments, with respect to one or more of the assumptions underlying the liability for representations and warranties and the corresponding estimated range of possible loss, such as investors or trustees successfully challenging or avoiding the application of the relevant statute of limitations, could result in significant increases to future provisions and/or the estimated range of possible loss. For more information on representations and warranties, see Note 7 Representations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate Guarantees to the Consolidated Financial Statements and, for more information related to the sensitivity of the assumptions used to estimate our liability for representations and warranties, see Complex Accounting Estimates Representations and Warranties Liability on page 90 . Other Mortgage-related Matters We continue to be subject to additional mortgage-related litigation and disputes, as well as governmental and regulatory scrutiny and investigations, related to our past and current origination, servicing, transfer of servicing and servicing rights, servicing compliance obligations, foreclosure activities, indemnification obligations, and mortgage insurance and captive reinsurance practices with mortgage insurers. The ongoing environment of additional regulation, increased regulatory compliance obligations, and enhanced regulatory enforcement, combined with ongoing uncertainty related to the continuing evolution of the regulatory environment, has resulted in increased operational and compliance costs and may limit our ability to continue providing certain products and services. For more information on management estimate of the aggregate range of possible loss for certain litigation matters and on regulatory investigations, see Note 12 Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Managing Risk Overview Risk is inherent in all our business activities. Sound risk management enables us to serve our customers and deliver for our shareholders. If not managed well, risks can result in financial loss, regulatory sanctions and penalties, and damage to our reputation, each of which may adversely impact our ability to execute our business strategies. We take a comprehensive approach to risk management with a defined Risk Framework and an articulated Risk Appetite Statement which are approved annually by the Enterprise Risk Committee (ERC) and the Board. The seven key types of risk faced by the Corporation are strategic, credit, market, liquidity, compliance, operational and reputational risks. Strategic risk is the risk resulting from incorrect assumptions about external or internal factors, inappropriate business plans, ineffective business strategy execution, or failure to respond in a timely manner to changes in the regulatory, macroeconomic or competitive environments. Credit risk is the risk of loss arising from the inability or failure of a borrower or counterparty to meet its obligations. Market risk is the risk that changes in market conditions may adversely impact the value of assets or liabilities, or otherwise negatively impact earnings. Liquidity risk is the inability to meet expected or unexpected cash flow and collateral needs while continuing to support our businesses and customers with the appropriate funding sources under a range of economic conditions. Compliance risk is the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, material financial loss or damage to the reputation of the Corporation arising from the failure of the Corporation to comply with the requirements of applicable laws, rules, regulations and related self-regulatory organizations standards and codes of conduct. Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems, or from external events. Reputational risk is the risk that negative perceptions of the Corporation conduct or business practices may adversely impact its profitability or operations through an inability to establish new or maintain existing customer/client relationships or otherwise adversely impact relationships with key stakeholders, such as investors, regulators, employees and the community. The following sections address in more detail the specific procedures, measures and analyses of the major categories of risk. This discussion of managing risk focuses on the current Risk Framework that, as part of its annual review process, was approved by the ERC and the Board. As set forth in our Risk Framework, a culture of managing risk well is fundamental to our values and operating principles. It requires us to focus on risk in all activities and encourages the necessary mindset and behavior to enable effective risk management, and promotes sound risk-taking within our risk appetite. Sustaining a culture of managing risk well throughout the organization is critical to our success and is a clear expectation of our executive management team and the Board. Our Risk Framework is the foundation for comprehensive management of the risks facing the Corporation. The Risk Framework sets forth clear roles, responsibilities and accountability for the management of risk and provides a blueprint for how the Board, through delegation of authority to committees and executive officers, establishes risk appetite and associated limits for our activities. Executive management assesses, with Board oversight, the risk-adjusted returns of each business. Management reviews and approves the strategic and financial operating plans, as well as the capital plan and Risk Appetite Statement, and recommends them annually to the Board for approval. Our strategic plan takes into consideration return objectives and financial resources, which must align with risk capacity and risk appetite. Management sets financial objectives for each business by allocating capital and setting a target for return on capital for each business. Capital Bank of America 2016 41 allocations and operating limits are regularly evaluated as part of our overall governance processes as the businesses and the economic environment in which we operate continue to evolve. For more information regarding capital allocations, see Business Segment Operations on page 29 . Our Risk Appetite Statement is how we maintain an acceptable risk profile by providing a common framework and a comparable set of measures for senior management and the Board to clearly indicate the level of risk we are willing to accept. Risk appetite is aligned with the strategic, capital and financial operating plans to maintain consistency with our strategy and financial resources. Our line of business strategies and risk appetite are also similarly aligned. For a more detailed discussion of our risk management activities, see the discussion below and pages 44 through 87 . Our overall capacity to take risk is limited; therefore, we prioritize the risks we take in order to maintain a strong and flexible financial position so we can withstand challenging economic conditions and take advantage of organic growth opportunities. Therefore, we set objectives and targets for capital and liquidity that are intended to permit us to continue to operate in a safe and sound manner, including during periods of stress. Our lines of business operate with risk limits (which may include credit, market and/or operational limits, as applicable) that are based on the amount of capital, earnings or liquidity we are willing to put at risk to achieve our strategic objectives and business plans. Executive management is responsible for tracking and reporting performance measurements as well as any exceptions to guidelines or limits. The Board, and its committees when appropriate, oversees financial performance, execution of the strategic and financial operating plans, adherence to risk appetite limits and the adequacy of internal controls. Risk Management Governance The Risk Framework describes delegations of authority whereby the Board and its committees may delegate authority to management-level committees or executive officers. Such delegations may authorize certain decision-making and approval functions, which may be evidenced in, for example, committee charters, job descriptions, meeting minutes and resolutions. The chart below illustrates the inter-relationship among the Board, Board committees and management committees that have the majority of risk oversight responsibilities for the Corporation. (1) This presentation does not include committees for other legal entities. (2) Reports to the CEO and CFO with oversight by the Audit Committee. Board of Directors and Board Committees The Board is comprised of 14 directors, all but one of whom are independent. The Board authorizes management to maintain an effective Risk Framework, and oversees compliance with safe and sound banking practices. In addition, the Board or its committees conduct inquiries of, and receive reports from management on risk-related matters to assess scope or resource limitations that could impede the ability of independent risk management (IRM) and/or Corporate Audit to execute its responsibilities. The Board committees discussed below have the principal responsibility for enterprise-wide oversight of our risk management activities. Through these activities, the Board and applicable committees are provided with information on our risk profile, and oversee executive management addressing key risks we face. Other Board committees as described below provide additional oversight of specific risks. Each of the committees shown on the above chart regularly reports to the Board on risk-related matters within the committee responsibilities, which is intended to collectively provide the Board with integrated insight about our management of enterprise-wide risks. Audit Committee The Audit Committee oversees the qualifications, performance and independence of the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm, the performance of our corporate audit function, the integrity of our consolidated financial statements, our compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, and makes inquiries of management or the Corporate General Auditor (CGA) to determine whether there are scope or resource limitations that impede the ability of Corporate Audit to execute its responsibilities. The Audit Committee is also responsible for overseeing compliance risk pursuant to the New York Stock Exchange listing standards. Enterprise Risk Committee The ERC has primary responsibility for oversight of the Risk Framework and key risks we face. It approves the Risk Framework 42 Bank of America 2016 and the Risk Appetite Statement and further recommends these documents to the Board for approval. The ERC oversees senior management responsibilities for the identification, measurement, monitoring and control of key risks we face. The ERC may consult with other Board committees on risk-related matters. Other Board Committees Our Corporate Governance Committee oversees our Board governance processes, identifies and reviews the qualifications of potential Board members, recommends nominees for election to our Board, recommends committee appointments for Board approval and reviews our stockholder engagement activities. Our Compensation and Benefits Committee oversees establishing, maintaining and administering our compensation programs and employee benefit plans, including approving and recommending our Chief Executive Officer (CEO) compensation to our Board for further approval by all independent directors, and reviewing and approving all of our executive officers compensation. Management Committees Management committees may receive their authority from the Board, a Board committee, another management committee or from one or more executive officers. Our primary management-level risk committee is the Management Risk Committee (MRC). Subject to Board oversight, the MRC is responsible for management oversight of key risks we face. The MRC provides management oversight of our compliance and operational risk programs, balance sheet and capital management, funding activities and other liquidity activities, stress testing, trading activities, recovery and resolution planning, model risk, subsidiary governance and activities between member banks and their nonbank affiliates pursuant to Federal Reserve rules and regulations, among other things. Lines of Defense In addition to the role of Executive Officers in managing risk, we have clear ownership and accountability across the three lines of defense: Front Line Units (FLUs), IRM and Corporate Audit. We also have control functions outside of FLUs and IRM (e.g., Legal and Global Human Resources). The three lines of defense are integrated into our management-level governance structure. Each of these is described in more detail below. Executive Officers Executive officers lead various functions representing the functional roles. Authority for functional roles may be delegated to executive officers from the Board, Board committees or management-level committees. Executive officers, in turn, may further delegate responsibilities, as appropriate, to management-level committees, management routines or individuals. Executive officers review our activities for consistency with our Risk Framework, Risk Appetite Statement and applicable strategic, capital and financial operating plans, as well as applicable policies, standards, procedures and processes. Executive officers and other employees make decisions individually on a day-to-day basis, consistent with the authority they have been delegated. Executive officers and other employees may also serve on committees and participate in committee decisions. Front Line Units FLUs include the lines of business as well as the Global Technology and Operations Group, and are responsible for appropriately assessing and effectively managing all of the risks associated with their activities. Three organizational units that include FLU activities and control function activities, but are not part of IRM are the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Group, Global Marketing and Corporate Affairs (GM&CA) and the Chief Administrative Officer (CAO) Group. Independent Risk Management IRM is part of our control functions and includes Global Risk Management and Global Compliance. We have other control functions that are not part of IRM (other control functions may also provide oversight to FLU activities), including Legal, Global Human Resources and certain activities within the CFO Group, GM&CA and the CAO Group. IRM, led by the Chief Risk Officer (CRO), is responsible for independently assessing and overseeing risks within FLUs and other control functions. IRM establishes written enterprise policies and procedures that include concentration risk limits where appropriate. Such policies and procedures outline how aggregate risks are identified, measured, monitored and controlled. The CRO has the authority and independence to develop and implement a meaningful risk management framework. The CRO has unrestricted access to the Board and reports directly to both the ERC and to the CEO. Global Risk Management is organized into enterprise risk teams, FLU risk teams and control function risk teams that work collaboratively in executing their respective duties. Within IRM, Global Compliance independently assesses compliance risk, and evaluates adherence to applicable laws, rules and regulations, including identifying compliance issues and risks, performing monitoring and testing, and reporting on the state of compliance activities across the Corporation. Additionally, Global Compliance works with FLUs and control functions so that day-to-day activities operate in a compliant manner. Corporate Audit Corporate Audit and the CGA maintain their independence from the FLUs, IRM and other control functions by reporting directly to the Audit Committee or the Board. The CGA administratively reports to the CEO. Corporate Audit provides independent assessment and validation through testing of key processes and controls across the Corporation. Corporate Audit includes Credit Review which periodically tests and examines credit portfolios and processes. Risk Management Processes The Risk Framework requires that strong risk management practices are integrated in key strategic, capital and financial planning processes and day-to-day business processes across the Corporation, with a goal of ensuring risks are appropriately considered, evaluated and responded to in a timely manner. We employ a risk management process, referred to as Identify, Measure, Monitor and Control (IMMC), as part of our daily activities. Identify To be effectively managed, risks must be clearly defined and proactively identified. Proper risk identification focuses on recognizing and understanding key risks inherent in our business activities or key risks that may arise from external factors. Each employee is expected to identify and escalate Bank of America 2016 43 risks promptly. Risk identification is an ongoing process, incorporating input from FLUs and control functions, designed to be forward looking and capture relevant risk factors across all of our lines of business. Measure Once a risk is identified, it must be prioritized and accurately measured through a systematic risk quantification process including quantitative and qualitative components. Risk is measured at various levels including, but not limited to, risk type, FLU, legal entity and on an aggregate basis. This risk quantification process helps to capture changes in our risk profile due to changes in strategic direction, concentrations, portfolio quality and the overall economic environment. Senior management considers how risk exposures might evolve under a variety of stress scenarios. Monitor We monitor risk levels regularly to track adherence to risk appetite, policies, standards, procedures and processes. We also regularly update risk assessments and review risk exposures. Through our monitoring, we can determine our level of risk relative to limits and can take action in a timely manner. We also can determine when risk limits are breached and have processes to appropriately report and escalate exceptions. This includes requests for approval to managers and alerts to executive management, management-level committees or the Board (directly or through an appropriate committee). Control We establish and communicate risk limits and controls through policies, standards, procedures and processes that define the responsibilities and authority for risk-taking. The limits and controls can be adjusted by the Board or management when conditions or risk tolerances warrant. These limits may be absolute (e.g., loan amount, trading volume) or relative (e.g., percentage of loan book in higher-risk categories). Our lines of business are held accountable to perform within the established limits. The formal processes used to manage risk represent a part of our overall risk management process. Corporate culture and the actions of our employees are also critical to effective risk management. Through our Code of Conduct, we set a high standard for our employees. The Code of Conduct provides a framework for all of our employees to conduct themselves with the highest integrity. We instill a strong and comprehensive culture of managing risk well through communications, training, policies, procedures and organizational roles and responsibilities. Additionally, we continue to strengthen the link between the employee performance management process and individual compensation to encourage employees to work toward enterprise-wide risk goals. Corporation-wide Stress Testing Integral to our Capital Planning, Financial Planning and Strategic Planning processes, we conduct capital scenario management and forecasting on a periodic basis to better understand balance sheet, earnings and capital sensitivities to certain economic and business scenarios, including economic and market conditions that are more severe than anticipated. These forecasts provide an understanding of the potential impacts from our risk profile on the balance sheet, earnings and capital, and serve as a key component of our capital and risk management practices. The intent of stress testing is to develop a comprehensive understanding of potential impacts of on- and off-balance sheet risks at the Corporation and how they impact financial resiliency. Contingency Planning We have developed and maintain contingency plans that are designed to prepare us in advance to respond in the event of potential adverse economic, financial or market stress. These contingency plans include our Capital Contingency Plan, Contingency Funding Plan and Recovery Plan, which provide monitoring, escalation, actions and routines designed to enable us to increase capital, access funding sources and reduce risk through consideration of potential options that include asset sales, business sales, capital or debt issuances, or other de-risking strategies. We also maintain a Resolution Plan to limit adverse systemic impacts that could be associated with a potential resolution of Bank of America. Strategic Risk Management Strategic risk is embedded in every business and is one of the major risk categories along with credit, market, liquidity, compliance, operational and reputational risks. This risk results from incorrect assumptions about external or internal factors, inappropriate business plans, ineffective business strategy execution, or failure to respond in a timely manner to changes in the regulatory, macroeconomic or competitive environments, in the geographic locations in which we operate, such as competitor actions, changing customer preferences, product obsolescence and technology developments. Our strategic plan is consistent with our risk appetite, capital plan and liquidity requirements, and specifically addresses strategic risks. On an annual basis, the Board reviews and approves the strategic plan, capital plan, financial operating plan and Risk Appetite Statement. With oversight by the Board, executive management directs the lines of business to execute our strategic plan consistent with our core operating principles and risk appetite. The executive management team monitors business performance throughout the year and provides the Board with regular progress reports on whether strategic objectives and timelines are being met, including reports on strategic risks and if additional or alternative actions need to be considered or implemented. The regular executive reviews focus on assessing forecasted earnings and returns on capital, the current risk profile, current capital and liquidity requirements, staffing levels and changes required to support the strategic plan, stress testing results, and other qualitative factors such as market growth rates and peer analysis. Significant strategic actions, such as capital actions, material acquisitions or divestitures, and Resolution Plans are reviewed and approved by the Board. At the business level, processes are in place to discuss the strategic risk implications of new, expanded or modified businesses, products or services and other strategic initiatives, and to provide formal review and approval where required. With oversight by the Board and the ERC, executive management performs similar analyses throughout the year, and evaluates changes to the financial forecast or the risk, capital or liquidity positions as deemed appropriate to balance and optimize achieving the targeted risk appetite, shareholder returns and maintaining the targeted financial strength. Proprietary models are used to measure the capital requirements for credit, country, market, operational and strategic risks. The allocated capital assigned to each business is based on its unique risk profile. With oversight by the Board, executive management assesses the risk-adjusted returns of each business in approving strategic and financial operating plans. The businesses use allocated capital to define business strategies, and price products and transactions. 44 Bank of America 2016 Capital Management The Corporation manages its capital position so its capital is more than adequate to support its business activities and to maintain capital, risk and risk appetite commensurate with one another. Additionally, we seek to maintain safety and soundness at all times, even under adverse scenarios, take advantage of organic growth opportunities, meet obligations to creditors and counterparties, maintain ready access to financial markets, continue to serve as a credit intermediary, remain a source of strength for our subsidiaries, and satisfy current and future regulatory capital requirements. Capital management is integrated into our risk and governance processes, as capital is a key consideration in the development of our strategic plan, risk appetite and risk limits. We conduct an Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) on a periodic basis. The ICAAP is a forward-looking assessment of our projected capital needs and resources, incorporating earnings, balance sheet and risk forecasts under baseline and adverse economic and market conditions. We utilize periodic stress tests to assess the potential impacts to our balance sheet, earnings, regulatory capital and liquidity under a variety of stress scenarios. We perform qualitative risk assessments to identify and assess material risks not fully captured in our forecasts or stress tests. We assess the potential capital impacts of proposed changes to regulatory capital requirements. Management assesses ICAAP results and provides documented quarterly assessments of the adequacy of our capital guidelines and capital position to the Board or its committees. We periodically review capital allocated to our businesses and allocate capital annually during the strategic and capital planning processes. For additional information, see Business Segment Operations on page 29 . CCAR and Capital Planning The Federal Reserve requires BHCs to submit a capital plan and requests for capital actions on an annual basis, consistent with the rules governing the CCAR capital plan. In April 2016, we submitted our 2016 CCAR capital plan and related supervisory stress tests. The 2016 CCAR capital plan included requests: (i) to repurchase $5.0 billion of common stock over four quarters beginning in the third quarter of 2016, (ii) to repurchase common stock to offset the dilution resulting from certain equity-based compensation awards, and (iii) to increase the quarterly common stock dividend from $0.05 per share to $0.075 per share. On June 29, 2016, following the Federal Reserve's non-objection to our 2016 CCAR capital plan, the Board authorized the common stock repurchase beginning July 1, 2016. Also, in addition to the previously announced repurchases associated with the 2016 CCAR capital plan, on January 13, 2017, we announced a plan to repurchase an additional $1.8 billion of common stock during the first half of 2017, to which the Federal Reserve did not object. The common stock repurchase authorization includes both common stock and warrants. During 2016 , we repurchased approximately $5.1 billion of common stock pursuant to the Board authorization of our 2016 and 2015 CCAR capital plans and to offset equity-based compensation awards. The timing and amount of common stock repurchases will be subject to various factors, including the Corporation capital position, liquidity, financial performance and alternative uses of capital, stock trading price, and general market conditions, and may be suspended at any time. The common stock repurchases may be effected through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including repurchase plans that satisfy the conditions of Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. As a well-capitalized BHC, we may notify the Federal Reserve of our intention to make additional capital distributions not to exceed one percent of Tier 1 capital (0.25 percent of Tier 1 capital beginning April 1, 2017), and which were not contemplated in our capital plan, subject to the Federal Reserve's non-objection. Regulatory Capital As a financial services holding company, we are subject to regulatory capital rules issued by U.S. banking regulators including Basel 3, which includes certain transition provisions through January 1, 2019. The Corporation and its primary affiliated banking entity, BANA, are Basel 3 Advanced approaches institutions. Bank of America 2016 45 Basel 3 Overview Basel 3 updated the composition of capital and established a Common equity tier 1 capital ratio. Common equity tier 1 capital primarily includes common stock, retained earnings and accumulated OCI, net of deductions and adjustments primarily related to goodwill, deferred tax assets, intangibles, MSRs and defined benefit pension assets. Under the Basel 3 regulatory capital transition provisions, certain deductions and adjustments to Common equity tier 1 capital are phased in through January 1, 2018. In 2016, under the transition provisions, 60 percent of these deductions and adjustments were recognized. Basel 3 also revised minimum capital ratios and buffer requirements, added a supplementary leverage ratio (SLR), and addressed the adequately capitalized minimum requirements under the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework. Finally, Basel 3 established two methods of calculating risk-weighted assets, the Standardized approach and the Advanced approaches. The Standardized approach relies primarily on supervisory risk weights based on exposure type and the Advanced approaches determines risk weights based on internal models. As an Advanced approaches institution, we are required to report regulatory risk-based capital ratios and risk-weighted assets under both the Standardized and Advanced approaches. The approach that yields the lower ratio is used to assess capital adequacy including under the PCA framework. Minimum Capital Requirements Minimum capital requirements and related buffers are being phased in from January 1, 2014 through January 1, 2019. Effective January 1, 2015, the PCA framework was also amended to reflect the requirements of Basel 3. The PCA framework establishes categories of capitalization, including well capitalized, based on regulatory ratio requirements. U.S. banking regulators are required to take certain mandatory actions depending on the category of capitalization, with no mandatory actions required for well-capitalized banking organizations, which included BANA at December 31, 2016 . On January 1, 2016, we became subject to a capital conservation buffer, a countercyclical capital buffer and a global systemically important bank (G-SIB) surcharge which will be phased in over a three-year period ending January 1, 2019. Once fully phased in, the Corporation risk-based capital ratio requirements will include a capital conservation buffer greater than 2.5 percent, plus any applicable countercyclical capital buffer and a G-SIB surcharge in order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments. The buffers and surcharge must be composed solely of Common equity tier 1 capital. Under the phase-in provisions, we were required to maintain a capital conservation buffer greater than 0.625 percent plus a G-SIB surcharge of 0.75 percent in 2016. The countercyclical capital buffer is currently set at zero. We estimate that our fully phased-in G-SIB surcharge will be 2.5 percent. The G-SIB surcharge may differ from this estimate over time. Supplementary Leverage Ratio Basel 3 also requires Advanced approaches institutions to disclose an SLR. The numerator of the SLR is quarter-end Basel 3 Tier 1 capital. The denominator is total leverage exposure based on the daily average of the sum of on-balance sheet exposures less permitted Tier 1 deductions, as well as the simple average of certain off-balance sheet exposures, as of the end of each month in a quarter. Effective January 1, 2018, the Corporation will be required to maintain a minimum SLR of 3.0 percent, plus a leverage buffer of 2.0 percent in order to avoid certain restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments. Insured depository institution subsidiaries of BHCs will be required to maintain a minimum 6.0 percent SLR to be considered "well capitalized" under the PCA framework. Capital Composition and Ratios Table 10 presents Bank of America Corporation transition and fully phased-in capital ratios and related information in accordance with Basel 3 Standardized and Advanced approaches as measured at December 31, 2016 and 2015 . Fully phased-in estimates are non-GAAP financial measures that the Corporation considers to be useful measures in evaluating compliance with new regulatory capital requirements that are not yet effective. For reconciliations to GAAP financial measures, see Table 13 . As of December 31, 2016 and 2015 , the Corporation meets the definition of well capitalized under current regulatory requirements. 46 Bank of America 2016 Table 10 Bank of America Corporation Regulatory Capital under Basel 3 (1) December 31, 2016 Transition Fully Phased-in (Dollars in millions) Standardized Approach Advanced Approaches Regulatory Minimum (2, 3) Standardized Approach Advanced Approaches (4) Regulatory Minimum (5) Risk-based capital metrics: Common equity tier 1 capital $ 168,866 $ 168,866 $ 162,729 $ 162,729 Tier 1 capital 190,315 190,315 187,559 187,559 Total capital (6) 228,187 218,981 223,130 213,924 Risk-weighted assets (in billions) 1,399 1,530 1,417 1,512 Common equity tier 1 capital ratio 12.1 % 11.0 % 5.875 % 11.5 % 10.8 % 9.5 % Tier 1 capital ratio 13.6 12.4 7.375 13.2 12.4 11.0 Total capital ratio 16.3 14.3 9.375 15.8 14.2 13.0 Leverage-based metrics: Adjusted quarterly average assets (in billions) (7) $ 2,131 $ 2,131 $ 2,131 $ 2,131 Tier 1 leverage ratio 8.9 % 8.9 % 4.0 8.8 % 8.8 % 4.0 SLR leverage exposure (in billions) $ 2,702 SLR 6.9 % 5.0 December 31, 2015 Risk-based capital metrics: Common equity tier 1 capital $ 163,026 $ 163,026 $ 154,084 $ 154,084 Tier 1 capital 180,778 180,778 175,814 175,814 Total capital (6) 220,676 210,912 211,167 201,403 Risk-weighted assets (in billions) 1,403 1,602 1,427 1,575 Common equity tier 1 capital ratio 11.6 % 10.2 % 4.5 % 10.8 % 9.8 % 9.5 % Tier 1 capital ratio 12.9 11.3 6.0 12.3 11.2 11.0 Total capital ratio 15.7 13.2 8.0 14.8 12.8 13.0 Leverage-based metrics: Adjusted quarterly average assets (in billions) (7) $ 2,103 $ 2,103 $ 2,102 $ 2,102 Tier 1 leverage ratio 8.6 % 8.6 % 4.0 8.4 % 8.4 % 4.0 SLR leverage exposure (in billions) $ 2,727 SLR 6.4 % 5.0 (1) As an Advanced approaches institution, we are required to report regulatory capital risk-weighted assets and ratios under both the Standardized and Advanced approaches. The approach that yields the lower ratio is to be used to assess capital adequacy and was the Advanced approaches method at December 31, 2016 and 2015 . (2) The December 31, 2016 amount includes a transition capital conservation buffer of 0.625 percent and a transition G-SIB surcharge of 0.75 percent. The 2016 countercyclical capital buffer is zero. (3) To be well capitalized under the current U.S. banking regulatory agency definitions, we must maintain a Total capital ratio of 10 percent or greater. (4) Basel 3 fully phased-in Advanced approaches estimates assume approval by U.S. banking regulators of our internal analytical models, including approval of the internal models methodology (IMM). As of December 31, 2016 , we did not have regulatory approval of the IMM model. (5) Fully phased-in regulatory minimums assume a capital conservation buffer of 2.5 percent and estimated G-SIB surcharge of 2.5 percent . The estimated fully phased-in countercyclical capital buffer is zero . We will be subject to fully phased-in regulatory minimums on January 1, 2019. The fully phased-in SLR minimum assumes a leverage buffer of 2.0 percent and is applicable on January 1, 2018. (6) Total capital under the Advanced approaches differs from the Standardized approach due to differences in the amount permitted in Tier 2 capital related to the qualifying allowance for credit losses. (7) Reflects adjusted average total assets for the three months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 . Common equity tier 1 capital under Basel 3 Advanced Transition was $168.9 billion at December 31, 2016 , an increase of $5.8 billion compared to December 31, 2015 driven by earnings, partially offset by dividends, common stock repurchases and the impact of certain transition provisions under the Basel 3 rules. During 2016 , Total capital increased $8.1 billion primarily driven by the same factors that drove the increase in Common equity tier 1 capital as well as issuances of preferred stock and subordinated debt. Risk-weighted assets decreased $72 billion during 2016 to $1,530 billion primarily due to lower market risk, and lower exposures and improved credit quality on legacy retail products.

Regulatory Developments Minimum Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity On December 15, 2016, the Federal Reserve issued a final rule establishing external total loss-absorbing capacity (TLAC) requirements to improve the resolvability and resiliency of large, interconnected BHCs. The rule will be effective January 1, 2019 and U.S. G-SIBs will be required to maintain a minimum external TLAC. We estimate our minimum required external TLAC would be the greater of 22.5 percent of risk-weighted assets or 9.5 percent of SLR leverage exposure. In addition, U.S. G-SIBs must meet a minimum long-term debt requirement. Our minimum required long-term debt is estimated to be the greater of 8.5 percent of risk-weighted assets or 4.5 percent of SLR leverage exposure. The impact of the TLAC rule is not expected to be material to our results of operations. The Corporation issued $11.6 billion of TLAC compliant debt in early 2017. Revisions to Approaches for Measuring Risk-weighted Assets The Basel Committee has several open proposals to revise key methodologies for measuring risk-weighted assets. The proposals include a standardized approach for credit risk, standardized approach for operational risk, revisions to the credit valuation adjustment (CVA) risk framework and constraints on the use of internal models. The Basel Committee has also finalized a revised standardized model for counterparty credit risk, revisions to the securitization framework and its fundamental review of the trading book, which updates both modeled and standardized approaches for market risk measurement. These revisions are to be coupled with a proposed capital floor framework to limit the extent to which banks can reduce risk-weighted asset levels through the use of internal models, both at the input parameter and aggregate risk-weighted asset level. The Basel Committee expects to finalize the outstanding proposals in 2017. U.S. banking regulators may update the U.S. Basel 3 rules to incorporate the Basel Committee revisions. Single-Counterparty Credit Limits On March 4, 2016, the Federal Reserve issued a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPR) to establish Single-Counterparty Credit Limits (SCCL) for large U.S. BHCs. The SCCL rule is designed to complement and serve as a backstop to risk-based capital requirements to ensure that the maximum possible loss that a bank could incur due to a single counterparty default would not endanger the bank survival. Under the proposal, U.S. BHCs must calculate SCCL by dividing the net aggregate credit exposure to a given counterparty by a bank eligible Tier 1 capital base, ensuring that exposure to G-SIBs and other nonbank systemically important financial institutions does not breach 15 percent and exposures to other counterparties do not breach 25 percent. Capital Requirements for Swap Dealers On December 2, 2016, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission issued an NPR to establish capital requirements for swap dealers and major swap participants that are not subject to existing U.S. prudential regulation. Under the proposal, applicable subsidiaries of the Corporation must meet capital requirements under one of two approaches. The first approach is a bank-based capital approach which requires that firms maintain Common equity tier 1 capital greater than or equal to the larger of 8.0 percent of the entity RWA as calculated under Basel 3, or 8.0 percent of the margin of the entity cleared and uncleared swaps, security-based swaps, futures and foreign futures positions. The second approach is based on net liquid assets and requires that a firm maintain net capital greater than or equal to 8.0 percent of the margin as described above. The proposal also includes liquidity and reporting requirements. Broker-dealer Regulatory Capital and Securities Regulation The Corporation principal U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries are Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated (MLPF&S) and Merrill Lynch Professional Clearing Corp (MLPCC). MLPCC is a fully-guaranteed subsidiary of MLPF&S and provides clearing and settlement services. Both entities are subject to the net capital requirements of Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Rule 15c3-1. Both entities are also registered as futures commission 50 Bank of America 2016 merchants and are subject to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission Regulation 1.17. MLPF&S has elected to compute the minimum capital requirement in accordance with the Alternative Net Capital Requirement as permitted by SEC Rule 15c3-1. At December 31, 2016 , MLPF&S regulatory net capital as defined by Rule 15c3-1 was $11.9 billion and exceeded the minimum requirement of $1.8 billion by $10.1 billion. MLPCC net capital of $2.8 billion exceeded the minimum requirement of $481 million by $2.3 billion. In accordance with the Alternative Net Capital Requirements, MLPF&S is required to maintain tentative net capital in excess of $1.0 billion, net capital in excess of $500 million and notify the SEC in the event its tentative net capital is less than $5.0 billion. At December 31, 2016 , MLPF&S had tentative net capital and net capital in excess of the minimum and notification requirements. Merrill Lynch International (MLI), a U.K. investment firm, is regulated by the Prudential Regulation Authority and the Financial Conduct Authority, and is subject to certain regulatory capital requirements. At December 31, 2016 , MLI capital resources were $34.9 billion which exceeded the minimum requirement of $14.8 billion. Liquidity Risk Funding and Liquidity Risk Management Liquidity risk is the inability to meet expected or unexpected cash flow and collateral needs while continuing to support our businesses and customers with the appropriate funding sources under a range of economic conditions. Our primary liquidity risk management objective is to meet all contractual and contingent financial obligations at all times, including during periods of stress. To achieve that objective, we analyze and monitor our liquidity risk under expected and stressed conditions, maintain liquidity and access to diverse funding sources, including our stable deposit base, and seek to align liquidity-related incentives and risks. We define liquidity as readily available assets, limited to cash and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities that we can use to meet our contractual and contingent financial obligations as those obligations arise. We manage our liquidity position through line of business and ALM activities, as well as through our legal entity funding strategy, on both a forward and current (including intraday) basis under both expected and stressed conditions. We believe that a centralized approach to funding and liquidity management within Corporate Treasury enhances our ability to monitor liquidity requirements, maximizes access to funding sources, minimizes borrowing costs and facilitates timely responses to liquidity events. The Board approves our liquidity policy and the ERC approves the contingency funding plan, including establishing liquidity risk tolerance levels. The MRC monitors our liquidity position and reviews the impact of strategic decisions on our liquidity. The MRC is responsible for overseeing liquidity risks and directing management to maintain exposures within the established tolerance levels. The MRC reviews and monitors our liquidity position, cash flow forecasts, stress testing scenarios and results, and reviews and approves certain liquidity risk limits. For additional information, see Managing Risk on page 41 . Under this governance framework, we have developed certain funding and liquidity risk management practices which include: maintaining liquidity at the parent company and selected subsidiaries, including our bank subsidiaries and other regulated entities; determining what amounts of liquidity are appropriate for these entities based on analysis of debt maturities and other potential cash outflows, including those that we may experience during stressed market conditions; diversifying funding sources, considering our asset profile and legal entity structure; and performing contingency planning. Global Liquidity Sources and Other Unencumbered Assets We maintain liquidity available to the Corporation, including the parent company and selected subsidiaries, in the form of cash and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities. Our liquidity buffer, referred to as Global Liquidity Sources (GLS), formerly Global Excess Liquidity Sources, is comprised of assets that are readily available to the parent company and selected subsidiaries, including holding company, bank and broker-dealer subsidiaries, even during stressed market conditions. Our cash is primarily on deposit with the Federal Reserve and, to a lesser extent, central banks outside of the U.S. We limit the composition of high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities to U.S. government securities, U.S. agency securities, U.S. agency MBS and a select group of non-U.S. government and supranational securities. We believe we can quickly obtain cash for these securities, even in stressed conditions, through repurchase agreements or outright sales. We hold our GLS in legal entities that allow us to meet the liquidity requirements of our global businesses, and we consider the impact of potential regulatory, tax, legal and other restrictions that could limit the transferability of funds among entities. Pursuant to the Federal Reserve and FDIC request disclosed in our Current Report on Form 8-K dated April 13, 2016, we provided our Resolution Plan submission to those regulators on September 30, 2016. In connection with our resolution planning activities, in the third quarter of 2016, we entered into intercompany arrangements with certain key subsidiaries under which we transferred certain of our parent company assets, and agreed to transfer certain additional parent company assets, to NB Holdings, Inc., a wholly-owned holding company subsidiary (NB Holdings). The parent company is expected to continue to have access to the same flow of dividends, interest and other amounts of cash necessary to service its debt, pay dividends and perform other obligations as it would have had if it had not entered into these arrangements and transferred any assets. In consideration for the transfer of assets, NB Holdings issued a subordinated note to the parent company in a principal amount equal to the value of the transferred assets. The aggregate principal amount of the note will increase by the amount of any future asset transfers. NB Holdings also provided the parent company with a committed line of credit that allows the parent company to draw funds necessary to service near-term cash needs. These arrangements support our preferred single point of entry resolution strategy, under which only the parent company would be resolved under the U.S Bankruptcy Code. These arrangements include provisions to terminate the line of credit, forgive the subordinated note and require the parent company to transfer its remaining financial assets to NB Holdings if our projected liquidity resources deteriorate so severely that resolution of the parent company becomes imminent. Our GLS are substantially the same in composition to what qualifies as High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA) under the final U.S. Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) rules. For more information on the final LCR rules, see Liquidity Risk Basel 3 Liquidity Standards on page 53 . Bank of America 2016 51 Our GLS were $499 billion and $504 billion at December 31, 2016 and 2015 , and were as shown in Table 15 . Table 15 Global Liquidity Sources December 31 Average for Three Months Ended December 31 2016 (Dollars in billions) 2016 2015 Parent company and NB Holdings $ 76 $ 96 $ 77 Bank subsidiaries 372 361 389 Other regulated entities 51 47 49 Total Global Liquidity Sources $ 499 $ 504 $ 515 As shown in Table 15 , parent company and NB Holdings liquidity totaled $76 billion and $96 billion at December 31, 2016 and 2015 . The decrease in parent company and NB Holdings liquidity was primarily due to the BNY Mellon settlement payment in the first quarter of 2016 and prepositioning liquidity to subsidiaries in connection with resolution planning. Typically, parent company and NB Holdings liquidity is in the form of cash deposited with BANA. Liquidity held at our bank subsidiaries totaled $372 billion and $361 billion at December 31, 2016 and 2015 . The increase in bank subsidiaries liquidity was primarily due to deposit growth, partially offset by loan growth. Liquidity at bank subsidiaries excludes the cash deposited by the parent company and NB Holdings. Our bank subsidiaries can also generate incremental liquidity by pledging a range of unencumbered loans and securities to certain FHLBs and the Federal Reserve Discount Window. The cash we could have obtained by borrowing against this pool of specifically-identified eligible assets was $310 billion and $252 billion at December 31, 2016 and 2015 . We have established operational procedures to enable us to borrow against these assets, including regularly monitoring our total pool of eligible loans and securities collateral. Eligibility is defined in guidelines from the FHLBs and the Federal Reserve and is subject to change at their discretion. Due to regulatory restrictions, liquidity generated by the bank subsidiaries can generally be used only to fund obligations within the bank subsidiaries and can only be transferred to the parent company or nonbank subsidiaries with prior regulatory approval. Liquidity held at our other regulated entities, comprised primarily of broker-dealer subsidiaries, totaled $51 billion and $47 billion at December 31, 2016 and 2015 . Our other regulated entities also held unencumbered investment-grade securities and equities that we believe could be used to generate additional liquidity. Liquidity held in an other regulated entity is primarily available to meet the obligations of that entity and transfers to the parent company or to any other subsidiary may be subject to prior regulatory approval due to regulatory restrictions and minimum requirements. Table 16 presents the composition of GLS at December 31, 2016 and 2015 . Table 16 Global Liquidity Sources Composition December 31 (Dollars in billions) 2016 2015 Cash on deposit $ 106 $ 119 U.S. Treasury securities 58 38 U.S. agency securities and mortgage-backed securities 318 327 Non-U.S. government and supranational securities 17 20 Total Global Liquidity Sources $ 499 $ 504 Time-to-required Funding and Liquidity Stress Analysis We use a variety of metrics to determine the appropriate amounts of liquidity to maintain at the parent company and our subsidiaries. One metric we use to evaluate the appropriate level of liquidity at the parent company and NB Holdings is time-to-required funding (TTF). This debt coverage measure indicates the number of months the parent company can continue to meet its unsecured contractual obligations as they come due using only the parent company and NB Holdings' liquidity sources without issuing any new debt or accessing any additional liquidity sources. We define unsecured contractual obligations for purposes of this metric as maturities of senior or subordinated debt issued or guaranteed by Bank of America Corporation. These include certain unsecured debt instruments, primarily structured liabilities, which we may be required to settle for cash prior to maturity. Prior to the third quarter of 2016, TTF incorporated only the liquidity of the parent company. During the third quarter of 2016, TTF was expanded to include the liquidity of NB Holdings, following changes in our liquidity management practices, initiated in connection with the Corporation's resolution planning activities, that include maintaining at NB Holdings certain liquidity previously held solely at the parent company. Our TTF was 35 months at December 31, 2016 . We also utilize liquidity stress analysis to assist us in determining the appropriate amounts of liquidity to maintain at the parent company and our subsidiaries. The liquidity stress testing process is an integral part of analyzing our potential contractual and contingent cash outflows. We evaluate the liquidity requirements under a range of scenarios with varying levels of severity and time horizons. The scenarios we consider and utilize incorporate market-wide and Corporation-specific events, including potential credit rating downgrades for the parent company and our subsidiaries, and more severe events including potential resolution scenarios. The scenarios are based on our historical experience, experience of distressed and failed financial institutions, regulatory guidance, and both expected and unexpected future events. 52 Bank of America 2016 The types of potential contractual and contingent cash outflows we consider in our scenarios may include, but are not limited to, upcoming contractual maturities of unsecured debt and reductions in new debt issuance; diminished access to secured financing markets; potential deposit withdrawals; increased draws on loan commitments, liquidity facilities and letters of credit; additional collateral that counterparties could call if our credit ratings were downgraded; collateral and margin requirements arising from market value changes; and potential liquidity required to maintain businesses and finance customer activities. Changes in certain market factors, including, but not limited to, credit rating downgrades, could negatively impact potential contractual and contingent outflows and the related financial instruments, and in some cases these impacts could be material to our financial results. We consider all sources of funds that we could access during each stress scenario and focus particularly on matching available sources with corresponding liquidity requirements by legal entity. We also use the stress modeling results to manage our asset and liability profile and establish limits and guidelines on certain funding sources and businesses. Basel 3 Liquidity Standards Basel 3 has two liquidity risk-related standards: the LCR and the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR). The LCR is calculated as the amount of a financial institution unencumbered HQLA relative to the estimated net cash outflows the institution could encounter over a 30-day period of significant liquidity stress, expressed as a percentage. The LCR regulatory requirement of 100 percent as of January 1, 2017 is applicable to the Corporation on a consolidated basis and to our insured depository institutions. As of December 31, 2016 , the consolidated Corporation and its insured depository institutions were above the 2017 LCR requirements. Our LCR may fluctuate from period to period due to normal business flows from customer activity. On December 19, 2016, the Federal Reserve published the final LCR public disclosure requirements. Effective April 1, 2017, the final rule requires us to disclose publicly, on a quarterly basis, quantitative information about our LCR calculation and a discussion of the factors that have a significant effect on our LCR. In April 2016, U.S. banking regulators issued a proposal for an NSFR requirement applicable to U.S. financial institutions following the Basel Committee's final standard in 2014. The U.S. NSFR would apply to the Corporation on a consolidated basis and to our insured depository institutions beginning on January 1, 2018. We expect to meet the NSFR requirement within the regulatory timeline. The standard is intended to reduce funding risk over a longer time horizon. The NSFR is designed to ensure an appropriate amount of stable funding, generally capital and liabilities maturing beyond one year, given the mix of assets and off-balance sheet items. Diversified Funding Sources We fund our assets primarily with a mix of deposits and secured and unsecured liabilities through a centralized, globally coordinated funding approach diversified across products, programs, markets, currencies and investor groups. The primary benefits of our centralized funding approach include greater control, reduced funding costs, wider name recognition by investors and greater flexibility to meet the variable funding requirements of subsidiaries. Where regulations, time zone differences or other business considerations make parent company funding impractical, certain other subsidiaries may issue their own debt. We fund a substantial portion of our lending activities through our deposits, which were $1.26 trillion and $1.20 trillion at December 31, 2016 and 2015 . Deposits are primarily generated by our Consumer Banking , GWIM and Global Banking segments. These deposits are diversified by clients, product type and geography, and the majority of our U.S. deposits are insured by the FDIC. We consider a substantial portion of our deposits to be a stable, low-cost and consistent source of funding. We believe this deposit funding is generally less sensitive to interest rate changes, market volatility or changes in our credit ratings than wholesale funding sources. Our lending activities may also be financed through secured borrowings, including credit card securitizations and securitizations with GSEs, the FHA and private-label investors, as well as FHLB loans. Our trading activities in other regulated entities are primarily funded on a secured basis through securities lending and repurchase agreements and these amounts will vary based on customer activity and market conditions. We believe funding these activities in the secured financing markets is more cost-efficient and less sensitive to changes in our credit ratings than unsecured financing. Repurchase agreements are generally short-term and often overnight. Disruptions in secured financing markets for financial institutions have occurred in prior market cycles which resulted in adverse changes in terms or significant reductions in the availability of such financing. We manage the liquidity risks arising from secured funding by sourcing funding globally from a diverse group of counterparties, providing a range of securities collateral and pursuing longer durations, when appropriate. For more information on secured financing agreements, see Note 10 Federal Funds Sold or Purchased, Securities Financing Agreements and Short-term Borrowings to the Consolidated Financial Statements . We issue long-term unsecured debt in a variety of maturities and currencies to achieve cost-efficient funding and to maintain an appropriate maturity profile. While the cost and availability of unsecured funding may be negatively impacted by general market conditions or by matters specific to the financial services industry or the Corporation, we seek to mitigate refinancing risk by actively managing the amount of our borrowings that we anticipate will mature within any month or quarter. During 2016 , we issued $35.6 billion of long-term debt, consisting of $27.5 billion for Bank of America Corporation, $1.0 billion for Bank of America, N.A. and $7.1 billion of other debt. Table 17 presents our long-term debt by major currency at December 31, 2016 and 2015 . Table 17 Long-term Debt by Major Currency December 31 (Dollars in millions) 2016 2015 U.S. Dollar $ 172,082 $ 190,381 Euro 28,236 29,797 British Pound 6,588 7,080 Japanese Yen 3,919 3,099 Australian Dollar 2,900 2,534 Canadian Dollar 1,049 1,428 Other 2,049 2,445 Total long-term debt $ 216,823 $ 236,764 Bank of America 2016 53 Total long-term debt decreased $19.9 billion , or eight percent , in 2016 , primarily due to maturities outpacing issuances. We may, from time to time, purchase outstanding debt instruments in various transactions, depending on prevailing market conditions, liquidity and other factors. In addition, our other regulated entities may make markets in our debt instruments to provide liquidity for investors. For more information on long-term debt funding, see Note 11 Long-term Debt to the Consolidated Financial Statements . We use derivative transactions to manage the duration, interest rate and currency risks of our borrowings, considering the characteristics of the assets they are funding. For further details on our ALM activities, see Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book on page 84 . We may also issue unsecured debt in the form of structured notes for client purposes, certain of which qualify as TLAC eligible debt. During 2016 , we issued $6.2 billion of structured notes, a majority of which were issued by Bank of America Corporation. Structured notes are debt obligations that pay investors returns linked to other debt or equity securities, indices, currencies or commodities. We typically hedge the returns we are obligated to pay on these liabilities with derivatives and/or investments in the underlying instruments, so that from a funding perspective, the cost is similar to our other unsecured long-term debt. We could be required to settle certain structured note obligations for cash or other securities prior to maturity under certain circumstances, which we consider for liquidity planning purposes. We believe, however, that a portion of such borrowings will remain outstanding beyond the earliest put or redemption date. Substantially all of our senior and subordinated debt obligations contain no provisions that could trigger a requirement for an early repayment, require additional collateral support, result in changes to terms, accelerate maturity or create additional financial obligations upon an adverse change in our credit ratings, financial ratios, earnings, cash flows or stock price. Contingency Planning We maintain contingency funding plans that outline our potential responses to liquidity stress events at various levels of severity. These policies and plans are based on stress scenarios and include potential funding strategies and communication and notification procedures that we would implement in the event we experienced stressed liquidity conditions. We periodically review and test the contingency funding plans to validate efficacy and assess readiness. Our U.S. bank subsidiaries can access contingency funding through the Federal Reserve Discount Window. Certain non-U.S. subsidiaries have access to central bank facilities in the jurisdictions in which they operate. While we do not rely on these sources in our liquidity modeling, we maintain the policies, procedures and governance processes that would enable us to access these sources if necessary. Credit Ratings Our borrowing costs and ability to raise funds are impacted by our credit ratings. In addition, credit ratings may be important to customers or counterparties when we compete in certain markets and when we seek to engage in certain transactions, including over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives. Thus, it is our objective to maintain high-quality credit ratings, and management maintains an active dialogue with the major rating agencies. Credit ratings and outlooks are opinions expressed by rating agencies on our creditworthiness and that of our obligations or securities, including long-term debt, short-term borrowings, preferred stock and other securities, including asset securitizations. Our credit ratings are subject to ongoing review by the rating agencies, and they consider a number of factors, including our own financial strength, performance, prospects and operations as well as factors not under our control. The rating agencies could make adjustments to our ratings at any time, and they provide no assurances that they will maintain our ratings at current levels. Other factors that influence our credit ratings include changes to the rating agencies methodologies for our industry or certain security types; the rating agencies assessment of the general operating environment for financial services companies; our relative positions in the markets in which we compete; our various risk exposures and risk management policies and activities; pending litigation and other contingencies or potential tail risks; our reputation; our liquidity position, diversity of funding sources and funding costs; the current and expected level and volatility of our earnings; our capital position and capital management practices; our corporate governance; the sovereign credit ratings of the U.S. government; current or future regulatory and legislative initiatives; and the agencies views on whether the U.S. government would provide meaningful support to the Corporation or its subsidiaries in a crisis. On January 24, 2017, Moody Investors Services, Inc. (Moody s) improved its ratings outlook on the Corporation and its subsidiaries, including BANA, to positive from stable, based on the agency view that there is an increased likelihood that the Corporation profitability will strengthen on a sustainable basis over the next 12 to 18 months while the Corporation continues to adhere to its conservative risk profile, lowering its earnings volatility. The agency concurrently affirmed the current ratings of the Corporation and its subsidiaries, which have not changed since the conclusion of the agency previous review of several global investment banking groups, including Bank of America, on May 28, 2015. On December 16, 2016, Standard & Poor Global Ratings (S&P) concluded its CreditWatch with positive implications for operating subsidiaries of four U.S. G-SIBs, including Bank of America. As a result, S&P upgraded the long-term senior debt ratings of BANA, MLPF&S, MLI and Bank of America Merrill Lynch International Limited (BAMLI) by one notch, to A+ from A. These ratings actions followed the Federal Reserve publication of the TLAC final rule, which provided clarity on which debt instruments will count as external TLAC, and by extension, will also count under S&P Additional Loss Absorbing Capacity (ALAC) framework. The ALAC framework details how a BHC loss-absorbing debt and equity capital buffers may enable uplift to its operating subsidiaries credit ratings. The Federal Reserve decision to allow existing debt containing otherwise impermissible acceleration clauses to count as external TLAC improved the Corporation ALAC calculation enough to warrant an additional notch of uplift under S&P methodology. Following the upgrades, S&P revised the outlook for its ratings to stable on those four operating subsidiaries. The ratings of Bank of America Corporation, which does not receive any ratings uplift under S&P ALAC framework, were not impacted by this ratings action and remain on stable outlook. 54 Bank of America 2016 On December 13, 2016, Fitch Ratings (Fitch) completed its latest semi-annual review of 12 large, complex securities trading and universal banks, including Bank of America. The agency affirmed the long-term and short-term senior debt ratings of Bank of America Corporation and Bank of America, N.A., and maintained stable outlooks on those ratings. Fitch concurrently revised the outlooks for two of Bank of America material international operating subsidiaries, MLI and BAMLI, to stable from positive due to a delay in host country internal TLAC proposals. Table 18 presents the current long-term/short-term senior debt ratings and outlooks expressed by the rating agencies.

In addition, under the terms of certain OTC derivative contracts and other trading agreements, in the event of downgrades of our or our rated subsidiaries credit ratings, the counterparties to those agreements may require us to provide additional collateral, or to terminate these contracts or agreements, which could cause us to sustain losses and/or adversely impact our liquidity. If the short-term credit ratings of our parent company, bank or broker-dealer subsidiaries were downgraded by one or more levels, the potential loss of access to short-term funding sources such as repo financing and the effect on our incremental cost of funds could be material. While certain potential impacts are contractual and quantifiable, the full scope of the consequences of a credit rating downgrade to a financial institution is inherently uncertain, as it depends upon numerous dynamic, complex and inter-related factors and assumptions, including whether any downgrade of a company long-term credit ratings precipitates downgrades to its short-term credit ratings, and assumptions about the potential behaviors of various customers, investors and counterparties. For more information on potential impacts of credit rating downgrades, see Liquidity Risk Time-to-required Funding and Stress Modeling on page 52 . For information on the additional collateral and termination payments that could be required in connection with certain OTC derivative contracts and other trading agreements as a result of such a credit rating downgrade, see Note 2 Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Common Stock Dividends For a summary of our declared quarterly cash dividends on common stock during 2016 and through February 23, 2017 , see Note 13 Shareholders Equity to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Credit Risk Management Credit risk is the risk of loss arising from the inability or failure of a borrower or counterparty to meet its obligations. Credit risk can also arise from operational failures that result in an erroneous advance, commitment or investment of funds. We define the credit exposure to a borrower or counterparty as the loss potential arising from all product classifications including loans and leases, deposit overdrafts, derivatives, assets held-for-sale and unfunded lending commitments which include loan commitments, letters of credit and financial guarantees. Derivative positions are recorded at fair value and assets held-for-sale are recorded at either fair value or the lower of cost or fair value. Certain loans and unfunded commitments are accounted for under the fair value option. Credit risk for categories of assets carried at fair value is not accounted for as part of the allowance for credit losses but as part of the fair value adjustments recorded in earnings. For derivative positions, our credit risk is measured as the net cost in the event the counterparties with contracts in which we are in a gain position fail to perform under the terms of those contracts. We use the current fair value to represent credit exposure without giving consideration to future mark-to-market changes. The credit risk amounts take into consideration the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements and cash collateral. Our consumer and commercial credit extension and review procedures encompass funded and unfunded credit exposures. For more information on derivatives and credit extension commitments, see Note 2 Derivatives and Note 12 Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements . We manage credit risk based on the risk profile of the borrower or counterparty, repayment sources, the nature of underlying collateral, and other support given current events, conditions and expectations. We classify our portfolios as either consumer or commercial and monitor credit risk in each as discussed below. We refine our underwriting and credit risk management practices as well as credit standards to meet the changing economic environment. To mitigate losses and enhance customer support in our consumer businesses, we have in place collection programs and loan modification and customer assistance infrastructures. We utilize a number of actions to mitigate losses in the commercial businesses including increasing the frequency and intensity of portfolio monitoring, hedging activity and our practice of transferring management of deteriorating commercial exposures to independent special asset officers as credits enter criticized categories. Bank of America 2016 55 For more information on our credit risk management activities, see Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management below, Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management on page 66 , Non-U.S. Portfolio on page 74 , Provision for Credit Losses on page 75 , Allowance for Credit Losses on page 75 , and Note 4 Outstanding Loans and Leases and Note 5 Allowance for Credit Losses to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management Credit risk management for the consumer portfolio begins with initial underwriting and continues throughout a borrower credit cycle. Statistical techniques in conjunction with experiential judgment are used in all aspects of portfolio management including underwriting, product pricing, risk appetite, setting credit limits, and establishing operating processes and metrics to quantify and balance risks and returns. Statistical models are built using detailed behavioral information from external sources such as credit bureaus and/or internal historical experience. These models are a component of our consumer credit risk management process and are used in part to assist in making both new and ongoing credit decisions, as well as portfolio management strategies, including authorizations and line management, collection practices and strategies, and determination of the allowance for loan and lease losses and allocated capital for credit risk. Consumer Credit Portfolio Improvement in the U.S. unemployment rate and home prices continued during 2016 resulting in improved credit quality and lower credit losses across most major consumer portfolios compared to 2015 . The 30 and 90 days or more past due balances declined across nearly all consumer loan portfolios during 2016 as a result of improved delinquency trends. Improved credit quality, continued loan balance run-off and sales across the consumer portfolio drove a $1.2 billion decrease in the consumer allowance for loan and lease losses in 2016 to $6.2 billion at December 31, 2016 . For additional information, see Allowance for Credit Losses on page 75 . For more information on our accounting policies regarding delinquencies, nonperforming status, charge-offs and troubled debt restructurings (TDRs) for the consumer portfolio, see Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements . In connection with an agreement to sell our non-U.S. consumer credit card business, this business, which includes $9.2 billion of non-U.S. credit card loans and related allowance for loan and lease losses of $243 million, was reclassified to assets of business held for sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2016. In this section, all applicable amounts and ratios include these balances, unless otherwise noted. Table 19 presents our outstanding consumer loans and leases, and the PCI loan portfolio. In addition to being included in the Outstandings columns in Table 19 , PCI loans are also shown separately in the Purchased Credit-impaired Loan Portfolio columns. The impact of the PCI loan portfolio on certain credit statistics is reported where appropriate. For more information on PCI loans, see Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management Purchased Credit-impaired Loan Portfolio on page 62 and Note 4 Outstanding Loans and Leases to the Consolidated Financial Statements .

Nonperforming loans do not include past due consumer credit card loans, other unsecured loans and in general, consumer loans not secured by real estate (loans discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy are included) as these loans are typically charged off no later than the end of the month in which the loan becomes 180 days past due. Real estate-secured past due consumer loans that are insured by the FHA or individually insured under long-term standby agreements with FNMA and FHLMC (collectively, the fully-insured loan portfolio) are reported as accruing as opposed to nonperforming since the principal repayment is insured. Fully-insured loans included in accruing past due 90 days or more are primarily from our repurchases of delinquent FHA loans pursuant to our servicing agreements with GNMA. Additionally, nonperforming loans and accruing balances past due 90 days or more do not include the PCI loan portfolio or loans accounted for under the fair value option even though the customer may be contractually past due.

(2) Balances exclude consumer loans accounted for under the fair value option. At December 31, 2016 and 2015 , $48 million and $293 million of loans accounted for under the fair value option were past due 90 days or more and not accruing interest. n/a = not applicable Table 21 presents net charge-offs and related ratios for consumer loans and leases.

For more information on PCI write-offs, see Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management Purchased Credit-impaired Loan Portfolio on page 62 . (2) Net charge-off ratios are calculated as net charge-offs divided by average outstanding loans and leases excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option. Net charge-off ratios, excluding the PCI and fully-insured loan portfolios, were 0.09 percent and 0.35 percent for residential mortgage, 0.60 percent and 0.84 percent for home equity and 0.82 percent and 0.99 percent for the total consumer portfolio for 2016 and 2015 , respectively. These are the only product classifications that include PCI and fully-insured loans. Net charge-offs, as shown in Tables 21 and 22 , exclude write-offs in the PCI loan portfolio of $144 million and $634 million in residential mortgage and $196 million and $174 million in home equity for 2016 and 2015 . Net charge-off ratios including the PCI write-offs were 0.15 percent and 0.56 percent for residential mortgage and 0.84 percent and 1.00 percent for home equity in 2016 and 2015 . For more information on PCI write-offs, see Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management Purchased Credit-impaired Loan Portfolio on page 62 . Bank of America 2016 57 Table 22 presents outstandings, nonperforming balances, net charge-offs, allowance for loan and lease losses and provision for loan and lease losses for the core and non-core portfolio within the consumer real estate portfolio. We categorize consumer real estate loans as core and non-core based on loan and customer characteristics such as origination date, product type, LTV, FICO score and delinquency status consistent with our current consumer and mortgage servicing strategy. Generally, loans that were originated after January 1, 2010, qualified under government-sponsored enterprise underwriting guidelines, or otherwise met our underwriting guidelines in place in 2015 are characterized as core loans. Loans held in legacy private-label securitizations, government-insured loans originated prior to 2010, loan products no longer originated, and loans originated prior to 2010 and classified as nonperforming or modified in a TDR prior to 2016 are generally characterized as non-core loans, and are principally run-off portfolios. Core loans as reported within Table 22 include loans held in the Consumer Banking and GWIM segments, as well as loans held for ALM activities in All Other . For more information on core and non-core loans, see Note 4 Outstanding Loans and Leases to the Consolidated Financial Statements . As shown in Table 22 , outstanding core consumer real estate loans increased $9.2 billion during 2016 driven by an increase of $14.7 billion in residential mortgage, partially offset by a $5.5 billion decrease in home equity. The increase in residential mortgage was primarily driven by originations outpacing prepayments in Consumer Banking and GWIM . The decrease in home equity was driven by paydowns outpacing new originations and draws on existing lines.

Consumer loans accounted for under the fair value option include residential mortgage loans of $710 million and $1.6 billion and home equity loans of $341 million and $250 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015 . For more information on the fair value option, see Note 21 Fair Value Option to the Consolidated Financial Statements . (2) Net charge-offs exclude write-offs in the PCI loan portfolio. For more information on PCI write-offs, see Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management Purchased Credit-impaired Loan Portfolio on page 62 . We believe that the presentation of information adjusted to exclude the impact of the PCI loan portfolio, the fully-insured loan portfolio and loans accounted for under the fair value option is more representative of the ongoing operations and credit quality of the business. As a result, in the following discussions of the residential mortgage and home equity portfolios, we provide information that excludes the impact of the PCI loan portfolio, the fully-insured loan portfolio and loans accounted for under the fair value option in certain credit quality statistics. We separately disclose information on the PCI loan portfolio on page 62 . Residential Mortgage The residential mortgage portfolio makes up the largest percentage of our consumer loan portfolio at 42 percent of consumer loans and leases at December 31, 2016 . Approximately 36 percent of the residential mortgage portfolio is in All Other and is comprised of originated loans, purchased loans used in our overall ALM activities, delinquent FHA loans repurchased pursuant to our servicing agreements with GNMA as well as loans repurchased related to our representations and warranties. Approximately 34 percent of the residential mortgage portfolio is 58 Bank of America 2016 in GWIM and represents residential mortgages originated for the home purchase and refinancing needs of our wealth management clients and the remaining portion of the portfolio is primarily in Consumer Banking . Outstanding balances in the residential mortgage portfolio, excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option, increased $3.9 billion in 2016 as retention of new originations was partially offset by loan sales of $6.6 billion and run-off. Loan sales primarily included $3.1 billion of loans in consolidated agency residential mortgage securitization vehicles and $1.9 billion of nonperforming and other delinquent loans. At December 31, 2016 and 2015 , the residential mortgage portfolio included $28.7 billion and $37.1 billion of outstanding fully-insured loans. On this portion of the residential mortgage portfolio, we are protected against principal loss as a result of either FHA insurance or long-term standby agreements that provide for the transfer of credit risk to FNMA and FHLMC. At December 31, 2016 and 2015 , $22.3 billion and $33.4 billion had FHA insurance with the remainder protected by long-term standby agreements. At December 31, 2016 and 2015 , $7.4 billion and $11.2 billion of the FHA-insured loan population were repurchases of delinquent FHA loans pursuant to our servicing agreements with GNMA. Table 23 presents certain residential mortgage key credit statistics on both a reported basis excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option, and excluding the PCI loan portfolio, our fully-insured loan portfolio and loans accounted for under the fair value option. Additionally, in the Reported Basis columns in the table below, accruing balances past due and nonperforming loans do not include the PCI loan portfolio, in accordance with our accounting policies, even though the customer may be contractually past due. As such, the following discussion presents the residential mortgage portfolio excluding the PCI loan portfolio, the fully-insured loan portfolio and loans accounted for under the fair value option. For more information on the PCI loan portfolio, see page 62 . Table 23 Residential Mortgage Key Credit Statistics December 31 Reported Basis (1) Excluding Purchased Credit-impaired and Fully-insured Loans (Dollars in millions) 2016 2015 2016 2015 Outstandings $ 191,797 $ 187,911 $ 152,941 $ 138,768 Accruing past due 30 days or more 8,232 11,423 1,835 1,568 Accruing past due 90 days or more 4,793 7,150 Nonperforming loans 3,056 4,803 3,056 4,803 Percent of portfolio Refreshed LTV greater than 90 but less than or equal to 100 5 % 7 % 3 % 5 % Refreshed LTV greater than 100 4 8 3 4 Refreshed FICO below 620 9 13 4 6 2006 and 2007 vintages (2) 13 17 12 17 Net charge-off ratio (3) 0.07 0.24 0.09 0.35 (1) Outstandings, accruing past due, nonperforming loans and percentages of portfolio exclude loans accounted for under the fair value option. (2) These vintages of loans account for $931 million, or 31 percent , and $1.6 billion, or 34 percent , of nonperforming residential mortgage loans at December 31, 2016 and 2015 . Additionally, these vintages accounted for net recoveries of $2 million in 2016 and net charge-offs of $136 million in 2015 . (3) Net charge-off ratios are calculated as net charge-offs divided by average outstanding loans excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option. Nonperforming residential mortgage loans decreased $1.7 billion in 2016 as outflows, including sales of $1.4 billion, outpaced new inflows. Of the nonperforming residential mortgage loans at December 31, 2016 , $1.0 billion, or 33 percent, were current on contractual payments. Accruing past due 30 days or more increased $267 million due to the timing impact of a consumer real estate payment servicer conversion that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2016. Net charge-offs decreased $342 million to $131 million in 2016 , compared to $473 million in 2015 . This decrease in net charge-offs was primarily driven by charge-offs related to the consumer relief portion of the settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) of $402 million in 2015 . Net charge-offs also included charge-offs of $26 million related to nonperforming loan sales during 2016 compared to recoveries of $127 million in 2015 . Additionally, net charge-offs declined driven by favorable portfolio trends and decreased write-downs on loans greater than 180 days past due, which were written down to the estimated fair value of the collateral, less costs to sell, due in part to improvement in home prices and the U.S. economy. Loans with a refreshed LTV greater than 100 percent represented three percent and four percent of the residential mortgage loan portfolio at December 31, 2016 and 2015 . Of the loans with a refreshed LTV greater than 100 percent, 98 percent were performing at both December 31, 2016 and 2015 . Loans with a refreshed LTV greater than 100 percent reflect loans where the outstanding carrying value of the loan is greater than the most recent valuation of the property securing the loan. The majority of these loans have a refreshed LTV greater than 100 percent primarily due to home price deterioration since 2006, partially offset by subsequent appreciation. Of the $152.9 billion in total residential mortgage loans outstanding at December 31, 2016 , as shown in Table 24 , 37 percent were originated as interest-only loans. The outstanding balance of interest-only residential mortgage loans that have entered the amortization period was $11.0 billion, or 19 percent, at December 31, 2016 . Residential mortgage loans that have entered the amortization period generally have experienced a higher rate of early stage delinquencies and nonperforming status compared to the residential mortgage portfolio as a whole. At December 31, 2016 , $249 million, or two percent of outstanding interest-only residential mortgages that had entered the amortization period were accruing past due 30 days or more compared to $1.8 billion , or one percent for the entire residential mortgage portfolio. In addition, at December 31, 2016 , $448 million, or four percent of outstanding interest-only residential Bank of America 2016 59 mortgage loans that had entered the amortization period were nonperforming, of which $233 million were contractually current, compared to $3.1 billion , or two percent for the entire residential mortgage portfolio, of which $1.0 billion were contractually current. Loans that have yet to enter the amortization period in our interest-only residential mortgage portfolio are primarily well-collateralized loans to our wealth management clients and have an interest-only period of three to ten years. More than 80 percent of these loans that have yet to enter the amortization period will not be required to make a fully-amortizing payment until 2019 or later. Table 24 presents outstandings, nonperforming loans and net charge-offs by certain state concentrations for the residential mortgage portfolio. The Los Angeles-Long Beach-Santa Ana Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) within California represented 15 percent and 14 percent of outstandings at December 31, 2016 and 2015 . Loans within this MSA contributed net recoveries of $13 million within the residential mortgage portfolio during 2016 and 2015 . In the New York area, the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island MSA made up 12 percent and 11 percent of outstandings during 2016 and 2015 . Loans within this MSA contributed net charge-offs of $33 million and $101 million within the residential mortgage portfolio during 2016 and 2015 .

(2) Net charge-offs exclude $144 million of write-offs in the residential mortgage PCI loan portfolio in 2016 compared to $634 million in 2015 . For more information on PCI write-offs, see Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management Purchased Credit-impaired Loan Portfolio on page 62 . (3) In these states, foreclosure requires a court order following a legal proceeding (judicial states). (4) Amounts exclude the PCI residential mortgage and fully-insured loan portfolios. (5) At December 31, 2016 and 2015 , 48 percent and 47 percent of PCI residential mortgage loans were in California. There were no other significant single state concentrations. Home Equity At December 31, 2016 , the home equity portfolio made up 15 percent of the consumer portfolio and is comprised of home equity lines of credit (HELOCs), home equity loans and reverse mortgages. At December 31, 2016 , our HELOC portfolio had an outstanding balance of $58.6 billion , or 88 percent of the total home equity portfolio compared to $66.1 billion, or 87 percent, at December 31, 2015 . HELOCs generally have an initial draw period of 10 years and the borrowers typically are only required to pay the interest due on the loans on a monthly basis. After the initial draw period ends, the loans generally convert to 15-year amortizing loans. At December 31, 2016 , our home equity loan portfolio had an outstanding balance of $5.9 billion , or nine percent of the total home equity portfolio compared to $7.9 billion, or 10 percent, at December 31, 2015 . Home equity loans are almost all fixed-rate loans with amortizing payment terms of 10 to 30 years and of the $5.9 billion at December 31, 2016 , 56 percent have 25- to 30-year terms. At December 31, 2016 , our reverse mortgage portfolio had an outstanding balance, excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option, of $1.9 billion , or three percent of the total home equity portfolio compared to $2.0 billion, or three percent, at December 31, 2015 . We no longer originate reverse mortgages. At December 31, 2016 , approximately 67 percent of the home equity portfolio was in Consumer Banking , 26 percent was in All Other and the remainder of the portfolio was primarily in GWIM . Outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio, excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option, decreased $9.5 billion in 2016 primarily due to paydowns and charge-offs outpacing new originations and draws on existing lines. Of the total home equity portfolio at December 31, 2016 and 2015 , $19.6 billion and $20.3 billion, or 29 percent and 27 percent, were in first-lien positions ( 31 percent and 28 percent excluding the PCI home equity portfolio). At December 31, 2016 , outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio that were in a second-lien or more junior-lien position and where we also held the first-lien loan totaled $10.9 billion, or 17 percent of our total home equity portfolio excluding the PCI loan portfolio. Unused HELOCs totaled $47.2 billion and $50.3 billion at December 31, 2016 and 2015 . The decrease was primarily due to accounts reaching the end of their draw period, which automatically eliminates open line exposure, as well as customers choosing to close accounts. Both of these more than offset customer paydowns of principal balances and the impact of new production. The HELOC utilization rate was 55 percent and 57 percent at December 31, 2016 and 2015 . 60 Bank of America 2016 Table 25 presents certain home equity portfolio key credit statistics on both a reported basis excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option, and excluding the PCI loan portfolio and loans accounted for under the fair value option. Additionally, in the Reported Basis columns in the table below, accruing balances past due 30 days or more and nonperforming loans do not include the PCI loan portfolio, in accordance with our accounting policies, even though the customer may be contractually past due. As such, the following discussion presents the home equity portfolio excluding the PCI loan portfolio and loans accounted for under the fair value option. For more information on the PCI loan portfolio, see page 62 . Table 25 Home Equity Key Credit Statistics December 31 Reported Basis (1) Excluding Purchased Credit-impaired Loans (Dollars in millions) 2016 2015 2016 2015 Outstandings $ 66,443 $ 75,948 $ 62,832 $ 71,329 Accruing past due 30 days or more (2) 566 613 566 613 Nonperforming loans (2) 2,918 3,337 2,918 3,337 Percent of portfolio Refreshed CLTV greater than 90 but less than or equal to 100 5 % 6 % 4 % 6 % Refreshed CLTV greater than 100 8 12 7 11 Refreshed FICO below 620 7 7 6 7 2006 and 2007 vintages (3) 37 43 34 41 Net charge-off ratio (4) 0.57 0.79 0.60 0.84 (1) Outstandings, accruing past due, nonperforming loans and percentages of the portfolio exclude loans accounted for under the fair value option. (2) Accruing past due 30 days or more includes $81 million and $89 million and nonperforming loans include $340 million and $396 million of loans where we serviced the underlying first-lien at December 31, 2016 and 2015 . (3) These vintages of loans have higher refreshed combined LTV ratios and accounted for 50 percent and 45 percent of nonperforming home equity loans at December 31, 2016 and 2015 , and 54 percent of net charge-offs in both 2016 and 2015 . (4) Net charge-off ratios are calculated as net charge-offs divided by average outstanding loans excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option. Nonperforming outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio decreased $419 million in 2016 as outflows, including sales of $234 million, outpaced new inflows. Of the nonperforming home equity portfolio at December 31, 2016 , $1.5 billion, or 50 percent, were current on contractual payments. Nonperforming loans that are contractually current primarily consist of collateral-dependent TDRs, including those that have been discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy, junior-lien loans where the underlying first-lien is 90 days or more past due, as well as loans that have not yet demonstrated a sustained period of payment performance following a TDR. In addition, $876 million, or 30 percent of nonperforming home equity loans, were 180 days or more past due and had been written down to the estimated fair value of the collateral, less costs to sell. Accruing loans that were 30 days or more past due decreased $47 million in 2016 . In some cases, the junior-lien home equity outstanding balance that we hold is performing, but the underlying first-lien is not. For outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio on which we service the first-lien loan, we are able to track whether the first-lien loan is in default. For loans where the first-lien is serviced by a third party, we utilize credit bureau data to estimate the delinquency status of the first-lien. Given that the credit bureau database we use does not include a property address for the mortgages, we are unable to identify with certainty whether a reported delinquent first-lien mortgage pertains to the same property for which we hold a junior-lien loan. For certain loans, we utilize a third-party vendor to combine credit bureau and public record data to better link a junior-lien loan with the underlying first-lien mortgage. At December 31, 2016 , we estimate that $1.0 billion of current and $149 million of 30 to 89 days past due junior-lien loans were behind a delinquent first-lien loan. We service the first-lien loans on $190 million of these combined amounts, with the remaining $980 million serviced by third parties. Of the $1.2 billion of current to 89 days past due junior-lien loans, based on available credit bureau data and our own internal servicing data, we estimate that approximately $428 million had first-lien loans that were 90 days or more past due. Net charge-offs decreased $231 million to $405 million in 2016 , compared to $636 million in 2015 driven by favorable portfolio trends due in part to improvement in home prices and the U.S. economy. Additionally, the decrease in net charge-offs was partly attributable to charge-offs of $75 million related to the consumer relief portion of the settlement with the DoJ in 2015. Outstanding balances with refreshed combined loan-to-value (CLTV) greater than 100 percent comprised seven percent and 11 percent of the home equity portfolio at December 31, 2016 and 2015 . Outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio with a refreshed CLTV greater than 100 percent reflect loans where our loan and available line of credit combined with any outstanding senior liens against the property are equal to or greater than the most recent valuation of the property securing the loan. Depending on the value of the property, there may be collateral in excess of the first-lien that is available to reduce the severity of loss on the second-lien. Of those outstanding balances with a refreshed CLTV greater than 100 percent, 95 percent of the customers were current on their home equity loan and 91 percent of second-lien loans with a refreshed CLTV greater than 100 percent were current on both their second-lien and underlying first-lien loans at December 31, 2016 . Of the $62.8 billion in total home equity portfolio outstandings at December 31, 2016 , as shown in Table 26 , 52 percent require interest-only payments. The outstanding balance of HELOCs that have entered the amortization period was $14.7 billion at December 31, 2016 . The HELOCs that have entered the amortization period have experienced a higher percentage of early stage delinquencies and nonperforming status when compared to the HELOC portfolio as a whole. At December 31, 2016 , $295 million, or two percent of outstanding HELOCs that had entered the amortization period were accruing past due 30 days or more. In addition, at December 31, 2016 , $1.8 billion, or 12 percent of outstanding HELOCs that had entered the amortization period were Bank of America 2016 61 nonperforming, of which $868 million were contractually current. Loans in our HELOC portfolio generally have an initial draw period of 10 years and 23 percent of these loans will enter the amortization period in 2017 and will be required to make fully-amortizing payments. We communicate to contractually current customers more than a year prior to the end of their draw period to inform them of the potential change to the payment structure before entering the amortization period, and provide payment options to customers prior to the end of the draw period. Although we do not actively track how many of our home equity customers pay only the minimum amount due on their home equity loans and lines, we can infer some of this information through a review of our HELOC portfolio that we service and that is still in its revolving period (i.e., customers may draw on and repay their line of credit, but are generally only required to pay interest on a monthly basis). During 2016 , approximately 34 percent of these customers with an outstanding balance did not pay any principal on their HELOCs. Table 26 presents outstandings, nonperforming balances and net charge-offs by certain state concentrations for the home equity portfolio. In the New York area, the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island MSA made up 13 percent of the outstanding home equity portfolio at both December 31, 2016 and 2015 . Loans within this MSA contributed 17 percent and 13 percent of net charge-offs in 2016 and 2015 within the home equity portfolio. The Los Angeles-Long Beach-Santa Ana MSA within California made up 11 percent and 12 percent of the outstanding home equity portfolio in 2016 and 2015 . Loans within this MSA contributed zero percent and two percent of net charge-offs in 2016 and 2015 within the home equity portfolio. Table 26 Home Equity State Concentrations December 31 Outstandings (1) Nonperforming (1) Net Charge-offs (2) (Dollars in millions) 2016 2015 2016 2015 2016 2015 California $ 17,563 $ 20,356 $ 829 $ 902 $ 7 $ 57 Florida (3) 7,319 8,474 442 518 76 128 New Jersey (3) 5,102 5,570 201 230 50 51 New York (3) 4,720 5,249 271 316 45 61 Massachusetts 3,078 3,378 100 115 12 17 Other U.S./Non-U.S. 25,050 28,302 1,075 1,256 215 322 Home equity loans (4) $ 62,832 $ 71,329 $ 2,918 $ 3,337 $ 405 $ 636 Purchased credit-impaired home equity portfolio (5) 3,611 4,619 Total home equity loan portfolio $ 66,443 $ 75,948 (1) Outstandings and nonperforming loans exclude loans accounted for under the fair value option. (2) Net charge-offs exclude $196 million of write-offs in the home equity PCI loan portfolio in 2016 compared to $174 million in 2015 . For more information on PCI write-offs, see Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management Purchased Credit-impaired Loan Portfolio on page 62 . (3) In these states, foreclosure requires a court order following a legal proceeding (judicial states). (4) Amount excludes the PCI home equity portfolio. (5) At both December 31, 2016 and 2015 , 29 percent of PCI home equity loans were in California. There were no other significant single state concentrations. Purchased Credit-impaired Loan Portfolio Loans acquired with evidence of credit quality deterioration since origination and for which it is probable at purchase that we will be unable to collect all contractually required payments are accounted for under the accounting guidance for PCI loans. For more information on PCI loans, see Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles and Note 4 Outstanding Loans and Leases to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Table 27 presents the unpaid principal balance, carrying value, related valuation allowance and the net carrying value as a percentage of the unpaid principal balance for the PCI loan portfolio. Table 27 Purchased Credit-impaired Loan Portfolio December 31, 2016 (Dollars in millions) Unpaid Principal Balance Gross Carrying Value Related Valuation Allowance Carrying Value Net of Valuation Allowance Percent of Unpaid Principal Balance Residential mortgage (1) $ 10,330 $ 10,127 $ 169 $ 9,958 96.40 % Home equity 3,689 3,611 250 3,361 91.11 Total purchased credit-impaired loan portfolio $ 14,019 $ 13,738 $ 419 $ 13,319 95.01 December 31, 2015 Residential mortgage $ 12,350 $ 12,066 $ 338 $ 11,728 94.96 % Home equity 4,650 4,619 466 4,153 89.31 Total purchased credit-impaired loan portfolio $ 17,000 $ 16,685 $ 804 $ 15,881 93.42 (1) Includes pay option loans with an unpaid principal balance of $1.9 billion and a carrying value of $1.8 billion at December 31, 2016. This includes $1.6 billion of loans that were credit-impaired upon acquisition and $226 million of loans that are 90 days or more past due. The total unpaid principal balance of pay option loans with accumulated negative amortization was $303 million, including $16 million of negative amortization. The total PCI unpaid principal balance decreased $3.0 billion , or 18 percent , in 2016 primarily driven by payoffs, sales, paydowns and write-offs. During 2016 , we sold PCI loans with a carrying value of $549 million compared to sales of $1.4 billion in 2015 . 62 Bank of America 2016 Of the unpaid principal balance of $14.0 billion at December 31, 2016 , $12.3 billion, or 88 percent, was current based on the contractual terms, $949 million, or seven percent, was in early stage delinquency, and $523 million was 180 days or more past due, including $451 million of first-lien mortgages and $72 million of home equity loans. During 2016 , we recorded a provision benefit of $45 million for the PCI loan portfolio which included a benefit of $25 million for residential mortgage and $20 million for home equity. This compared to a total provision benefit of $40 million in 2015 . The provision benefit in 2016 was primarily driven by continued home price improvement and lower default estimates on second-lien loans. The PCI valuation allowance declined $385 million during 2016 due to write-offs in the PCI loan portfolio of $144 million in residential mortgage and $196 million in home equity, combined with a provision benefit of $45 million . The PCI residential mortgage loan portfolio represented 74 percent of the total PCI loan portfolio at December 31, 2016 . Those loans to borrowers with a refreshed FICO score below 620 represented 27 percent of the PCI residential mortgage loan portfolio at December 31, 2016 . Loans with a refreshed LTV greater than 90 percent, after consideration of purchase accounting adjustments and the related valuation allowance, represented 23 percent of the PCI residential mortgage loan portfolio and 26 percent based on the unpaid principal balance at December 31, 2016 . The PCI home equity portfolio represented 26 percent of the total PCI loan portfolio at December 31, 2016 . Those loans with a refreshed FICO score below 620 represented 15 percent of the PCI home equity portfolio at December 31, 2016 . Loans with a refreshed CLTV greater than 90 percent, after consideration of purchase accounting adjustments and the related valuation allowance, represented 46 percent of the PCI home equity portfolio and 49 percent based on the unpaid principal balance at December 31, 2016 . U.S. Credit Card At December 31, 2016 , 96 percent of the U.S. credit card portfolio was managed in Consumer Banking with the remainder in GWIM . Outstandings in the U.S. credit card portfolio increased $2.7 billion in 2016 as retail volumes outpaced payments. Net charge-offs decreased $45 million to $2.3 billion in 2016 due to improvements in delinquencies and bankruptcies as a result of an improved economic environment and the impact of higher credit quality originations. U.S. credit card loans 30 days or more past due and still accruing interest increased $20 million from loan growth while loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing interest decreased $7 million in 2016 . Unused lines of credit for U.S. credit card totaled $321.6 billion and $312.5 billion at December 31, 2016 and 2015 . The $9.1 billion increase was driven by account growth and lines of credit increases. Table 28 presents certain state concentrations for the U.S. credit card portfolio. Table 28 U.S. Credit Card State Concentrations December 31 Outstandings Accruing Past Due 90 Days or More Net Charge-offs (Dollars in millions) 2016 2015 2016 2015 2016 2015 California $ 14,251 $ 13,658 $ 115 $ 115 $ 360 $ 358 Florida 7,864 7,420 85 81 245 244 Texas 7,037 6,620 65 58 164 157 New York 5,683 5,547 60 57 161 162 Washington 4,128 3,907 18 19 56 59 Other U.S. 53,315 52,450 439 459 1,283 1,334 Total U.S. credit card portfolio $ 92,278 $ 89,602 $ 782 $ 789 $ 2,269 $ 2,314 Non-U.S. Credit Card Outstandings in the non-U.S. credit card portfolio, which are recorded in All Other , decreased $761 million in 2016 primarily driven by weakening of the British Pound against the U.S. Dollar. Net charge-offs decreased $13 million to $175 million in 2016 due to the same driver. Unused lines of credit for non-U.S. credit card totaled $24.4 billion and $27.9 billion at December 31, 2016 and 2015 . The $3.5 billion decrease was driven by weakening of the British Pound against the U.S. Dollar, partially offset by account growth and increases in lines of credit. On December 20, 2016, we entered into an agreement to sell our non-U.S. consumer credit card business to a third party. Subject to regulatory approval, this transaction is expected to close by mid-2017. For more information on the sale of our non-U.S. consumer credit card business, see Recent Events on page 21 and Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Direct/Indirect Consumer At December 31, 2016 , approximately 53 percent of the direct/indirect portfolio was included in Consumer Banking (consumer auto and specialty lending automotive, marine, aircraft, recreational vehicle loans and consumer personal loans), and 47 percent was included in GWIM (principally securities-based lending loans). Outstandings in the direct/indirect portfolio increased $5.3 billion in 2016 primarily driven by the consumer auto loan portfolio. Table 29 presents certain state concentrations for the direct/indirect consumer loan portfolio. Bank of America 2016 63 Table 29 Direct/Indirect State Concentrations December 31 Outstandings Accruing Past Due 90 Days or More Net Charge-offs (Dollars in millions) 2016 2015 2016 2015 2016 2015 California $ 11,300 $ 10,735 $ 3 $ 3 $ 13 $ 8 Florida 9,418 8,835 3 3 29 20 Texas 9,406 8,514 5 4 21 17 New York 5,253 5,077 1 1 3 3 Georgia 3,255 2,869 4 4 9 7 Other U.S./Non-U.S. 55,457 52,765 18 24 59 57 Total direct/indirect loan portfolio $ 94,089 $ 88,795 $ 34 $ 39 $ 134 $ 112 Other Consumer At December 31, 2016 , approximately 75 percent of the $2.5 billion other consumer portfolio was consumer auto leases included in Consumer Banking. The remainder is primarily associated with certain consumer finance businesses that we previously exited. Nonperforming Consumer Loans, Leases and Foreclosed Properties Activity Table 30 presents nonperforming consumer loans, leases and foreclosed properties activity during 2016 and 2015 . For more information on nonperforming loans, see Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles and Note 4 Outstanding Loans and Leases to the Consolidated Financial Statements . During 2016 , nonperforming consumer loans declined $2.2 billion to $6.0 billion primarily driven by loan sales of $1.6 billion . Additionally, nonperforming loans declined as outflows outpaced new inflows. The outstanding balance of a real estate-secured loan that is in excess of the estimated property value less costs to sell is charged off no later than the end of the month in which the loan becomes 180 days past due unless repayment of the loan is fully insured. At December 31, 2016 , $2.5 billion, or 40 percent of nonperforming consumer real estate loans and foreclosed properties had been written down to their estimated property value less costs to sell, including $2.2 billion of nonperforming loans 180 days or more past due and $363 million of foreclosed properties. In addition, at December 31, 2016 , $2.5 billion, or 39 percent of nonperforming consumer loans were modified and are now current after successful trial periods, or are current loans classified as nonperforming loans in accordance with applicable policies. Foreclosed properties decreased $81 million in 2016 as liquidations outpaced additions. PCI loans are excluded from nonperforming loans as these loans were written down to fair value at the acquisition date; however, once we acquire the underlying real estate upon foreclosure of the delinquent PCI loan, it is included in foreclosed properties. PCI-related foreclosed properties decreased $65 million in 2016 . Not included in foreclosed properties at December 31, 2016 was $1.2 billion of real estate that was acquired upon foreclosure of certain delinquent government-guaranteed loans (principally FHA-insured loans). We exclude these amounts from our nonperforming loans and foreclosed properties activity as we expect we will be reimbursed once the property is conveyed to the guarantor for principal and, up to certain limits, costs incurred during the foreclosure process and interest incurred during the holding period. Nonperforming loans also include certain loans that have been modified in TDRs where economic concessions have been granted to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties. These concessions typically result from our loss mitigation activities and could include reductions in the interest rate, payment extensions, forgiveness of principal, forbearance or other actions. Certain TDRs are classified as nonperforming at the time of restructuring and may only be returned to performing status after considering the borrower sustained repayment performance for a reasonable period, generally six months. Nonperforming TDRs, excluding those modified loans in the PCI loan portfolio, are included in Table 30 . 64 Bank of America 2016 Table 30 Nonperforming Consumer Loans, Leases and Foreclosed Properties Activity (1) (Dollars in millions) 2016 2015 Nonperforming loans and leases, January 1 $ 8,165 $ 10,819 Additions to nonperforming loans and leases: New nonperforming loans and leases 3,492 4,949 Reductions to nonperforming loans and leases: Paydowns and payoffs (795 ) (1,018 ) Sales (1,604 ) (1,674 ) Returns to performing status (2) (1,628 ) (2,710 ) Charge-offs (1,277 ) (1,769 ) Transfers to foreclosed properties (3) (294 ) (432 ) Transfers to loans held-for-sale (55 ) Total net reductions to nonperforming loans and leases (2,161 ) (2,654 ) Total nonperforming loans and leases, December 31 (4) 6,004 8,165 Foreclosed properties, January 1 444 630 Additions to foreclosed properties: New foreclosed properties (3) 431 606 Reductions to foreclosed properties: Sales (443 ) (686 ) Write-downs (69 ) (106 ) Total net reductions to foreclosed properties (81 ) (186 ) Total foreclosed properties, December 31 (5) 363 444 Nonperforming consumer loans, leases and foreclosed properties, December 31 $ 6,367 $ 8,609 Nonperforming consumer loans and leases as a percentage of outstanding consumer loans and leases (6) 1.32 % 1.80 % Nonperforming consumer loans, leases and foreclosed properties as a percentage of outstanding consumer loans, leases and foreclosed properties (6) 1.39 1.89 (1) Balances do not include nonperforming LHFS of $69 million and $5 million and nonaccruing TDRs removed from the PCI loan portfolio prior to January 1, 2010 of $27 million and $38 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015 as well as loans accruing past due 90 days or more as presented in Table 20 and Note 4 Outstanding Loans and Leases to the Consolidated Financial Statements . (2) Consumer loans may be returned to performing status when all principal and interest is current and full repayment of the remaining contractual principal and interest is expected, or when the loan otherwise becomes well-secured and is in the process of collection. (3) New foreclosed properties represents transfers of nonperforming loans to foreclosed properties net of charge-offs taken during the first 90 days after transfer of a loan to foreclosed properties. New foreclosed properties also includes properties obtained upon foreclosure of delinquent PCI loans, properties repurchased due to representations and warranties exposure and properties acquired with newly consolidated subsidiaries. (4) At December 31, 2016 , 36 percent of nonperforming loans were 180 days or more past due. (5) Foreclosed property balances do not include properties insured by certain government-guaranteed loans, principally FHA-insured loans, of $1.2 billion and $1.4 billion at December 31, 2016 and 2015 . (6) Outstanding consumer loans and leases exclude loans accounted for under the fair value option. Our policy is to record any losses in the value of foreclosed properties as a reduction in the allowance for loan and lease losses during the first 90 days after transfer of a loan to foreclosed properties. Thereafter, further losses in value as well as gains and losses on sale are recorded in noninterest expense. New foreclosed properties included in Table 30 are net of $73 million and $162 million of charge-offs and write-offs of PCI loans in 2016 and 2015 , recorded during the first 90 days after transfer. We classify junior-lien home equity loans as nonperforming when the first-lien loan becomes 90 days past due even if the junior-lien loan is performing. At December 31, 2016 and 2015 , $428 million and $484 million of such junior-lien home equity loans were included in nonperforming loans and leases. Bank of America 2016 65 Table 31 presents TDRs for the consumer real estate portfolio. Performing TDR balances are excluded from nonperforming loans and leases in Table 30 . Table 31 Consumer Real Estate Troubled Debt Restructurings December 31 2016 2015 (Dollars in millions) Total Nonperforming Performing Total Nonperforming Performing Residential mortgage (1, 2) $ 12,631 $ 1,992 $ 10,639 $ 18,372 $ 3,284 $ 15,088 Home equity (3) 2,777 1,566 1,211 2,686 1,649 1,037 Total consumer real estate troubled debt restructurings $ 15,408 $ 3,558 $ 11,850 $ 21,058 $ 4,933 $ 16,125 (1) Residential mortgage TDRs deemed collateral dependent totaled $3.5 billion and $4.9 billion , and included $1.6 billion and $2.7 billion of loans classified as nonperforming and $1.9 billion and $2.2 billion of loans classified as performing at December 31, 2016 and 2015 . (2) Residential mortgage performing TDRs included $5.3 billion and $8.7 billion of loans that were fully-insured at December 31, 2016 and 2015 . (3) Home equity TDRs deemed collateral dependent totaled $1.6 billion and $1.6 billion , and included $1.3 billion and $1.3 billion of loans classified as nonperforming and $301 million and $290 million of loans classified as performing at December 31, 2016 and 2015 . In addition to modifying consumer real estate loans, we work with customers who are experiencing financial difficulty by modifying credit card and other consumer loans. Credit card and other consumer loan modifications generally involve a reduction in the customer interest rate on the account and placing the customer on a fixed payment plan not exceeding 60 months, all of which are considered TDRs (the renegotiated TDR portfolio). In addition, the accounts of non-U.S. credit card customers who do not qualify for a fixed payment plan may have their interest rates reduced, as required by certain local jurisdictions. These modifications, which are also TDRs, tend to experience higher payment default rates given that the borrowers may lack the ability to repay even with the interest rate reduction. In all cases, the customer available line of credit is canceled. Modifications of credit card and other consumer loans are made through renegotiation programs utilizing direct customer contact, but may also utilize external renegotiation programs. The renegotiated TDR portfolio is excluded in large part from Table 30 as substantially all of the loans remain on accrual status until either charged off or paid in full. At December 31, 2016 and 2015 , our renegotiated TDR portfolio was $610 million and $779 million , of which $493 million and $635 million were current or less than 30 days past due under the modified terms. The decline in the renegotiated TDR portfolio was primarily driven by paydowns and charge-offs as well as lower program enrollments. For more information on the renegotiated TDR portfolio, see Note 4 Outstanding Loans and Leases to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management Credit risk management for the commercial portfolio begins with an assessment of the credit risk profile of the borrower or counterparty based on an analysis of its financial position. As part of the overall credit risk assessment, our commercial credit exposures are assigned a risk rating and are subject to approval based on defined credit approval standards. Subsequent to loan origination, risk ratings are monitored on an ongoing basis, and if necessary, adjusted to reflect changes in the financial condition, cash flow, risk profile or outlook of a borrower or counterparty. In making credit decisions, we consider risk rating, collateral, country, industry and single name concentration limits while also balancing these considerations with the total borrower or counterparty relationship. Our business and risk management personnel use a variety of tools to continuously monitor the ability of a borrower or counterparty to perform under its obligations. We use risk rating aggregations to measure and evaluate concentrations within portfolios. In addition, risk ratings are a factor in determining the level of allocated capital and the allowance for credit losses. As part of our ongoing risk mitigation initiatives, we attempt to work with clients experiencing financial difficulty to modify their loans to terms that better align with their current ability to pay. In situations where an economic concession has been granted to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty, we identify these loans as TDRs. For more information on our accounting policies regarding delinquencies, nonperforming status and net charge-offs for the commercial portfolio, see Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Management of Commercial Credit Risk Concentrations Commercial credit risk is evaluated and managed with the goal that concentrations of credit exposure do not result in undesirable levels of risk. We review, measure and manage concentrations of credit exposure by industry, product, geography, customer relationship and loan size. We also review, measure and manage commercial real estate loans by geographic location and property type. In addition, within our non-U.S. portfolio, we evaluate exposures by region and by country. Tables 36 , 39 , 44 and 45 summarize our concentrations. We also utilize syndications of exposure to third parties, loan sales, hedging and other risk mitigation techniques to manage the size and risk profile of the commercial credit portfolio. For more information on our industry concentrations, including our utilized exposure to the energy sector which was three percent and four percent of total commercial utilized exposure at December 31, 2016 and 2015 , see Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management Industry Concentrations on page 71 and Table 39 . We account for certain large corporate loans and loan commitments, including issued but unfunded letters of credit which are considered utilized for credit risk management purposes, that exceed our single name credit risk concentration guidelines under the fair value option. Lending commitments, both funded and unfunded, are actively managed and monitored, and as appropriate, credit risk for these lending relationships may be mitigated through the use of credit derivatives, with our credit view and market perspectives determining the size and timing of the hedging activity. In addition, we purchase credit protection to cover the funded portion as well as the unfunded portion of certain other credit exposures. To lessen the cost of obtaining our desired credit protection levels, credit exposure may be added within an industry, borrower or counterparty group by selling protection. These credit derivatives do not meet the requirements for treatment as 66 Bank of America 2016 accounting hedges. They are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in other income (loss). In addition, we are a member of various securities and derivative exchanges and clearinghouses, both in the U.S. and other countries. As a member, we may be required to pay a pro-rata share of the losses incurred by some of these organizations as a result of another member default and under other loss scenarios. For additional information, see Note 12 Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Commercial Credit Portfolio During 2016 , other than in the higher risk energy sub-sectors, credit quality among large corporate borrowers was strong. While we experienced some deterioration in the energy sector in 2016 , oil prices have stabilized, which contributed to a modest improvement in energy-related exposure by year end. Credit quality of commercial real estate borrowers continued to be strong with conservative LTV ratios, stable market rents in most sectors and vacancy rates remaining low. Outstanding commercial loans and leases increased $17.7 billion during 2016 primarily in U.S. commercial. Nonperforming commercial loans and leases increased $562 million during 2016 . Nonperforming commercial loans and leases as a percentage of outstanding loans and leases, excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option, increased during 2016 to 0.38 percent from 0.28 percent at December 31, 2015 . Reservable criticized balances increased $424 million to $16.3 billion during 2016 as a result of net downgrades outpacing paydowns, primarily in the energy sector. The increase in nonperforming loans was primarily due to energy and metals mining exposure. The allowance for loan and lease losses for the commercial portfolio increased $409 million to $5.3 billion at December 31, 2016 . For additional information, see Allowance for Credit Losses on page 75 . Table 32 presents our commercial loans and leases portfolio, and related credit quality information at December 31, 2016 and 2015 .

For more information on the fair value option, see Note 21 Fair Value Option to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Table 33 presents net charge-offs and related ratios for our commercial loans and leases for 2016 and 2015 . The increase in net charge-offs of $80 million in 2016 was primarily due to higher energy sector related losses.

Bank of America 2016 67 Table 34 presents commercial credit exposure by type for utilized, unfunded and total binding committed credit exposure. Commercial utilized credit exposure includes SBLCs and financial guarantees, bankers acceptances and commercial letters of credit for which we are legally bound to advance funds under prescribed conditions during a specified time period and excludes exposure related to trading account assets. Although funds have not yet been advanced, these exposure types are considered utilized for credit risk management purposes. Total commercial utilized credit exposure increased $15.3 billion in 2016 primarily driven by growth in loans and leases. The utilization rate for loans and leases, SBLCs and financial guarantees, commercial letters of credit and bankers acceptances, in the aggregate, was 58 percent and 56 percent at December 31, 2016 and 2015 .

(2) Total commercial unfunded exposure includes loan commitments accounted for under the fair value option with a notional amount of $6.7 billion and $10.6 billion at December 31, 2016 and 2015 . (3) Excludes unused business card lines which are not legally binding. (4) Includes the notional amount of unfunded legally binding lending commitments net of amounts distributed (e.g. syndicated or participated) to other financial institutions. The distributed amounts were $12.1 billion and $14.3 billion at December 31, 2016 and 2015 . (5) Includes credit risk exposure associated with assets under operating lease arrangements of $5.7 billion and $6.0 billion at December 31, 2016 and 2015 . (6) Derivative assets are carried at fair value, reflect the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements and have been reduced by cash collateral of $43.3 billion and $41.9 billion at December 31, 2016 and 2015 . Not reflected in utilized and committed exposure is additional non-cash derivative collateral held of $22.9 billion and $23.3 billion at December 31, 2016 and 2015 , which consists primarily of other marketable securities. Table 35 presents commercial utilized reservable criticized exposure by loan type. Criticized exposure corresponds to the Special Mention, Substandard and Doubtful asset categories as defined by regulatory authorities. Total commercial utilized reservable criticized exposure increased $424 million , or three percent , in 2016 driven by downgrades, primarily related to our energy exposure, outpacing paydowns and upgrades. Approximately 76 percent and 78 percent of commercial utilized reservable criticized exposure was secured at December 31, 2016 and 2015 . Table 35 Commercial Utilized Reservable Criticized Exposure December 31 2016 2015 (Dollars in millions) Amount (1) Percent (2) Amount (1) Percent (2) U.S. commercial $ 10,311 3.46 % $ 9,965 3.56 % Commercial real estate 399 0.68 513 0.87 Commercial lease financing 810 3.62 708 3.31 Non-U.S. commercial 3,974 4.17 3,944 4.04 15,494 3.27 15,130 3.30 U.S. small business commercial 826 6.36 766 5.95 Total commercial utilized reservable criticized exposure $ 16,320 3.35 $ 15,896 3.38 (1) Total commercial utilized reservable criticized exposure includes loans and leases of $14.9 billion and $14.5 billion and commercial letters of credit of $1.4 billion at December 31, 2016 and 2015 . (2) Percentages are calculated as commercial utilized reservable criticized exposure divided by total commercial utilized reservable exposure for each exposure category. U.S. Commercial At December 31, 2016 , 72 percent of the U.S. commercial loan portfolio, excluding small business, was managed in Global Banking, 16 percent in Global Markets , 10 percent in GWIM (generally business-purpose loans for high net worth clients) and the remainder primarily in Consumer Banking . U.S. commercial loans, excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option, increased $17.6 billion , or seven percent , during 2016 due to growth across all of the commercial businesses. Energy exposure largely drove increases in reservable criticized balances of $346 million , or three percent , and nonperforming loans and leases of $389 million , or 45 percent , during 2016 , as well as increases in net charge-offs of $45 million in 2016 compared to 2015 . 68 Bank of America 2016 Commercial Real Estate Commercial real estate primarily includes commercial loans and leases secured by non-owner-occupied real estate and is dependent on the sale or lease of the real estate as the primary source of repayment. The portfolio remains diversified across property types and geographic regions. California represented the largest state concentration at 23 percent and 21 percent of the commercial real estate loans and leases portfolio at December 31, 2016 and 2015 . The commercial real estate portfolio is predominantly managed in Global Banking and consists of loans made primarily to public and private developers, and commercial real estate firms. Outstanding loans remained relatively unchanged with new originations slightly outpacing paydowns during 2016 . During 2016 , we continued to see low default rates and solid credit quality in both the residential and non-residential portfolios. We use a number of proactive risk mitigation initiatives to reduce adversely rated exposure in the commercial real estate portfolio, including transfers of deteriorating exposures to management by independent special asset officers and the pursuit of loan restructurings or asset sales to achieve the best results for our customers and the Corporation. Nonperforming commercial real estate loans and foreclosed properties decreased $22 million, or 20 percent, to $86 million and reservable criticized balances decreased $ 114 million , or 22 percent , to $399 million at December 31, 2016 . The decrease in reservable criticized balances was primarily due to loan resolutions and strong commercial real estate fundamentals in most sectors. Net recoveries were $31 million and $5 million in 2016 and 2015 . Table 36 presents outstanding commercial real estate loans by geographic region, based on the geographic location of the collateral, and by property type.

At December 31, 2016 , total committed non-residential exposure was $76.9 billion compared to $81.0 billion at December 31, 2015 , of which $55.7 billion and $55.1 billion were funded loans. Non-residential nonperforming loans and foreclosed properties decreased $13 million, or 14 percent, to $81 million at December 31, 2016 due to decreases across most property types. The non-residential nonperforming loans and foreclosed properties represented 0.14 percent and 0.17 percent of total non-residential loans and foreclosed properties at December 31, 2016 and 2015 . Non-residential utilized reservable criticized exposure decreased $105 million, or 21 percent, to $397 million at December 31, 2016 compared to $502 million at December 31, 2015 , which represented 0.70 percent and 0.89 percent of non- residential utilized reservable exposure. For the non-residential portfolio, net recoveries increased $24 million to $31 million in 2016 compared to 2015 . At December 31, 2016 , total committed residential exposure was $3.7 billion compared to $4.1 billion at December 31, 2015 , of which $1.7 billion and $2.1 billion were funded secured loans. The residential nonperforming loans and foreclosed properties decreased $8 million, or 57 percent, and residential utilized reservable criticized exposure decreased $8 million, or 73 percent, during 2016 . The nonperforming loans, leases and foreclosed properties and the utilized reservable criticized ratios for the residential portfolio were 0.35 percent and 0.16 percent at Bank of America 2016 69 December 31, 2016 compared to 0.66 percent and 0.52 percent at December 31, 2015 . At December 31, 2016 and 2015 , the commercial real estate loan portfolio included $6.8 billion and $7.6 billion of funded construction and land development loans that were originated to fund the construction and/or rehabilitation of commercial properties. Reservable criticized construction and land development loans totaled $107 million and $108 million, and nonperforming construction and land development loans and foreclosed properties totaled $44 million at both December 31, 2016 and 2015 . During a property construction phase, interest income is typically paid from interest reserves that are established at the inception of the loan. As construction is completed and the property is put into service, these interest reserves are depleted and interest payments from operating cash flows begin. We do not recognize interest income on nonperforming loans regardless of the existence of an interest reserve. Non-U.S. Commercial At December 31, 2016 , 77 percent of the non-U.S. commercial loan portfolio was managed in Global Banking and 23 percent in Global Markets . Outstanding loans, excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option, decreased $2.2 billion in 2016 primarily due to payoffs. Net charge-offs increased $66 million to $120 million in 2016 primarily due to higher energy sector related losses in the first half of 2016 . For more information on the non-U.S. commercial portfolio, see Non-U.S. Portfolio on page 74 . U.S. Small Business Commercial The U.S. small business commercial loan portfolio is comprised of small business card loans and small business loans managed in Consumer Banking . Credit card-related products were 48 percent and 45 percent of the U.S. small business commercial portfolio at December 31, 2016 and 2015 . Net charge-offs decreased $17 million to $208 million in 2016 primarily driven by portfolio improvement. Of the U.S. small business commercial net charge-offs, 86 percent and 81 percent were credit card-related products in 2016 and 2015 . Nonperforming Commercial Loans, Leases and Foreclosed Properties Activity Table 37 presents the nonperforming commercial loans, leases and foreclosed properties activity during 2016 and 2015 . Nonperforming loans do not include loans accounted for under the fair value option. During 2016 , nonperforming commercial loans and leases increased $491 million to $1.7 billion primarily due to energy and metals and mining exposure. Approximately 77 percent of commercial nonperforming loans, leases and foreclosed properties were secured and approximately 66 percent were contractually current. Commercial nonperforming loans were carried at approximately 88 percent of their unpaid principal balance before consideration of the allowance for loan and lease losses as the carrying value of these loans has been reduced to the estimated property value less costs to sell.

(3) Commercial loans and leases may be returned to performing status when all principal and interest is current and full repayment of the remaining contractual principal and interest is expected, or when the loan otherwise becomes well-secured and is in the process of collection. TDRs are generally classified as performing after a sustained period of demonstrated payment performance. (4) New foreclosed properties represents transfers of nonperforming loans to foreclosed properties net of charge-offs recorded during the first 90 days after transfer of a loan to foreclosed properties. (5) Outstanding commercial loans exclude loans accounted for under the fair value option. 70 Bank of America 2016 Table 38 presents our commercial TDRs by product type and performing status. U.S. small business commercial TDRs are comprised of renegotiated small business card loans and small business loans. The renegotiated small business card loans are not classified as nonperforming as they are charged off no later than the end of the month in which the loan becomes 180 days past due. For more information on TDRs, see Note 4 Outstanding Loans and Leases to the Consolidated Financial Statements .

Our commercial credit exposure is diversified across a broad range of industries. Total commercial committed credit exposure increased $8.6 billion , or one percent , in 2016 to $951.1 billion . Increases in commercial committed exposure were concentrated in healthcare equipment and services, telecommunication services, capital goods and consumer services, partially offset by lower exposure to technology hardware and equipment, banking, and food, beverage and tobacco. Industry limits are used internally to manage industry concentrations and are based on committed exposures and capital usage that are allocated on an industry-by-industry basis. A risk management framework is in place to set and approve industry limits as well as to provide ongoing monitoring. The MRC overseas industry limit governance. Diversified financials, our largest industry concentration with committed exposure of $124.5 billion , decreased $3.9 billion , or three percent , in 2016 . The decrease was primarily due to a reduction in bridge financing exposure and other commitments. Real estate, our second largest industry concentration with committed exposure of $83.7 billion , decreased $4.0 billion , or five percent , in 2016 . For more information on the commercial real estate and related portfolios, see Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management Commercial Real Estate on page 69 . Our energy-related committed exposure decreased $4.6 billion in 2016 to $39.2 billion . Within the higher risk sub-sectors of exploration and production and oil field services, total committed exposure declined $2.8 billion to $15.3 billion at December 31, 2016 , or 39 percent of total committed energy exposure. Total utilized exposure to these sub-sectors declined approximately $1.7 billion to $6.7 billion in 2016 . Of the total $5.7 billion of reservable utilized exposure to the higher risk sub-sectors, 56 percent was criticized at December 31, 2016 . Energy sector net charge-offs increased $141 million to $241 million in 2016 , and energy sector reservable criticized exposure increased $910 million in 2016 to $5.5 billion due to low oil prices which impacted the financial performance of energy clients. The energy allowance for credit losses increased $382 million in 2016 to $925 million primarily due to an increase in reserves for the higher risk sub-sectors.

(4) Represents net notional credit protection purchased. For additional information, see Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management Risk Mitigation below. Risk Mitigation We purchase credit protection to cover the funded portion as well as the unfunded portion of certain credit exposures. To lower the cost of obtaining our desired credit protection levels, we may add credit exposure within an industry, borrower or counterparty group by selling protection. At December 31, 2016 and 2015 , net notional credit default protection purchased in our credit derivatives portfolio to hedge our funded and unfunded exposures for which we elected the fair value option, as well as certain other credit exposures, was $3.5 billion and $6.7 billion . We recorded net losses of $438 million in 2016 compared to net gains of $150 million in 2015 on these positions. The gains and losses on these instruments were offset by gains and losses on the related exposures. The Value-at-Risk (VaR) results for these exposures are included in the fair value option portfolio information in Table 48 . For additional information, see Trading Risk Management on page 80 .

(4) NR is comprised of index positions held and any names that have not been rated. In addition to our net notional credit default protection purchased to cover the funded and unfunded portion of certain credit exposures, credit derivatives are used for market-making activities for clients and establishing positions intended to profit from directional or relative value changes. We execute the majority of our credit derivative trades in the OTC market with large, multinational financial institutions, including broker-dealers and, to a lesser degree, with a variety of other investors. Because these transactions are executed in the OTC market, we are subject to settlement risk. We are also subject to credit risk in the event that these counterparties fail to perform under the terms of these contracts. In most cases, credit derivative transactions are executed on a daily margin basis. Therefore, events such as a credit downgrade, depending on the ultimate rating level, or a breach of credit covenants would typically require an increase in the amount of collateral required by the counterparty, where applicable, and/or allow us to take additional protective measures such as early termination of all trades. Table 42 presents the total contract/notional amount of credit derivatives outstanding and includes both purchased and written credit derivatives. The credit risk amounts are measured as net asset exposure by counterparty, taking into consideration all contracts with the counterparty. For more information on our written credit derivatives, see Note 2 Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements . The credit risk amounts discussed above and presented in Table 42 take into consideration the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements while amounts disclosed in Note 2 Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements are shown on a gross basis. Credit risk reflects the potential benefit from offsetting exposure to non-credit derivative products with the same counterparties that may be netted upon the occurrence of certain events, thereby reducing our overall exposure.

We calculate CVA based on a modeled expected exposure that incorporates current market risk factors including changes in market spreads and non-credit related market factors that affect the value of a derivative. The exposure also takes into consideration credit mitigants such as legally enforceable master netting agreements and collateral. For additional information, see Note 2 Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements . We enter into risk management activities to offset market driven exposures. We often hedge the counterparty spread risk in CVA with credit default swaps (CDS). We hedge other market risks in CVA primarily with currency and interest rate swaps. In certain instances, the net-of-hedge amounts in the table below move in the same direction as the gross amount or may move in the opposite direction. This movement is a consequence of the complex interaction of the risks being hedged resulting in limitations in the ability to perfectly hedge all of the market exposures at all times. Table 43 Credit Valuation Gains and Losses Gains (Losses) 2016 2015 (Dollars in millions) Gross Hedge Net Gross Hedge Net Credit valuation $ 374 $ (160 ) $ 214 $ 255 $ (28 ) $ 227 Bank of America 2016 73 Non-U.S. Portfolio Our non-U.S. credit and trading portfolios are subject to country risk. We define country risk as the risk of loss from unfavorable economic and political conditions, currency fluctuations, social instability and changes in government policies. A risk management framework is in place to measure, monitor and manage non-U.S. risk and exposures. In addition to the direct risk of doing business in a country, we also are exposed to indirect country risks (e.g., related to the collateral received on secured financing transactions or related to client clearing activities). These indirect exposures are managed in the normal course of business through credit, market and operational risk governance, rather than through country risk governance. Table 44 presents our 20 largest non-U.S. country exposures. These exposures accounted for 88 percent and 86 percent of our total non-U.S. exposure at December 31, 2016 and 2015 . Net country exposure for these 20 countries increased $6.5 billion in 2016 primarily driven by increases in Germany, and to a lesser extent Canada, France and Switzerland. On a product basis, the increase was driven by an increase in funded loans and loan equivalents in Germany and Canada, higher unfunded commitments in Germany and Switzerland, and an increase in securities in France and Canada. Non-U.S. exposure is presented on an internal risk management basis and includes sovereign and non-sovereign credit exposure, securities and other investments issued by or domiciled in countries other than the U.S. The risk assignments by country can be adjusted for external guarantees and certain collateral types. Exposures that are subject to external guarantees are reported under the country of the guarantor. Exposures with tangible collateral are reflected in the country where the collateral is held. For securities received, other than cross-border resale agreements, outstandings are assigned to the domicile of the issuer of the securities. Funded loans and loan equivalents include loans, leases, and other extensions of credit and funds, including letters of credit and due from placements, which have not been reduced by collateral, hedges or credit default protection. Funded loans and loan equivalents are reported net of charge-offs but prior to any allowance for loan and lease losses. Unfunded commitments are the undrawn portion of legally binding commitments related to loans and loan equivalents. Net counterparty exposure includes the fair value of derivatives, including the counterparty risk associated with CDS, and secured financing transactions. Derivatives exposures are presented net of collateral, which is predominantly cash, pledged under legally enforceable master netting agreements. Secured financing transaction exposures are presented net of eligible cash or securities pledged as collateral. Securities and other investments are carried at fair value and long securities exposures are netted against short exposures with the same underlying issuer to, but not below, zero (i.e., negative issuer exposures are reported as zero ). Other investments include our GPI portfolio and strategic investments. Net country exposure represents country exposure less hedges and credit default protection purchased, net of credit default protection sold. We hedge certain of our country exposures with credit default protection primarily in the form of single-name, as well as indexed and tranched CDS. The exposures associated with these hedges represent the amount that would be realized upon the isolated default of an individual issuer in the relevant country assuming a zero recovery rate for that individual issuer, and are calculated based on the CDS notional amount adjusted for any fair value receivable or payable. Changes in the assumption of an isolated default can produce different results in a particular tranche.

At December 31, 2016 , net exposure to China was $10.9 billion , concentrated in large state-owned companies, subsidiaries of multinational corporations and commercial banks. At December 31, 2016 , net exposure to Brazil was $13.7 billion , concentrated in sovereign securities, oil and gas companies and commercial banks. At December 31, 2016 , net exposure to Turkey was $2.7 billion , concentrated in commercial banks. The outlook for policy direction and therefore economic performance in the EU is uncertain as a consequence of reduced political cohesion and the lack of clarity following the U.K. Referendum to leave the EU. At December 31, 2016 , net exposure to the U.K. was $47.7 billion , concentrated in multinational corporations and sovereign clients. For additional information, see Executive Summary 2016 Economic and Business Environment on page 21 . Table 45 presents countries where total cross-border exposure exceeded one percent of our total assets. At December 31, 2016 , the U.K. and France were the only countries where total cross-border exposure exceeded one percent of our total assets. At December 31, 2016 , Germany had total cross-border exposure of $18.4 billion representing 0.84 percent of our total assets. No other countries had total cross-border exposure that exceeded 0.75 percent of our total assets at December 31, 2016 . Cross-border exposure includes the components of Country Risk Exposure as detailed in Table 44 as well as the notional amount of cash loaned under secured financing agreements. Local exposure, defined as exposure booked in local offices of a respective country with clients in the same country, is excluded.

The provision for credit losses was $224 million lower than net charge-offs for 2016 , resulting in a reduction in the allowance for credit losses. This compared to a reduction of $1.2 billion in the allowance for credit losses in 2015 . The provision for credit losses for the consumer portfolio increased $360 million to $2.6 billion in 2016 compared to 2015 due to a slower pace of credit quality improvement. Included in the provision is a benefit of $45 million related to the PCI loan portfolio for 2016 compared to a benefit of $40 million in 2015 . The provision for credit losses for the commercial portfolio, including unfunded lending commitments, increased $76 million to $1.0 billion in 2016 compared to 2015 driven by an increase in energy sector reserves in the first half of 2016 for the higher risk energy sub-sectors. While we experienced some deterioration in the energy sector in 2016, oil prices have stabilized which contributed to a modest improvement in energy-related exposure by year end. Allowance for Credit Losses Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses The allowance for loan and lease losses is comprised of two components. The first component covers nonperforming commercial loans and TDRs. The second component covers loans and leases on which there are incurred losses that are not yet individually identifiable, as well as incurred losses that may not be represented in the loss forecast models. We evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses based on the total of these two components, each of which is described in more detail below. The allowance for loan and lease losses excludes LHFS and loans accounted for under the fair value option as the fair value reflects a credit risk component. The first component of the allowance for loan and lease losses covers both nonperforming commercial loans and all TDRs within the consumer and commercial portfolios. These loans are subject to impairment measurement based on the present value of projected future cash flows discounted at the loan original effective interest rate, or in certain circumstances, impairment may also be based upon the collateral value or the loan observable market price if available. Impairment measurement for the renegotiated consumer credit card, small business credit card and unsecured consumer TDR portfolios is based on the present value of projected cash flows discounted using the average portfolio contractual interest rate, excluding promotionally priced loans, in effect prior to restructuring. For purposes of computing this specific loss component of the allowance, larger impaired loans are evaluated individually and smaller impaired loans are evaluated as a pool using historical experience for the respective product types and risk ratings of the loans. The second component of the allowance for loan and lease losses covers the remaining consumer and commercial loans and leases that have incurred losses that are not yet individually identifiable. The allowance for consumer and certain homogeneous commercial loan and lease products is based on aggregated portfolio evaluations, generally by product type. Loss forecast models are utilized that consider a variety of factors including, but not limited to, historical loss experience, estimated defaults or foreclosures based on portfolio trends, delinquencies, economic trends and credit scores. Our consumer real estate loss forecast model estimates the portion of loans that will default based on individual loan attributes, the most significant of which are refreshed LTV or CLTV, and borrower credit score as well as vintage and geography, all of which are further broken down into Bank of America 2016 75 current delinquency status. Additionally, we incorporate the delinquency status of underlying first-lien loans on our junior-lien home equity portfolio in our allowance process. Incorporating refreshed LTV and CLTV into our probability of default allows us to factor the impact of changes in home prices into our allowance for loan and lease losses. These loss forecast models are updated on a quarterly basis to incorporate information reflecting the current economic environment. As of December 31, 2016 , the loss forecast process resulted in reductions in the residential mortgage and home equity portfolios compared to December 31, 2015 . The allowance for commercial loan and lease losses is established by product type after analyzing historical loss experience, internal risk rating, current economic conditions, industry performance trends, geographic and obligor concentrations within each portfolio and any other pertinent information. The statistical models for commercial loans are generally updated annually and utilize our historical database of actual defaults and other data, including external default data. The loan risk ratings and composition of the commercial portfolios used to calculate the allowance are updated quarterly to incorporate the most recent data reflecting the current economic environment. For risk-rated commercial loans, we estimate the probability of default and the loss given default (LGD) based on our historical experience of defaults and credit losses. Factors considered when assessing the internal risk rating include the value of the underlying collateral, if applicable, the industry in which the obligor operates, the obligor liquidity and other financial indicators, and other quantitative and qualitative factors relevant to the obligor credit risk. As of December 31, 2016 , the allowance increased for the U.S. commercial and non-U.S. commercial portfolios compared to December 31, 2015 . Also included within the second component of the allowance for loan and lease losses are reserves to cover losses that are incurred but, in our assessment, may not be adequately represented in the historical loss data used in the loss forecast models. For example, factors that we consider include, among others, changes in lending policies and procedures, changes in economic and business conditions, changes in the nature and size of the portfolio, changes in portfolio concentrations, changes in the volume and severity of past due loans and nonaccrual loans, the effect of external factors such as competition, and legal and regulatory requirements. We also consider factors that are applicable to unique portfolio segments. For example, we consider the risk of uncertainty in our loss forecasting models related to junior-lien home equity loans that are current, but have first-lien loans that we do not service that are 30 days or more past due. In addition, we consider the increased risk of default associated with our interest-only loans that have yet to enter the amortization period. Further, we consider the inherent uncertainty in mathematical models that are built upon historical data. During 2016 , the factors that impacted the allowance for loan and lease losses included improvements in the credit quality of the portfolios driven by continuing improvements in the U.S. economy and labor markets, proactive credit risk management initiatives and the impact of high credit quality originations. Evidencing the improvements in the U.S. economy and labor markets are growth in consumer spending, downward unemployment trends and increases in home prices. In addition to these improvements, in the consumer portfolio, loan sales, returns to performing status, paydowns and charge-offs continued to outpace new nonaccrual loans. During 2016 , the allowance for loan and lease losses in the commercial portfolio reflected increased coverage for the energy sector due to low oil prices which impacted the financial performance of energy clients and contributed to an increase in reservable criticized balances. While we experienced some deterioration in the energy sector in 2016, oil prices have stabilized which contributed to a modest improvement in energy-related exposure by year end. We monitor differences between estimated and actual incurred loan and lease losses. This monitoring process includes periodic assessments by senior management of loan and lease portfolios and the models used to estimate incurred losses in those portfolios. Additions to, or reductions of, the allowance for loan and lease losses generally are recorded through charges or credits to the provision for credit losses. Credit exposures deemed to be uncollectible are charged against the allowance for loan and lease losses. Recoveries of previously charged off amounts are credited to the allowance for loan and lease losses. The allowance for loan and lease losses for the consumer portfolio, as presented in Table 47 , was $6.2 billion at December 31, 2016 , a decrease of $1.2 billion from December 31, 2015 . The decrease was primarily in the home equity and residential mortgage portfolios. Reductions in the residential mortgage and home equity portfolios were due to improved home prices, lower nonperforming loans and a decrease in consumer loan balances, as well as write-offs in our PCI loan portfolio. The allowance related to the U.S. credit card and unsecured consumer lending portfolios at December 31, 2016 remained relatively unchanged and in line with the level of delinquencies compared to December 31, 2015 . For example, in the U.S. credit card portfolio, accruing loans 30 days or more past due remained relatively unchanged at $1.6 billion at December 31, 2016 (to 1.73 percent from 1.76 percent of outstanding U.S. credit card loans at December 31, 2015 ), while accruing loans 90 days or more past due decreased to $782 million at December 31, 2016 from $789 million (to 0.85 percent from 0.88 percent of outstanding U.S. credit card loans) at December 31, 2015 . See Tables 20 and 21 for additional details on key credit statistics for the credit card and other unsecured consumer lending portfolios. The allowance for loan and lease losses for the commercial portfolio, as presented in Table 47 , was $5.3 billion at December 31, 2016 , an increase of $409 million from December 31, 2015 driven by increased allowance coverage for the higher risk energy sub-sectors as a result of low oil prices. Commercial utilized reservable criticized exposure increased to $16.3 billion at December 31, 2016 from $15.9 billion (to 3.35 percent from 3.38 percent of total commercial utilized reservable exposure) at December 31, 2015 , largely due to downgrades outpacing paydowns and upgrades in the energy portfolio. Nonperforming commercial loans increased to $1.7 billion at December 31, 2016 from $1.2 billion (to 0.38 percent from 0.28 percent of outstanding commercial loans excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option) at December 31, 2015 with the increase primarily in the energy and metals and mining sectors. Commercial loans and leases outstanding increased to $458.5 billion at December 31, 2016 from $440.8 billion at December 31, 2015 . See Tables 32 , 33 and 35 for additional details on key commercial credit statistics. The allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of total loans and leases outstanding was 1.26 percent at December 31, 2016 compared to 1.37 percent at December 31, 2015 . The decrease in the ratio was primarily due to improved 76 Bank of America 2016 credit quality in the consumer portfolios driven by improved economic conditions and write-offs in the PCI loan portfolio. The December 31, 2016 and 2015 ratios above include the PCI loan portfolio. Excluding the PCI loan portfolio, the allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of total loans and leases outstanding was 1.24 percent and 1.31 percent at December 31, 2016 and 2015 . Table 46 presents a rollforward of the allowance for credit losses, which includes the allowance for loan and lease losses and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments, for 2016 and 2015 .

Consumer loans accounted for under the fair value option included residential mortgage loans of $710 million and $1.6 billion and home equity loans of $341 million and $250 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015 . Commercial loans accounted for under the fair value option included U.S. commercial loans of $2.9 billion and $2.3 billion and non-U.S. commercial loans of $3.1 billion and $2.8 billion at December 31, 2016 and 2015 .

(5) Represents allowance for loan and lease losses related to the non-U.S. credit card loan portfolio, which is included in assets of business held for sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2016. 78 Bank of America 2016 Reserve for Unfunded Lending Commitments In addition to the allowance for loan and lease losses, we also estimate probable losses related to unfunded lending commitments such as letters of credit, financial guarantees, unfunded bankers acceptances and binding loan commitments, excluding commitments accounted for under the fair value option. Unfunded lending commitments are subject to the same assessment as funded loans, including estimates of probability of default and LGD. Due to the nature of unfunded commitments, the estimate of probable losses must also consider utilization. To estimate the portion of these undrawn commitments that is likely to be drawn by a borrower at the time of estimated default, analyses of our historical experience are applied to the unfunded commitments to estimate the funded exposure at default (EAD). The expected loss for unfunded lending commitments is the product of the probability of default, the LGD and the EAD, adjusted for any qualitative factors including economic uncertainty and inherent imprecision in models. The reserve for unfunded lending commitments was $762 million at December 31, 2016 , an increase of $116 million from December 31, 2015 . The increase was primarily attributable to increased coverage for the energy sector due to low oil prices which impacted the financial performance of energy clients. Market Risk Management Market risk is the risk that changes in market conditions may adversely impact the value of assets or liabilities, or otherwise negatively impact earnings. This risk is inherent in the financial instruments associated with our operations, primarily within our Global Markets segment. We are also exposed to these risks in other areas of the Corporation (e.g., our ALM activities). In the event of market stress, these risks could have a material impact on our results. For additional information, see Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book on page 84 . Our traditional banking loan and deposit products are non-trading positions and are generally reported at amortized cost for assets or the amount owed for liabilities (historical cost). However, these positions are still subject to changes in economic value based on varying market conditions, with one of the primary risks being changes in the levels of interest rates. The risk of adverse changes in the economic value of our non-trading positions arising from changes in interest rates is managed through our ALM activities. We have elected to account for certain assets and liabilities under the fair value option. Our trading positions are reported at fair value with changes reflected in income. Trading positions are subject to various changes in market-based risk factors. The majority of this risk is generated by our activities in the interest rate, foreign exchange, credit, equity and commodities markets. In addition, the values of assets and liabilities could change due to market liquidity, correlations across markets and expectations of market volatility. We seek to manage these risk exposures by using a variety of techniques that encompass a broad range of financial instruments. The key risk management techniques are discussed in more detail in the Trading Risk Management section. Global Risk Management is responsible for providing senior management with a clear and comprehensive understanding of the trading risks to which we are exposed. These responsibilities include ownership of market risk policy, developing and maintaining quantitative risk models, calculating aggregated risk measures, establishing and monitoring position limits consistent with risk appetite, conducting daily reviews and analysis of trading inventory, approving material risk exposures and fulfilling regulatory requirements. Market risks that impact businesses outside of Global Markets are monitored and governed by their respective governance functions. Quantitative risk models, such as VaR, are an essential component in evaluating the market risks within a portfolio. The Enterprise Model Risk Committee (EMRC), a subcommittee of the MRC, is responsible for providing management oversight and approval of model risk management and governance. The EMRC defines model risk standards, consistent with our risk framework and risk appetite, prevailing regulatory guidance and industry best practice. Models must meet certain validation criteria, including effective challenge of the model development process and a sufficient demonstration of developmental evidence incorporating a comparison of alternative theories and approaches. The EMRC oversees that model standards are consistent with model risk requirements and monitors the effective challenge in the model validation process across the Corporation. In addition, the relevant stakeholders must agree on any required actions or restrictions to the models and maintain a stringent monitoring process for continued compliance. Interest Rate Risk Interest rate risk represents exposures to instruments whose values vary with the level or volatility of interest rates. These instruments include, but are not limited to, loans, debt securities, certain trading-related assets and liabilities, deposits, borrowings and derivatives. Hedging instruments used to mitigate these risks include derivatives such as options, futures, forwards and swaps. Foreign Exchange Risk Foreign exchange risk represents exposures to changes in the values of current holdings and future cash flows denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. The types of instruments exposed to this risk include investments in non-U.S. subsidiaries, foreign currency-denominated loans and securities, future cash flows in foreign currencies arising from foreign exchange transactions, foreign currency-denominated debt and various foreign exchange derivatives whose values fluctuate with changes in the level or volatility of currency exchange rates or non-U.S. interest rates. Hedging instruments used to mitigate this risk include foreign exchange options, currency swaps, futures, forwards, and foreign currency-denominated debt and deposits. Mortgage Risk Mortgage risk represents exposures to changes in the values of mortgage-related instruments. The values of these instruments are sensitive to prepayment rates, mortgage rates, agency debt ratings, default, market liquidity, government participation and interest rate volatility. Our exposure to these instruments takes several forms. First, we trade and engage in market-making activities in a variety of mortgage securities including whole loans, pass-through certificates, commercial mortgages and collateralized mortgage obligations including collateralized debt obligations (CDO) using mortgages as underlying collateral. Second, we originate a variety of MBS which involves the accumulation of mortgage-related loans in anticipation of eventual securitization. Third, we may hold positions in mortgage securities and residential mortgage loans as part of the ALM portfolio. Fourth, we create MSRs as part of our mortgage origination activities. For more information on MSRs, see Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles and Note 23 Mortgage Servicing Rights to Bank of America 2016 79 the Consolidated Financial Statements . Hedging instruments used to mitigate this risk include derivatives such as options, swaps, futures and forwards as well as securities including MBS and U.S. Treasury securities. For additional information, see Mortgage Banking Risk Management on page 86 . Equity Market Risk Equity market risk represents exposures to securities that represent an ownership interest in a corporation in the form of domestic and foreign common stock or other equity-linked instruments. Instruments that would lead to this exposure include, but are not limited to, the following: common stock, exchange-traded funds, American Depositary Receipts, convertible bonds, listed equity options (puts and calls), OTC equity options, equity total return swaps, equity index futures and other equity derivative products. Hedging instruments used to mitigate this risk include options, futures, swaps, convertible bonds and cash positions. Commodity Risk Commodity risk represents exposures to instruments traded in the petroleum, natural gas, power and metals markets. These instruments consist primarily of futures, forwards, swaps and options. Hedging instruments used to mitigate this risk include options, futures and swaps in the same or similar commodity product, as well as cash positions. Issuer Credit Risk Issuer credit risk represents exposures to changes in the creditworthiness of individual issuers or groups of issuers. Our portfolio is exposed to issuer credit risk where the value of an asset may be adversely impacted by changes in the levels of credit spreads, by credit migration or by defaults. Hedging instruments used to mitigate this risk include bonds, CDS and other credit fixed-income instruments. Market Liquidity Risk Market liquidity risk represents the risk that the level of expected market activity changes dramatically and, in certain cases, may even cease. This exposes us to the risk that we will not be able to transact business and execute trades in an orderly manner which may impact our results. This impact could be further exacerbated if expected hedging or pricing correlations are compromised by disproportionate demand or lack of demand for certain instruments. We utilize various risk mitigating techniques as discussed in more detail in Trading Risk Management. Trading Risk Management To evaluate risk in our trading activities, we focus on the actual and potential volatility of revenues generated by individual positions as well as portfolios of positions. Various techniques and procedures are utilized to enable the most complete understanding of these risks. Quantitative measures of market risk are evaluated on a daily basis from a single position to the portfolio of the Corporation. These measures include sensitivities of positions to various market risk factors, such as the potential impact on revenue from a one basis point change in interest rates, and statistical measures utilizing both actual and hypothetical market moves, such as VaR and stress testing. Periods of extreme market stress influence the reliability of these techniques to varying degrees. Qualitative evaluations of market risk utilize the suite of quantitative risk measures while understanding each of their respective limitations. Additionally, risk managers independently evaluate the risk of the portfolios under the current market environment and potential future environments. VaR is a common statistic used to measure market risk as it allows the aggregation of market risk factors, including the effects of portfolio diversification. A VaR model simulates the value of a portfolio under a range of scenarios in order to generate a distribution of potential gains and losses. VaR represents the loss a portfolio is not expected to exceed more than a certain number of times per period, based on a specified holding period, confidence level and window of historical data. We use one VaR model consistently across the trading portfolios and it uses a historical simulation approach based on a three-year window of historical data. Our primary VaR statistic is equivalent to a 99 percent confidence level. This means that for a VaR with a one-day holding period, there should not be losses in excess of VaR, on average, 99 out of 100 trading days. Within any VaR model, there are significant and numerous assumptions that will differ from company to company. The accuracy of a VaR model depends on the availability and quality of historical data for each of the risk factors in the portfolio. A VaR model may require additional modeling assumptions for new products that do not have the necessary historical market data or for less liquid positions for which accurate daily prices are not consistently available. For positions with insufficient historical data for the VaR calculation, the process for establishing an appropriate proxy is based on fundamental and statistical analysis of the new product or less liquid position. This analysis identifies reasonable alternatives that replicate both the expected volatility and correlation to other market risk factors that the missing data would be expected to experience. VaR may not be indicative of realized revenue volatility as changes in market conditions or in the composition of the portfolio can have a material impact on the results. In particular, the historical data used for the VaR calculation might indicate higher or lower levels of portfolio diversification than will be experienced. In order for the VaR model to reflect current market conditions, we update the historical data underlying our VaR model on a weekly basis, or more frequently during periods of market stress, and regularly review the assumptions underlying the model. A relatively minor portion of risks related to our trading positions is not included in VaR. These risks are reviewed as part of our ICAAP. For more information regarding ICAAP, see Capital Management on page 45 . Global Risk Management continually reviews, evaluates and enhances our VaR model so that it reflects the material risks in our trading portfolio. Changes to the VaR model are reviewed and approved prior to implementation and any material changes are reported to management through the appropriate management committees. Trading limits on quantitative risk measures, including VaR, are independently set by Global Markets Risk Management and reviewed on a regular basis so they remain relevant and within our overall risk appetite for market risks. Trading limits are reviewed in the context of market liquidity, volatility and strategic business priorities. Trading limits are set at both a granular level to allow for extensive coverage of risks as well as at aggregated portfolios to account for correlations among risk factors. All trading limits are approved at least annually. Approved trading limits are stored and tracked in a centralized limits management system. Trading limit excesses are communicated to management for review. Certain quantitative market risk measures and corresponding limits have been identified as critical in the Corporation Risk 80 Bank of America 2016 Appetite Statement. These risk appetite limits are reported on a daily basis and are approved at least annually by the ERC and the Board. In periods of market stress, Global Markets senior leadership communicates daily to discuss losses, key risk positions and any limit excesses. As a result of this process, the businesses may selectively reduce risk. Table 48 presents the total market-based trading portfolio VaR which is the combination of the covered positions trading portfolio and the impact from less liquid trading exposures. Covered positions are defined by regulatory standards as trading assets and liabilities, both on- and off-balance sheet, that meet a defined set of specifications. These specifications identify the most liquid trading positions which are intended to be held for a short-term horizon and where we are able to hedge the material risk elements in a two-way market. Positions in less liquid markets, or where there are restrictions on the ability to trade the positions, typically do not qualify as covered positions. Foreign exchange and commodity positions are always considered covered positions, except for structural foreign currency positions that we choose to exclude with prior regulatory approval. In addition, Table 48 presents our fair value option portfolio, which includes substantially all of the funded and unfunded exposures for which we elect the fair value option, and their corresponding hedges. The fair value option portfolio combined with the total market-based trading portfolio VaR represents our total market-based portfolio VaR. Additionally, market risk VaR for trading activities as presented in Table 48 differs from VaR used for regulatory capital calculations due to the holding period being used. The holding period for VaR used for regulatory capital calculations is 10 days, while for the market risk VaR presented below it is one day. Both measures utilize the same process and methodology. The total market-based portfolio VaR results in Table 48 include market risk to which we are exposed from all business segments, excluding CVA and DVA. The majority of this portfolio is within the Global Markets segment. Table 48 presents year-end, average, high and low daily trading VaR for 2016 and 2015 using a 99 percent confidence level. Table 48 Market Risk VaR for Trading Activities 2016 2015 (Dollars in millions) Year End Average High (1) Low (1) Year End Average High (1) Low (1) Foreign exchange $ 8 $ 9 $ 16 $ 5 $ 10 $ 10 $ 42 $ 5 Interest rate 11 19 30 10 17 25 42 14 Credit 25 30 37 25 32 35 46 27 Equity 19 18 30 11 18 16 33 9 Commodity 4 6 12 3 4 5 8 3 Portfolio diversification (39 ) (46 ) (36 ) (46 ) Total covered positions trading portfolio 28 36 50 24 45 45 66 26 Impact from less liquid exposures 6 5 3 8 Total market-based trading portfolio 34 41 58 28 48 53 74 31 Fair value option loans 14 23 40 12 35 26 36 17 Fair value option hedges 6 11 22 5 17 14 22 8 Fair value option portfolio diversification (10 ) (21 ) (35 ) (26 ) Total fair value option portfolio 10 13 20 8 17 14 19 10 Portfolio diversification (4 ) (6 ) (4 ) (6 ) Total market-based portfolio $ 40 $ 48 $ 70 $ 32 $ 61 $ 61 $ 85 $ 41 (1) The high and low for each portfolio may have occurred on different trading days than the high and low for the components. Therefore the impact from less liquid exposures and the amount of portfolio diversification, which is the difference between the total portfolio and the sum of the individual components, are not relevant. The average total market-based trading portfolio VaR decreased during 2016 primarily due to reduced exposure to the interest rate and credit markets. Bank of America 2016 81 The graph below presents the daily total market-based trading portfolio VaR for 2016 , corresponding to the data in Table 48 . Additional VaR statistics produced within our single VaR model are provided in Table 49 at the same level of detail as in Table 48 . Evaluating VaR with additional statistics allows for an increased understanding of the risks in the portfolio as the historical market data used in the VaR calculation does not necessarily follow a predefined statistical distribution. Table 49 presents average trading VaR statistics at 99 percent and 95 percent confidence levels for 2016 and 2015 . Table 49 Average Market Risk VaR for Trading Activities 99 percent and 95 percent VaR Statistics 2016 2015 (Dollars in millions) 99 percent 95 percent 99 percent 95 percent Foreign exchange $ 9 $ 5 $ 10 $ 6 Interest rate 19 12 25 15 Credit 30 18 35 20 Equity 18 11 16 9 Commodity 6 3 5 3 Portfolio diversification (46 ) (30 ) (46 ) (31 ) Total covered positions trading portfolio 36 19 45 22 Impact from less liquid exposures 5 3 8 3 Total market-based trading portfolio 41 22 53 25 Fair value option loans 23 13 26 15 Fair value option hedges 11 8 14 9 Fair value option portfolio diversification (21 ) (13 ) (26 ) (16 ) Total fair value option portfolio 13 8 14 8 Portfolio diversification (6 ) (4 ) (6 ) (5 ) Total market-based portfolio $ 48 $ 26 $ 61 $ 28 Backtesting The accuracy of the VaR methodology is evaluated by backtesting, which compares the daily VaR results, utilizing a one-day holding period, against a comparable subset of trading revenue. A backtesting excess occurs when a trading loss exceeds the VaR for the corresponding day. These excesses are evaluated to understand the positions and market moves that produced the trading loss and to ensure that the VaR methodology accurately represents those losses. We expect the frequency of trading losses in excess of VaR to be in line with the confidence level of the VaR statistic being tested. For example, with a 99 percent confidence level, we expect one trading loss in excess of VaR every 100 days or between two to three trading losses in excess of VaR over the course of a year. The number of backtesting excesses observed can differ from the statistically expected number of excesses if the current level of market volatility is materially different than the level of market volatility that existed during the three years of historical data used in the VaR calculation. The trading revenue used for backtesting is defined by regulatory agencies in order to most closely align with the VaR component of the regulatory capital calculation. This revenue differs from total trading-related revenue in that it excludes revenue from trading activities that either do not generate market risk or the market risk cannot be included in VaR. Some examples of the types of revenue excluded for backtesting are fees, commissions, reserves, net interest income and intraday trading revenues. We conduct daily backtesting on our portfolios, ranging from the total market-based portfolio to individual trading areas. Additionally, we conduct daily backtesting on the VaR results used for regulatory capital calculations as well as the VaR results for key legal entities, regions and risk factors. These results are reported to senior market risk management. Senior management regularly reviews and evaluates the results of these tests. 82 Bank of America 2016 During 2016 , there were no days in which there was a backtesting excess for our total market-based portfolio VaR, utilizing a one-day holding period. Total Trading-related Revenue Total trading-related revenue, excluding brokerage fees, and CVA, DVA and funding valuation adjustment (FVA) gains (losses), represents the total amount earned from trading positions, including market-based net interest income, which are taken in a diverse range of financial instruments and markets. Trading account assets and liabilities are reported at fair value. For more information on fair value, see Note 20 Fair Value Measurements to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Trading-related revenue can be volatile and is largely driven by general market conditions and customer demand. Also, trading-related revenue is dependent on the volume and type of transactions, the level of risk assumed, and the volatility of price and rate movements at any given time within the ever-changing market environment. Significant daily revenue by business is monitored and the primary drivers of these are reviewed. The histogram below is a graphic depiction of trading volatility and illustrates the daily level of trading-related revenue for 2016 and 2015 . During 2016 , positive trading-related revenue was recorded for 99 percent of the trading days, of which 84 percent were daily trading gains of over $25 million and the largest loss was $24 million. This compares to 2015 where positive trading-related revenue was recorded for 98 percent of the trading days, of which 77 percent were daily trading gains of over $25 million and the largest loss was $22 million. Trading Portfolio Stress Testing Because the very nature of a VaR model suggests results can exceed our estimates and it is dependent on a limited historical window, we also stress test our portfolio using scenario analysis. This analysis estimates the change in the value of our trading portfolio that may result from abnormal market movements. A set of scenarios, categorized as either historical or hypothetical, are computed daily for the overall trading portfolio and individual businesses. These scenarios include shocks to underlying market risk factors that may be well beyond the shocks found in the historical data used to calculate VaR. Historical scenarios simulate the impact of the market moves that occurred during a period of extended historical market stress. Generally, a multi-week period representing the most severe point during a crisis is selected for each historical scenario. Hypothetical scenarios provide estimated portfolio impacts from potential future market stress events. Scenarios are reviewed and updated in response to changing positions and new economic or political information. In addition, new or ad hoc scenarios are developed to address specific potential market events or particular vulnerabilities in the portfolio. The stress tests are reviewed on a regular basis and the results are presented to senior management. Stress testing for the trading portfolio is integrated with enterprise-wide stress testing and incorporated into the limits framework. The macroeconomic scenarios used for enterprise-wide stress testing purposes differ from the typical trading portfolio scenarios in that they have a longer time horizon and the results are forecasted over multiple periods for use in consolidated capital and liquidity planning. For additional information, see Managing Risk on page 44 . Bank of America 2016 83 Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book The following discussion presents net interest income for banking book activities. Interest rate risk represents the most significant market risk exposure to our banking book balance sheet. Interest rate risk is measured as the potential change in net interest income caused by movements in market interest rates. Client-facing activities, primarily lending and deposit-taking, create interest rate sensitive positions on our balance sheet. We prepare forward-looking forecasts of net interest income. The baseline forecast takes into consideration expected future business growth, ALM positioning and the direction of interest rate movements as implied by the market-based forward curve. We then measure and evaluate the impact that alternative interest rate scenarios have on the baseline forecast in order to assess interest rate sensitivity under varied conditions. The net interest income forecast is frequently updated for changing assumptions and differing outlooks based on economic trends, market conditions and business strategies. Thus, we continually monitor our balance sheet position in order to maintain an acceptable level of exposure to interest rate changes. The interest rate scenarios that we analyze incorporate balance sheet assumptions such as loan and deposit growth and pricing, changes in funding mix, product repricing and maturity characteristics. Our overall goal is to manage interest rate risk so that movements in interest rates do not significantly adversely affect earnings and capital. Table 50 presents the spot and 12-month forward rates used in our baseline forecasts at December 31, 2016 and 2015 . Table 50 Forward Rates December 31, 2016 Federal Funds Three-month LIBOR 10-Year Swap Spot rates 0.75 % 1.00 % 2.34 % 12-month forward rates 1.25 1.51 2.49 December 31, 2015 Spot rates 0.50 % 0.61 % 2.19 % 12-month forward rates 1.00 1.22 2.39 Table 51 shows the pretax dollar impact to forecasted net interest income over the next 12 months from December 31, 2016 and 2015 , resulting from instantaneous parallel and non-parallel shocks to the market-based forward curve. Periodically we evaluate the scenarios presented so that they are meaningful in the context of the current rate environment. During 2016 , the asset sensitivity of our balance sheet decreased primarily driven by higher long-end rates. We continue to be asset sensitive to a parallel move in interest rates with the majority of that benefit coming from the short end of the yield curve. Additionally, higher interest rates impact the fair value of debt securities and, accordingly, for debt securities classified as AFS, may adversely affect accumulated OCI and thus capital levels under the Basel 3 capital rules. Under instantaneous upward parallel shifts, the near-term adverse impact to Basel 3 capital is reduced over time by offsetting positive impacts to net interest income. For more information on the transition provisions of Basel 3, see Capital Management Regulatory Capital on page 45 . Table 51 Estimated Banking Book Net Interest Income Sensitivity (Dollars in millions) Short Rate (bps) Long Rate (bps) December 31 Curve Change 2016 2015 Parallel Shifts +100 bps instantaneous shift +100 +100 $ 3,370 $ 3,606 -50 bps instantaneous shift -50 -50 (2,900 ) (3,458 ) Flatteners Short-end instantaneous change +100 2,473 2,418 Long-end instantaneous change -50 (961 ) (1,767 ) Steepeners Short-end instantaneous change -50 (1,918 ) (1,672 ) Long-end instantaneous change +100 928 1,217 The sensitivity analysis in Table 51 assumes that we take no action in response to these rate shocks and does not assume any change in other macroeconomic variables normally correlated with changes in interest rates. As part of our ALM activities, we use securities, certain residential mortgages, and interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives in managing interest rate sensitivity. The behavior of our deposit portfolio in the baseline forecast and in alternate interest rate scenarios is a key assumption in our projected estimates of net interest income. The sensitivity analysis in Table 51 assumes no change in deposit portfolio size or mix from the baseline forecast in alternate rate environments. In higher rate scenarios, any customer activity resulting in the replacement of low-cost or noninterest-bearing deposits with higher-yielding deposits or market-based funding would reduce our benefit in those scenarios. Interest Rate and Foreign Exchange Derivative Contracts Interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts are utilized in our ALM activities and serve as an efficient tool to manage our interest rate and foreign exchange risk. We use derivatives to hedge the variability in cash flows or changes in fair value on our balance sheet due to interest rate and foreign exchange components. For more information on our hedging activities, see Note 2 Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Our interest rate contracts are generally non-leveraged generic interest rate and foreign exchange basis swaps, options, futures and forwards. In addition, we use foreign exchange contracts, including cross-currency interest rate swaps, foreign currency futures contracts, foreign currency forward contracts and options to mitigate the foreign exchange risk associated with foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities. Changes to the composition of our derivatives portfolio during 2016 reflect actions taken for interest rate and foreign exchange rate risk management. The decisions to reposition our derivatives portfolio are based on the current assessment of economic and financial conditions including the interest rate and foreign currency environments, balance sheet composition and trends, and the relative mix of our cash and derivative positions. 84 Bank of America 2016 Table 52 presents derivatives utilized in our ALM activities including those designated as accounting and economic hedging instruments and shows the notional amount, fair value, weighted-average receive-fixed and pay-fixed rates, expected maturity and average estimated durations of our open ALM derivatives at December 31, 2016 and 2015 . These amounts do not include derivative hedges on our MSRs.

(2) At December 31, 2016 and 2015 , the notional amount of same-currency basis swaps included $59.3 billion and $75.2 billion in both foreign currency and U.S. Dollar-denominated basis swaps in which both sides of the swap are in the same currency. (3) Foreign exchange basis swaps consisted of cross-currency variable interest rate swaps used separately or in conjunction with receive-fixed interest rate swaps.

(6) Reflects the net of long and short positions. Amounts shown as negative reflect a net short position. (7) The notional amount of foreign exchange contracts of $(20.3) billion at December 31, 2016 was comprised of $21.5 billion in foreign currency-denominated and cross-currency receive-fixed swaps, $(38.5) billion in net foreign currency forward rate contracts, $(4.6) billion in foreign currency-denominated pay-fixed swaps and $1.3 billion in net foreign currency futures contracts. Foreign exchange contracts of $(25.4) billion at December 31, 2015 were comprised of $21.3 billion in foreign currency-denominated and cross-currency receive-fixed swaps, $(40.3) billion in net foreign currency forward rate contracts, $(7.6) billion in foreign currency-denominated pay-fixed swaps and $1.2 billion in foreign currency futures contracts. Bank of America 2016 85 We use interest rate derivative instruments to hedge the variability in the cash flows of our assets and liabilities and other forecasted transactions (collectively referred to as cash flow hedges). The net losses on both open and terminated cash flow hedge derivative instruments recorded in accumulated OCI were $1.4 billion and $1.7 billion , on a pretax basis, at December 31, 2016 and 2015 . These net losses are expected to be reclassified into earnings in the same period as the hedged cash flows affect earnings and will decrease income or increase expense on the respective hedged cash flows. Assuming no change in open cash flow derivative hedge positions and no changes in prices or interest rates beyond what is implied in forward yield curves at December 31, 2016 , the pretax net losses are expected to be reclassified into earnings as follows: $205 million , or 14 percent within the next year, 47 percent in years two through five, and 28 percent in years six through ten, with the remaining 11 percent thereafter. For more information on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, see Note 2 Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements . We hedge our net investment in non-U.S. operations determined to have functional currencies other than the U.S. Dollar using forward foreign exchange contracts that typically settle in less than 180 days, cross-currency basis swaps and foreign exchange options. We recorded net after-tax losses on derivatives in accumulated OCI associated with net investment hedges which were offset by gains on our net investments in consolidated non-U.S. entities at December 31, 2016 . Mortgage Banking Risk Management We originate, fund and service mortgage loans, which subject us to credit, liquidity and interest rate risks, among others. We determine whether loans will be held-for-investment or held-for-sale at the time of commitment and manage credit and liquidity risks by selling or securitizing a portion of the loans we originate. Interest rate risk and market risk can be substantial in the mortgage business. Fluctuations in interest rates drive consumer demand for new mortgages and the level of refinancing activity which, in turn, affects total origination and servicing income. Hedging the various sources of interest rate risk in mortgage banking is a complex process that requires complex modeling and ongoing monitoring. Typically, an increase in mortgage interest rates will lead to a decrease in mortgage originations and related fees. IRLCs and the related residential first mortgage LHFS are subject to interest rate risk between the date of the IRLC and the date the loans are sold to the secondary market, as an increase in mortgage interest rates typically leads to a decrease in the value of these instruments. MSRs are nonfinancial assets created when the underlying mortgage loan is sold to investors and we retain the right to service the loan. Typically, an increase in mortgage rates will lead to an increase in the value of the MSRs driven by lower prepayment expectations. This increase in value from increases in mortgage rates is opposite of, and therefore offsets, the risk described for IRLCs and LHFS. Because the interest rate risks of these two hedged items offset, we combine them into one overall hedged item with one combined economic hedge portfolio. To hedge these combined assets, we use certain derivatives such as interest rate options, interest rate swaps, forward sale commitments, eurodollar and U.S. Treasury futures, and mortgage TBAs, as well as other securities including agency MBS, principal-only and interest-only MBS and U.S. Treasury securities. During 2016 and 2015 , we recorded gains in mortgage banking income of $366 million and $360 million related to the change in fair value of the derivative contracts and other securities used to hedge the market risks of the MSRs, IRLCs and LHFS, net of gains and losses due to changes in fair value of these hedged items. For more information on MSRs, see Note 23 Mortgage Servicing Rights to the Consolidated Financial Statements and for more information on mortgage banking income, see Consumer Banking on page 30 . Compliance Risk Management Compliance risk is the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, material financial loss or damage to the reputation of the Corporation arising from the failure of the Corporation to comply with the requirements of applicable laws, rules, regulations and related self-regulatory organizations standards and codes of conduct (collectively, applicable laws, rules and regulations). Global Compliance independently assesses compliance risk, and evaluates FLUs and control functions for adherence to applicable laws, rules and regulations, including identifying compliance issues and risks, performing monitoring and independent testing, and reporting on the state of compliance activities across the Corporation. Additionally, Global Compliance works with FLUs and control functions so that day-to-day activities operate in a compliant manner. The Corporation approach to the management of compliance risk is described in the Global Compliance Enterprise Policy, which outlines the requirements of the Corporation global compliance program, and defines roles and responsibilities of FLUs, IRM and Corporate Audit, the three lines of defense in managing compliance risk. The requirements work together to drive a comprehensive risk-based approach for the proactive identification, management and escalation of compliance risks throughout the Corporation. For more information on FLUs and control functions, see Managing Risk on page 41 . The Global Compliance Enterprise Policy also sets the requirements for reporting compliance risk information to executive management as well as the Board or appropriate Board-level committees in support of Global Compliance's responsibility for conducting independent oversight of the Corporation compliance risk management activities. The Board provides oversight of compliance risk through its Audit Committee and the ERC. Operational Risk Management The Corporation defines operational risk as the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events. Operational risk may occur anywhere in the Corporation, including third-party business processes, and is not limited to operations functions. Effects may extend beyond financial losses and may result in reputational risk impacts. Operational risk includes legal risk. Successful operational risk management is particularly important to diversified financial services companies because of the nature, volume and complexity of the financial services business. Operational risk is a significant component in the calculation of total risk-weighted assets used in the Basel 3 capital calculation under the Advanced approaches. For more information on Basel 3 Advanced approaches, see Capital Management on page 45 . We approach operational risk management from two perspectives within the structure of the Corporation: (1) at the enterprise level to provide independent, integrated management of operational risk across the organization, and (2) at the business and control function levels to address operational risk in revenue 86 Bank of America 2016 producing and non-revenue producing units. The Operational Risk Management Program addresses the overarching processes for identifying, measuring, monitoring and controlling operational risk, and reporting operational risk information to management and the Board. Our internal governance structure enhances the effectiveness of the Corporation Operational Risk Management Program and is administered at the enterprise level through formal oversight by the Board, the ERC, the CRO and a variety of management committees and risk oversight groups aligned to the Corporation overall risk governance framework and practices. Of these, the MRC oversees the Corporation policies and processes for operational risk management. The MRC also serves as an escalation point for critical operational risk matters within the Corporation. The MRC reports operational risk activities to the ERC. The independent operational risk management teams oversee the businesses and control functions to monitor adherence to the Operational Risk Management Program and advise and challenge operational risk exposures. Within the Global Risk Management organization, the Corporate Operational Risk team develops and guides the strategies, enterprise-wide policies, practices, controls and monitoring tools for assessing and managing operational risks across the organization. The Corporate Operational Risk team reports results to businesses, control functions, senior management, management committees, the ERC and the Board. The FLUs and control functions are responsible for assessing, monitoring and managing all the risks within their units, including operational risks. In addition to enterprise risk management tools such as loss reporting, scenario analysis and Risk and Control Self Assessments (RCSAs), operational risk executives, working in conjunction with senior business executives, have developed key tools to help identify, measure, monitor and control risk in each business and control function. Examples of these include personnel management practices; data management, data quality controls and related processes; fraud management units; cybersecurity controls, processes and systems; transaction processing, monitoring and analysis; business recovery planning; and new product introduction processes. The FLUs and control functions are also responsible for consistently implementing and monitoring adherence to corporate practices. Among the key tools in the risk management process are the RCSAs. The RCSA process, consistent with identification, measurement, monitoring and control, is one of our primary methods for capturing the identification and assessment of operational risk exposures, including inherent and residual operational risk ratings, and control effectiveness ratings. The end-to-end RCSA process incorporates risk identification and assessment of the control environment; monitoring, reporting and escalating risk; quality assurance and data validation; and integration with the risk appetite. Key operational risk indicators have been developed and are used to assist in identifying trends and issues on an enterprise, business and control function level. This results in a comprehensive risk management view that enables understanding of and action on operational risks and controls for our processes, products, activities and systems. Independent review and challenge to the Corporation overall operational risk management framework is performed by the Enterprise Independent Testing Team and reported through the operational risk governance committees and management routines. Insurance maintained by the Corporation may mitigate the impact of operational losses. Certain insurance is purchased to be in compliance with laws, regulations or legal requirements, and in conjunction with specific hedging strategies to reduce adverse financial impacts arising from operational losses. Reputational Risk Management Reputational risk is the risk that negative perceptions of the Corporation conduct or business practices may adversely impact its profitability or operations through an inability to establish new or maintain existing customer/client relationships or otherwise impact relationships with key stakeholders, such as investors, regulators, employees and the community. Reputational risk may result from many of the Corporation activities, including those related to the management of our strategic, operational, compliance and credit risks. The Corporation manages reputational risk through established policies and controls in its businesses and risk management processes to mitigate reputational risks in a timely manner and through proactive monitoring and identification of potential reputational risk events. The Corporation has processes and procedures in place to respond to events that give rise to reputational risk, including educating individuals and organizations that influence public opinion, implementing external communication strategies to mitigate the risk, and informing key stakeholders of potential reputational risks. The Corporation organization and governance structure provides oversight of reputational risks, and key risk indicators are reported regularly and directly to management and the ERC, which provides primary oversight of reputational risk. In addition, each FLU has a committee, which includes representatives from Compliance, Legal and Risk, that is responsible for the oversight of reputational risk. Such committees oversight includes providing approval for business activities that present elevated levels of reputational risks. Complex Accounting Estimates Our significant accounting principles, as described in Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements , are essential in understanding the MD&A. Many of our significant accounting principles require complex judgments to estimate the values of assets and liabilities. We have procedures and processes in place to facilitate making these judgments. The more judgmental estimates are summarized in the following discussion. We have identified and described the development of the variables most important in the estimation processes that involve mathematical models to derive the estimates. In many cases, there are numerous alternative judgments that could be used in the process of determining the inputs to the models. Where alternatives exist, we have used the factors that we believe represent the most reasonable value in developing the inputs. Actual performance that differs from our estimates of the key variables could impact our results of operations. Separate from the possible future impact to our results of operations from input and model variables, the value of our lending portfolio and market-sensitive assets and liabilities may change subsequent to the balance sheet date, often significantly, due to the nature and magnitude of future credit and market conditions. Such credit and market conditions may change quickly and in unforeseen ways and the resulting volatility could have a significant, negative effect on future operating results. These fluctuations would not be indicative of deficiencies in our models or inputs. Bank of America 2016 87 Allowance for Credit Losses The allowance for credit losses, which includes the allowance for loan and lease losses and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments, represents management estimate of probable losses inherent in the Corporation loan portfolio excluding those loans accounted for under the fair value option. Our process for determining the allowance for credit losses is discussed in Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements . We evaluate our allowance at the portfolio segment level and our portfolio segments are Consumer Real Estate, Credit Card and Other Consumer, and Commercial. Due to the variability in the drivers of the assumptions used in this process, estimates of the portfolio inherent risks and overall collectability change with changes in the economy, individual industries, countries, and borrowers ability and willingness to repay their obligations. The degree to which any particular assumption affects the allowance for credit losses depends on the severity of the change and its relationship to the other assumptions. Key judgments used in determining the allowance for credit losses include risk ratings for pools of commercial loans and leases, market and collateral values and discount rates for individually evaluated loans, product type classifications for consumer and commercial loans and leases, loss rates used for consumer and commercial loans and leases, adjustments made to address current events and conditions, considerations regarding domestic and global economic uncertainty, and overall credit conditions. Our estimate for the allowance for loan and lease losses is sensitive to the loss rates and expected cash flows from our Consumer Real Estate and Credit Card and Other Consumer portfolio segments, as well as our U.S. small business commercial card portfolio within the Commercial portfolio segment. For each one-percent increase in the loss rates on loans collectively evaluated for impairment in our Consumer Real Estate portfolio segment, excluding PCI loans, coupled with a one-percent decrease in the discounted cash flows on those loans individually evaluated for impairment within this portfolio segment, the allowance for loan and lease losses at December 31, 2016 would have increased by $51 million. PCI loans within our Consumer Real Estate portfolio segment are initially recorded at fair value. Applicable accounting guidance prohibits carry-over or creation of valuation allowances in the initial accounting. However, subsequent decreases in the expected cash flows from the date of acquisition result in a charge to the provision for credit losses and a corresponding increase to the allowance for loan and lease losses. We subject our PCI portfolio to stress scenarios to evaluate the potential impact given certain events. A one-percent decrease in the expected cash flows could result in a $127 million impairment of the portfolio. For each one-percent increase in the loss rates on loans collectively evaluated for impairment within our Credit Card and Other Consumer portfolio segment and U.S. small business commercial card portfolio, coupled with a one-percent decrease in the expected cash flows on those loans individually evaluated for impairment within the Credit Card and Other Consumer portfolio segment and the U.S. small business commercial card portfolio, the allowance for loan and lease losses at December 31, 2016 would have increased by $38 million. Our allowance for loan and lease losses is sensitive to the risk ratings assigned to loans and leases within the Commercial portfolio segment (excluding the U.S. small business commercial card portfolio). Assuming a downgrade of one level in the internal risk ratings for commercial loans and leases, except loans and leases already risk-rated Doubtful as defined by regulatory authorities, the allowance for loan and lease losses would have increased by $2.8 billion at December 31, 2016 . The allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of total loans and leases at December 31, 2016 was 1.26 percent and these hypothetical increases in the allowance would raise the ratio to 1.60 percent. These sensitivity analyses do not represent management expectations of the deterioration in risk ratings or the increases in loss rates but are provided as hypothetical scenarios to assess the sensitivity of the allowance for loan and lease losses to changes in key inputs. We believe the risk ratings and loss severities currently in use are appropriate and that the probability of the alternative scenarios outlined above occurring within a short period of time is remote. The process of determining the level of the allowance for credit losses requires a high degree of judgment. It is possible that others, given the same information, may at any point in time reach different reasonable conclusions. For more information on the Financial Accounting Standards Board's (FASB) proposed standard on accounting for credit losses, see Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Fair Value of Financial Instruments We are, under applicable accounting guidance, required to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs in measuring fair value. We classify fair value measurements of financial instruments based on the three-level fair value hierarchy in the guidance. We carry trading account assets and liabilities, derivative assets and liabilities, AFS debt and equity securities, other debt securities, consumer MSRs and certain other assets at fair value. Also, we account for certain loans and loan commitments, LHFS, short-term borrowings, securities financing agreements, asset-backed secured financings, long-term deposits and long-term debt under the fair value option. The fair values of assets and liabilities may include adjustments, such as market liquidity and credit quality, where appropriate. Valuations of products using models or other techniques are sensitive to assumptions used for the significant inputs. Where market data is available, the inputs used for valuation reflect that information as of our valuation date. Inputs to valuation models are considered unobservable if they are supported by little or no market activity. In periods of extreme volatility, lessened liquidity or in illiquid markets, there may be more variability in market pricing or a lack of market data to use in the valuation process. In keeping with the prudent application of estimates and management judgment in determining the fair value of assets and liabilities, we have in place various processes and controls that include: a model validation policy that requires review and approval of quantitative models used for deal pricing, financial statement fair value determination and risk quantification; a trading product valuation policy that requires verification of all traded product valuations; and a periodic review and substantiation of daily profit and loss reporting for all traded products. Primarily through validation controls, we utilize both broker and pricing service inputs which can and do include both market-observable and internally-modeled values and/or valuation inputs. Our reliance on this information is affected by our understanding of how the broker and/or pricing service develops 88 Bank of America 2016 its data with a higher degree of reliance applied to those that are more directly observable and lesser reliance applied to those developed through their own internal modeling. Similarly, broker quotes that are executable are given a higher level of reliance than indicative broker quotes, which are not executable. These processes and controls are performed independently of the business. For additional information, see Note 20 Fair Value Measurements and Note 21 Fair Value Option to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Level 3 Assets and Liabilities Financial assets and liabilities, and MSRs where values are based on valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and are significant to the overall fair value measurement are classified as Level 3 under the fair value hierarchy established in applicable accounting guidance. Level 3 financial assets and liabilities include certain loans, MBS, ABS, CDOs, CLOs, structured liabilities and highly structured, complex or long-dated derivative contracts and MSRs. The fair value of these Level 3 financial assets and liabilities and MSRs is determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation. Total recurring Level 3 assets were $14.5 billion , or 0.66 percent of total assets, and total recurring Level 3 liabilities were $7.2 billion , or 0.37 percent of total liabilities, at December 31, 2016 compared to $18.1 billion or 0.84 percent and $7.5 billion or 0.40 percent at December 31, 2015 . Level 3 financial instruments may be hedged with derivatives classified as Level 1 or 2; therefore, gains or losses associated with Level 3 financial instruments may be offset by gains or losses associated with financial instruments classified in other levels of the fair value hierarchy. The Level 3 gains and losses recorded in earnings did not have a significant impact on our liquidity or capital. We conduct a review of our fair value hierarchy classifications on a quarterly basis. Transfers into or out of Level 3 are made if the significant inputs used in the financial models measuring the fair values of the assets and liabilities became unobservable or observable, respectively, in the current marketplace. These transfers are considered to be effective as of the beginning of the quarter in which they occur. For more information on the significant transfers into and out of Level 3 during 2016 and 2015 , see Note 20 Fair Value Measurements to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Accrued Income Taxes and Deferred Tax Assets Accrued income taxes, reported as a component of either other assets or accrued expenses and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, represent the net amount of current income taxes we expect to pay to or receive from various taxing jurisdictions attributable to our operations to date. We currently file income tax returns in more than 100 jurisdictions and consider many factors, including statutory, judicial and regulatory guidance , in estimating the appropriate accrued income taxes for each jurisdiction. Net deferred tax assets, reported as a component of other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, represent the net decrease in taxes expected to be paid in the future because of net operating loss (NOL) and tax credit carryforwards and because of future reversals of temporary differences in the bases of assets and liabilities as measured by tax laws and their bases as reported in the financial statements. NOL and tax credit carryforwards result in reductions to future tax liabilities, and many of these attributes can expire if not utilized within certain periods. We consider the need for valuation allowances to reduce net deferred tax assets to the amounts that we estimate are more-likely-than-not to be realized. Consistent with the applicable accounting guidance, we monitor relevant tax authorities and change our estimates of accrued income taxes and/or net deferred tax assets due to changes in income tax laws and their interpretation by the courts and regulatory authorities. These revisions of our estimates, which also may result from our income tax planning and from the resolution of income tax audit matters, may be material to our operating results for any given period. See Note 19 Income Taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a table of significant tax attributes and additional information. For more information, see Item 1A. Risk Factors Regulatory, Compliance and Legal . Goodwill and Intangible Assets Background The nature of and accounting for goodwill and intangible assets are discussed in Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles and Note 8 Goodwill and Intangible Assets to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Goodwill is reviewed for potential impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis, which for the Corporation is as of June 30, and in interim periods if events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment. A reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below. 2016 Annual Goodwill Impairment Testing Estimating the fair value of reporting units is a subjective process that involves the use of estimates and judgments, particularly related to cash flows, the appropriate discount rates and an applicable control premium. We determined the fair values of the reporting units using a combination of valuation techniques consistent with the market approach and the income approach and also utilized independent valuation specialists. The market approach we used estimates the fair value of the individual reporting units by incorporating any combination of the book capital, tangible capital and earnings multiples from comparable publicly-traded companies in industries similar to the reporting unit. The relative weight assigned to these multiples varies among the reporting units based on qualitative and quantitative characteristics, primarily the size and relative profitability of the reporting unit as compared to the comparable publicly-traded companies. Since the fair values determined under the market approach are representative of a noncontrolling interest, we added a control premium to arrive at the reporting units estimated fair values on a controlling basis. For purposes of the income approach, we calculated discounted cash flows by taking the net present value of estimated future cash flows and an appropriate terminal value. Our discounted cash flow analysis employs a capital asset pricing model in estimating the discount rate (i.e., cost of equity financing) for each reporting unit. The inputs to this model include the risk-free rate of return, beta, which is a measure of the level of non-diversifiable risk associated with comparable companies for each specific reporting unit, market equity risk premium and in certain cases an unsystematic (company-specific) risk factor. We use our internal forecasts to estimate future cash flows and actual results may differ from forecasted results. Bank of America 2016 89 We completed our annual goodwill impairment test as of June 30, 2016 for all of our reporting units that had goodwill. We also evaluated the non-U.S. consumer card business within All Other , as this business comprises substantially all of the goodwill included in All Other . To determine fair value, we utilized a combination of the market approach and the income approach. Under the market approach, we compared earnings and equity multiples of the individual reporting units to multiples of public companies comparable to the individual reporting units. The control premium used in the June 30, 2016 annual goodwill impairment test was 30 percent, based upon observed comparable premiums paid for change in control transactions for financial institutions, for all reporting units. Under the income approach, we updated our assumptions to reflect the current market environment. The discount rates used in the June 30, 2016 annual goodwill impairment test ranged from 8.9 percent to 12.7 percent depending on the relative risk of a reporting unit. Cumulative average growth rates developed by management for revenues and expenses in each reporting unit ranged from negative 3.2 percent to positive 5.9 percent. Our market capitalization remained below our recorded book value during 2016 . We do not believe that our current market capitalization reflects the aggregate fair value of our individual reporting units with assigned goodwill, as our market capitalization does not include consideration of individual reporting unit control premiums. Additionally, while the impact of recent regulatory changes has been considered in the reporting units' forecasts and valuations, overall regulatory and market uncertainties persist that we believe further impact our stock price. Based on the results of step one of the annual goodwill impairment test, we determined that step two was not required for any of the reporting units as their fair value exceeded their carrying value indicating there was no impairment. In 2015 , we completed our annual goodwill impairment test as of June 30, 2015 for all of our reporting units that had goodwill. Based on the results of step one of the annual goodwill impairment test, we determined that step two was not required for any of the reporting units as their fair value exceeded their carrying value indicating there was no impairment. Representations and Warranties Liability The methodology used to estimate the liability for obligations under representations and warranties related to transfers of residential mortgage loans is a function of the type of representations and warranties provided in the sales contract and considers a variety of factors. Depending upon the counterparty, these factors include actual defaults, estimated future defaults, historical loss experience, estimated home prices, other economic conditions, estimated probability that we will receive a repurchase request, number of payments made by the borrower prior to default and estimated probability that we will be required to repurchase a loan. It also considers other relevant facts and circumstances, such as bulk settlements and identity of the counterparty or type of counterparty, as appropriate. The estimate of the liability for obligations under representations and warranties is based upon currently available information, significant judgment, and a number of factors, including those set forth above, that are subject to change. Changes to any one of these factors could significantly impact the estimate of our liability. The representations and warranties provision may vary significantly each period as the methodology used to estimate the expense continues to be refined based on the level and type of repurchase requests presented, defects identified, the latest experience gained on repurchase requests and other relevant facts and circumstances. The estimate of the liability for representations and warranties is sensitive to future defaults, loss severity and the net repurchase rate. An assumed simultaneous increase or decrease of 10 percent in estimated future defaults, loss severity and the net repurchase rate would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $250 million in the representations and warranties liability as of December 31, 2016 . These sensitivities are hypothetical and are intended to provide an indication of the impact of a significant change in these key assumptions on the representations and warranties liability. In reality, changes in one assumption may result in changes in other assumptions, which may or may not counteract the sensitivity. For more information on representations and warranties exposure and the corresponding estimated range of possible loss, see Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations Representations and Warranties on page 40 , as well as Note 7 Representations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate Guarantees and Note 12 Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements . 2015 Compared to 2014 The following discussion and analysis provide a comparison of our results of operations for 2015 and 2014 . This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes. Table 7 and Note 24 Business Segment Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements contain financial data to supplement this discussion. Overview Net Income Net income was $15.8 billion , or $1.31 per diluted share in 2015 compared to $5.5 billion , or $0.42 per diluted share in 2014 . The increase in net income for 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily driven by a decrease of $15.2 billion in litigation expense. Net Interest Income Net interest income decreased $1.8 billion to $39.0 billion in 2015 compared to 2014 . The net interest yield decreased 11 bps to 2.14 percent in 2015 . These declines were primarily driven by lower loan yields and consumer loan balances, as well as a charge of $612 million in 2015 related to the redemption of certain trust preferred securities, partially offset by lower funding costs, higher trading-related net interest income, lower rates paid on deposits and commercial loan growth. Noninterest Income Noninterest income was $44.0 billion in 2015 , a decrease of $1.1 billion compared to 2014 , which was driven by the following factors: Investment banking income decreased $493 million driven by lower debt and equity issuance fees, partially offset by higher advisory fees. 90 Bank of America 2016 Trading account profits increased $164 million . Excluding DVA, trading account profits decreased $330 million driven by declines in credit-related products reflecting lower client activity, partially offset by strong performance in equity derivatives, increased client activity in equities in the Asia-Pacific region, improvement in currencies on higher client flows and increased volatility. Mortgage banking income increased $801 million primarily due to a benefit for representations and warranties in 2015 compared to a provision in 2014 , and to a lesser extent, improved MSR net-of-hedge performance and an increase in core production revenue, partially offset by a decline in servicing fees. Other income decreased $1.2 billion primarily due to DVA gains of $407 million in 2014 compared to DVA losses of $633 million in 2015 and an $869 million decrease in equity investment income as 2014 included a gain on the sale of a portion of an equity investment and gains from an initial public offering (IPO) of an equity investment in Global Markets . These declines were partially offset by higher gains on asset sales and lower PPI costs in 2015 . Provision for Credit Losses The provision for credit losses was $3.2 billion in 2015 , an increase of $886 million compared to 2014 . The provision for credit losses was $1.2 billion lower than net charge-offs for 2015 , resulting in a reduction in the allowance for credit losses. The provision for credit losses in 2014 included $400 million of additional costs associated with the consumer relief portion of the settlement with the DoJ. Excluding these additional costs, the provision for credit losses in the consumer portfolio increased $1.1 billion compared to 2014 due to a slower pace of portfolio improvement, and also due to a lower level of recoveries on nonperforming loan sales and other recoveries in 2015 . The provision for credit losses for the commercial portfolio increased $160 million in 2015 compared to 2014 driven by energy sector exposure. Net charge-offs totaled $4.3 billion , or 0.50 percent of average loans and leases in 2015 compared to $4.4 billion, or 0.49 percent in 2014 . The decrease in net charge-offs was primarily due to credit quality improvement in the consumer portfolio, partially offset by higher net charge-offs in the commercial portfolio primarily due to lower net recoveries in commercial real estate and higher energy-related net charge-offs. Noninterest Expense Noninterest expense was $57.7 billion in 2015 , a decrease of $17.9 billion compared to 2014 , primarily driven by a decrease of $15.2 billion in litigation expense as well as the following factors: Personnel expense decreased $919 million as we continue to streamline processes, reduce headcount and achieve cost savings. Occupancy decreased $167 million primarily due to our focus on reducing our rental footprint. Professional fees decreased $208 million due to lower default-related servicing expenses and legal fees. Telecommunications expense decreased $436 million due to efficiencies gained as we have simplified our operating model, including in-sourcing certain functions. Other general operating expense decreased $16.0 billion primarily due to a decrease of $15.2 billion in litigation expense which was primarily related to previously disclosed legacy mortgage-related matters and other litigation charges in 2014. Income Tax Expense The income tax expense was $6.2 billion on pretax income of $22.1 billion in 2015 compared to income tax expense of $2.4 billion on pretax income of $8.0 billion in 2014 . The effective tax rate for 2015 was 28.2 percent and was driven by our recurring tax preferences and tax benefits related to certain non-U.S. restructurings, partially offset by a $290 million charge for the impact of the U.K. tax law changes. The effective tax rate for 2014 was 30.7 percent and was driven by our recurring tax preference benefits, the resolution of several tax examinations and tax benefits from non-U.S. restructurings, partially offset by the non-deductible treatment of certain litigation charges. Bank of America 2016 91 Business Segment Operations Consumer Banking Consumer Banking recorded net income of $6.6 billion in 2015 compared to $6.3 billion in 2014 with the increase primarily driven by lower noninterest expense, lower provision for credit losses and higher noninterest income, partially offset by lower net interest income. Net interest income decreased $362 million to $20.4 billion in 2015 as the beneficial impact of an increase in investable assets as a result of higher deposit balances was more than offset by the impact of the allocation of ALM activities, higher funding costs, lower card yields and lower average card loan balances. Noninterest income increased $59 million to $11.1 billion in 2015 primarily driven by higher card income and the impact on revenue of certain divestitures, partially offset by lower mortgage banking income and service charges. The provision for credit losses decreased $124 million to $2.3 billion in 2015 driven by continued improvement in credit quality primarily related to our small business and credit card portfolios. Noninterest expense decreased $674 million to $18.7 billion in 2015 primarily driven by lower operating and personnel expenses, partially offset by higher fraud costs in advance of EMV chip implementation. Global Wealth & Investment Management GWIM recorded net income of $2.6 billion in 2015 compared to $2.9 billion in 2014 with the decrease driven by a decrease in revenue and increases in noninterest expense and the provision for credit losses. Net interest income decreased $303 million to $5.5 billion in 2015 due to the impact of the allocation of ALM activities, partially offset by the impact of loan and deposit growth. Noninterest income, primarily investment and brokerage services, decreased $66 million to $12.5 billion in 2015 driven by lower transactional revenue, partially offset by increased asset management fees due to the impact of long-term AUM flows and higher average market levels. Noninterest expense increased $107 million to $13.9 billion in 2015 primarily due to higher amortization of previously issued stock awards and investments in client-facing professionals, partially offset by lower revenue-related expenses. Global Banking Global Banking recorded net income of $5.3 billion in 2015 compared to $5.8 billion in 2014 with the decrease primarily driven by lower revenue and higher provision for credit losses, partially offset by lower noninterest expense. Revenue decreased $645 million to $ 17.6 billion in 2015 primarily due to lower net interest income. The decline in net interest income reflects the impact of the allocation of the ALM activities, including liquidity costs as well as loan spread compression, partially offset by loan growth. The provision for credit losses increased $361 million to $686 million in 2015 driven by energy exposure and loan growth. Noninterest expense decreased $325 million to $8.5 billion in 2015 primarily due to lower litigation expense and technology initiative costs. Global Markets Global Markets recorded net income of $2.4 billion in 2015 compared to $2.6 billion in 2014 . Excluding net DVA, net income increased $170 million to $2.9 billion in 2015 primarily driven by lower noninterest expense and lower tax expense, partially offset by lower revenue. Revenue, excluding net DVA, decreased due to lower trading account profits from declines in credit-related businesses, lower investment banking fees and lower equity investment gains as 2014 included gains related to the IPO of an equity investment, partially offset by an increase in net interest income. Net DVA losses were $786 million in 2015 compared to losses of $240 million in 2014 . Noninterest expense decreased $615 million to $11.4 billion in 2015 largely due to lower litigation expense and, to a lesser extent, lower revenue-related incentive compensation and support costs. All Other All Other recorded a net loss of $1.1 billion in 2015 compared to a net loss of $12.0 billion in 2014 with the improvement primarily driven by a $15.2 billion decrease in litigation expense, which is included in noninterest expense, as well as an $862 million increase in mortgage banking income, primarily due to lower representations and warranties provision. These were partially offset by a $950 million decrease in net interest income primarily driven by a $612 million charge in 2015 related to the discount on certain trust preferred securities. 92 Bank

Bank of America 2016 109 Glossary Alt-A Mortgage A type of U.S. mortgage that is considered riskier than A-paper, or "prime," and less risky than "subprime," the riskiest category. Alt-A interest rates therefore tend to be between those of prime and subprime consumer real estate loans. Typically, Alt-A mortgages are characterized by borrowers with less than full documentation, lower credit scores and higher LTVs. Assets in Custody Consist largely of custodial and non-discretionary trust assets excluding brokerage assets administered for clients. Trust assets encompass a broad range of asset types including real estate, private company ownership interest, personal property and investments. Assets Under Management (AUM) The total market value of assets under the investment advisory and/or discretion of GWIM which generate asset management fees based on a percentage of the assets market values. AUM reflects assets that are generally managed for institutional, high net worth and retail clients, and are distributed through various investment products including mutual funds, other commingled vehicles and separate accounts. Banking Book All on- and off-balance sheet financial instruments of the Corporation except for those positions that are held for trading purposes. Carrying Value (with respect to loans) The amount at which a loan is recorded on the balance sheet. For loans recorded at amortized cost, carrying value is the unpaid principal balance net of unamortized deferred loan origination fees and costs and unamortized purchase premiums or discounts, less net charge-offs and interest payments applied as a reduction of principal under the cost recovery method for loans that have been on nonaccrual status. For PCI loans, the carrying value equals fair value upon acquisition adjusted for subsequent cash collections and yield accreted to date. For credit card loans, the carrying value also includes interest that has been billed to the customer. For loans classified as held-for-sale, carrying value is the lower of carrying value as described in the sentences above, or fair value. For loans for which we have elected the fair value option, the carrying value is fair value. Client Brokerage Assets Client assets which are held in brokerage accounts, including non-discretionary brokerage and fee-based assets that generate brokerage income and asset management fee revenue. Committed Credit Exposure Includes any funded portion of a facility plus the unfunded portion of a facility on which the lender is legally bound to advance funds during a specified period under prescribed conditions. Credit Derivatives Contractual agreements that provide protection against a credit event on one or more referenced obligations. The nature of a credit event is established by the protection purchaser and the protection seller at the inception of the transaction, and such events generally include bankruptcy or insolvency of the referenced credit entity, failure to meet payment obligations when due, as well as acceleration of indebtedness and payment repudiation or moratorium. The purchaser of the credit derivative pays a periodic fee in return for a payment by the protection seller upon the occurrence, if any, of such a credit event. A CDS is a type of a credit derivative. Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA) A portfolio adjustment required to properly reflect the counterparty credit risk exposure as part of the fair value of derivative instruments. Debit Valuation Adjustment (DVA) A portfolio adjustment required to properly reflect the Corporation own credit risk exposure as part of the fair value of derivative instruments and/or structured liabilities. Funding Valuation Adjustment (FVA) A portfolio adjustment required to include funding costs on uncollateralized derivatives and derivatives where the Corporation is not permitted to use the collateral it receives. Interest Rate Lock Commitment (IRLC) Commitment with a loan applicant in which the loan terms, including interest rate and price, are guaranteed for a designated period of time subject to credit approval. Letter of Credit A document issued on behalf of a customer to a third party promising to pay the third party upon presentation of specified documents. A letter of credit effectively substitutes the issuer credit for that of the customer. Loan-to-value (LTV) A commonly used credit quality metric. LTV is calculated as the outstanding carrying value of the loan divided by the estimated value of the property securing the loan. Estimated property values are generally determined through the use of automated valuation models (AVMs) or the CoreLogic Case-Shiller Index. An AVM is a tool that estimates the value of a property by reference to large volumes of market data including sales of comparable properties and price trends specific to the MSA in which the property being valued is located. CoreLogic Case-Shiller is a widely used index based on data from repeat sales of single family homes. CoreLogic Case-Shiller indexed-based values are reported on a three-month or one-quarter lag. 110 Bank of America 2016 Margin Receivable An extension of credit secured by eligible securities in certain brokerage accounts. Matched Book Repurchase and resale agreements or securities borrowed and loaned transactions where the overall asset and liability position is similar in size and/or maturity. Generally, these are entered into to accommodate customers where the Corporation earns the interest rate spread. Mortgage Servicing Rights (MSR) The right to service a mortgage loan when the underlying loan is sold or securitized. Servicing includes collections for principal, interest and escrow payments from borrowers and accounting for and remitting principal and interest payments to investors. Net Interest Yield Net interest income divided by average total interest-earning assets. Nonperforming Loans and Leases Includes loans and leases that have been placed on nonaccrual status, including nonaccruing loans whose contractual terms have been restructured in a manner that grants a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties. Loans accounted for under the fair value option, PCI loans and LHFS are not reported as nonperforming loans and leases. Credit card receivables, residential mortgage loans that are insured by the FHA or through long-term credit protection agreements with FNMA and FHLMC (fully-insured loan portfolio) and certain other consumer loans are not placed on nonaccrual status and are, therefore, not reported as nonperforming loans and leases. Pay Option Loans Pay option adjustable-rate mortgages have interest rates that adjust monthly and minimum required payments that adjust annually. During an initial five- or ten-year period, minimum required payments may increase by no more than 7.5 percent. If payments are insufficient to pay all of the monthly interest charges, unpaid interest is added to the loan balance (i.e., negative amortization) until the loan balance increases to a specified limit, at which time a new monthly payment amount adequate to repay the loan over its remaining contractual life is established. Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) A framework established by the U.S. banking regulators requiring banks to maintain certain levels of regulatory capital ratios, comprised of five categories of capitalization: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. Insured depository institutions that fail to meet certain of these capital levels are subject to increasingly strict limits on their activities, including their ability to make capital distributions, pay management compensation, grow assets and take other actions. Purchased Credit-impaired (PCI) Loan A loan purchased as an individual loan, in a portfolio of loans or in a business combination with evidence of deterioration in credit quality since origination for which it is probable, upon acquisition, that the investor will be unable to collect all contractually required payments. These loans are recorded at fair value upon acquisition. Subprime Loans Although a standard industry definition for subprime loans (including subprime mortgage loans) does not exist, the Corporation defines subprime loans as specific product offerings for higher risk borrowers, including individuals with one or a combination of high credit risk factors, such as low FICO scores, high debt to income ratios and inferior payment history. Troubled Debt Restructurings (TDRs) Loans whose contractual terms have been restructured in a manner that grants a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties. Certain consumer loans for which a binding offer to restructure has been extended are also classified as TDRs. Concessions could include a reduction in the interest rate to a rate that is below market on the loan, payment extensions, forgiveness of principal, forbearance, loans discharged in bankruptcy or other actions intended to maximize collection. Secured consumer loans that have been discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy and have not been reaffirmed by the borrower are classified as TDRs at the time of discharge from bankruptcy. Value-at-Risk (VaR) VaR is a model that simulates the value of a portfolio under a range of hypothetical scenarios in order to generate a distribution of potential gains and losses. VaR represents the loss the portfolio is expected to experience with a given confidence level based on historical data. A VaR model is an effective tool in estimating ranges of potential gains and losses on our trading portfolios.
