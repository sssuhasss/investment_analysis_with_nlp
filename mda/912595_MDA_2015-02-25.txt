ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion analyzes the financial condition and results of operations of both MAA and the Operating Partnership, of which the MAA is the sole general partner and in which MAA owned a 94.7% limited partner interest as of December 31, 2014 . MAA conducts all of its business through the Operating Partnership and the Operating Partnership various subsidiaries. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES A critical accounting policy is one that is both important to our financial condition and results of operations and that involves some degree of uncertainty. The following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto, which have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and circumstances. We believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances; however, actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions. We believe that the estimates and assumptions listed below are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations because they require the greatest subjective determinations and form the basis of accounting policies deemed to be most critical. Acquisition of real estate assets We account for our acquisitions of investments in real estate in accordance with ASC 805-10, Business Combinations , which requires the fair value of the real estate acquired to be allocated to the acquired tangible assets, consisting of land, building and furniture, fixtures and equipment, and identified intangible assets, consisting of the value of in-place leases and other contracts. In calculating the fair value of acquired tangible assets, management divides forecasted net operating income (NOI) by a market capitalization rate. Management analyzed historical stabilized NOI to determine its estimate for forecasted NOI. Management estimates the market capitalization rate by analyzing the market capitalization rates for properties with comparable ages in similar sized markets. Although management's estimates of the fair value of acquired tangible assets have been materially accurate in the past, variability of future operating performance as well as additional information becoming available could lead to the modification of the initial fair value calculation and purchase price allocation. Subsequent adjustments made to the purchase price allocation, if any, would be made within the allocation period, which typically does not exceed one year. Impairment of long-lived assets, including goodwill We account for long-lived assets in accordance with the provisions of accounting standards for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets and evaluate our goodwill for impairment under accounting standards for goodwill and other intangible assets. We evaluate goodwill for impairment on at least an annual basis, or more frequently if a goodwill impairment indicator is identified. We periodically evaluate long-lived assets, including investments in real estate and goodwill, for indicators that would suggest that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. The judgments regarding the existence of such indicators are based on factors such as operating performance, market conditions and legal factors. If impairment indicators exist for a long-lived asset, management compares the carrying amount of the asset to an estimate of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. Management estimates future cash flows by analyzing historical cash flows generated by the asset. If impairment indicators exist for goodwill, management compares the carrying amount of the asset to an estimate of the implied fair value of the asset. Management calculates the fair value of the asset by dividing historical operating cash flows by a market capitalization rate. Management estimates the market capitalization rate by analyzing the market capitalization rates for properties with comparable ages in similar sized markets. Historically, impairment analysis estimates have been materially accurate, which resulted in no impairment losses recognized during the years ended December 31, 2014 , 2013 , and 2012 . Cost Capitalization Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred while significant improvements, renovations, and replacements are capitalized. The cost to complete any deferred repairs and maintenance at properties acquired by us in order to elevate the condition of the property to our standards are capitalized as incurred. The carrying costs related to development 41 projects, including interest, property taxes, insurance and allocated direct development salary cost during the construction period, are capitalized. Management uses judgment in determining whether costs should be expensed or capitalized. Loss Contingencies The outcomes of the claims, disputes and legal proceedings described or referenced above are subject to significant uncertainty. The Company records an accrual for loss contingencies when a loss is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company reviews these accruals quarterly and makes revisions based on changes in facts and circumstances. When a loss contingency is not both probable and reasonably estimable, the Company does not accrue the loss. However, for material loss contingencies, if the unrecorded loss (or an additional loss in excess of the accrual) is at least a reasonable possibility and material, then the Company discloses a reasonable estimate of the possible loss, or range of loss, if such reasonable estimate can be made. If the Company cannot make a reasonable estimate of the possible loss, or range of loss, then that is disclosed. The assessment of whether a loss is probable or a reasonable possibility, and whether the loss or range of loss is reasonably estimable, often involve a series of complex judgments about future events. Among the factors that the Company considers in this assessment, including with respect to the matters disclosed in this Note, are the nature of existing legal proceedings and claims, the asserted or possible damages or loss contingency (if reasonably estimable), the progress of the matter, existing law and precedent, the opinions or views of legal counsel and other advisers, the Company's experience in similar matters, the facts available to the Company at the time of assessment, and how the Company intends to respond, or has responded, to the proceeding or claim. The Company's assessment of these factors may change over time as individual proceedings or claims progress. For matters where the Company is not currently able to reasonably estimate a range of reasonably possible loss, the factors that have contributed to this determination include the following: (i) the damages sought are indeterminate; (ii) the proceedings are in the early stages; (iii) the matters involve novel or unsettled legal theories or a large or uncertain number of actual or potential cases or parties; and/or (iv) discussions with the parties in matters that are expected ultimately to be resolved through negotiation and settlement have not reached the point where the Company believes a reasonable estimate of loss, or range of loss, can be made. In such instances, the Company believes that there is considerable uncertainty regarding the timing or ultimate resolution of such matters, including a possible eventual loss or business impact, if any. For more information regarding our significant accounting policies, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 1. OVERVIEW OF THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2014 As noted earlier, on October 1, 2013, we consummated the Merger and acquired all of Colonial's net assets. As a result of the Merger, the results of operations for 2013 include twelve months of results for MAA and three months of results for the legacy Colonial assets. The results of operations for 2014 include twelve months of results for both the MAA and Colonial portfolios. Our December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013 balance sheets include the combined assets and liabilities of MAA and Colonial. All properties acquired from Colonial have been placed in our Non-Same Store operating segment, as the properties are recent acquisitions and had not been owned and stabilized for at least twelve months as of January 1, 2014. We experienced an increase in income from continuing operations in 2014 as increases in revenues outpaced increases in expenses. The increases in revenues came from a 4.5% increase in our large market same store segment, a 1.8% increase in our secondary market same store segment and a 225.9% increase in our non-same store and other segment, which was primarily a result of the Merger. The increase in expense came from a 2.8% increase in our large market same store segment, a 2.1% increase in our secondary market same store segment and a 227.6% increase in our non-same store and other segment, which was primarily the result of the Merger. Our same store portfolio represents those communities that have been held and have been stabilized for at least twelve months. Communities excluded from the same store portfolio would include recent acquisitions (including the Colonial portfolio), communities being developed or in lease-up, communities undergoing extensive renovations, and communities identified as discontinued operations. The drivers of these increases are discussed below in the results of operations section. We have grown externally during the past three years by following our acquisition strategy to invest in large and mid-sized growing markets in the Sunbelt region of the United States. Apart from the Merger, we acquired seven properties for our portfolio in 2012 , four in 2013 and eight in 2014 . Offsetting some of this increased revenue stream were nine apartment dispositions in 2012 , nine apartment dispositions in 2013 , and eight apartment dispositions in 2014 . 42 The following table shows our apartment real estate assets as of 2014 , 2013 , and 2012 : 2014 2013 2012 Properties 268 275 166 Units 82,316 83,641 49,591 Development Units 514 1,461 774 Average Effective Monthly Rent/Unit, excluding lease-up and development $ 948.26 $ 883.40 $ 855.71 Occupancy, excluding lease-up and development 94.1 % 94.9 % 95.1 % See discussion of same store average rent per unit and occupancy comparisons in the Trends section below. In addition to the multifamily assets detailed above, we also owned or owned an interest in three commercial properties totaling approximately 293,000 square feet of leasable space. Average effective monthly rent per unit is equal to the average of gross rent amounts after the effect of leasing concessions for occupied units plus prevalent market rates asked for unoccupied units, divided by the total number of units. Leasing concessions represent discounts to the current market rate. We believe average effective monthly rent is a helpful measurement in evaluating average pricing. It does not represent actual rental revenue collected per unit. The following is a discussion of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2014 , 2013 , and 2012 . This discussion should be read in conjunction with all of the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2014 to the Year Ended December 31, 2013 Property Revenues The following table shows our property revenues by segment for the years ended December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013 (dollars in thousands): Year ended December 31, 2014 Year ended December 31, 2013 Increase Percentage Increase Large Market Same Store $ 252,029 $ 241,194 $ 10,835 4.5 % Secondary Market Same Store 246,800 242,464 4,336 1.8 % Same Store Portfolio 498,829 483,658 15,171 3.1 % Non-Same Store and Other 490,298 150,429 339,869 225.9 % Total $ 989,127 $ 634,087 $ 355,040 56.0 % The increase in property revenues from our same store portfolio is primarily a result of increased average effective rent per unit of 3.0%. The increase in property revenues from our non-same store and other group is primarily due to the addition of the Colonial portfolio as a result of the Merger, which represents $273.3 million of the increase. The remaining $66.6 million of the increase was related to acquisitions other than the Merger. 43 Property Operating Expenses Property operating expenses include costs for property personnel, property personnel bonuses, building repairs and maintenance, real estate taxes and insurance, utilities, landscaping, and depreciation and amortization. The following table shows our property operating expenses by segment for the years ended December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013 (dollars in thousands): Year ended December 31, 2014 Year ended December 31, 2013 Increase Percentage Increase Large Market Same Store $ 100,892 $ 98,190 $ 2,702 2.8 % Secondary Market Same Store 98,191 96,141 2,050 2.1 % Same Store Portfolio 199,083 194,331 4,752 2.4 % Non-Same Store and Other 193,246 58,983 134,263 227.6 % Total $ 392,329 $ 253,314 $ 139,015 54.9 % The increase in property operating expenses from our same store portfolio is primarily a result of increases in real estate taxes of $3.9 million and utilities expenses of $1.3 million, offset by a decrease in insurance expenses of $1.0 million. The increase in property operating expenses from our non-same store and other group is primarily due to the addition of the Colonial portfolio as a result of the Merger, which represents $106.9 million of the increase. The remaining $27.4 million of the increase was related to acquisitions other than the Merger. Depreciation and Amortization The following table shows our depreciation and amortization expense by segment for the years ended December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013 (dollars in thousands): Year ended December 31, 2014 Year ended December 31, 2013 Increase Percentage Increase Large Market Same Store $ 58,356 $ 57,712 $ 644 1.1 % Secondary Market Same Store 59,697 59,339 358 0.6 % Same Store Portfolio 118,053 117,051 1,002 0.9 % Non-Same Store and Other 183,758 69,928 113,830 162.8 % Total $ 301,811 $ 186,979 $ 114,832 61.4 % The increase in depreciation and amortization expense from our same store portfolio resulted from capital spending made during the ordinary course of business. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense from our non-same store and other group is primarily due to the addition of the Colonial portfolio as a result of the Merger. Property Management Expenses Property management expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014 were approximately $32.1 million , an increase of $9.0 million from the year ended December 31, 2013 . The majority of the increase was related to increases in payroll expenses of $3.0 million, state franchise taxes of $2.7 million, software maintenance of $2.1 million, and incentive bonuses of $0.9 million as a result of the increased headcount and scope of work resulting from the Merger. General and Administrative Expenses General and Administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014 were approximately $20.9 million , an increase of $5.3 million from the year ended December 31, 2013 . The majority of the increase was related to increases in incentive bonuses of $3.3 million and payroll expenses of $1.2 million as a result of the increased headcount resulting from the Merger. 44 Merger and Integration Related Expenses Merger related expenses, primarily severance, legal, and professional costs for the acquisition of Colonial were approximately $3.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 , a decrease of $29.3 million from the year ended December 31, 2013 . We also incurred integration related expenses, primarily related to temporary systems, staffing, and facilities costs of $8.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 , an increase of $3.3 million from the year ended December 31, 2013 . Interest Expense Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2014 was approximately $119.5 million , an increase of $43.5 million from the year ended December 31, 2013 . The increase was primarily the result of an increase in our average debt outstanding from the year ended December 31, 2013 to the year ended December 31, 2014 of approximately $1.38 billion, due primarily to the assumption of Colonial's debt as a result of the Merger. Debt Extinguishment Loss on debt extinguishment for the year ended December 31, 2014 was approximately $2.6 million , an increase of $2.2 million from the year ended December 31, 2013 . The increase was primarily the result of the prepayment of a loan for a property sold during the year ended December 31, 2014 . Discontinued Operations We recorded a gain on sale of discontinued operations of $5.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to a $76.8 million gain for the year ended December 31, 2013 . The decrease in the gain is caused by the proceeds received in 2014 being less than the proceeds received in 2013 in relation to the net book value of the properties sold and, in accordance with newly adopted ASU 2014-08, recording a gain on sale of depreciable assets excluded from discontinued operations in 2014, which is discussed further below. Dispositions of Depreciable Real Estate Assets Excluded from Discontinued Operations We recorded a gain on sale of depreciable assets excluded from discontinued operations of $42.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 . We did not record a similar gain for the year ended December 31, 2013 because we did not dispose of any properties that were excluded from discontinued operations. Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for the year ended December 31, 2014 was approximately $8.3 million , an increase of $4.3 million from the year ended December 31, 2013 . This increase is primarily due to the increase in OP unitholders as a result of the Merger. Net Income Attributable to MAA Primarily as a result of the items discussed above, net income attributable to MAA increased by approximately $32.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2014 from the year ended December 31, 2013 . 45 Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2013 to the Year Ended December 31, 2012 Property Revenues The following table shows our property revenues by segment for the years ended December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012 (dollars in thousands): Year ended December 31, 2013 Year ended December 31, 2012 Increase Percentage Increase Large Market Same Store $ 256,141 $ 243,721 $ 12,420 5.1 % Secondary Market Same Store 207,572 201,834 5,738 2.8 % Same Store Portfolio 463,713 445,555 18,158 4.1 % Non-Same Store and Other 170,374 29,434 140,940 478.8 % Total $ 634,087 $ 474,989 $ 159,098 33.5 % The increase in property revenues from our same store portfolio is primarily a result of increased average rent per unit of approximately 3.9%. The increase in property revenues from our non-same store and other group is primarily due to the addition of the Colonial portfolio as a result of the Merger, which represents $88.1 million of the increase. The remaining $52.8 million of the increase was related to acquisitions other than the Merger. Property Operating Expenses Property operating expenses include costs for property personnel, property personnel bonuses, building repairs and maintenance, real estate taxes and insurance, utilities, landscaping, and depreciation and amortization. The following table shows our property operating expenses by segment for the years ended December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012 (dollars in thousands): Year ended December 31, 2013 Year ended December 31, 2012 Increase Percentage Increase Large Market Same Store $ 103,416 $ 100,661 $ 2,755 2.7 % Secondary Market Same Store 83,785 82,070 1,715 2.1 % Same Store Portfolio 187,201 182,731 4,470 2.4 % Non-Same Store and Other 66,113 11,418 54,695 479.0 % Total $ 253,314 $ 194,149 $ 59,165 30.5 % The increase in property operating expenses from our same store portfolio is primarily a result of increases in real estate taxes of $3.5 million and insurance expenses of $0.7 million. The increase in property operating expenses from our non-same store and other group is primarily due to the addition of the Colonial portfolio as a result of the Merger, which represents $34.1 million of the increase. The remaining $20.6 million of the increase was related to acquisitions other than the Merger. 46 Depreciation and Amortization The following table shows our depreciation and amortization expense by segment for the years ended December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012 (dollars in thousands): Year ended December 31, 2013 Year ended December 31, 2012 Increase Percentage Increase Large Market Same Store $ 60,329 $ 59,914 $ 415 0.7 % Secondary Market Same Store 50,362 49,871 491 1.0 % Same Store Portfolio 110,691 109,785 906 0.8 % Non-Same Store and Other 76,288 11,426 64,862 567.7 % Total $ 186,979 $ 121,211 $ 65,768 54.3 % The increase in depreciation and amortization expense from our same store portfolio resulted from asset additions made during the normal course of business. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense from our non-same store and other group is primarily due to the addition of the Colonial portfolio as a result of the Merger. General and Administrative Expenses General and Administrative expense for the year ended December 31, 2013 was approximately $15.6 million , an increase of $1.8 million from the year ended December 31, 2012 . The majority of the increase was related to an increase in tax preparation fees, audit fees, and stock incentives. Merger and Integration Related Expenses Merger related expenses for the acquisition of Colonial were approximately $32.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. We also incurred integration related expenses of $5.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. There were no merger related expenses or integration related expenses for the year ended December 31, 2012. Interest Expense Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2013 was approximately $75.9 million , an increase of $18.0 million from the year ended December 31, 2012 . The increase was primarily the result of an increase in our average debt outstanding of $451.6 million from the year ended December 31, 2012 to the year ended December 31, 2013 , due primarily to the assumption of Colonial's debt as a result of the Merger. Discontinued Operations Income from discontinued operations before gain on sale for the year ended December 31, 2013 was approximately $5.1 million , a decrease of $1.9 million from the year ended December 31, 2012 . The decrease is driven by the fact that the properties sold in 2013 had lower net income than the properties sold in 2012 . We recorded a gain on sale of discontinued operations of $76.8 million and $41.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012 , respectively. The increase in the gain is caused by the proceeds being greater than the net book value of the properties in 2013 compared to 2012 . Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for the year ended December 31, 2013 was approximately $4.0 million , an decrease of $0.6 million from the year ended December 31, 2012 . Net Income Attributable to MAA Primarily as a result of the foregoing, net income attributable to MAA increased by approximately $10.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2013 from the year ended December 31, 2012 . 47 Funds from Operations Funds from operations, or FFO, represents net income (computed in accordance with GAAP) excluding extraordinary items, net income attributable to noncontrolling interest, asset impairment, gains or losses on disposition of real estate assets, plus depreciation and amortization of real estate, and adjustments for joint ventures to reflect FFO on the same basis. Disposition of real estate assets includes sales of discontinued operations. FFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income or any other GAAP measurement of performance, as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating, investing, and financing activities as a measure of liquidity. We believe that FFO is helpful to investors in understanding our operating performance because its calculation excludes depreciation and amortization expense on real estate assets. We believe that GAAP historical cost depreciation of real estate assets is generally not correlated with changes in the value of those assets, whose value does not diminish predictably over time, as historical cost depreciation implies. Our calculation of FFO may differ from the methodology for calculating FFO utilized by other REITs and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other REITs. Core FFO represents FFO excluding certain non-cash or non-routine items such as acquisition, merger and integration expenses, mark-to-market debt adjustments and loss or gain on debt extinguishment. While our definition of Core FFO is similar to others in our industry, our precise methodology for calculating Core FFO may differ from that utilized by other REITs and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other REITs. Core FFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income. MAA believes that Core FFO is helpful in understanding our operating performance in that it removes certain items that by their nature are not comparable over periods and therefore tend to obscure actual operating performance. The following table is a reconciliation of Core FFO and FFO to consolidated net income for the years ended December 31, 2014 , 2013 , and 2012 (dollars in thousands): Years ended December 31, 2014 2013 2012 Net income available for MAA common shareholders $ 147,980 $ 115,281 $ 105,223 Depreciation and amortization of real estate assets 299,421 184,857 118,835 Depreciation and amortization of real estate assets of discontinued operations 42 2,703 7,398 Gain on sales of discontinued operations (5,394 ) (76,844 ) (41,635 ) Gain on sale of depreciable real estate assets excluded from discontinued operations (42,649 ) Gain on disposition within unconsolidated entities (4,007 ) (1) Depreciation and amortization of real estate assets of real estate joint ventures 397 1,030 1,886 Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 8,297 3,998 4,602 Funds from operations 404,087 231,025 196,309 Acquisition expense 2,388 1,393 1,581 Merger Related Expenses 3,152 32,403 Integration related expenses 8,395 5,102 Gain on sale of non-depreciable real estate assets (350 ) (45 ) Mark-to-market debt adjustment (25,079 ) (7,992 ) (767 ) Loss on debt extinguishment 3,126 (2) 426 654 Core funds from operations $ 395,719 $ 262,357 $ 197,732 (1) Gain on disposition within unconsolidated entities excludes the promote fee recognized with the final liquidation of Mid-America Multifamily Fund II (Fund II). (2) The loss on debt extinguishment for the year ended December 31, 2014 includes MAA's share of debt extinguishment costs incurred by our joint venture, Mid-America Multifamily Fund II. 48 FFO for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased approximately $173.1 million from the year ended December 31, 2013 primarily as a result of the increase in total property revenues of $355.0 million discussed above that was partially offset by the $139.0 million increase in property operating expenses, the $43.5 million of increased interest expense, the $9.0 million of increased property management expenses, and the $5.3 million of increased general and administrative expenses. FFO for the year ended December 31, 2013 increased approximately $34.7 million from the year ended December 31, 2012 primarily as a result of the increase in property revenues of $159.1 million discussed above that was partially offset by the $59.2 million increase in property operating expenses, the $32.4 million of merger related expenses, and the $18.0 million of increased interest expense. Core FFO for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased approximately $133.4 million from the year ended December 31, 2013 primarily as a result of the increase in total property revenues of $355.0 million discussed above that was partially offset by the $139.0 million increase in property operating expenses, the $43.5 million of increased interest expense, the $9.0 million of increased property management expenses, and the $5.3 million of increased general and administrative expenses. Core FFO for the year ended December 31, 2013 increased by approximately $64.6 million from the year ended December 31, 2012 primarily as a result of the increase in total property revenues of $159.1 million discussed above that was partially offset by the $59.2 million increase in property operating expenses and the $18.0 million of increased interest expense. Trends During the twelve months ended December 31, 2014, demand for apartments was strong, as it was during the twelve months ended December 31, 2013. This strength was evident on two fronts: same store average physical occupancy during the twelve months ended December 31, 2014 was strong, ending the year at 95.5% occupancy and averaging 95.3% for the year; while same store effective rent per unit continued to grow, up 3.3% in the twelve months ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2013. In addition, effective rent was up 4.0% for the month of December 2014 as compared to the month of December 2013. An important part of our portfolio strategy is to maintain a broad diversity of markets across the Sunbelt region of the United States. The diversity of markets tends to mitigate exposure to economic issues in any one geographic market or area. We believe that a well-diversified portfolio, including both large and select secondary markets, will perform well in up cycles as well as weather down cycles better. As of December 31, 2014, we were invested in approximately 49 defined Metropolitan Statistical Areas, with approximately 64% of our multifamily assets, based on gross assets, in large markets and 36% of our multifamily assets in select secondary markets. New supply of rental units has increased in several key markets and multifamily permitting increased in 2014. We believe this permitting will ultimately lead to a further increase in supply but also believe the lack of new apartments in recent years combined with demand from new households will help keep supply and demand in balance. Also, we believe that more sustainable credit terms for residential mortgages should work to favor rental demand at existing multi-family properties. Competition from condominiums reverting back to rental units, or new condominiums being converted to rental, has not been a major factor in our portfolio because most of our submarkets have not been primary areas for condominium development. We have found the same to be true for rental competition from single family homes. We have avoided committing a significant amount of capital to markets or submarkets where most of the excessive inflation in house prices occurred. We saw significant rental competition from condominiums or single family houses in only a few of our submarkets. Long term, we expect demographic trends (including the growth of prime age groups for rentals and immigration and population movement to the southeast and southwest) will continue to build apartment rental demand for our markets. Our focus is on maintaining strong physical occupancy while increasing pricing where possible through our revenue management system. As noted above, physical occupancy ended the year strong and also averaged nearly 60 basis points better in 2014 as compared to 2013. As we continue into the typically slower winter leasing season, the level of physical occupancy puts us in a good position to maximize pricing in the first quarter of 2015. We continue to develop improved products, operating systems and procedures that we believe enable us to capture more revenues. The continued benefit of ancillary services (such as our cable saver and deposit saver programs), improved collections and utility reimbursements enable us to capture increased revenue. We also actively work on improving processes and products to reduce expenses, such as new web-sites and internet access for our residents that enable them to transact their business with us more simply and effectively. 49 Liquidity and Capital Resources Our cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities, as well as general economic and market conditions, are the principal factors affecting our liquidity and capital resources. The significant changes in cash from the year ended December 31, 2013 to the year ended December 31, 2014 due to operating, investing, and financing activities are as follows: Operating Activities Net cash flow provided by operating activities increased to $384.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $258.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 . This change was a result of various items, including higher revenue as discussed above. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities increased to $203.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $83.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 . The primary drivers of this change are as follows: Cash (outflow)/inflow during the year ended December 31, 2014 2013 Increase/(Decrease) Percentage Increase/(Decrease) Purchases of real estate and other assets $ (309,174 ) $ (139,199 ) $ 169,975 122.1 % Proceeds from disposition of real estate assets $ 254,638 $ 128,978 $ 125,660 97.4 % Normal capital improvements $ (90,201 ) $ (53,439 ) $ 36,762 68.8 % Return (funding) of escrow for future acquisitions $ 24,884 $ (24,884 ) $ (49,768 ) (200.0 )% Cash acquired in connection with Colonial merger $ $ 63,454 $ (63,454 ) (100.0 )% The increase in cash outflows from purchases of real estate and other assets primarily resulted from the acquisition of eight apartment communities during the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the acquisition of four apartment communities during the year ended December 31, 2013 . The increase in proceeds from disposition of real estate assets primarily resulted from the sale of eight apartment communities and two commercial properties during the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the sale of nine apartment communities during the year ended December 31, 2013 . The increase in cash outflows for normal capital improvements is due to the fact that we owned more properties throughout 2014 than we owned throughout 2013. During October 2013, we acquired 115 apartment communities through our Merger with Colonial. Owning these properties for all of 2014 led to increased capital improvement spending. The decrease in cash outflows from the return (funding) of escrow for future acquisitions resulted from the release of funds held in escrow for two 1031(b) transactions at December 31, 2014 compared to having funds held in escrow for the same two 1031(b) transactions at December 31, 2013 . We also acquired $63.5 million of cash during the Merger, which accounts for the decrease in cash acquired in connection with the Colonial merger from 2013 to 2014. 50 Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities increased to $244.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 from $94.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 . The primary drivers of this change are as follows: Cash (outflow)/inflow during the year ended December 31, 2014 2013 (Decrease)/Increase Percentage (Decrease)/Increase Net change in credit lines $ (157,184 ) $ (308,000 ) $ (150,816 ) (49.0 )% Proceeds from notes payable $ 396,855 $ 347,759 $ 49,096 14.1 % Principal payments on notes payable $ (260,347 ) $ (11,103 ) $ 249,244 2,244.8 % Proceeds from issuances of common shares $ 1,042 $ 25,680 $ (24,638 ) (95.9 )% Dividends paid on common shares $ (219,158 ) $ (140,697 ) $ 78,461 55.8 % The decrease in cash outflows from the net change in credit lines from 2013 to 2014 was due to the timing of borrowings and repayments on our various lines of credit. The increase in cash inflows from proceeds on notes payable is due to the fact that in 2014, we issued $400 million in senior unsecured notes while in 2013 we issued only $350 million in senior unsecured notes. The increase in cash outflows from principal payments on notes payable is primarily due to the fact that during 2014 we paid off $192.2 million of bonds originally issued by Colonial that matured during the year. The decrease in cash inflows from the proceeds from the issuance of common shares is due to the fact that during 2013 we issued approximately 365,000 shares through our ATM plan. We issued no shares through our ATM plan during 2014. The increase in cash outflows from dividends paid on common shares is due to the fact that we had more shares of common stock outstanding during 2014 than during 2013. In connection with the Merger, in October 2013, we issued approximately 31.9 million shares. The additional shares of common stock outstanding during 2014 along with our increase in the dividend rate led to an increase in the aggregate amount of dividends paid during the year ended December 31, 2014 . Free Cash Flow Free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities (computed in accordance with GAAP) less funding of normal capital improvements to existing real estate assets, distributions to unitholders, and dividends paid on common and preferred shares. Free cash flow should not be considered as an alternative to any GAAP measurement of performance or liquidity. Our calculation of free cash flow may differ from the methodology for calculating free cash flow utilized by other companies and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other companies. The following table is a reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash provided by operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2014 , 2013 , and 2012 (dollars in thousands): 2014 2013 2012 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 384,126 $ 258,380 $ 210,967 Normal capital improvements $ (90,201 ) $ (53,439 ) $ (47,222 ) Distributions to noncontrolling interests $ (12,290 ) $ (6,550 ) $ (4,948 ) Dividends paid on common shares $ (219,158 ) $ (140,697 ) $ (107,749 ) Free cash flow $ 62,477 $ 57,694 $ 51,048 While we had sufficient liquidity to permit dividend distributions at current rates through additional borrowings, if necessary, any significant deterioration in operations could result in our financial resources being insufficient to pay distributions to shareholders at the current rate, in which event we would be required to reduce the dividend distribution rate. We believe that we have adequate resources to fund our current operations, annual refurbishment of our properties, and incremental investment in new apartment properties. Our capital resources consist of both equity and debt securities. 51 Equity As of December 31, 2014 , we owned 75,267,675 OP Units, comprising a 94.7% limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership, while the remaining 4,191,152 outstanding OP Units were held by limited partners of the Operating Partnership. Holders of OP Units (other than us and our affiliates) may require us to redeem their OP Units from time to time, in which case we may, at our option, pay the redemption price either in cash (in an amount per OP Unit equal, in general, to the average closing price of our common stock on the New York Stock Exchange over a specified period prior to the redemption date) or by delivering one share of our common stock (subject to adjustment under specified circumstances) for each OP Unit so redeemed. In addition, we have registered the 4,191,152 shares of our common stock, which as of December 31, 2014 , were issuable upon redemption of OP Units held by the Operating Partnership's limited partners under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, so that those shares can be sold freely in the public markets. To the extent that additional OP Units are issued to limited partners of the Operating Partnership, we will likely register the additional shares of common stock issuable upon redemption of those OP Units under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, so that those shares can also be sold in the public markets. If we issue shares of our common stock upon the redemption of OP Units in our Operating Partnership, sales of substantial amounts of such shares of our common stock, or the perception that these sales could occur, may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock or may impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of our common stock or other equity securities. In connection with the Merger, we issued approximately 31.9 million shares of MAA common stock and approximately 2.6 million OP Units on October 1, 2013. For more information regarding our equity capital resources, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 10 and Note 11. Debt The following schedule outlines our variable versus fixed rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps and caps, outstanding as of December 31, 2014 (dollars in thousands): Principal Balance Average Years to Rate Maturity Effective Rate SECURED DEBT Conventional - Fixed Rate or Swapped $ 1,253,203 4.5 4.1 % Conventional - Variable Rate - Capped (1) 192,013 1.5 1.1 % Tax-free - Variable Rate - Capped (1) 90,315 3.1 0.9 % Total Fixed or Hedged Rate Maturity $ 1,535,531 4.0 3.5 % Conventional - Variable Rate (2) 56,585 0.1 0.7 % Total Secured Rate Maturity $ 1,592,116 3.9 3.4 % UNSECURED DEBT Fixed Rate or Swapped $ 1,873,399 5.1 4.0 % Variable Rate 59,000 0.1 1.3 % Total Unsecured Rate Maturity $ 1,932,399 4.9 3.9 % TOTAL DEBT $ 3,524,515 4.4 3.7 % TOTAL FIXED OR HEDGED DEBT $ 3,408,930 4.6 3.8 % (1) The effective rate represents the average rate on the underlying variable debt unless the cap rates are reached, which average 4.6% of LIBOR for conventional caps and 5.6% of SIFMA for tax-free caps. (2) Includes $27.0 million of mortgages with an imbedded cap at a 7% all-in interest rate. As of December 31, 2014 , we had entered into interest rate swaps totaling a notional amount of $625.0 million . To date, these swaps have proven to be highly effective hedges. We had also entered into interest rate cap agreements totaling a notional amount of approximately $255.3 million as of December 31, 2014 . 52 The following schedule outlines the contractual maturity dates of our outstanding debt as of December 31, 2014 (in thousands): Amount Borrowed Credit Facilities Fannie Mae Secured Key Bank Unsecured Other Secured Other Unsecured Total 2015 $ 105,785 $ $ 71,490 $ 190,752 $ 368,027 2016 80,000 50,910 78,916 209,826 2017 80,000 59,000 63,040 168,157 370,197 2018 80,000 94,788 300,751 475,539 2019 558,559 20,000 578,559 Thereafter 91,115 316,429 1,114,823 1,522,367 Total $ 436,900 $ 59,000 $ 1,155,216 $ 1,873,399 $ 3,524,515 The following schedule details the line limits, collateralized availability and the outstanding balances of our various borrowings as of December 31, 2014 (dollars in thousands): Line Limit Amount Collateralized Amount Borrowed Average Years to Contract Maturity Fannie Mae Credit Facilities $ 451,315 $ 436,900 $ 436,900 5.1 Other Secured Borrowings 1,155,216 1,155,216 1,155,216 4.8 Unsecured Credit Facility 500,000 496,227 59,000 2.6 Other Unsecured Borrowings 1,873,399 1,873,399 1,873,399 5.1 Total Debt $ 3,979,930 $ 3,961,742 $ 3,524,515 5.0 The following schedule outlines the interest rate maturities of our outstanding fixed or hedged debt as of December 31, 2014 (dollars in thousands): Fixed Rate Debt Interest Rate Swaps Total Fixed Rate Balances Contract Rate Interest Rate Caps Total Fixed or Hedged 2015 $ 250,543 $ 75,000 $ 325,543 5.3 % $ 51,813 $ 377,356 2016 114,629 114,629 5.2 % 104,480 219,109 2017 131,196 300,000 431,196 2.2 % 66,495 497,691 2018 145,521 250,000 395,521 2.9 % 32,845 428,366 2019 558,559 558,559 5.7 % 26,695 585,254 Thereafter 1,301,154 1,301,154 4.4 % 1,301,154 Total $ 2,501,602 $ 625,000 $ 3,126,602 4.3 % $ 282,328 $ 3,408,930 At December 31, 2014 , we had secured credit facility relationships with Prudential Mortgage Capital which are credit enhanced by Fannie Mae and a $500.0 million bank unsecured facility with a syndicate of banks. Together, these credit facilities provided a total line capacity of $951.3 million with all but $18.2 million collateralized and available to borrow at December 31, 2014 . We had total borrowings outstanding under these credit facilities of $495.9 million at December 31, 2014 . Secured Credit Facilities We rely on the efficient operation of the financial markets to refinance debt maturities, and on rate renewals for Fannie Mae. Fannie Mae provided credit enhancement for approximately $436.9 million of our outstanding debt through our Fannie Mae Facilities, as defined below, as of December 31, 2014 . 53 The interest rate markets for Fannie Mae Discount Mortgage Backed Securities, or DMBS, which in our experience are highly liquid and highly correlated with three-month LIBOR interest rates, are also an important component of our liquidity and interest rate swap effectiveness. Prudential Mortgage Capital, a Delegated Underwriting and Servicing, or DUS, lender for Fannie Mae, markets 90-day Fannie Mae DMBS monthly, and is obligated to advance funds to us at DMBS rates plus a credit spread under the terms of the credit agreements between Prudential and us. Approximately 12.4% of our outstanding obligations at December 31, 2014 were borrowed through credit facilities with/or credit enhanced by Fannie Mae, also referred to as the Fannie Mae Facilities. The Fannie Mae Facilities have a combined line limit of $451.3 million , of which $436.9 million was collateralized and available to borrow at December 31, 2014 . We had total borrowings outstanding under the Fannie Mae Facilities of approximately $436.9 million at December 31, 2014 . Various Fannie Mae rate tranches of the Fannie Mae Facilities mature from 2015 through 2018. The Fannie Mae Facilities provide for both fixed and variable rate borrowings. The interest rate on the majority of the variable portion is based on the Fannie Mae DMBS rate which are credit-enhanced by Fannie Mae and are typically sold every 90 days by Prudential Mortgage Capital at interest rates approximating three-month London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, less a spread that has averaged 0.17% over the life of the Fannie Mae Facilities, plus a credit enhancement fee of 0.49% to 0.67% . We have seen more volatility in the spread between the DMBS and three-month LIBOR since late 2007 than was historically prevalent. On June 27, 2014, we paid off $198.2 million under our credit facility with/or credit enhanced by Freddie Mac, also referred to as the Freddie Mac Facility. As of December 31, 2014 , we no longer had any borrowings outstanding through the Freddie Mac Facility. Unsecured Credit Facilities On August 7, 2013, our Operating Partnership entered into a $500.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility agreement with KeyBank National Association and thirteen other banks. This credit facility replaces our Operating Partnership's previous unsecured credit facility with KeyBank. Interest is paid using an investment grade pricing grid using LIBOR plus a spread of 0.90% to 1.70%. As of December 31, 2014 , we had $59.0 million borrowed under this facility. This facility serves as our primary source of short term liquidity and has an accordion feature to expand its capacity to $800.0 million. Unsecured Term Loans In addition to our unsecured credit facility, we maintain three term loans. We had total borrowings of $550.0 million outstanding under these term loan agreements at December 31, 2014 . The $250.0 million Wells Fargo term loan bore interest at a rate of LIBOR plus a spread of 1.65% to 2.90% based on the credit ratings of our unsecured debt from time to time. The loan matures on August 1, 2018. On July 25, 2014, we repriced the Wells Fargo term loan, and it now bears interest at a rate of LIBOR plus a spread of 0.90% to 1.90% based on the credit ratings of our unsecured debt from time to time. The maturity date was not changed. As of December 31, 2014 , this loan was bearing interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 1.15%. The $150.0 million U.S. Bank National Association term loan bore interest at a rate of LIBOR plus a spread of 1.10% to 2.05% based on the credit ratings of our unsecured debt from time to time and was set to mature on May 11, 2017. On October 1, 2014 we repriced the US Bank term loan, and it now bears interest at a rate of LIBOR plus a spread of 0.90% to 1.90% based on the credit ratings of our unsecured debt from time to time. The maturity was extended to March 1, 2020. As of December 31, 2014 , this loan was bearing interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 1.15%. The $150.0 million term loan agreement with Key Bank and J.P. Morgan bore interest at a rate of LIBOR plus a spread of 1.10% to 2.05% and matures on March 1, 2017. As of December 31, 2014 , this loan was bearing interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 1.35%. Senior Unsecured Notes We have also issued both public and private unsecured senior notes. As of December 31, 2014 , we have approximately $1.0 billion of publicly issued bonds and $310 million of private placement notes. These notes are longer term in nature and usually mature within 5 to 12 years. 54 Secured Property Mortgages We also maintain secured property mortgages with Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and various life insurance companies. These mortgages are usually fixed rate and can range from 5 to 10 years in maturity. As of December 31, 2014 , we have $1.1 billion of secured property mortgages. For more information regarding our debt capital resources, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 6. The following table reflects our total contractual cash obligations which consist of our long-term debt, development fees and operating leases as of December 31, 2014 (dollars in thousands): Contractual Obligations (1) 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 Thereafter Total Long-Term Debt Obligations (2) $ 454,540 $ 205,949 $ 321,014 $ 431,046 $ 570,290 $ 1,541,676 $ 3,524,515 Fixed Rate or Swapped Interest (3) 98,528 84,281 72,842 63,588 54,824 163,772 537,835 Purchase Obligations (4) 786 786 Operating Lease Obligations 389 244 240 174 1,047 Total $ 554,243 $ 290,474 $ 394,096 $ 494,808 $ 625,114 $ 1,705,448 $ 4,064,183 (1) Fixed rate and swapped interest are shown in this table. The average interest rates of variable rate debt are shown in preceding tables. (2) Represents principal payments. (3) Swapped interest is subject to the ineffective portion of cash flow hedges as described in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 7. (4) Represents development fees. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements At December 31, 2014 , and 2013 , we did not have any relationships, including those with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. As of December 31, 2014 , we had a 25.0% ownership interest in the McKinney joint venture, which consists of undeveloped land. As of December 31, 2014 , we had a 33.3% ownership interest in the Land Title Building joint venture, which consists of 29,971 square feet of commercial space. In addition, we do not engage in trading activities involving non-exchange traded contracts. As such, we are not materially exposed to any financing, liquidity, market, or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships. We do not have any relationships or transactions with persons or entities that derive benefits from their non-independent relationships with us or our related parties other than those disclosed in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 14. Our investments in our real estate joint ventures are unconsolidated and are recorded using the equity method for the joint ventures in which we do not have a controlling interest. Insurance We renegotiated our insurance programs effective July 1, 2014 . We believe that the property and casualty insurance program in place provides appropriate insurance coverage for financial protection against insurable risks such that any insurable loss experienced that can be reasonably anticipated would not have a significant impact on our liquidity, financial position or results of operation. 55 Inflation Our resident leases at the apartment communities allow, at the time of renewal, for adjustments in the rent payable thereunder, and thus may enable us to seek rent increases. Almost all leases are for one year or less. The short-term nature of these leases generally serves to reduce our risk to adverse effects of inflation. Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards The following table provides a brief description of recent accounting pronouncements that could have a material effect on our financial statements: Standard Description Date of Adoption Effect on the Financial Statements or Other Significant Matters Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-15, Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern This ASU requires an entity's management to evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. If substantial doubt exists, the entity must disclose the principal conditions or events that raised the substantial doubt, management's evaluation of the significance of these conditions, and management's plan for alleviating the substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern. This ASU is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016; however, early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of this ASU, but does not expect the adoption of this ASU to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations taken as a whole. ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers This ASU establishes principles for recognizing revenue upon the transfer of promised goods or services to customers, in an amount that reflects the expected consideration received in exchange for those goods or services. This ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is not permitted. The amendments may be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of initial application. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of adoption of this ASU on its consolidated financial condition and results of operations taken as a whole, but does not expect the impact to be material. The Company has not yet determined which method will be used for initial application. ASU 2014-08, Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity This ASU raises the threshold for disposals to qualify as discontinued operations. It also requires additional disclosures for discontinued operations and new disclosures for individually material disposal transactions that do not meet the definition of a discontinued operation. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2014, and interim periods within those years; however, early adoption is permitted beginning in the first quarter of 2014. We adopted this ASU on January 1, 2014. The adoption of this ASU required us to not classify certain disposals occurring during 2014 as discontinued operations.The 2014 dispositions did not qualify for discontinued operations treatment and therefore the gains on these properties are presented as a component of continuing operations for 2014.
