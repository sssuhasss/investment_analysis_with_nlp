ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and circumstances. We believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances; however, actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions. We believe that the estimates and assumptions listed below are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations because they require the greatest subjective determinations and form the basis of accounting policies deemed to be most critical. These critical accounting policies include revenue recognition, capitalization of expenditures and depreciation and amortization of assets, impairment of long-lived assets, including goodwill, acquisition of real estate assets, and fair value of derivative financial instruments. Revenue recognition We lease multifamily residential apartments under operating leases primarily with terms of one year or less. Rental revenues are recognized using a method that represents a straight-line basis over the term of the lease and other revenues are recorded when earned. We record all gains and losses on real estate in accordance with accounting standards governing the sale of real estate. Capitalization of expenditures and depreciation and amortization of assets We carry real estate assets at depreciated cost. Depreciation and amortization is computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, which range from 8 to 40 years for land improvements and buildings, 5 years for furniture, fixtures, and equipment, 3 to 5 years for computers and software, and 6 months for acquired leases, all of which are subjective determinations. Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred while significant improvements, renovations and replacements are capitalized. The cost to complete any deferred repairs and maintenance at properties acquired by us in order to elevate the condition of the property to our standards are capitalized as incurred. Development costs are capitalized in accordance with accounting standards for costs and initial rental operations of real estate projects and standards for the capitalization of interest cost, real estate taxes and personnel expense. Acquisition of Real Estate Assets We account for our acquisitions of investments in real estate in accordance with ASC 805-10, Business Combinations , which requires the fair value of the real estate acquired to be allocated to the acquired tangible assets, consisting of land, building and furniture, fixtures and equipment, and identified intangible assets, consisting of the value of in-place leases. 34 We allocate the purchase price to the fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property (which includes the land, building, and furniture, fixtures, and equipment) determined by valuing the property as if it were vacant, based on management determination of the relative fair values of these assets. Management determines the as-if-vacant fair value of a property using methods similar to those used by independent appraisers. These methods include using stabilized NOI and market specific capitalization and discount rates. In allocating the fair value of identified intangible assets of an acquired property, the in-place leases are valued based on current rent rates and time and cost to lease a unit. Management concluded that the leases acquired on each of its property acquisitions are approximately at market rates since the lease terms generally do not extend beyond one year. Impairment of long-lived assets, including goodwill We account for long-lived assets in accordance with the provisions of accounting standards for the impairment or disposal on long-lived assets and evaluate our goodwill for impairment under accounting standards for goodwill and other intangible assets. We evaluate goodwill for impairment on at least an annual basis, or more frequently if a goodwill impairment indicator is identified. We periodically evaluate long-lived assets, including investments in real estate and goodwill, for indicators that would suggest that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. The judgments regarding the existence of such indicators are based on factors such as operating performance, market conditions and legal factors. Long-lived assets, such as real estate assets, equipment and purchased intangibles subject to amortization, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. Assets to be disposed of are separately presented on the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and are no longer depreciated. The assets and liabilities of a disposed group classified as held for sale are presented separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the balance sheet. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment, and is tested for impairment more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. An impairment loss for goodwill is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill. This determination is made at the reporting unit level and consists of two steps. First, we determine the fair value of a reporting unit and compare it to its carrying amount. In the apartment industry, the primary method used for determining fair value is to divide annual operating cash flows by an appropriate capitalization rate. We determine the appropriate capitalization rate by reviewing the prevailing rates in a property market or submarket. Second, if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation in accordance with accounting standards for business combinations. The residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill. 35 Fair value of derivative financial instruments We utilize certain derivative financial instruments, primarily interest rate swaps and interest rate caps, during the normal course of business to manage, or hedge, the interest rate risk associated with our variable rate debt or as hedges in anticipation of future debt transactions to manage well-defined interest rate risk associated with the transaction. In order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedging instrument, changes in the hedging instrument must be highly effective at offsetting changes in the hedged item. The historical correlation of the hedging instruments and the underlying hedged items are assessed before entering into the hedging relationship and on a quarterly basis thereafter, and have been found to be highly effective. We measure ineffectiveness using the change in the variable cash flows method for interest rate swaps and the hypothetical derivative method for interest rate caps for each reporting period through the term of the hedging instruments. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded in earnings if in an overhedged position. The change in fair value of the interest rate swaps and the intrinsic value or fair value of interest rate caps designated as cash flow hedges are recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income in the statement of shareholders equity. The valuation of our derivative financial instruments is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative. The fair values of interest rate swaps are determined using the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future fixed cash payments and the discounted expected variable cash receipts. The variable cash receipts are based on an expectation of future interest rates (forward curves) derived from observable market interest rate curves. The fair values of interest rate caps are determined using the market standard methodology of discounting the future expected cash receipts that would occur if variable interest rates rise above the strike rate of the interest rate caps. The variable interest rates used in the calculation of projected receipts on the interest rate cap are based on an expectation of future interest rates derived from observable market interest rate curves and volatilities. Additionally, we incorporate credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both our own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements. Changes in the fair values of our derivatives are primarily the result of fluctuations in interest rates. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Notes 5 and 6 for further discussion. OVERVIEW OF THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2011 We experienced an increase in income from continuing operations in 2011 as increases in revenues outpaced increases in expenses. The increases in revenues came from a 4.2% increase in our large market same store segment, a 4.6% increase in our secondary market same store segment and a 150.6% increase in our non-same store and other segment which was primarily a result of acquisitions. The increase in expense came from a 4.0% increase in our large market same store segment, a 3.3% increase in our secondary market same store segment and a 119.4% increase in our non-same store and other segment which was primarily a result of acquisitions as well as an approximately $5.8 million increase in general and administrative costs, the majority of which was related to a $1.8 million out of period adjustment related to our restricted stock plans and a $1.4 million increase in employee medical insurance. Our same store portfolio represents those communities that have been held and have been stabilized for at least 12 months. Communities excluded from the same store portfolio would include recent acquisitions, communities being developed or in lease-up, communities undergoing extensive renovations, and communities identified as discontinued operations. 36 We have grown externally during the past three years by following our acquisition strategy to invest in large and mid-sized growing markets in the Sunbelt region of the United States. We acquired four properties for our 100% owned portfolio in 2009, eight in 2010 and eleven in 2011. We also purchased two properties through one of our joint ventures in 2009, two in 2010 and one in 2011. Offsetting some of this increased revenue stream were three property dispositions in 2009 and two dispositions in 2011. We continued to benefit from reduced interest rates in 2011; however because a reduction in average interest rates did not offset the impact from an increase in the average amount of debt outstanding for the year ended December 31, 2011 from the year ended December 31, 2010, interest expense increased by $2.7 million. As of December 31, 2011, the total number of apartment units that we owned or had an ownership interest in was 49,133 apartment units in 167 communities as compared to 46,310 in 157 communities at December 31, 2010, and 43,604 apartment units in 147 communities at December 31, 2009. For communities owned 100% by us, the average effective rent per apartment unit, excluding units in lease-up, increased to $793.46 at December 31, 2011 from $736.51 at December 31, 2010 and $715 at December 31, 2009. For these same units, overall occupancy at December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009 was 95.1%, 95.8%, 95.2%, respectively. Average effective rent per unit is equal to the average of gross rent amounts after the effect of leasing concessions for occupied units plus prevalent market rates asked for unoccupied units, divided by the total number of units. Leasing concessions represent discounts to the current market rate. We believe average effective rent is a helpful measurement in evaluating average pricing. It does not represent actual rental revenue collected per unit. The following is a discussion of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009. This discussion should be read in conjunction with all of the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2011, to the Year Ended December 31, 2010 Property revenues for the year ended December 31, 2011 were approximately $448.0 million, an increase of $50.7 million from the year ended December 31, 2010 due to (i) a $8.2 million increase in property revenues from our large market same store group primarily as a result of increased average rent per unit (ii) a $8.2 million increase in property revenues from our secondary market same store group primarily as a result of increased average rent per unit and (iii) a $34.3 million increase in property revenues from our non-same store and other group, mainly as a result of acquisitions. See further discussion on revenue growth in the Trends section below. 37 Property operating expenses include costs for property personnel, property personnel bonuses, building repairs and maintenance, real estate taxes and insurance, utilities, landscaping and depreciation and amortization. Property operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization, for the year ended December 31, 2011 were approximately $191.5 million, an increase of approximately $19.1 million from the year ended December 31, 2010 due primarily to increases in property operating expenses of (i) $3.3 million from our large market same store group, (ii) $2.6 million from our secondary market same store group, and (iii) $13.2 million from our non-same store and other group, mainly as a result of acquisitions. The increases in the large and secondary market same store groups are primarily due to an additional $1.9 million in bulk cable expense and $0.9 million increase in expense due to our Level one call center program. Other increases are the result of normal operating costs. Depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2011 was approximately $115.6 million, an increase of approximately $12.5 million from the year ended December 31, 2010 primarily due to the increases in depreciation and amortization expense of (i) $0.9 million from our large market same store group, (ii) $1.0 million from our secondary market same store group, and (iii) $10.6 million from our non-same store and other group, mainly as a result of acquisitions. Increases in depreciation and amortization expense from our large and secondary market same store groups resulted from asset additions made during the normal course of business. General and Administrative expense for the year ended December 31, 2011 was approximately $18.1 million, an increase of $5.8 million from the year ended December 31, 2010. The majority of the increase was related to a one-time charge of $1.8 million for an out of period adjustment to our restricted stock plans and a $1.4 million increase in employee medical insurance. For more discussion on the out of period adjustment, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2011 was approximately $58.6 million, an increase of $2.7 million from the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase was primarily the result of an increase in our average debt outstanding from December 31, 2010 to the year ended December 31, 2011 of approximately $127.6 million. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we recorded an asset impairment charge of approximately $1.9 million related to one of our original initial public offering communities. This community was part of our secondary market same store segment. Fair value of the community was determined by an offer. No asset impairment charges were recorded during the year ended December 31, 2011. During the year ended December 31, 2011, we recorded a gain on sale of discontinued operations of $12.8 million. There was no material gain (loss) on sale of discontinued operation during the year ended December 31, 2010. Primarily as a result of the foregoing and other various increases in expenses, net income attributable to Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. increased by approximately $19.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 from the year ended December 31, 2010. Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2010, to the Year Ended December 31, 2009 Property revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010, increased by approximately $23.3 million from the year ended December 31, 2009, due to (i) a $6.0 million increase in property revenues from our large market same store group and (ii) a $8.1 million increase in property revenues from our secondary market same store group and (iii) a $9.2 million increase in property revenues from our non-same store and other group, mainly as a result of acquisitions. The increase in our same store portfolio is largely attributable to the bulk cable program. 38 Property operating expenses include costs for property personnel, building repairs and maintenance, real estate taxes and insurance, utilities, landscaping and other property related costs. Property operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2010, increased by approximately $14.8 million from the year ended December 31, 2009, due primarily to increases of property operating expenses of (i) $4.7 million from our large market same store group, (ii) a $5.8 million from our secondary market same store group, and (ii) $4.3 million from our non-same store and other group, mainly as a result of acquisitions. The increase in our large and secondary same store groups is largely attributable to accounting for the bulk cable program. Depreciation and amortization expense increased by approximately $8.0 million primarily due to the increases of depreciation and amortization expense of (i) $1.1 million from our large market same store group, (ii) $2.5 million from our secondary market same store group, and (iii) $4.4 million from our non-same store and other group, mainly as a result of acquisitions. Increases of depreciation and amortization expense from our large and secondary market same store groups resulted from asset additions made during the normal course of business. Interest expense decreased approximately $1.1 million in 2010 from 2009 due primarily to the decrease in our average annual borrowing cost from 4.31% in 2009 to 3.95% in 2010. This decrease was somewhat offset by an increase in our average debt outstanding by approximately $88.2 million from 2009 to 2010 to fund acquisitions and our development and redevelopment programs. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we recorded an asset impairment charge of approximately $1.9 million related to one of our original initial public offering communities. This community was part of our secondary market same store segment. Fair value of the community was determined by an offer. No asset impairment charges were recorded during the year ended December 31, 2009. For the year ended December 31, 2009, we recorded total gains of approximately $4.6 million from the sale of three communities. We had no property dispositions in 2010. Income from discontinued operations decreased $1.3 million from approximately $2.2 million during the year 2009 to $0.9 million in 2010. Primarily as a result of the foregoing, net income attributable to Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. decreased by approximately $7.5 million in 2010 from 2009. Funds from Operations Funds from operations, or FFO, represents net income (computed in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP) excluding extraordinary items, net income attributable to noncontrolling interest, asset impairment, gains or losses on disposition of real estate assets, plus depreciation and amortization of real estate, and adjustments for joint ventures to reflect FFO on the same basis. This definition of FFO is in accordance with the NAREIT definition. Disposition of real estate assets includes sales of discontinued operations as well as proceeds received from insurance and other settlements from property damage. In response to the Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Policy Statement relating to EITF Topic D-42 concerning the calculation of earnings per share for the redemption of preferred stock, we have included the amount charged to retire preferred stock in excess of carrying values in our FFO calculation. 39 Our policy is to expense the cost of interior painting, vinyl flooring, and blinds as incurred for stabilized properties. During the stabilization period for acquisition properties, these items are capitalized as part of the total repositioning program of newly acquired properties, and, thus are not deducted in calculating FFO. FFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income or any other GAAP measurement of performance, as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating, investing, and financing activities as a measure of liquidity. We believe that FFO is helpful to investors in understanding our operating performance in that such calculation excludes depreciation and amortization expense on real estate assets. We believe that GAAP historical cost depreciation of real estate assets is generally not correlated with changes in the value of those assets, whose value does not diminish predictably over time, as historical cost depreciation implies. Our calculation of FFO may differ from the methodology for calculating FFO utilized by other REITs and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other REITs. 40 The following table is a reconciliation of FFO to consolidated net income for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009 (dollars in thousands): Years ended December 31, 2011 2010 (1) 2009 Consolidated net income $ 51,231 $ 30,875 $ 39,221 Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests (2,410 ) (1,114 ) (2,010 ) Net income attributable to MAA 48,821 29,761 37,211 Depreciation and amortization of real estate assets 113,395 101,024 93,079 Asset impairment - 1,914 - Net casualty (gains) loss and other settlement proceeds 619 (330 ) (32 ) Gain on properties contributed to joint ventures - (752 ) - Net loss on insurance and other settlement proceeds of discontinued operations 12 - - Depreciation and amortization of real estate assets of discontinued operations 822 976 941 Loss (gains) on sales of discontinued operations (12,799 ) 2 (4,649 ) Depreciation and amortization of real estate assets of real estate joint ventures 2,262 1,896 970 Preferred dividend distribution - (6,549 ) (12,865 ) Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 2,410 1,114 2,010 Premiums and original issuance costs associated with the redemption of preferred stock - (5,149 ) - Funds from operations $ 155,542 $ 123,907 $ 116,665 (1) In accordance with NAREIT's current guidance, FFO has been updated to exclude asset impairment write downs. FFO for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased approximately $31.6 million from the year ended December 31, 2010 primarily as a result of the increase in property revenues of approximately $50.7 million discussed above that was only partially offset by the $19.1 million increase in property operating expenses. FFO for the year ended December 31, 2010 was impacted by a distribution in preferred dividends of $6.5 million and by the recognition of approximately $5.1 million on the consolidated statements of operations representing the write-off of premiums and original issuance costs for the Series H preferred stock redemption. There were no such charges for 2011. FFO for the year ended December 31, 2010 increased approximately $7.2 million from the year ended December 31, 2009 primarily as a result of the increase in property revenues of approximately $23.3 million discussed above that was only partially offset by the $14.8 million increase in property operating expenses. Trends During 2011, rental demand for apartments continued to improve relative to 2010. This was evident through physical occupancy that was consistent with 2010 combined with steady price increases on both new leases and renewals signed throughout the year. We have maintained this momentum with job formation, one of the primary drivers of apartment demand, continuing to be slow to return. The stagnant job market across the nation and in our markets continues to cause us to be cautious about apartment demand and pricing but optimistic about the long term prospects for apartment demand as job growth returns. 41 An important part of our portfolio strategy is to maintain a broad diversity of markets across the Sunbelt region of the United States. The diversity of markets tends to mitigate exposure to economic issues in any one geographic market or area. We have found that a well diversified portfolio, including both large and select secondary markets, has tended to perform well in up cycles as well as weather down cycles better. As of December 31, 2011, with the addition of assets in Richmond, Virginia and Fredericksburg, Virginia, we were invested in over 50 separate markets, with 59% of our gross assets in large markets and 41% of our gross assets in select secondary markets. We also continue to benefit on the supply side. New supply entering the market was low in 2011 and continues to run well below historical new supply delivery averages. Competition from condominiums reverting back to rental units, or new condominiums being converted to rental, was not a major factor in our portfolio because most of our submarkets have not been primary areas for condominium development. We have found the same to be true for rental competition from single family homes. We have avoided committing a significant amount of capital to markets where most of the excessive inflation in house prices has occurred. We saw significant rental competition from condominiums or single family houses in only a few of our submarkets. We expect this relative new supply compression to continue to be a positive factor to our business as the new supply remains limited. Our focus throughout 2011 was on pushing pricing where possible through our revenue management system, while maintaining strong physical occupancy. Effective rent per unit for the year was higher than 2010 by 3.8%, with each individual quarter growth higher than the previous quarter. This pricing trend is expected to continue in 2012. As pricing continued to move forward throughout the year, our average same store physical occupancy (large market same store and secondary market same store segments combined) in 2011 remained strong at 96%. Overall same store revenues increased 4.4% for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2010. This included an increase of $3.1 million due to our new bulk cable program. With cable expense netted into cable revenues, same store revenues increased 4.0% over this period. As expected, more robust revenue growth resumed in 2011 as compared to 2010 as rents continued the upward trend that began in the latter part of 2010. Although some increase in development is expected, we believe the continued reduced availability of financing for new apartment construction will likely limit new apartment construction to levels well below pre-recession deliveries. Also, more sustainable credit terms for residential mortgages should work to favor rental demand at existing multi-family properties. Long term, we expect demographic trends (including the growth of prime age groups for rentals and immigration and population movement to the southeast and southwest) will continue to build apartment rental demand for our markets. Should the economy fall into a recession, the limited new supply of apartments and the more disciplined mortgage financing for single family home buying should lessen the impact to some degree, but a weak economy and employment market would nevertheless limit rent growth prospects. 42 We continue to develop improved products, operating systems and procedures that enable us to capture more revenues. The continued roll-out of ancillary services (such as our cable saver and deposit saver programs), improved collections and utility reimbursements enable us to capture increased revenue dollars. We also actively work on improving processes and products to reduce expenses, such as new web-sites and internet access for our residents that enable them to transact their business with us more simply and effectively. Throughout 2011, we continued to have the benefit of lower interest rates resulting from a continued strong market for FNMA and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation debt securities. Short term interest rates continue to be at historically low levels, and as a result, we are forecasting a continuation of favorable interest rates in the near term with the expectation of rising rates as the economy improves. Liquidity and Capital Resources Net cash flow provided by operating activities increased to $172.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 from $133.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. This change was a result of various items, including changes in cash flows associated with the timing of accrual payments and higher revenue as discussed above. Net cash used in investing activities was approximately $ 442.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to $254.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2010, mainly related to acquisition activity and development costs. In the year ended December 31, 2011, we had acquisition cash outflows of $362.7 million compared to $278.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. During 2011, we had cash outflows of $38.2 million for development activities, compared to $16.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. During 2011, we also had cash outflows of $52.1 million for improvements to existing real estate assets compared to $31.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase in cash outflows also included a decrease in cash inflows from disposition activity. During the year ended December 31, 2011, we had cash inflows of approximately $23.7 million, related to the sale of two properties from our same store portfolio. In the year ended December 31, 2010, we had cash inflows of $90.3 million, mainly related to the contributions of three communities to Fund II. Net cash provided by financing activities was approximately $281.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to $152.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. In the year ended December 31, 2011, we had cash inflows of $285.4 million from proceeds of notes payable compared to $137.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. In the year ended December 31, 2011, we received proceeds of approximately $235.7 million primarily from the issuance of common stock through our at-the-market program, or ATM and a waiver through our Dividend and Distribution Reinvestment and Share Purchase Plan, or DRSPP. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we received proceeds of approximately $305.5 million primarily through these same programs. We used $155.0 million of these proceeds to fund the redemption of our 8.30% Series H Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, or Series H during 2010. During 2011, we sold 3,303,273 shares of common stock for net proceeds of approximately $204.5 million through our ATM. This compares to 5,077,201 shares of common stock for net proceeds of approximately $274.6 million for 2010. During 2011, we issued 495,645 shares at an average discount of 2% for net proceeds of $30.0 million through the direct stock purchase feature of our DRSPP. During 2010, we issued 551,895 shares at an average discount of 2% for net proceeds of $30.0 million through the direct stock purchase feature of our DRSPP. During 2009, we did not offer a discount through our DRSPP and issued approximately 1,100 shares of common stock, generating approximately $39,000 in proceeds. 43 On June 2, 2010, we redeemed 3,100,001 shares of the 6,200,000 shares of our Series H preferred stock for approximately $77.5 million. On August 5, 2010 we redeemed all of the remaining and outstanding shares of Series H for approximately $77.5 million, resulting in a combined write-off for the year ended December 31, 2010 of approximately $5.1 million on the consolidated statements of operations related to premiums and original issuance costs. There was no redemption of preferred stock during 2011. The weighted average interest rate at December 31, 2011 for the $1.6 billion of debt outstanding was 3.7%, compared to the weighted average interest rate of 3.8% on $1.5 billion of debt outstanding at December 31, 2010. We utilize both conventional and tax exempt debt to help finance our activities. Borrowings are made through individual property mortgages as well as company-wide secured and unsecured credit facilities. We utilize fixed rate borrowings, interest rate swaps and interest rate caps to manage our current and future interest rate risk. More details on our borrowings can be found in the schedules presented later in this section. At December 31, 2011, we had secured credit facility relationships with Prudential Mortgage Capital which are credit enhanced by the FNMA, Financial Federal which are credit enhanced by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, or Freddie Mac, and a $250 million bank unsecured facility with a syndicate of banks. Together, these credit facilities provided a total line capacity of $1.4 billion with all but $2.9 million collateralized and available to borrow at December 31, 2011. We had total borrowings outstanding under these credit facilities of $1.1 billion at December 31, 2011. Approximately 57% of our outstanding obligations at December 31, 2011 were borrowed through credit facilities with/or credit enhanced by FNMA, also referred to as the FNMA Facilities. The FNMA Facilities have a combined line limit of $964 million, all of which was collateralized and available to borrow at December 31, 2011. We had total borrowings outstanding under the FNMA Facilities of approximately $948 million at December 31, 2011. Various FNMA rate traunches of the FNMA Facilities mature from 2012 through 2018. The FNMA Facilities provide for both fixed and variable rate borrowings. The interest rate on the majority of the variable portion is based on the FNMA Discount Mortgage Backed Security, or DMBS, rate which are credit-enhanced by FNMA and are typically sold every 90 days by Prudential Mortgage Capital at interest rates approximating three-month LIBOR less a spread that has averaged 0.16% over the life of the FNMA Facilities, plus a credit enhancement fee of 0.49% to 0.67%. We have seen more volatility in the spread between the DMBS and three-month LIBOR since late 2007 than was historically prevalent. Approximately 12% of our outstanding obligations at December 31, 2011 were borrowed through a credit facility with/or credit enhanced by Freddie Mac, also referred to as the Freddie Mac Facility. The Freddie Mac Facility has a combined line limit of $200 million, of which $198 million was collateralized and available to borrow at December 31, 2011. We had total borrowings outstanding under the Freddie Mac Facility of approximately $198 million at December 31, 2011. The Freddie Mac facility matures in 2014. The interest rate on the Freddie Mac Facility renews every 30 or 90 days and is based on the Freddie Mac Reference Bill Rate on the date of renewal, which has historically approximated the equivalent 30 or 90-day LIBOR, plus a credit enhancement fee of 0.65%. The Freddie Mac Reference Bill rate has traded consistently below LIBOR, and the historical average spread was 0.32% below LIBOR at December 31, 2011. 44 We also maintain a $250 million unsecured credit facility with nine banks led by Key Bank. The Key Bank Credit Line bears an interest rate of LIBOR plus a spread of 1.65% to 2.40% based on a leveraged based pricing grid. This credit line expires in November 2015 with a one year extension option. At December 31, 2011, we had $249 million available to be borrowed under the Key Bank Credit Line agreement with $0 million borrowed under this facility. Approximately $1 million of the facility is used to support letters of credit. Each of our credit facilities is subject to various covenants and conditions on usage, and the secured facilities are subject to periodic re-evaluation of collateral. If we were to fail to satisfy a condition to borrowing, the available credit under one or more of the facilities could not be drawn, which could adversely affect our liquidity. In the event of a reduction in real estate values the amount of available credit could be reduced. Moreover, if we were to fail to make a payment or violate a covenant under a credit facility, after applicable cure periods, one or more of our lenders could declare a default, accelerate the due date for repayment of all amounts outstanding and/or foreclose on properties securing such facilities. A default on an obligation to repay outstanding debt could also create a cross default on a separate piece of debt, whereby one or more of our lenders could accelerate the due date for repayment of all amounts outstanding and/or foreclose on properties securing the related facilities. Any such event could have a material adverse effect. On July 29, 2011, we issued $135 million of Senior Unsecured Notes. The notes were offered in a private placement with three maturity traunches: $50.00 million 7-year maturity at 4.7%, $72.75 million 10-year maturity at 5.4%, and $12.25 million 12-year maturity at 5.6%. At December 31, 2011, $135 million was outstanding with an average remaining maturity of 8.7 years and an average interest rate of 5.1%. The following schedule details the line limits, collateralized availability and the outstanding balances of our various borrowings as of December 31, 2011 (dollars in thousands): Average Years to Line Amount Amount Contract Limit Collateralized Borrowed Maturity Fannie Mae Credit Facilities $ 964,429 $ 964,429 $ 948,300 4.9 Freddie Mac Credit Facilities 200,000 198,247 198,247 2.5 Other Secured Borrowings 368,208 368,208 368,208 8.3 Unsecured Senior Notes 135,000 135,000 135,000 8.7 Unsecured Credit Facility 250,000 248,827 - 3.8 Total Debt $ 1,917,637 $ 1,914,711 $ 1,649,755 5.7 As of December 31, 2011, we had entered into interest rate swaps totaling a notional amount of $576.8 million. To date, these swaps have proven to be highly effective hedges. We had also entered into interest rate cap agreements totaling a notional amount of approximately $270.7 million as of December 31, 2011. 45 The following schedule outlines our variable versus fixed rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps and caps, outstanding as of December 31, 2011 (dollars in thousands): Average Years to Principal Rate Effective Balance Maturity Rate SECURED DEBT Conventional - Fixed Rate or Swapped $ 962,008 4.3 5.1% Tax-free - Fixed Rate or Swapped 17,800 0.8 4.4% Conventional - Variable Rate - Capped (1) 197,936 4.4 0.7% Tax-free - Variable Rate - Capped (1) 72,715 2.2 0.9% Total Secured Fixed or Hedged Rate Maturity $ 1,250,459 4.2 4.2% Conventional - Variable Rate (2) 264,296 0.2 0.9% Total Secured Interest Rate Maturity $ 1,514,755 3.5 3.6% UNSECURED DEBT Fixed Senior Unsecured Notes $ 135,000 8.7 5.1% Variable Unsecured Facility - - 0.0% Total Unsecured Debt $ 135,000 8.7 5.1% TOTAL DEBT INTEREST RATE MATURITY $ 1,649,755 5.0 3.7% (1) The effective rate represents the average rate on the underlying variable debt unless the cap rates are reached, which average 4.6% of LIBOR for conventional caps and 5.4% of SIFMA for tax-free caps.

We rely on the efficient operation of the financial markets to finance debt maturities, and on FNMA and Freddie Mac, or the Agencies. The Agencies provided credit enhancement for approximately $1.1 billion of our outstanding debt through credit facilities as of December 31, 2011. The interest rate markets for FNMA DMBS and Freddie Mac Reference Bills, which in our experience are highly liquid and highly correlated with three-month LIBOR interest rates, are also an important component of our liquidity and interest rate swap effectiveness. Prudential Mortgage Capital, a DUS lender for Fannie Mae, markets 90-day Fannie Mae Discount Mortgage Backed Securities monthly, and is obligated to advance funds to us at DMBS rates plus a credit spread under the terms of the credit agreements between Prudential and us. Financial Federal, a Freddie Mac Program Plus Lender and Servicer, is obligated to advance funds under the terms of credit agreements between Financial Federal and us. 47 For the year ended December 31, 2011, our net cash provided by operating activities was in excess of covering funding improvements to existing real estate assets, distributions to unitholders, and dividends paid on common and preferred shares by approximately $22.9 million, as compared to $12.2 million and $12.3 million for the same periods in 2010 and 2009, respectively. While we had sufficient liquidity to permit distributions at current rates through additional borrowings, if necessary, any significant deterioration in operations could result in our financial resources being insufficient to pay distributions to shareholders at the current rate, in which event we would be required to reduce the distribution rate. The following table reflects our total contractual cash obligations which consist of our long-term debt and operating leases as of December 31, 2011 (dollars in thousands): Contractual Obligations (1) 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Thereafter Total Long-Term Debt (2) $ 68,502 $ 207,103 $ 447,410 $ 172,333 $ 83,322 $ 671,085 $ 1,649,755 Fixed Rate or Swapped Interest (3) 48,894 41,289 32,016 25,871 23,282 82,083 253,435 Purchase Obligations (4) 10,263 2,367 - - - - 12,630 Operating Lease 13 4 3 1 - - 21 Total $ 127,672 $ 250,763 $ 479,429 $ 198,205 $ 106,604 $ 753,168 $ 1,915,841 (1) Fixed rate and swapped interest are shown in this table.

(3) Swapped interest is subject to the ineffective portion of cash flow hedges as described in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 6. (4) Represents development fees Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements At December 31, 2011, and 2010, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. Mid-America Multifamily Fund I, LLC, was established to acquire $500 million of apartment communities with redevelopment upside offering value creation opportunity through capital improvements, operating enhancements and restructuring in-place financing. As of December 31, 2011, Mid-America Multifamily Fund I, LLC owned two properties but does not expect to acquire any additional communities. Mid-America Multifamily Fund II, LLC, was established to acquire $250 million of apartment communities with redevelopment upside offering value creation opportunity through capital improvements, operating enhancements and restructuring in-place financing. As of December 31, 2011, Mid-America Multifamily Fund II, LLC owned five properties. In addition, we do not engage in trading activities involving non-exchange traded contracts. As such, we are not materially exposed to any financing, liquidity, market, or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships. We do not have any relationships or transactions with persons or entities that derive benefits from their non-independent relationships with us or our related parties other than those disclosed in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 12. Our investments in our real estate joint ventures are unconsolidated and are recorded using the equity method as we do not have a controlling interest. 48 Insurance We renegotiated our insurance programs effective July 1, 2011. We believe that the property and casualty insurance program in place provides appropriate insurance coverage for financial protection against insurable risks such that any insurable loss experienced that can be reasonably anticipated would not have a significant impact on our liquidity, financial position or results of operation. Inflation Substantially all of the resident leases at the apartment communities allow, at the time of renewal, for adjustments in the rent payable there under, and thus may enable us to seek rent increases. Almost all leases are for one year or less. The short-term nature of these leases generally serves to reduce our risk to adverse effects of inflation. Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards In June 2011, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2011-05, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Presentation of Comprehensive Income. This ASU allows an entity the option to present the total of comprehensive income, the components of net income, and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. In both choices, an entity is required to present each component of net income along with total net income, each component of other comprehensive income along with a total for other comprehensive income, and a total amount for comprehensive income. ASU 2011-05 eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of equity. The amendments do not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income. ASU 2011-05 will be applied retrospectively. The amendments are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2011, but allows for early adoption. We adopted ASU 2011-05 for the Annual Report for fiscal year 2011, and this changed the presentation of our financial statements but not our consolidated financial condition or results of operations taken as a whole. In November 2011, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2011-12, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Deferral of the Effective Date for Amendments to the Presentation of Reclassifications of Items Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in Accounting Standards Update No. 2011-05 . This ASU supersedes certain paragraphs in ASU 2011-05 addressing reclassification adjustments out of accumulated other comprehensive income. The effective dates and expected changes to our presentation are the same as noted in ASU 2011-05 above. In May 2011, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2011-04, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRS. The amendments change the wording, mainly for clarification, used to describe many of the requirements in U.S. GAAP for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements. For many of the requirements, the Board does not intend for the amendments in this update to result in a change in the application of the requirements in Topic 820. The amendments in this ASU are to be applied prospectively. The amendments are effective during interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011. We will adopt ASU 2011-04 in the interim and annual periods of fiscal year 2012. The adoption of ASU 2011-04 will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations taken as a whole. 49
