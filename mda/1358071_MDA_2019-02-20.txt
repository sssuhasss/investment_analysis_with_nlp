Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion is intended to assist you in understanding our business and results of operations together with our present financial condition. This section should be read in conjunction with our historical consolidated financial statements and notes, as well as the selected historical consolidated financial data included elsewhere in this report. Certain statements in our discussion below are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. We caution that a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those implied or expressed by the forward-looking statements. Please see Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Item 1A. Risk Factors for further details about these statements. Overview We are an independent oil and natural gas company engaged in the acquisition, development, exploration and production of oil and natural gas properties. We are one of the largest operators in the Permian Basin of Southeast New Mexico and West Texas. Concho legacy in the Permian Basin provides us a deep understanding of operating and geological trends, and we are actively developing our resource base utilizing large-scale development projects, which include long-lateral wells and multi-well pad locations, throughout our operating areas. Oil comprised 63 percent of our 1,187 MMBoe of estimated proved reserves at December 31, 2018 and 64 percent of our 96 MMBoe of production for 2018. We seek to operate the wells in which we own an interest, and we operated wells that accounted for 92 percent of our proved developed producing reserves and 77 percent of our 9,277 gross wells at December 31, 2018. By controlling operations, we are able to more effectively manage the cost and timing of exploration and development of our properties, including the drilling and stimulation methods used. 42 Financial and Operating Performance On July 19, 2018, we completed the RSP Acquisition, which, among other things, impacted the comparability of our results of operations. Our financial and operating performance for 2018 included the following highlights: Net income was $ 2,286 million ($13.25 per diluted share) as compared to net income of $956 million ($ 6.41 per diluted share) in 2017. The increase was primarily due to: $1,565 million increase in oil and natural gas revenues as a result of a 36 percent increase in production and a 18 percent increase in commodity price realizations per Boe (excluding the effects of derivative activities) ; $ 958 million change in (gain) loss on derivatives due to a $832 million gain on derivatives during 2018, as compared to a $126 million loss during 2017; $122 million net increase in gain on disposition of assets due to a gain of approximately $800 million during 2018 primarily attributable to the February 2018 acquisition and divestiture primarily in the Midland Basin, the January 2018 divestiture in the Delaware Basin and the contribution of certain infrastructure assets to WaterBridge Operating LLC ( WaterBridge ) in December 2018, as compared to a net gain of approximately $678 million during 2017 primarily attributable to our disposition of ACC ; and $ 86 million increase in other income, primarily due to a gain of approximately $103 million on the equity method investment distribution received from Oryx; partially offset by: $678 million increase in our income tax provision primarily due to the income tax benefit recorded in 2017 as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the TCJA ); $332 million increase in depreciation, depletion and amortization expense, primarily due to an increase in production, partially offset by a lower depletion rate per Boe; $182 million increase in production expense, primarily due to (i) increased production associated with our wells successfully drilled and completed in 2017 and 2018, (ii) our acquisitions and nonmonetary transactions during the fourth quarter of 2017 and during 2018, (iii) increased cost of services and (iv) increased workover costs; $106 million increase in production and ad valorem tax expense, primarily due to increased production taxes as a result of increased oil and natural gas sales; and $36 million increase in transaction costs, primarily due to consulting, investment banking, advisory, legal and other fees related to the RSP Acquisition. Average daily sales volumes increased by 36 percent from 192,658 Boe per day during 2017 to 262,937 Boe per day during 2018. Net cash provided by operating activities increased by approximately $863 million to $2,558 million for 2018, as compared to $1,695 m illion in 2017, primarily due to increased oil and natural gas revenues, partially offset by (i) changes related to cash settlements on derivatives, (ii) increased production expense and (iii) increased production tax expense. 43 Commodity Prices Our results of operations are heavily influenced by commodity prices. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for a description of the factors that may impact future commodity prices, including the price of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids. Although we cannot predict the occurrence of events that may affect future commodity prices or the degree to which these prices will be affected, the prices for any commodity that we produce will generally approximate current market prices in the geographic region of the production. From time to time, we expect that we may hedge a portion of our commodity price risk to mitigate the impact of price volatility on our business. See Notes 9 and 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information regarding our commodity derivative positions at December 31, 2018 and additional derivative contracts entered into subsequent to December 31, 2018, respectively. The following table sets forth the average NYMEX oil and natural gas prices for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, as well as the high and low NYMEX prices for the same periods: Years Ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 Average NYMEX prices: Oil (Bbl) $ 64.81 $ 50.97 $ 43.42 Natural gas (MMBtu) $ 3.07 $ 3.02 $ 2.56 High and Low NYMEX prices: Oil (Bbl): High $ 76.41 $ 60.42 $ 54.06 Low $ 42.53 $ 42.53 $ 26.21 Natural gas (MMBtu): High $ 4.84 $ 3.72 $ 3.93 Low $ 2.55 $ 2.56 $ 1.64 Further, the NYMEX oil price and NYMEX natural gas price reached highs and lows of $55.59 and $45.41 per Bbl and $3.59 and $2.55 per MMBtu, respectively, during the period from January 1, 2019 to February 15, 2019. At February 15, 2019, the NYMEX oil price and NYMEX natural gas price were $55.59 per Bbl and $2.63 per MMBtu, respectively. Historically, and during the year ended December 31, 2018, we derived a significant portion of our total natural gas revenues from the value of the natural gas liquids contained in our natural gas, with the remaining portion coming from the value of the dry natural gas residue. Because of our liquids-rich natural gas stream, and the related value of the natural gas liquids being included in our natural gas revenues, our realized natural gas price (excluding the effects of derivatives) reflected a price greater than the related NYMEX natural gas price for the year ended December 31, 2018. The average Mont Belvieu price for a blended barrel of natural gas liquids was $29.94 per Bbl, $25.06 per Bbl and $18.08 per Bbl during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Potential cost inflation . Oilfield service and supply costs are also subject to supply and demand dynamics. As companies expand their drilling and development activities, the demand for third-party oilfield services and suppliers may also increase. As such, when commodity prices begin to trend upward, we expect demand for oilfield services and supplies to grow, and the costs of drilling, equipping and operating our wells and infrastructure could begin to rise. Our lease operating expenses per Boe increased during 2018 as compared to 2017, partially due to cost inflation resulting from these factors. 44 Recent Events 2019 capital budget. In October 2018, our board of directors approved our 2019 capital budget of up to $3.8 billion. With current commodity prices, we expect to spend between $2.8 billion and $3.0 billion on drilling and completion activity. 2019 dividends. On February 19, 2019, our board of directors declared a cash dividend of $0.125 per share for the first quarter of 2019. The total cash dividend, including cash dividend on unvested restricted stock awards, of $25 million is expected to be paid on March 29, 2019 to stockholders of record as of March 1, 2019. Marketing contract. Consistent with our strategy of diversifying our oil pricing, in January 2019, we entered into a firm sales agreement with a third-party purchaser. The purchaser provides an integrated transportation and marketing strategy, including ample dock capacity. The agreement has a term that ends five years after the startup of Cactus II Pipeline system and requires that we deliver 50,000 barrels of oil per day that will receive waterborne market pricing. RSP Acquisition. On July 19, 2018, we completed the RSP Acquisition. Under the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Acquisition Agreement ), each share of RSP common stock was converted into 0.320 of a share of our common stock. We issued approximately 51 million shares of common stock at a price of $148.27 per share, resulting in total consideration paid to the former RSP shareholders of approximately $7.5 billion. Refer to Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information regarding the RSP Acquisition. Long-term debt. On July 2, 2018, we issued $1,600 million in aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes, consisting of $1,000 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.3% unsecured senior notes due 2028 (the 4.3% Notes ) and $600 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.85% unsecured senior notes due 2048 (the 4.85% Notes and, together with the 4.3% Notes, the Notes ). The net proceeds of approximately $1,579 million were used to redeem and cancel all of RSP outstanding $700 million aggregate principal amount of 6.625% unsecured senior notes due 2022 (the RSP 2022 Notes ) and $450 million aggregate principal amount of 5.25% unsecured senior notes due 2025 (the RSP 2025 Notes and, together with the RSP 2022 Notes, the RSP Notes ) and to repay a portion of the outstanding indebtedness under RSP existing credit facility. We repaid the remaining balance under RSP credit facility with borrowings under our Credit Facility, resulting in a total payoff of $1,773 million, which included the accrued interest and premiums on the RSP notes and other fees and expenses related to RSP credit facility. Derivative Financial Instruments Derivative financial instrument exposure. At December 31, 2018, the fair value of our financial derivatives was a net asset of $695 million. Under the terms of our financial derivative instruments, we do not have exposure to potential margin calls on our financial derivative instruments. The terms of our Credit Facility do not allow us to offset amounts we may owe a lender against amounts we may be owed related to our financial instruments with such party. New commodity derivative contracts. After December 31, 2018, we entered into derivative contracts to hedge additional amounts of estimated future production. Refer to Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information regarding these commodity derivative contracts. 45 Results of Operations The following table sets forth summary production and operating data for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. The actual historical data in this table excludes results from the RSP Acquisition for periods prior to July 19, 2018 and the Reliance Acquisition for periods prior to October 2016. Because of normal production declines, increased or decreased drilling activities, fluctuations in commodity prices and the effects of acquisitions and divestitures, the historical information presented below should not be interpreted as being indicative of future results. Years Ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 Production and operating data: Net production volumes: Oil (MBbl) 61,251 43,472 33,840 Natural gas (MMcf) 208,326 161,089 127,481 Total (MBoe) 95,972 70,320 55,087 Average daily production volumes: Oil (Bbl) 167,811 119,101 92,459 Natural gas (Mcf) 570,756 441,340 348,309 Total (Boe) 262,937 192,658 150,511 Average prices per unit: Oil, without derivatives (Bbl) $ 56.22 $ 48.13 $ 39.90 Oil, with derivatives (Bbl) (a) $ 52.73 $ 49.93 $ 57.90 Natural gas, without derivatives (Mcf) $ 3.40 $ 3.07 $ 2.23 Natural gas, with derivatives (Mcf) (a) $ 3.37 $ 3.06 $ 2.36 Total, without derivatives (Boe) $ 43.25 $ 36.78 $ 29.68 Total, with derivatives (Boe) (a) $ 40.98 $ 37.88 $ 41.03 Operating costs and expenses per Boe: (b) Oil and natural gas production $ 6.14 $ 5.80 $ 5.81 Production and ad valorem taxes $ 3.19 $ 2.82 $ 2.38 Gathering, processing and transportation $ 0.58 $ - $ - Depreciation, depletion and amortization $ 15.41 $ 16.29 $ 21.19 General and administrative $ 3.25 $ 3.46 $ 4.09 (a) Includes the effect of net cash receipts from (payments on) derivatives: Years Ended December 31, (in millions) 2018 2017 2016 Net cash receipts from (payments on) derivatives: Oil derivatives $ (213) $ 79 $ 609 Natural gas derivatives (5) - 16 Total $ (218) $ 79 $ 625 The presentation of average prices with derivatives is a result of including the net cash receipts from (payments on) commodity derivatives that are presented in our statements of cash flows. This presentation of average prices with derivatives is a means by which to reflect the actual cash performance of our commodity derivatives for the respective periods and presents oil and natural gas prices with derivatives in a manner consistent with the presentation generally used by the investment community. (b) Per Boe amounts calculated using dollars and volumes rounded to thousands. 46 The following table presents selected production data for the fields that represent greater than 15 percent of our total proved reserves at December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016: Year Ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 Production: Delaware Basin: Oil (MMBbl) 34 25 21 Natural gas (Bcf) 130 103 80 Total (MMBoe) 56 42 34 Midland Basin: Oil (MMBbl) 21 11 6 Natural gas (Bcf) 52 30 20 Total (MMBoe) 30 16 9 Yeso: Oil (MMBbl) (a) 7 7 Natural gas (Bcf) (a) 28 27 Total (MMBoe) (a) 12 12 (a) Represents less than 15% of our total proved reserves for the year indicated. The Yeso field is part of our Delaware Basin operating area. 47 Year Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2017 Oil and natural gas revenues. Oil and natural gas operating revenues were $4,151 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 , an increase of $1,565 million (61 percent ) from $2,586 million for 2017 . This increase was primarily due to the increase in oil and natural gas production, partially due to the RSP Acquisition, as well as the increase in realized oil and natural gas prices (excluding the effects of derivative activities). Additionally, on January 1, 2018, we adopted ASC 606, which requires certain costs related to gathering, processing and transportation to be separately presented on the consolidated statements of operations. Prior to the adoption of ASC 606, these costs were generally accounted for as a deduction to revenue and included within total operating revenues on the consolidated statements of operations. We elected to use the modified retrospective approach for adopting ASC 606, and as such, prior period amounts have not been restated. See Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for more information regarding the adoption of ASC 606. Specific factors affecting oil and natural gas revenues include the following: total oil production was 61,251 MBbl for the year ended December 31, 2018 , an increase of 17,779 MBbl (41 percent ) from 43,472 MBbl for 2017 ; average realized oil price (excluding the effects of derivative activities) was $56.22 per Bbl during the year ended December 31, 2018 , an increase of 17 percent from $48.13 per Bbl during 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2018 , our crude oil price differential relative to NYMEX was $(8.59) per Bbl, or a realization of approximately 87 percent, as compared to a crude oil price differential relative to NYMEX of $(2.84) per Bbl, or a realization of approximately 94 percent, for 2017. The basis differential (referred to as the Mid-Cush differential ) between the location of Midland, Texas and Cushing, Oklahoma (NYMEX pricing location) for our oil directly impacts our realized oil price. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the average market Mid-Cush differential was a price reduction of $6.51 per Bbl and $0.30 per Bbl, respectively. Additionally, we incur fixed deductions from the posted Midland oil price based on the location of our oil within the Permian Basin. Our crude oil price differential relative to NYMEX excluding the Mid-Cush differential was $2.08 per Bbl for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $2.54 per Bbl for the year ended December 31, 2017; total natural gas production was 208,326 MMcf for the year ended December 31, 2018 , an increase of 47,237 MMcf (29 percent ) from 161,089 MMcf for 2017 ; and average realized natural gas price (excluding the effects of derivative activities) was $3.40 per Mcf during the year ended December 31, 2018 , an increase of 11 percent from $3.07 per Mcf during 2017 . For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 , we realized approximately 111 percent and 102 percent, respectively, of the average NYMEX natural gas prices for the respective periods. Historically, and during the year ended December 31, 2018, we derived a significant portion of our total natural gas revenues from the value of the natural gas liquids contained in our natural gas, with the remaining portion coming from the value of the dry natural gas residue. Because of our liquids-rich natural gas stream and the related value of the natural gas liquids being included in our natural gas revenues, our realized natural gas price (excluding the effects of derivatives) reflected a price greater than the related NYMEX natural gas price for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in our realized natural gas price (excluding the effects of derivatives) as a percentage of NYMEX during the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to 2017 was primarily due to an increase in the average Mont Belvieu price for a blended barrel of natural gas liquids. The average Mont Belvieu price for a blended barrel of natural gas liquids was $29.94 per Bbl and $25.06 per Bbl during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase in our realized natural gas price was also due to the adoption of ASC 606, as our natural gas realized price was $0.16 per Mcf higher than what it would have been under the previous revenue standard. However, the increase was partially offset by lower regional market prices for natural gas, in part due to the widening of the regional differentials. During the latter part of 2018, amid concerns of rising natural gas production relative to natural gas takeaway in the Permian Basin, the natural gas price differential increased significantly. For example, during the fourth quarter of 2018, we realized approximately 76 percent of the average NYMEX natural gas prices. 48 Oil and natural gas production expenses. The following table provides the components of our oil and natural gas production expenses for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017: Years Ended December 31, 2018 2017 Per Per (in millions, except per unit amounts) Amount Boe Amount Boe Lease operating expenses $ 553 $ 5.76 $ 387 $ 5.50 Workover costs 37 0.38 21 0.30 Total oil and natural gas production expenses $ 590 $ 6.14 $ 408 $ 5.80 Lease operating expenses were $553 million ($5.76 per Boe) for the year ended December 31, 2018 , which was an increase of $166 million (43 percent) from $387 million ($5.50 per Boe) for the year ended December 31, 2017 . The increase in lease operating expenses was primarily the result of increased production activities due to (i) additional wells successfully drilled and completed (ii) additional wells added from acquisitions, primarily the RSP Acquisition and (iii) overall increased cost of services. The increase in lease operating expenses per Boe was primarily due to the increase in lease operating expenses noted above, partially offset by an increase in production. Workover costs were $37 million ($0.38 per Boe) for the year ended December 31, 2018 , which was an increase of $16 million from $21 million ($0.30 per Boe) during 2017 . The increase in workover costs during the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to 2017 was primarily due to increased workover activity and higher cost of services. The increase in workover costs per Boe was primarily due to the increase in workover costs noted above, partially offset by an increase in production. Production and ad valorem taxes. The following table provides the components of our production and ad valorem tax expenses for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017: Years Ended December 31, 2018 2017 Per Per (in millions, except per unit amounts) Amount Boe Amount Boe Production taxes $ 272 $ 2.84 $ 181 $ 2.58 Ad valorem taxes 33 0.35 18 0.24 Total production and ad valorem taxes $ 305 $ 3.19 $ 199 $ 2.82 Production taxes per unit of production were $2.84 per Boe during the year ended December 31, 2018 , an increase of 10 percent from $2.58 per Boe during 2017 . Over the same period, our revenue per Boe (excluding the effects of derivatives) increased 18 percent. The increase in production taxes per unit of production was directly related to the increase in oil and natural gas sales, partially offset by a higher percentage of our total production originating in Texas, which has a lower tax rate than New Mexico. Production taxes fluctuate with the market value of our production sold, while ad valorem taxes are generally based on the valuation of our oil and natural gas properties at the beginning of the year, which vary across the different areas in which we operate. Ad valorem taxes increased by $15 million primarily due to additional wells drilled and completed, new wells acquired in the RSP Acquisition and an increase in property values. The increase in ad valorem taxes per Boe was primarily due to an increase in property values. 49 Gathering, processing and transportation costs. The following table shows the gathering, processing and transportation costs for the year ended December 31, 2018 : Year Ended December 31, 2018 Per (in millions, except per unit amounts) Amount Boe Gathering, processing and transportation costs $ 55 $ 0.58 Gathering, processing and transportation costs were $55 million ($0.58 per Boe) for the year ended December 31, 2018 . On January 1, 2018, we adopted ASC 606, which requires certain amounts related to gathering, processing and transportation costs to be separately presented on the consolidated statements of operations. Prior to the adoption of ASC 606, the majority of these costs were accounted for as a deduction to revenue and included within total operating revenues on the consolidated statements of operations. We have elected to use the modified retrospective approach for adopting ASC 606, and as such, prior period amounts have not been restated. In addition, our gathering, processing and transportation costs are impacted by production volumes and fixed costs associated with certain contracts. Exploration and abandonments expense. The following table provides the components of our exploration and abandonments expense for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017: Years Ended December 31, (in millions) 2018 2017 Geological and geophysical $ 12 $ 13 Leasehold abandonments 35 27 Other 18 19 Total exploration and abandonments $ 65 $ 59 Our geological and geophysical expense for the periods presented above primarily consists of the costs of acquiring and processing geophysical data and core analysis. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we recorded approximately $35 million and $27 million, respectively, of leasehold abandonments. Our leasehold abandonments for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 were primarily related to certain expiring acreage and acreage where we had no future plans to drill. Our other expense for the periods presented above primarily consists of surface and title costs on locations we no longer intend to drill, certain plugging costs and delay rentals. 50 Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense. The following table provides components of our depreciation, depletion and amortization expense for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017: Years Ended December 31, 2018 2017 Per Per (in millions, except per unit amounts) Amount Boe Amount Boe Depletion of proved oil and natural gas properties $ 1,453 $ 15.14 $ 1,122 $ 15.95 Depreciation of other property and equipment 22 0.23 21 0.29 Amortization of intangible assets 3 0.04 3 0.05 Total depletion, depreciation and amortization $ 1,478 $ 15.41 $ 1,146 $ 16.29 Oil price used to estimate proved oil reserves at period end $ 62.04 $ 47.79 Natural gas price used to estimate proved natural gas reserves at period end $ 3.10 $ 2.98 Depletion of proved oil and natural gas properties was $1,453 million ($15.14 per Boe) for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $331 million (30 percent) from $1,122 million ($15.95 per Boe) for 2017. The increase in depletion expense was primarily due to an increase in production, partially offset by a lower depletion rate per Boe. The decrease in depletion expense per Boe was primarily due to the increase in proved reserves due to our successful exploratory drilling program, cost reductions and higher oil prices, partially offset by the RSP Acquisition. General and administrative expenses. The following table provides components of our general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017: Years Ended December 31, 2018 2017 Per Per (in millions, except per unit amounts) Amount Boe Amount Boe General and administrative expenses $ 248 $ 2.58 $ 200 $ 2.85 Less: Operating fee reimbursements (19) (0.19) (16) (0.24) Non-cash stock-based compensation 82 0.86 60 0.85 Total general and administrative expenses $ 311 $ 3.25 $ 244 $ 3.46 General and administrative expenses were approximately $311 million ($3.25 per Boe) for the year ended December 31, 2018 , an increase of $67 million (27 percent) from $244 million ($3.46 per Boe) for 2017 . The increase in cash general and administrative and non-cash stock-based compensation expenses was primarily driven by the increase in employee headcount. The decrease in total general and administrative expenses per Boe was primarily the result of increased production, partially offset by the increase in total general and administrative expenses noted above. We receive fees for the operation of jointly-owned oil and natural gas properties during the drilling and production phases and record such reimbursements as reductions of general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. We earned reimbursements of approximately $19 million and $16 million during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 51 Gain (loss) on derivatives. The following table sets forth the gain (loss) on derivatives for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017: Years Ended December 31, (in millions) 2018 2017 Gain (loss) on derivatives: Oil derivatives $ 848 $ (172) Natural gas derivatives (16) 46 Total $ 832 $ (126) The following table represents our net cash receipts from (payments on) derivatives for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017: Years Ended December 31, (in millions) 2018 2017 Net cash receipts from (payments on) derivatives: Oil derivatives $ (213) $ 79 Natural gas derivatives (5) - Total $ (218) $ 79 Our earnings are affected by the changes in value of our derivatives portfolio between periods and the related cash settlements of those derivatives, which could be significant. To the extent the future commodity price outlook declines between measurement periods, we will have mark-to-market gains; while to the extent future commodity price outlook increases between measurement periods, we will have mark-to-market losses. See Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information regarding significant judgments made in classifying financial instruments in the fair value hierarchy. Gain on disposition of assets, net. During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we recognized a non-cash net gain on disposition of assets of approximately $800 million and $678 million respectively. The net gain during 2018 was primarily due to (i) a gain of approximately $575 million related to our February 2018 acquisition and divestiture primarily in the Midland Basin, (ii) a gain of approximately $134 million related to our Delaware Basin divestiture in January 2018 and (iii) a gain of approximately $79 million related to the contribution of certain infrastructure assets in the southern portion of our Delaware Basin to WaterBridge in December 2018. See Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financials Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information regarding our transaction with WaterBridge. In addition, during 2018, we completed multiple nonmonetary transactions that included the exchange of both proved and unproved oil and natural gas properties. Certain of these transactions were accounted for at fair value, and as a result, we recorded pre-tax gains of approximately $15 million. In February 2017, we closed on the divestiture of our ownership interest in ACC. After adjustments for debt and working capital, we received cash proceeds from the sale of approximately $801 million. After direct transaction costs, we recorded a pre-tax gain on disposition of assets of approximately $655 million. Our net investment in ACC at the time of closing was approximately $129 million. See Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financials Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information regarding our significant divestitures and nonmonetary transactions. 52 Interest expense. The following table sets forth interest expense, weighted average interest rates and weighted average debt balances for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017: Years Ended December 31, (in millions) 2018 2017 Interest expense, as reported $ 149 $ 146 Capitalized interest 8 3 Interest expense, excluding impact of capitalized interest $ 157 $ 149 Weighted average interest rate Credit Facility 4.5% 3.5% Weighted average interest rate senior notes 4.3% 5.0% Total weighted average interest rate 4.3% 5.0% Weighted average Credit Facility balance $ 172 $ 100 Weighted average senior notes balance 3,195 2,658 Total weighted average debt balance $ 3,367 $ 2,758 The increase in interest expense was due to the increase in the weighted average debt balance, partially offset by the decrease in the weighted average interest rate and an increase in capitalized interest. The increase in the weighted average debt balance was due primarily to the Notes issued in connection with the RSP Acquisition. Loss on extinguishment of debt. We recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $66 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 . This amount includes: (i) approximately $36 million associated with the premium paid for the cash tender offer ( Tender Offer ) and redemption of the 5.5% unsecured senior notes due 2022 (the 5.5% Notes ), approximately $25 million associated with the make-whole premium paid for the early extinguishment of the 5.5% Notes, approximately $21 million of unamortized deferred loan costs and approximately $2 million of additional interest on the 5.5% Notes to October 13, 2017, which was paid in September 2017, reduced by approximately $19 million of unamortized premium; and (ii) approximately $1 million representing the proportional amount of unamortized deferred loan costs associated with banks that are no longer in our Credit Facility syndicate as a result of the April 2017 amendment to our Credit Facility. Other income, net. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded other income of approximately $108 million primarily related to a cash distribution received from Oryx. See Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information regarding this distribution. Income tax provisions. For the year ended December 31, 2018 , we recorded income tax expense of approximately $603 million. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded an income tax benefit of approximately $75 million, which includes the $398 million provisional income tax benefit that was recognized as a result of the favorable income tax rate change enacted through the TCJA in December 2017. At December 31, 2018, the Company completed its accounting for all of the enactment-date tax effects of the TCJA and recognized an adjustment to this provisional amount of approximately $7 million primarily related to the deductibility of certain performance-based compensation expenses. The effective income tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 were 21 percent and (9) percent, respectively. Our 2018 effective tax rate more closely aligns with the 21 percent federal statutory rate enacted by the TCJA while our 2017 effective tax rate reflects the $398 million income tax benefit recognized due to the decrease in the federal income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent enacted by the TCJA. We evaluate changes to our industry, production, market conditions and changes in our forecasted drilling plan by tax jurisdiction. Our material state tax jurisdictions include Texas and New Mexico. In July 2018, as part of the RSP Acquisition, we acquired property primarily located in Texas. As such, we identified a slight shift in our projected future apportionment between New Mexico and Texas for the year ended December 31, 2018. As a result, we recognized a state deferred tax benefit of approximately $8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. We did not identify a shift in our projected future apportionment for the year ended December 31, 2017. 53 Year Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016 Oil and natural gas revenues. Oil and natural gas operating revenues were $2,586 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $951 million (58 percent) from $1,635 million for 2016. This increase was primarily due to the increase in oil and natural gas production as well as the increase in realized oil and natural gas prices (excluding the effects of derivative activities). Specific factors affecting oil and natural gas revenues include the following: total oil production was 43,472 MBbl for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of 9,632 MBbl (28 percent) from 33,840 MBbl for 2016; average realized oil price (excluding the effects of derivative activities) was $48.13 per Bbl during the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of 21 percent from $39.90 per Bbl during 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2017, our crude oil price differential relative to NYMEX was $(2.84) per Bbl, or a realization of approximately 94 percent, as compared to a crude oil price differential relative to NYMEX of $(3.52) per Bbl, or a realization of approximately 92 percent, for 2016. The basis differential between the location of Midland, Texas and Cushing, Oklahoma (NYMEX pricing location) for our oil directly impacts our realized oil price. For the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, the average market basis differential between WTI-Midland and WTI-Cushing was a price reduction of $0.30 per Bbl and $0.15 per Bbl, respectively. Additionally, we incur fixed deductions from the posted Midland oil price based on the location of our oil within the Permian Basin. These fixed deductions were less per Boe during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to 2016 primarily due to more production transported through pipelines and successful renegotiation of fixed deductions for trucked volumes; total natural gas production was 161,089 MMcf for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of 33,608 MMcf (26 percent) from 127,481 MMcf for 2016; and average realized natural gas price (excluding the effects of derivative activities) was $3.07 per Mcf during the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of 38 percent from $2.23 per Mcf during 2016. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we realized approximately 102 percent and 87 percent, respectively, of the average NYMEX natural gas prices for the respective periods. The increase in our realized natural gas price (excluding the effects of derivatives) as a percentage of NYMEX during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to 2016 was primarily due to an increase in the average Mont Belvieu price for a blended barrel of natural gas liquids. Historically, and during the year ended December 31, 2017, we derived a significant portion of our total natural gas revenues from the value of the natural gas liquids contained in our natural gas, with the remaining portion coming from the value of the dry natural gas residue. The average Mont Belvieu price for a blended barrel of natural gas liquids was $25.06 per Bbl and $18.08 per Bbl during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. 54 Oil and natural gas production expenses. The following table provides the components of our oil and natural gas production expenses for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016: Years Ended December 31, 2017 2016 Per Per (in millions, except per unit amounts) Amount Boe Amount Boe Lease operating expenses $ 387 $ 5.50 $ 301 $ 5.46 Workover costs 21 0.30 19 0.35 Total oil and natural gas production expenses $ 408 $ 5.80 $ 320 $ 5.81 Lease operating expenses were $387 million ($5.50 per Boe) for the year ended December 31, 2017, which was an increase of $86 million (29 percent) from $301 million ($5.46 per Boe) for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in lease operating expenses was primarily due to (i) increased production associated with our wells successfully drilled and completed in 2016 and 2017, (ii) our acquisitions during the fourth quarter of 2016 and during 2017, particularly the Reliance Acquisition and our Midland Basin acquisition, whose associated properties incur higher lease operating expense per Boe than our legacy assets and (iii) increased cost of services. Production and ad valorem taxes. The following table provides the components of our production and ad valorem tax expenses for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016: Years Ended December 31, 2017 2016 Per Per (in millions, except per unit amounts) Amount Boe Amount Boe Production taxes $ 181 $ 2.58 $ 117 $ 2.13 Ad valorem taxes 18 0.24 14 0.25 Total production and ad valorem taxes $ 199 $ 2.82 $ 131 $ 2.38 Production taxes per unit of production were $2.58 per Boe during the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of 21 percent from $2.13 per Boe during 2016. Over the same period, our revenue per Boe (excluding the effects of derivatives) increased 24 percent. The increase in production taxes per unit of production was directly related to the increase in oil and natural gas sales, partially offset by a $5 million tax credit received during 2017 related to certain wells in Texas qualifying for reduced severance tax rates, as compared to $4 million in tax credit received during 2016. Production taxes fluctuate with the market value of our production sold, while ad valorem taxes are generally based on the valuation of our oil and natural gas properties at the beginning of the year, which vary across the different areas in which we operate. 55 Exploration and abandonments expense. The following table provides the components of our exploration and abandonments expense for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016: Years Ended December 31, (in millions) 2017 2016 Geological and geophysical $ 13 $ 8 Exploratory dry hole costs - 7 Leasehold abandonments 27 50 Other 19 12 Total exploration and abandonments $ 59 $ 77 Our geological and geophysical expense for the periods presented above primarily consists of the costs of acquiring and processing geophysical data and core analysis. Our exploratory dry hole costs during the year ended December 31, 2016 were primarily related to an uneconomic well in the Delaware Basin that was attempting to establish commercial production through testing of multiple zones. We did not recognize any exploratory dry hole costs during the year ended December 31, 2017. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we recorded approximately $27 million and $50 million, respectively, of leasehold abandonments. For the year ended December 31, 2017, our abandonments were primarily in the Delaware Basin related to acreage expiring and acreage where we have no future plans to drill. For the year ended December 31, 2016, our abandonments were primarily in the Delaware Basin related to (i) drilling locations that, based on multiple factors, were no longer likely to be drilled, (ii) acreage with no future development plans and (iii) expiring acreage. Our other expense for the periods presented above primarily consists of surface and title costs on locations we no longer intend to drill, certain plugging costs and delay rentals. Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense. The following table provides components of our depreciation, depletion and amortization expense for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016: Years Ended December 31, 2017 2016 Per Per (in millions, except per unit amounts) Amount Boe Amount Boe Depletion of proved oil and natural gas properties $ 1,122 $ 15.95 $ 1,145 $ 20.79 Depreciation of other property and equipment 21 0.29 21 0.37 Amortization of intangible assets 3 0.05 1 0.03 Total depletion, depreciation and amortization $ 1,146 $ 16.29 $ 1,167 $ 21.19 Oil price used to estimate proved oil reserves at period end $ 47.79 $ 39.25 Natural gas price used to estimate proved natural gas reserves at period end $ 2.98 $ 2.48 Depletion of proved oil and natural gas properties was $1,122 million ($15.95 per Boe) for the year ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of $23 million (2 percent) from $1,145 million ($20.79 per Boe) for 2016. The decrease in depletion expense was primarily due to a lower depletion rate per Boe partially offset by an increase in production. The decrease in depletion expense per Boe was primarily due to (i) lower drilling and completion costs per Boe of proved developed reserves added, (ii) an overall increase in proved reserves primarily caused by our successful exploratory drilling program, the Reliance Acquisition as well as other acquisitions, and higher commodity prices, partially offset by decreased proved reserves caused by reclassification of proved undeveloped reserves to unproved reserves because they were no longer expected to be developed within five years of the date of their initial recognition and (iii) a non-cash impairment charge of approximately $1.5 billion recorded in the first quarter of 2016. 56 Impairments of long-lived assets. We did not recognize an impairment charge during the year ended December 31, 2017. During the three months ended March 31, 2016, we recognized a non-cash impairment charge of approximately $1.5 billion. The impairment during the three months ended March 31, 2016 was primarily due to a decline in NYMEX strip prices, which resulted in the carrying amount of our Yeso field in the Delaware Basin to exceed the expected undiscounted future net cash flows of the field. Our estimates of commodity prices for purposes of determining the estimated fair value at March 31, 2016 ranged from a 2016 price of $41.26 per barrel of oil and $2.26 per Mcf of natural gas to a 2023 price of $66.33 per barrel of oil and $3.56 per Mcf of natural gas. Commodity prices for this purpose were held flat after 2023. See Note 2 and Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information on impairments of long-lived assets. General and administrative expenses. The following table provides components of our general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016: Years Ended December 31, 2017 2016 Per Per (in millions, except per unit amounts) Amount Boe Amount Boe General and administrative expenses $ 200 $ 2.85 $ 184 $ 3.33 Less: Operating fee reimbursements (16) (0.24) (17) (0.31) Non-cash stock-based compensation 60 0.85 59 1.07 Total general and administrative expenses $ 244 $ 3.46 $ 226 $ 4.09 General and administrative expenses were approximately $244 million ($3.46 per Boe) for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $18 million (8 percent) from $226 million ($4.09 per Boe) for 2016. The increase in cash general and administrative expenses was primarily a result of increased compensation expense. The decrease in total general and administrative expenses per Boe was primarily due to increased production, partially offset by the increase in cash general and administrative costs noted above. We receive fees for the operation of jointly-owned oil and natural gas properties during the drilling and production phases and record such reimbursements as reductions of general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. We earned reimbursements of approximately $16 million and $17 million during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. 57 Gain (loss) on derivatives. The following table sets forth the gain (loss) on derivatives for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016: Years Ended December 31, (in millions) 2017 2016 Gain (loss) on derivatives: Oil derivatives $ (172) $ (337) Natural gas derivatives 46 (32) Total $ (126) $ (369) The following table represents our net cash receipts from derivatives for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016: Years Ended December 31, (in millions) 2017 2016 Net cash receipts from derivatives: Oil derivatives $ 79 $ 609 Natural gas derivatives - 16 Total $ 79 $ 625 Our earnings are affected by the changes in value of our derivatives portfolio between periods and the related cash settlements of those derivatives, which could be significant. To the extent the future commodity price outlook declines between measurement periods, we will have mark-to-market gains; while to the extent future commodity price outlook increases between measurement periods, we will have mark-to-market losses. See Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information regarding significant judgments made in classifying financial instruments in the fair value hierarchy. Gain on disposition of assets, net. During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we recognized a gain on disposition of assets of approximately $678 million and $118 million, respectively. In February 2017, we closed on the divestiture of our ownership interest in ACC. After adjustments for debt and working capital, we received cash proceeds from the sale of approximately $801 million. After direct transaction costs, we recorded a pre-tax gain on disposition of assets of approximately $655 million. Our net investment in ACC at the time of closing was approximately $129 million. In February 2016, we sold certain assets in the Delaware Basin for proceeds of approximately $292 million and recognized a pre-tax gain of approximately $110 million. 58 Interest expense. The following table sets forth interest expense, weighted average interest rates and weighted average debt balances for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016: Years Ended December 31, (in millions) 2017 2016 Interest expense, as reported $ 146 $ 204 Capitalized interest 3 - Interest expense, excluding impact of capitalized interest $ 149 $ 204 Weighted average interest rate Credit Facility 3.5% - Weighted average interest rate senior notes 5.0% 5.9% Total weighted average interest rate 5.0% 5.9% Weighted average Credit Facility balance $ 100 $ - Weighted average senior notes balance 2,658 3,182 Total weighted average debt balance $ 2,758 $ 3,182 The decrease in interest expense was due to the decrease in the weighted average debt balance and the weighted average interest rate. Our weighted average debt balance decreased for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to 2016 primarily due to (i) the satisfaction and discharge of the 6.5% unsecured senior notes due 2022 (the 6.5% Notes ) in December 2016, (ii) the redemption of the 7.0% unsecured senior notes due 2021 (the 7.0% Notes ) in September 2016 and (iii) the repurchases and redemption of the 5.5% Notes in September 2017, partially offset by (i) the issuance of the 4.375% unsecured senior notes due 2025 (the 4.375% Notes ) in December 2016, (ii) the issuance of the 3.75% unsecured senior notes due 2027 (the 3.75% Notes ) and the 4.875% unsecured senior notes due 2047 (the 4.875% Notes and, together with the 3.75% Notes, the 2017 Notes ) and (iii) an increase in borrowings under our Credit Facility. The decrease in interest expense was due to the overall decrease in the weighted average debt balance and an increase in capitalized interest. Loss on extinguishment of debt. We recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $66 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This amount includes: (i) approximately $36 million associated with the premium paid for the cash tender offer, approximately $25 million associated with the make-whole premium paid for the early extinguishment of the 5.5% Notes, approximately $21 million of unamortized deferred loan costs and approximately $2 million of additional interest on the 5.5% Notes to October 13, 2017, which was paid in September 2017, reduced by approximately $19 million of unamortized premium; and (ii) approximately $1 million representing the proportional amount of unamortized deferred loan costs associated with banks that are no longer in our Credit Facility syndicate as a result of the April 2017 amendment to our Credit Facility. We recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $56 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This amount includes: (i) approximately $20 million associated with the make-whole premium paid for the early extinguishment of the 6.5% Notes in December 2016, approximately $7 million of related unamortized deferred loan costs and approximately $1 million of additional interest on the 6.5% Notes through January 16, 2017, which was paid in December 2016; and (ii) $21 million associated with the make-whole premium paid for the early redemption of the 7.0% Notes in September 2016 and approximately $7 million of related unamortized deferred loan costs. Income tax provisions. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded an income tax benefit of $75 million, which included discrete provisional income tax benefits of approximately $398 million related to the enactment of the TCJA and $6 million related to stock-based awards recorded in the income tax provision pursuant to Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-09, Compensation Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-based Payment Accounting adopted on January 1, 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded an income tax benefit of $876 million primarily due to having a loss before income taxes. The change in our income tax provision in 2017 as compared to 2016 was primarily due to the favorable impacts of the tax law changes enacted through the TCJA in December 2017 as the income tax benefit related to the federal statutory rate change more than offset our income tax expense of $308 million on income before income taxes during 2017. The effective income tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were (9) percent and 38 percent, respectively. The 2017 rate was negative due to recognizing an overall income tax benefit while having pre-tax income. We evaluate changes to our industry, production, market conditions and changes in our forecasted drilling plan by tax jurisdiction. Our material state tax jurisdictions include Texas and New Mexico. In February 2017, we sold our ownership interest in ACC, which consisted of property in both Texas and New Mexico, and in April 2017, we completed an acquisition of assets in the Delaware Basin. We have considered these and other factors and did not identify a shift in our projected future apportionment between New Mexico and Texas for the year ended December 31, 2017. In October 2016, we purchased 59 Texas-based assets in the Reliance Acquisition for approximately $1.7 billion, which caused a shift in our projected future apportionment from New Mexico to Texas, which has a lower statutory state tax rate than New Mexico. As such, we recognized an overall state deferred tax benefit of approximately $21 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. 60 Capital Commitments, Capital Resources and Liquidity Capital commitments. Our primary needs for cash are development, exploration and acquisition of oil and natural gas assets, payment of contractual obligations and working capital obligations. Funding for these cash needs may be provided by any combination of internally-generated cash flow, financing under our credit facility, proceeds from the disposition of assets or alternative financing sources, as discussed in Capital resources below. Oil and natural gas properties. Our costs incurred on oil and natural gas properties, excluding acquisitions, during the years ended December 31, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 totaled $2.6 billion, $1.7 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively. The increase was primarily due to our increased drilling and completion activity level during 2018 as compared to 2017 and 2016. Our intent is to manage our capital spending to be within our operating cash flow, excluding unbudgeted acquisitions. The primary reason for the differences in costs incurred and cash flow expenditures was the timing of payments. Total 2018 expenditures were primarily funded in part from cash flows from operations and proceeds from our January 2018 Delaware Basin divestitures. 2019 capital budget . In October 2018, our board of directors approved our 2019 capital budget of up to $3.8 billion. With current commodity prices, we expected to spend between $2.8 billion and $3.0 billion on drilling and completion activity. 2019 dividends. On February 19, 2019, our board of directors declared a cash dividend of $0.125 per share for the first quarter of 2019. The total cash dividend, including cash dividend on unvested restricted stock awards, of $25 million is expected to be paid on March 29, 2019 to stockholders of record as of March 1, 2019. We intend to continue to pay a quarterly dividend of $0.125 in the future, however, any payment of future dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on, among other things, our earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, level of indebtedness, statutory and contractual restrictions applying to the payment of dividends and other considerations that our board of directors deems relevant. Other than the customary purchase of leasehold acreage, our capital budgets are exclusive of acquisitions. We do not have a specific acquisition budget because the timing and size of acquisitions are difficult to forecast. We evaluate opportunities to purchase or sell oil and natural gas properties in the marketplace and could participate as a buyer or seller of properties at various times. We seek to acquire oil and natural gas properties that provide opportunities for the addition of reserves and production through a combination of development, high-potential exploration and control of operations that will allow us to apply our operating expertise, such as the RSP Acquisition. Acquisitions. The following table reflects o ur expenditures for acquisitions of proved and unproved properties for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016: Years Ended December 31, (in millions) 2018 2017 2016 Property acquisition costs: Proved $ 4,136 $ 303 $ 982 Unproved 3,617 905 1,154 Total property acquisition costs (a) $ 7,753 $ 1,208 $ 2,136 (a) Included in the property acquisition costs above are budgeted unproved leasehold acreage acquisitions of approximately $51 million, $52 million and $30 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Our unbudgeted acquisitions during 2018 were primarily comprised of approximately $7.6 billion of property acquisition costs related to the RSP Acquisition. Our unbudgeted acquisitions during 2017 were primarily comprised of approximately $1.1 billion of property acquisition costs related to our Midland Basin and Delaware Basin acquisitions. Our unbudgeted acquisitions during 2016 were primarily comprised of approximately $2.1 billion of property acquisition costs related to the Reliance Acquisition and Delaware Basin acquisition. 61 Contractual obligations. We had the following contractual obligations at December 31, 2018 : Payments Due by Period Less than 1 - 3 3 - 5 More than (in millions) Total 1 year years years 5 years Long-term debt (a) $ 4,242 $ - $ - $ 242 $ 4,000 Cash interest expense on debt (b) 2,991 256 372 354 2,009 Asset retirement obligations (c) 179 11 13 3 152 Employment agreements with officers (d) 9 9 - - - Purchase obligations (e) 442 88 155 69 130 Operating lease obligations 40 14 22 3 1 Total contractual obligations (f) $ 7,903 $ 378 $ 562 $ 671 $ 6,292 (a) See Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for information regarding future interest payment obligations on our long-term debt. The amounts included in the table above represent principal maturities only. (b) Cash interest expense on our senior notes is estimated assuming no principal repayment until their maturity dates. Also included in the Less than 1 year column is accrued interest at December 31, 2018 of approximately $70 million. At December 31, 2018, we had variable-rate debt outstanding under our Credit Facility of $242 million. (c) Amounts represent costs related to expected oil and natural gas property abandonments, net of any future accretion. (d) Represents amounts of cash compensation we are obligated to pay to our officers under employment agreements assuming such employees continue to serve the entire term of their employment agreement and their cash compensation is not adjusted. (e) Relates to purchase agreements we have entered into including daywork drilling contracts, water commitment agreements, throughput volume delivery commitments, fixed and variable power commitments, fixed asset commitments and maintenance commitments. (f) The amounts above do not include the liability for unrecognized tax benefits. See Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information. ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ 62 Off-balance sheet arrangements. Currently, we do not have any material off-balance sheet arrangements. Capital resources. Our primary sources of liquidity have been cash flows generated from (i) operating activities, (ii) borrowings under our Credit Facility, (iii) proceeds from bond and equity offerings and (iv) asset dispositions. In October 2018, our board of directors approved our 2019 capital budget of up to $3.8 billion. With current commodity prices, we expect to spend between $2.8 billion and $3.0 billion on drilling and completion activity. The following table summarizes our changes in cash and cash equivalents for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016: Years Ended December 31, (in millions) 2018 2017 2016 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 2,558 $ 1,695 $ 1,384 Net cash used in investing activities (2,216) (1,719) (2,225) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities (342) (29) 665 Net decrease in cash and cash equivalents $ - $ (53) $ (176) Cash flow from operating activities. The increase in operating cash flows during the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to 2017 was primarily due to an increase in oil and natural gas revenues of approximately $1.6 billion, partially offset by (i) a decrease in operating cash flow of approximately $297 million due to approximately $218 million for settlements paid on derivatives during the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to approximately $79 million in settlements received from derivatives during 2017, (ii) approximately $182 million increase in production expense and (iii) approximately $106 million increase in production tax expense. The increase in operating cash flows during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to 2016 was primarily due to an increase in oil and natural gas revenues of approximately $951 million and a decrease in cash interest expense of approximately $55 million, partially offset by (i) approximately $546 million decrease in settlements received from derivatives, (ii) approximately $88 million increase in production expense and (iii) approximately $68 million increase in production tax expense. Our net cash provided by operating activities included a benefit of approximately $4 million, a reduction of approximately $23 million and a reduction of approximately $51 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 , respectively, associated with changes in working capital items. Changes in working capital items adjust for the timing of receipts and payments of actual cash. Cash flow from investing activities. Our investing activities consist primarily of drilling and completion activity, acquisitions and divestitures. The primary reason for the differences in costs incurred on oil and natural gas properties, including acquisitions, and cash flow expenditures is the timing of payments and the issuances of shares of common stock to fund certain acquisitions. For the year ended December 31, 2018 , our net cash used in investing activities was approximately $2.2 billion, which consisted primarily of our investment of approximately $2.5 billion for additions to oil and natural gas properties and approximately $136 million of oil and natural gas property acquisitions, partially offset by (i) approximately $361 million of proceeds received from the disposition of certain assets and (ii) a $148 million distribution received from Oryx, one of our equity method investments. The total distribution from Oryx was approximately $157 million, of which approximately $9 million represented cumulative Oryx earnings and was classified as cash flow from operating activities, while the remaining amount of approximately $148 million was classified as cash flow from investing activities. The 2018 expenditures were primarily funded with cash flows from operations. For the year ended December 31, 2017 , our net cash used in investing activities was approximately $1.7 billion, which consisted primarily of our investment of approximately $1.6 billion for additions to oil and natural gas properties and approximately $908 million of oil and natural gas property acquisitions. This was partially offset by approximately $803 million of proceeds received from the disposition of certain assets. The 2017 expenditures were primarily funded in part from (i) cash flows from operations, (ii) proceeds from our February 2017 divestiture of ACC and (iii) our issuance of approximately 2.2 million shares of common stock related to our Delaware Basin acquisition. For the year ended December 31, 2016 , our net cash used in investing activities was approximately $2.2 billion, which consisted primarily of our investment of approximately $1.0 billion for additions to oil and natural gas properties and approximately $1.4 billion of oil and natural gas property acquisitions. This was partially offset by approximately $332 million of proceeds received from the disposition of certain assets. The 2016 expenditures were funded in part from (i) proceeds from 63 our February 2016 divestiture, (ii) our issuance of approximately 2.2 million shares of common stock related to our March 2016 acquisition, (iii) proceeds from our August 2016 equity offering and (iv) our issuance of approximately 3.9 million shares of common stock related to the Reliance Acquisition. Cash flow from financing activities. For the year ended December 31, 2018, our net cash used in financing activities was approximately $ 342 million. In July 2018, we issued $1,600 million in aggregate principal amount of the Notes, for which we received net proceeds of approximately $1,579 million. We used the net proceeds to redeem and cancel the RSP Notes. We made aggregate payments of approximately $1.2 billion to redeem and cancel the RSP Notes, including make-whole call premiums of approximately $35 million and $33 million for the RSP 2022 Notes and the RSP 2025 Notes, respectively. We also paid accrued interest of approximately $14 million on the RSP Notes. The remaining proceeds, along with borrowings under our Credit Facility, were used to repay the $540 million of outstanding principal under RSP revolving credit facility, including $1 million in accrued interest. We also made net payments of $80 million on our Credit Facility during 2018. For the year ended December 31, 2017, our net cash used in financing activities was approximately $29 million. In September 2017, we issued $1,800 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2017 Notes, for which we received net proceeds of approximately $1,777 million. We used the net proceeds from the offering, together with cash on hand and borrowings under our Credit Facility, to fund the (i) Tender Offer of $1,232 million principal amount of the 5.5% Notes at a price equal to 102.934 percent of par and (ii) redemption of our remaining obligations of the $918 million outstanding principal amount under the indentures of the 5.5% Notes at a price equal to 102.75 percent of par. The early extinguishment price included approximately $36 million associated with the premium paid for the Tender Offer, approximately $25 million for the make-whole premium paid for the early extinguishment of the 5.5% Notes and approximately $2 million for prepaid interest as part of the satisfaction and discharge. We also had net borrowings of $322 million under our Credit Facility during 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2016, our net cash provided by financing activities was approximately $665 million primarily due to the following activities: In August 2016, we issued approximately 10.4 million shares of our common stock in a public offering at $130.90 per share and received net proceeds of approximately $1.3 billion. We used a portion of the net proceeds to finance part of the cash portion of the purchase price for the Reliance Acquisition and to fund part of the early redemption of the 7.0% Notes and the remainder for general corporate purposes. In September 2016, we redeemed the $600 million outstanding principal amount of the 7.0% Notes at a price equal to 103.5 percent of par. The redemption price included the make-whole premium for the early redemption of $21 million. In December 2016, we issued $600 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.375% senior notes due 2025 at par, for which we received net proceeds of approximately $593 million. We used the net proceeds from the offering to fund the satisfaction and discharge of our obligations under the indenture of the $600 million outstanding principal amount of the 6.5% Notes at a price equal to 103.25 percent of par. The early extinguishment price included the make-whole premium of $20 million. In April 2017, we amended our Credit Facility to decrease our unused lender commitments. In September 2017, we elected to enter into an Investment Grade Period under our Credit Facility, which had the effect of releasing all collateral formerly securing our Credit Facility. If the Investment Grade Period under our Credit Facility terminates (whether automatically or by our election), our Credit Facility will once again be secured by a first lien on substantially all of our oil and natural gas properties and by a pledge of the equity interests in our subsidiaries. At December 31, 2018, we had unused commitments under our Credit Facility of $1.8 billion . Advances on our Credit Facility bear interest, at our option, based on: (i) an alternative base rate, which is equal to the highest of (a) the prime rate of JPMorgan Chase Bank (5.5 percent at December 31, 2018), (b) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.5 percent and (c) LIBOR plus 1.0 percent; or (ii) LIBOR. The Credit Facility interest rates and commitment fees on the unused portion of the available commitment vary depending on our credit ratings from Moody and S&P. At our current credit ratings, LIBOR Rate Loans and Alternate Base Rate Loans bear interest margins of 150 basis points and 50 basis points per annum, respectively, and commitment fees on the unused portion of the available commitment are 25 basis points per annum. In conducting our business, we may utilize various financing sources, including the issuance of (i) fixed and floating rate debt, (ii) convertible securities, (iii) preferred stock, (iv) common stock and (v) other securities. Historically, we have demonstrated our use of the capital markets by issuing common stock and senior unsecured debt. There are no assurances that we can access the capital markets to obtain additional funding, if needed, and at cost and terms that are favorable to us. We may also sell assets and issue securities in exchange for oil and natural gas assets or interests in energy companies. Additional securities may be of a class senior to common stock with respect to such matters as dividends and liquidation rights and may also have other rights and preferences as determined from time to time. Utilization of some of these financing sources may require approval from the lenders under our Credit Facility. 64 Liquidity. Our principal source of liquidity is the available borrowing capacity under our Credit Facility. At December 31, 2018, our commitments from our bank group were $2.0 billion of which $1.8 billion was unused commitments. Debt ratings . We receive debt credit ratings from S&P, Moody and Fitch and are designated as investment grade with all three agencies. In determining our ratings, the agencies perform regular reviews and consider a number of qualitative and quantitative factors including, but not limited to, the industry in which we operate, production growth opportunities, liquidity, debt levels and asset and reserve mix. A downgrade in our credit ratings could (i) negatively impact our costs of capital and our ability to effectively execute aspects of our strategy, (ii) affect our ability to raise debt in the public debt markets, and the cost of any new debt could be much higher than our outstanding debt and (iii) negatively affect our ability to obtain additional financing or the interest rate, fees and other terms associated with such additional financing. Further, if we are unable to maintain credit ratings of Ba2 or better from Moody and BB or better from S&P, the Investment Grade Period under our Credit Facility will automatically terminate and cause our Credit Facility to once again be secured by a first lien on substantially all of our oil and natural gas properties and by a pledge of the equity interests in our subsidiaries. These and other impacts of a downgrade in our credit ratings could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. As of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, no changes in our credit ratings have occurred; however, we cannot be assured that our credit ratings will not be downgraded in the future. Book capitalization and current ratio . Our net book capitalization at December 31, 2018 was $23.0 billion, consisting of debt of $ 4.2 b illion and stockholders equity of $ 18.8 billion. Our net book capitalization at December 31, 2017 was $11.6 billion, consisting of debt of $ 2.7 b illion and stockholders equity of $ 8.9 billion. Our ratio of net debt to net book capitalization was 18 percent and 23 percent at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Our ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 1.04 to 1.0 at December 31, 2018 as compared to 0.51 to 1.0 at December 31, 2017. Inflation and changes in prices. Our revenues, the value of our assets and our ability to obtain bank financing or additional capital on attractive terms have been and will continue to be affected by changes in commodity prices and the costs to produce our reserves. Commodity prices are subject to significant fluctuations that we are unable to control or predict. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we received an average of $56.22 per barrel of oil and $3.40 per Mcf of natural gas before consideration of commodity derivative contracts compared to $48.13 and $39.90 per barrel of oil and $3.07 and $2.23 per Mcf of natural gas in the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Although certain of our costs are affected by general inflation, inflation does not normally have a significant effect on our business. 65 Critical Accounting Policies, Practices and Estimates Our historical consolidated financial statements and related notes to consolidated financial statements contain information that is pertinent to our management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations. Preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires that our management make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. However, the accounting principles used by us generally do not change our reported cash flows or liquidity. Interpretation of the existing rules must be done and judgments made on how the specifics of a given rule apply to us. In management opinion, the more significant reporting areas impacted by management judgments and estimates are the choice of accounting method for oil and natural gas activities, oil and natural gas reserve estimation, asset retirement obligations, impairment of long-lived assets, valuation of stock-based compensation, valuation of business combinations, accounting and valuation of nonmonetary transactions, goodwill impairment, litigation and environmental contingencies, valuation of financial derivative instruments, uncertain tax positions and income taxes. Management judgments and estimates in these areas are based on information available from both internal and external sources, including engineers, geologists and historical experience in similar matters. Actual results could differ from the estimates as additional information becomes known. Successful Efforts Method of Accounting We utilize the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and natural gas exploration and development activities. Under this method, exploration expenses, including geological and geophysical costs, lease rentals and exploratory dry holes, are charged against income as incurred. Costs of successful wells and related production equipment, undeveloped leases and developmental dry holes are capitalized. Exploratory drilling costs are initially capitalized, but are charged to expense if and when a well is determined not to have found proved reserves. Generally, a gain or loss is recognized when producing fields are sold. This accounting method may yield significantly different results than the full cost method of accounting. The application of the successful efforts method of accounting requires management judgment to determine the proper designation of wells as either developmental or exploratory, which will ultimately determine the proper accounting treatment of costs of dry holes. Once a well is drilled, the determination that proved reserves have been discovered may take considerable time, and requires both judgment and application of industry experience. The evaluation of oil and natural gas leasehold acquisition costs included in unproved properties requires management judgment to estimate the fair value of such properties. Drilling activities in an area by other companies may also effectively impair our leasehold positions. Depletion of capitalized drilling and development costs of oil and natural gas properties is computed using the unit-of-production method on total estimated proved developed oil and natural gas reserves. Depletion of producing leaseholds is based on the unit-of-production method using our total estimated proved reserves. In arriving at rates under the unit-of-production method, the quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas are established based on estimates made by our geologists and engineers and independent engineers. Service properties, equipment and other assets are depreciated using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives of two to 39 years. 66 Oil and Natural Gas Reserves and Standardized Measure of Discounted Net Future Cash Flows This report presents estimates of our proved reserves as of December 31, 2018, which have been prepared and presented in accordance with SEC guidelines. The pricing that was used for estimates of our reserves as of December 31, 2018 was based on the 12-month unweighted average of the first-day-of-the-month WTI posted price of $62.04 per Bbl for oil and Henry Hub spot natural gas price of $3.10 per MMBtu for natural gas. Our independent engineers and technical staff prepare the estimates of our oil and natural gas reserves and associated future net cash flows. Even though our independent engineers and technical staff are knowledgeable and follow authoritative guidelines for estimating reserves, they must make a number of subjective assumptions based on professional judgments in developing the reserve estimates. Reserve estimates are updated at least annually and consider recent production levels and other technical information about each field. Periodic revisions to the estimated reserves and future net cash flows may be necessary as a result of a number of factors, including reservoir performance, new drilling, oil and natural gas prices, cost changes, technological advances, new geological or geophysical data, or other economic factors. We cannot predict the amounts or timing of future reserve revisions. If such revisions are significant, they could significantly alter future depletion and result in impairment of long-lived assets that may be material. It should not be assumed that the Standardized Measure included in this report as of December 31, 2018 is the current market value of our estimated proved reserves. In accordance with SEC requirements, we based the 2018 Standardized Measure on the 12-month unweighted average of the first-day-of-the-month pricing for oil and natural gas and prevailing costs on the date of the estimate. Actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs utilized in the estimate. See Item 1A. Risk Factors and Item 2. Properties for additional information regarding estimates of proved reserves. Our estimates of proved reserves materially impact depletion expense. If the estimates of proved reserves decline, the rate at which we record depletion expense will increase, reducing future earnings. Such a decline may result from lower commodity prices, which may make it uneconomical to drill for and produce higher cost fields. In addition, a decline in proved reserve estimates may impact the outcome of our assessment of our proved properties for impairment. Asset Retirement Obligations There are legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets that result from the acquisition, construction, development and the normal operation of a long-lived asset. The primary impact of this relates to oil and natural gas wells on which we have a legal obligation to plug and abandon. We record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred and, generally, a corresponding increase in the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. The determination of the fair value of the liability requires us to make numerous judgments and estimates, including judgments and estimates related to future costs to plug and abandon wells, future inflation rates and estimated lives of the related assets. When the judgments used to estimate the initial fair value of the asset retirement obligation change, an adjustment is recorded to both the obligation and the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. Historically, there have been no significant revisions to our initial estimates once future results became known. See Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information regarding our asset retirement obligations. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets All of our long-lived assets are monitored for potential impairment when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may be greater than management estimates of its future net cash flows, including cash flows from proved reserves, risk-adjusted probable and possible reserves, and integrated assets. If the carrying value of the long-lived assets exceeds the sum of estimated undiscounted future net cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value of the assets. The evaluations involve a significant amount of judgment since the results are based on estimated future events, such as future sales prices for oil and natural gas, future costs to produce these products, estimates of future oil and natural gas reserves to be recovered and the timing thereof, the economic and regulatory climates, cash flows from integrated assets and other factors. The need to test an asset for impairment may result from significant declines in sales prices or downward revisions in estimated quantities of oil and natural gas reserves. Any assets held for sale are reviewed for impairment when we approve the plan to sell. Estimates of anticipated sales prices are highly judgmental and subject to material revision in future periods. At December 31, 2018, our estimates of commodity prices for purposes of determining undiscounted future cash flows, which are based on the NYMEX strip, ranged from a 2019 price of $47.09 per barrel of oil increasing to a 2025 price of $53.10 per barrel of oil. Natural gas prices ranged from a 2019 price of $2.78 per Mcf of natural gas decreasing to a 2021 price of $2.61 per Mcf then rising to a 2025 price of $2.90 per Mcf of natural gas. Both oil and natural gas commodity prices for this purpose were held flat after 2025. We did not recognize an impairment charge during the year ended December 31, 2018. It is reasonably possible that the estimates of undiscounted future net cash flows of our long-lived assets may change in the future resulting in the need to impair carrying values. We estimate that if the future oil and natural gas prices used in this analysis, and noted above, would have been approximately 10 percent lower at December 31, 2018 with no other changes in capital costs, operating costs, price differentials or reserve performance curves, the carrying amount of our Yeso field would 67 have exceeded the expected undiscounted future net cash flow and an impairment of approximately $800 million would have been recorded. The impairment would have been the result of certain downward revisions to our proved reserves in the Yeso field during 2018. Other assumptions such as operating costs, well and reservoir performance, severance and ad valorem taxes and operating and development plans would likely change given a change in oil and natural gas prices. However, we did not estimate the correlation between these assumptions and any estimated commodity price change, and these and other assumptions may worsen or partially mitigate some of the effects of a reduction in commodity prices, including the ultimate impact and amount of any potential impairment charge. As a result, we are unable to predict with certainty whether or not a decline in commodity prices alone will or will not cause us to recognize an impairment charge in a particular field or the magnitude of any such impairment charge. We additionally note that there may be changes to both drilling and completion designs that affect the volume curves, capital costs estimates and the amount of proved undeveloped locations that can be recorded, each of which will affect management estimates of future cash flows. See Notes 2 and 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information on impairments of long-lived assets. Unproved oil and natural gas properties are periodically assessed for impairment by considering future drilling and exploration plans, results of exploration activities, commodity price outlooks, planned future sales and expiration of all or a portion of the projects. During the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we recognized expense of approximately $ 35 million, $ 27 million and $ 50 million, respectively, related to abandoned and expiring acreage, which is included in exploration and abandonments expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Valuation of Stock-Based Compensation In accordance with GAAP, we calculate the fair value of stock-based compensation using various valuation methods. The valuation methods require the use of estimates to derive the inputs necessary to determine fair value. We utilize (i) the average of the high and low stock price on the date of grant for the fair value of restricted stock awards and (ii) the Monte Carlo simulation method for the fair value of performance unit awards. The significant assumptions used in these models include expected volatility, expected term, risk-free interest rate, forfeiture rate, and the probability of meeting performance targets. Each of these valuation methods were chosen as management believes they give the best estimate of fair value for the respective stock-based awards. See Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for more information regarding our stock-based compensation. Valuation of Business Combinations In connection with a purchase business combination, the acquiring company must record assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on fair values as of the acquisition date. Deferred taxes must be recorded for any differences between the assigned values and tax bases of assets and liabilities. Any excess of purchase price over amounts assigned to assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. The amount of goodwill recorded in any particular business combination can vary significantly depending upon the value attributed to assets acquired and liabilities assumed. In estimating the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, we make various assumptions. The most significant assumptions related to the estimated fair values assigned to proved and unproved oil and natural gas properties and integrated assets. To estimate the fair values of these properties, we utilize estimates of oil and natural gas reserves. We make future price assumptions to apply to the estimated reserves quantities acquired and estimate future operating and development costs to arrive at estimates of future net cash flows. For estimated proved reserves, the future net cash flows are discounted using a market-based weighted average cost of capital rate determined appropriate at the time of the acquisition. The market-based weighted average cost of capital rate is subject to additional project-specific risking factors. To estimate the fair value of unproved properties, we apply risk-weighting factors of the future net cash flows of unproved reserves, or we may evaluate acreage values through recent market transactions in the area. Estimated fair values assigned to assets acquired can have a significant effect on results of operations in the future. A higher fair value assigned to a property results in a higher depletion expense, which results in lower net earnings. Fair values are based on estimates of future commodity prices, reserves quantities, operating expenses and development costs. This increases the likelihood of impairment if future commodity prices or reserves quantities are lower than those originally used to determine fair value or if future operating expenses or development costs are higher than those originally used to determine fair value. Impairment would have no effect on cash flows but would result in a decrease in net income for the period in which the impairment is recorded. Historically, we have had no material revisions to valuations of business combinations once the valuation estimate was finalized. Accounting and Valuation of Nonmonetary Transactions In connection with nonmonetary transactions, which include exchanges of producing and non-producing assets, we must evaluate the transaction to determine appropriate accounting treatment. In general, the basic principle of accounting for nonmonetary transactions is based on the fair values involved, which is the same basis used in monetary transactions and results in the recognition of gains and losses. However, certain nonmonetary transactions meet criteria that require modification of the basic principle that necessitate recording values based on historical book value. We determine the treatment of nonmonetary transactions based on the individual facts and circumstances of each transaction. In cases where 68 nonmonetary transactions are recorded at fair value, we make various assumptions. The most significant assumptions are related to the estimated fair values assigned to proved and unproved oil and natural gas properties, similar to our valuation of the fair value of oil and natural gas assets acquired during a business combination described above. Any resulting difference between the fair value of the assets involved and their carrying value is recorded as a gain or loss in the consolidated statement of operations. Estimated fair values assigned to assets exchanged can have a significant effect on our results of operations in the future. If future commodity prices or reserves quantities are lower than those originally used to determine fair value or if future operating expenses or development costs are higher than those originally used to determine fair value, we would record an impairment loss for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value. Impairment would have no effect on cash flows but would result in a decrease in net income for the period in which the impairment is recorded. Goodwill Impairment Goodwill is not amortized but assessed for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist. Impairment tests, which involve the use of estimates related to the fair market value of the business operations with which goodwill is associated, is performed as of July 1 of each year. As we operate as a single operating segment and a single reporting unit, we evaluate goodwill for impairment based on an evaluation of the fair value of the company as a whole. There is considerable judgment involved in estimating fair values, including, among other things, determining the control premium when using the market approach in determining the fair value. To establish a reasonable control premium, we consider the premiums paid in recent market acquisitions and analyze current industry, market and economic conditions along with other factors or available information specific to our business. See Notes 2 and 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for more information regarding goodwill. Litigation and Environmental Contingencies We make judgments and estimates in recording liabilities for ongoing litigation and environmental remediation. Actual costs can vary from such estimates for a variety of reasons. The costs to settle litigation can vary from estimates based on differing interpretations of laws and opinions and assessments on the amount of damages. Similarly, environmental remediation liabilities are subject to change because of changes in laws and regulations, developing information relating to the extent and nature of site contamination and improvements in technology. A liability is recorded for these types of contingencies if we determine the loss to be both probable and reasonably estimable. If we are unable to reasonably estimate an amount but we are able to estimate a range of reasonably possible amounts, then the low end of the range is recorded. See Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for more information regarding our commitments and contingencies. Valuation of Financial Derivatives In order to reduce commodity price uncertainty and increase cash flow predictability relating to the marketing of our oil and natural gas, we enter into commodity price hedging arrangements with respect to a portion of our expected production. In addition, we have used derivative instruments in connection with acquisitions and certain price-sensitive projects. Management exercises significant judgment in determining the types of instruments to be used, production volumes to be hedged, prices at which to hedge and the counterparties creditworthiness. All derivative instruments are reflected at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets. Our open commodity derivative instruments were in a net asset position with a fair value of $695 million at December 31, 2018. In order to determine the fair value at the end of each reporting period, we compute discounted cash flows for the duration of each commodity derivative instrument using the terms of the related contract. Inputs consist of published forward commodity price curves as of the date of the estimate. We compare these prices to the price parameters contained in our hedge contracts to determine estimated future cash inflows or outflows. We then discount the cash inflows or outflows using a combination of published LIBOR rates and Eurodollar futures rates. The fair values of our commodity derivative assets and liabilities include a measure of credit risk based on average published yields by credit rating. Changes in the fair values of our commodity derivative instruments have a significant impact on our net income because we follow mark-to-market accounting and recognize all gains and losses on such instruments in earnings in the period in which they occur. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we reported a $832 million gain on commodity derivative instruments. We compare our estimates of the fair values of our commodity derivative instruments with those provided by our counterparties. There have been no significant differences. Income Taxes On December 22, 2017, the President of the United States signed the TCJA into law, which enacted significant changes to the federal income tax laws. According to ASC 740, Income Taxes, a company is required to record the effects of an enacted tax law or rate change in the period of enactment. Based on the comprehensiveness of TCJA and the challenges faced by calendar year-end registrants to complete the accounting for the income tax effects of the TCJA in the period of 69 enactment, the SEC issued SAB 118 Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which allowed companies to report provisional amounts when based on reasonable estimates and to adjust these amounts during a measurement period of up to one year. We elected to apply SAB 118 and recorded provisional amounts of our income tax balances in our consolidated financial statements at December 31, 2017. We calculated our best estimate of the impact of the TCJA, including the federal statutory tax rate change noted below, in our 2017 income tax provision in accordance with our understanding of the TCJA and recorded a $398 million decrease to our income tax provision at December 31, 2017. The provisional amount related to the re-measurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future. At December 31, 2018, the Company completed its accounting for all of the enactment-date tax effects of the TCJA and recognized an adjustment of $7 million to the provisional amount recorded at December 31, 2017. This adjustment was primarily related to the deductibility of certain performance-based compensation based on additional available regulatory and interpretive guidance. On July 19, 2018, we completed the RSP Acquisition. For federal income tax purposes, the transaction qualified as a tax-free merger whereby we acquired carryover tax basis in RSP assets and liabilities. As of December 31, 2018, we recorded an opening balance sheet deferred tax liability of $515 million based on our assessment of the carryover tax basis, which includes a deferred tax asset related to tax attributes acquired from RSP. The acquired income tax attributes primarily consist of NOLs and research and development credits that are subject to an annual limitation under Internal Revenue Code Section 382. The Company expects that these tax attributes will be fully utilized prior to expiration. Our provision for income taxes includes both federal and state taxes of the jurisdictions in which we operate. We estimate our overall tax rate using a combination of the enacted federal statutory tax rate, which decreased from 35 percent to 21 percent effective January 1, 2018 as a result of the TCJA, and a blend of enacted state tax rates. Acquisitions or dispositions of assets and changes in our drilling plan by tax jurisdiction could change the apportionment of our state taxes, which would impact our overall tax rate. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, based upon the technical merits of the position. At December 31, 2018, we had unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $63 million, primarily related to research and development credits. If all or a portion of the unrecognized tax benefit is sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, the tax benefit will be recognized as a reduction to our deferred tax liability and will affect our effective tax rate in the period it is recognized. The assessment of potential uncertain tax positions requires a significant amount of judgment and are reviewed and adjusted on a periodic basis. Our federal and state income tax returns are not prepared or filed before the consolidated financial statements are prepared; therefore, we estimate the tax basis of our assets and liabilities, which are based on numerous judgments and assumptions inherent in the determination of future taxable income, at the end of each period as well as the effects of tax rate changes and tax credits. Adjustments related to these estimates are recorded in our tax provision in the period in which we finalize our income tax returns. Historically, we have had no significant changes as a result of filing our tax returns. Material changes to our tax accruals and uncertain tax positions may occur in the future based on audits, changes in legislation or resolution of pending matters. See Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information regarding our current year income tax expense, deferred tax balances and uncertain tax positions. New accounting pronouncements issued but not yet adopted. See Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for information regarding new accounting pronouncements issued but not yet adopted. 70
