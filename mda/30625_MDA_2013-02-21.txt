ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis is provided to increase the understanding of, and should be read in conjunction with, the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes. See Item 1A. Risk Factors and the Forward-Looking Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012 ("Annual Report") for a discussion of the risks, uncertainties and assumptions associated with these statements. Unless otherwise noted, all amounts discussed herein are consolidated. EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW Our Company We believe that we are a world-leading manufacturer and aftermarket service provider of comprehensive flow control systems. We develop and manufacture precision-engineered flow control equipment integral to the movement, control and protection of the flow of materials in our customers critical processes. Our product portfolio of pumps, valves, seals, automation and aftermarket services supports global infrastructure industries, including oil and gas, chemical, power generation and water management, as well as general industrial markets where our products and services add value. Through our manufacturing platform and global network of Quick Response Centers ("QRCs"), we offer a broad array of aftermarket equipment services, such as installation, advanced diagnostics, repair and retrofitting. We currently employ approximately 17,000 employees in more than 50 countries. Our business model is significantly influenced by the capital spending of global infrastructure industries for the placement of new products into service and aftermarket services for existing operations. The worldwide installed base of our products is an important source of aftermarket revenue, where products are expected to ensure the maximum operating time of many key industrial processes. Over the past several years, we have significantly invested in our aftermarket strategy to provide local support to drive customer investments in our offerings and use of our services to replace or repair installed products. The aftermarket portion of our business also helps provide business stability during various economic periods. The aftermarket business, which is served by our network of 177 QRCs located around the globe, provides a variety of service offerings for our customers including spare parts, service solutions, product life cycle solutions and other value-added services. It is generally a higher margin business compared to our original equipment business and a key component of our profitable growth strategy. Our operations are conducted through three business segments that are referenced throughout this Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD&A"): Engineered Product Division ("EPD") for long lead time, custom and other highly-engineered pumps and pump systems, mechanical seals, auxiliary systems and replacement parts and related services; Industrial Product Division ("IPD") for pre-configured engineered pumps and pump systems and related products and services; and Flow Control Division ("FCD") for engineered and industrial valves, control valves, actuators and controls and related services. Our business segments share a focus on industrial flow control technology and have a high number of common customers. These segments also have complementary product offerings and technologies that are often combined in applications that provide us a net competitive advantage. Our segments also benefit from our global footprint and our economies of scale in reducing administrative and overhead costs to serve customers more cost effectively. For example, our segment leadership reports to our Chief Operating Officer ("COO"), and the segments share leadership for operational support functions such as research and development, marketing and supply chain. The reputation of our product portfolio is built on more than 50 well-respected brand names such as Worthington, IDP, Valtek, Limitorque, Durco, Edward, Anchor/Darling and Durametallic, which we believe to be one of the most comprehensive in the industry. Our products and services are sold either directly or through designated channels to more than 10,000 companies, including some of the world leading engineering, procurement and construction ("EPC") firms, original equipment manufacturers, distributors and end users. We continue to build on our geographic breadth through our QRC network with the goal to be positioned as near to customers as possible for service and support in order to capture valuable aftermarket business. Along with ensuring that we have the local capability to sell, install and service our equipment in remote regions, it is equally imperative to continuously improve our global operations. We continue to expand our global supply chain capability to meet global customer demands and ensure the quality and timely delivery of our products. We continue to devote resources to improving the supply chain processes across our business segments to find areas of synergy and cost reduction and to improve our supply chain management capability to ensure it can meet 25 global customer demands. We also remain focused on improving on-time delivery and quality, while managing warranty costs as a percentage of sales across our global operations, through the assistance of a focused Continuous Improvement Process ("CIP") initiative. The goal of the CIP initiative, which includes lean manufacturing, six sigma business management strategy and value engineering, is to maximize service fulfillment to customers through on-time delivery, reduced cycle time and quality at the highest internal productivity. We experienced improved bookings in 2012 despite an environment of continued global macroeconomic uncertainty. The oil and gas industry experienced stable conditions, while the chemical industry saw increased activity. The growth in the chemical industry was driven by Asia Pacific and Middle Eastern countries accelerating investment in their chemical processing capabilities and North America producers investing to utilize natural gas as a low-cost feedstock. We experienced a modest decline in bookings into Europe, as economic conditions in the region remain challenged. In the power generation industry, we experienced a slowing in the level of investment during 2012 due to uncertainty relating to environmental regulations and potential regulatory impact to the overall civilian nuclear market. In 2012, continued favorable conditions in our aftermarket business were driven by our customers' need to maintain continuing operations across several industries and the expansion of our aftermarket capabilities through our integrated solutions offerings. Our pursuit of major capital projects globally and our investments in localized customer service remain key components of our long-term growth strategy, and also provide stability during various economic periods. We believe that our commitment to localize service support capabilities close to our customers' operations through our QRC network has enabled us to grow our market share in the aftermarket portion of our business. We believe that with our customer relationships, global presence and highly-regarded technical capabilities, we will continue to have opportunities in our core industries; however, we face ongoing challenges affecting many companies in our industry with a significant multinational presence, such as economic, political, currency and other risks. At December 31, 2012, we had no direct investments in European sovereign or non-sovereign debt. However, certain of our defined benefit plans hold investments in European equity and fixed income securities as discussed in Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" ("Item 8") of this Annual Report. Other than broad, macro-level economic impacts, including foreign exchange rate impacts, we did not experience any direct or measurable disruptions during 2012 due to the European economic crisis. We will continue to monitor and evaluate the impact of any future developments in the region on our current business, our customers and suppliers and the state of the global economy. Additional adverse developments could potentially impact our customers exposures to sovereign and non-sovereign European debt and could soften the level of capital investment and demand for our products and services. On May 31, 2012, we announced that our Board of Directors endorsed an updated capital structure strategy designed to make our financial structure more efficient. This capital structure strategy includes: (i) targeting a long-term gross leverage ratio of 1.0x-2.0x total debt to EBITDA through the business cycle, versus then-current gross leverage ratio of 0.7x; and (ii) an expanded share repurchase program of $1.0 billion, which at authorization included approximately $233 million remaining under the previous repurchase authorization. The expanded share repurchase program includes amounts incremental to our previously-announced policy of annually returning 40% to 50% of running two-year average net earnings to shareholders. While we intend to adhere to this policy for the foreseeable future, any future returns of cash, whether through any combination of dividends or share repurchases, will be reviewed individually, declared by our Board of Directors and implemented by management at its discretion, depending on our financial condition and business opportunities at the time and market conditions. As a part of the $1.0 billion share repurchase program, on June 14, 2012, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase program ("ASR Program"). The ASR Program was completed on December 12, 2012. Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report includes a discussion of our ASR Program, share repurchase program and payments of quarterly dividends on our common stock. As a part of our continuing effort to execute our capital structure strategy, we entered into a new credit agreement in August 2012. This new agreement provided additional debt capacity to execute on our growth initiatives, and also enhanced our operating flexibility and reduced our borrowing costs after attaining investment grade credit ratings with all three rating agencies. Additionally, on September 11, 2012, we issued $500.0 million in aggregate principal amount of senior notes due September 15, 2022 ("Senior Notes"). See Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for a more complete discussion of our long-term debt. Our Markets The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the "Outlook for 2013" section included below in this MD&A. Our products and services are used in several distinct industries: oil and gas, chemical, power generation, water management, and a number of other industries that are collectively referred to as "general industries." 26 Demand for most of our products depends on the level of new capital investment and planned and unplanned maintenance expenditures by our customers. The level of new capital investment depends, in turn, on capital infrastructure projects driven by the need for oil and gas, power generation and water management, as well as general economic conditions. These drivers are generally related to the phase of the business cycle in their respective industries and the expectations of future market behavior. The levels of maintenance expenditures are additionally driven by the reliability of equipment, planned and unplanned downtime for maintenance and the required capacity utilization of the process. Our customers include EPC firms, original equipment manufacturers, end users and distributors. Sales to EPC firms and original equipment manufacturers are typically for large project orders and critical applications, as are certain sales to distributors. Project orders are typically procured for customers either directly from us or indirectly through contractors for new construction projects or facility enhancement projects. The quick turnaround business, which we also refer to as "book and ship," is defined as orders that are received from the customer (booked) and shipped within three months of receipt. These orders are typically for more standardized, general purpose products, parts or services. Each of our three business segments generate certain levels of this type of business. In the sale of aftermarket products and services, we benefit from a large installed base of our original equipment, which requires periodic maintenance, repair and replacement parts. We use our manufacturing platform and global network of QRCs to offer a broad array of aftermarket equipment services, such as installation, advanced diagnostics, repair and retrofitting. In geographic regions where we are positioned to provide quick response, we believe customers have traditionally relied on us, rather than our competitors, for aftermarket products due to our highly engineered and customized products. However, the aftermarket for standard products is competitive, as the existence of common standards allows for easier replacement of the installed products. As proximity of service centers, timeliness of delivery and quality are important considerations for all aftermarket products and services, we continue to selectively expand our global QRC network to improve our ability to capture this important aftermarket business. Oil and Gas The oil and gas industry, which represented approximately 41% and 40% of our bookings in 2012 and 2011 , respectively, experienced a stable level of capital spending in 2012 compared to the previous year due to the need to continue building infrastructure to bring future capacity on line to meet future demand expectations. The majority of investment by the major oil companies continued to focus on upstream production activities; however, there were improved levels of spending in both mid-stream pipeline and downstream refining operations, particularly in the developing markets. Refining overcapacity remained a concern throughout the year in the mature regions, as overall demand for oil remained volatile throughout the year. Aftermarket opportunities in this industry improved throughout the year, with our integrated solutions offering helping to offset a reduction in service-related business, as many refineries performed this work with their own personnel. The outlook for the oil and gas industry is heavily dependent on the demand growth from both mature markets and developing geographies. We believe oil and gas companies will continue with upstream and downstream investment plans that are in line with projections of future demand growth and the production declines of existing operations. A projected decline in demand could cause oil and gas companies to reduce their overall level of spending, which could decrease demand for our products and services. However, we believe the long-term fundamentals for this industry remain solid based on current supply, projected depletion rates of existing fields and forecasted long-term demand growth. With our long-standing reputation in providing successful solutions for upstream, mid-stream and downstream applications, along with the advancements in our portfolio of offerings, we believe that we continue to be well-positioned to pursue the global opportunities in this industry. Chemical The chemical industry represented approximately 19% and 18% of our bookings in 2012 and 2011 , respectively. Capital spending in the chemical industry increased in 2012 with the expansion of existing facilities and the approval of new projects around the world. The Middle East and Asia have seen significant growth in chemical projects as countries in those regions try to access the higher margins available downstream in the petrochemical markets. Additionally, North America has seen a revival in the chemical industry, where shale gas has changed the economics of production allowing for a lower cost abundant feedstock to drive high value chemical projects. The aftermarket opportunities improved for the majority of the year with indications that the improvements will continue into 2013. Despite a strong year, the outlook for the chemical industry remains heavily dependent on global economic conditions. As global economies stabilize and unemployment conditions improve, a rise in consumer spending should follow. An increase in spending would drive greater demand for chemical-based products supporting improved levels of capital investment. We believe the chemical industry in the near-term will continue to invest in maintenance and upgrades for optimization of existing assets and that developing regions will continue investing in capital infrastructure to meet current and future indigenous demand. We believe 27 our global presence and our localized aftermarket capabilities are well-positioned to serve the potential growth opportunities in this industry. Power Generation The power generation industry represented approximately 14% and 16% of our bookings in 2012 and 2011 , respectively. In 2012, the power generation industry continued to experience some softness in capital spending in the mature regions driven by the uncertainty related to environmental regulations, as well as potential regulatory impacts to the overall civilian nuclear market. In the developing regions, capital investment remained in place driven by increased demand forecasts for electricity in countries such as China and India. Global concerns about the environment continue to support an increase in desired future capacity from renewable energy sources. The majority of the active and planned construction throughout 2012 continued to utilize designs based on fossil fuels. Natural gas increased its percentage of utilization driven by market prices for gas remaining low and relatively stable. With the potential of unconventional sources of gas, such as shale gas, the power generation industry is forecasting an increased use of this form of fuel for power generation plants. We believe the outlook for the power generation industry remains favorable. Current legislative efforts to limit the emissions of carbon dioxide may have an adverse effect on investment plans depending on the potential requirements imposed and the timing of compliance by country. However, we believe that proposed methods of limiting carbon dioxide emissions offer business opportunities for our products and services. We believe the long-term fundamentals for the power generation industry remain solid based on projected increases in demand for electricity driven by global population growth, advancements of industrialization and growth of urbanization in developing markets. We also believe that our long-standing reputation in the power generation industry, our portfolio of offerings for the various generating methods, our advancements in serving the renewable energy market and carbon capture methodologies, as well as our global service and support structure, position us well for the future opportunities in this important industry. Water Management The water management industry represented approximately 4% our bookings in both 2012 and 2011 . Although the water management industry displayed weakness in spending levels in 2012 as desalination projects continued to be delayed, worldwide demand for fresh water and water treatment continues to create requirements for new facilities or for upgrades of existing systems, many of which require products that we offer, particularly pumps. We believe that the persistent demand for fresh water during all economic cycles supports continued investments. The water management industry is facing a future supply/demand challenge relative to forecasted global population growth coupled with the advancement of industrialization and urbanization. Due to the limitations of usable fresh water around the globe, there continues to be a need for increased investment in desalination. This investment is forecasted to significantly increase over the next several decades. We believe we are a global leader in the desalination market, which is already an important source of fresh water in the Mediterranean region and the Middle East. We expect that this trend in desalination will expand from these traditional areas to other coastal areas around the globe, which we believe presents a significant market opportunity for pumps, valves, actuation products and energy recovery devices. General Industries General industries represented, in the aggregate, approximately 22% of our bookings in both 2012 and 2011 . General industries comprises a variety of different businesses, including mining and ore processing, pharmaceuticals, pulp and paper, food and beverage and other smaller applications, none of which individually represented more than 5% of total bookings in 2012 and 2011 . General industries also includes sales to distributors, whose end customers operate in the industries we primarily serve. The outlook for this group of industries is heavily dependent upon the condition of global economies and consumer confidence levels. The long-term fundamentals of many of these industries remain sound, as many of the products produced by these industries are common staples of industrialized and urbanized economies. We believe that our specialty product offerings designed for these industries and our aftermarket service capabilities will provide continued business opportunities. OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Throughout this discussion of our results of operations, we discuss the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We have calculated currency effects by translating current year results on a monthly basis at prior year exchange rates for the same periods. As discussed in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report, effective October 28, 2011, we acquired for inclusion in EPD, Lawrence Pumps, Inc. ("LPI"), a privately-owned, United States ("U.S.") based 28 company specializing in the design, development and manufacture of engineered centrifugal slurry pumps for critical services within the petroleum refining, petrochemical, pulp and paper and energy markets. We also acquired for inclusion in FCD, Valbart Srl ("Valbart"), a privately-owned Italian valve manufacturer, effective July 16, 2010. The results of operations of LPI and Valbart have been consolidated since the respective dates of acquisition. No pro forma information has been provided for these acquisitions due to immateriality. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Outlook for 2013 section included in this MD&A. Bookings and Backlog 2012 2011 2010 (Amounts in millions) Bookings $ 4,713.5 $ 4,661.9 $ 4,228.9 Backlog (at period end) 2,648.9 2,690.1 2,594.7 We define a booking as the receipt of a customer order that contractually engages us to perform activities on behalf of our customer in regards to the manufacture, delivery, and/or support of products or the delivery of service. Bookings recorded and subsequently canceled within the same fiscal period are excluded from bookings. Bookings in 2012 increased by $51.6 million, or 1.1% , as compared with 2011 . The increase included negative currency effects of approximately $204 million. The increase was primarily driven by the oil and gas and chemical industries in EPD and IPD and general industries in EPD, partially offset by declines in the power generation industry in EPD and IPD and the oil and gas and general industries in FCD. The increase was more heavily weighted toward aftermarket bookings in EPD and to a lesser extent original equipment bookings in IPD, offset by reduced original equipment bookings in FCD. The increase included the 2012 impact of IPD orders in excess of $90 million to supply offshore oil and gas platform equipment over the next five years and an order in 2011 in excess of $80 million to supply a variety of pumps for a refinery that did not recur in 2012. Bookings in 2011 increased by $433.0 million, or 10.2%, as compared with 2010. The increase included currency benefits of approximately $149 million. The increase was primarily attributable to increased original equipment bookings in FCD and IPD, coupled with increased aftermarket bookings in EPD. These increases were partially offset by decreased original equipment bookings in EPD, including the impact of an order in excess of $80 million to supply a variety of pumps for a refinery, received primarily in the first quarter of 2011, as well as the impact of an order in excess of $80 million for crude oil pumps, seals and related support services booked in 2010 that did not recur. The increase was also attributable to strength in the oil and gas and chemical industries in FCD, general industries in both FCD and IPD and power generation and chemical industries in EPD, partially offset by a decrease in the oil and gas industry in EPD. Backlog represents the aggregate value of booked but uncompleted customer orders and is influenced primarily by bookings, sales, cancellations and currency effects. Backlog of $2.6 billion at December 31, 2012 decreased by $41.2 million, or 1.5% , as compared to December 31, 2011 . Currency effects provided an increase of approximately $22 million (currency effects on backlog are calculated using the change in period end exchange rates). Approximately 24% of the backlog at December 31, 2012 and 2011 was related to aftermarket orders. Backlog of $2.7 billion at December 31, 2011 increased by $95.4 million, or 3.7%, as compared to December 31, 2010. Currency effects provided a decrease of approximately $51 million. Sales 2012 2011 2010 (Amounts in millions) Sales $ 4,751.3 $ 4,510.2 $ 4,032.0 Sales in 2012 increased by $241.1 million, or 5.3% , as compared with 2011 . The increase included negative currency effects of approximately $204 million. The increase was primarily due to increased original equipment sales in IPD and FCD, and aftermarket sales in EPD. The increase was driven by customer sales to North America, Asia Pacific and the Middle East, partially offset by a decrease in customer sales to Europe. Sales in 2011 increased by $478.2 million, or 11.9%, as compared with 2010. The increase included currency benefits of approximately $144 million. The increase was primarily due to increased original equipment sales in FCD and IPD, and increased aftermarket sales in EPD. The increase was driven by customer sales to North America, Asia Pacific and the Middle East. Sales to international customers, including export sales from the U.S., were approximately 71% of sales in 2012 , and 73% in both 2011 and 2010 . Sales to Europe, the Middle East and Africa ("EMA") were approximately 37% , 39% and 40% of total 29 sales in 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively. Sales to Asia Pacific were approximately 20% , 19% and 18% of total sales in 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively. Sales to Latin America were approximately 10% of total sales in each of 2012 , 2011 and 2010 . Gross Profit and Gross Profit Margin 2012 2011 2010 (Amounts in millions, except percentages) Gross profit $ 1,581.0 $ 1,513.6 $ 1,409.7 Gross profit margin 33.3 % 33.6 % 35.0 % Gross profit in 2012 increased by $67.4 million, or 4.5% , as compared with 2011 . Gross profit margin in 2012 of 33.3% decreased from 33.6% in 2011 . The decrease was primarily attributed to the larger effect on revenue of certain large, lower margin projects that shipped from backlog in EPD as compared with the same period in 2011, partially offset by the effects of operational execution improvements in EPD and IPD. Aftermarket sales of approximately 41% of total sales were consistent with the same period in 2011. Gross profit in 2011 increased by $103.9 million, or 7.4%, as compared with 2010. The increase included the effect of approximately $13 million in increased savings realized and $9.9 million of decreased charges resulting from our realignment programs, partially offset by $6.8 million in charges related to the IPD recovery plan, as compared with 2010. Gross profit margin in 2011 of 33.6% decreased from 35.0% in 2010. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower margins on certain large projects primarily in beginning of year backlog, the negative impact of currency on margins of U.S. dollar-denominated sales produced in some of our non-U.S. facilities, incremental charges associated with certain projects that have not shipped or shipped late in EPD, charges related to the IPD recovery plan and increased material costs in FCD. The decrease was partially offset by a mix shift to higher margin aftermarket sales in all business segments. As a result of the sales mix shift, aftermarket sales increased to approximately 41% of total sales, as compared with approximately 39% of total sales for the same period in 2010. Selling, General and Administrative Expense ("SG&A") 2012 2011 2010 (Amounts in millions, except percentages) SG&A $ 922.1 $ 914.1 $ 845.0 SG&A as a percentage of sales 19.4 % 20.3 % 21.0 % SG&A in 2012 increased by $8.0 million, or 0.9% , as compared with 2011 . Currency effects yielded a decrease of approximately $28 million. Selling-related expenses and broad-based annual incentive compensation expenses primarily contributed to the increase. These increases were partially offset by a $10.4 million gain in EPD during the first quarter of 2012 from the sale of our manufacturing facility in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in preparation for opening a new manufacturing facility there in 2013. SG&A as a percentage of sales in 2012 improved 90 basis points as compared with 2011 , due in part to a continued focus on cost management. SG&A in 2011 increased by $69.1 million, or 8.2%, as compared with 2010. The increase included currency effects that yielded an increase of approximately $25 million, and also included the effect of approximately $10 million in increased savings realized and $3.6 million of decreased charges resulting from our realignment programs as compared with 2010. The increase was primarily attributable to incremental selling and marketing-related expenses associated with the above mentioned increase in sales, merit-related compensation increases, acquisition-related costs and other incremental SG&A costs associated with the acquisition of LPI during the fourth quarter of 2011 and the impact of hiring associates to support high-growth areas of the business. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in broad-based annual and long-term incentive program compensation. SG&A as a percentage of sales in 2011 improved 70 basis points as compared with 2010. Net Earnings from Affiliates 2012 2011 2010 (Amounts in millions) Net earnings from affiliates $ 17.0 $ 19.1 $ 16.6 Net earnings from affiliates represents our net income from investments in eight joint ventures ( one located in each of Japan, Saudi Arabia, South Korea and the United Arab Emirates and two located in each of China and India) that are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Net earnings from affiliates in 2012 decreased by $2.1 million, or 11.0% , as compared with 2011 , 30 primarily due to decreased earnings of our FCD joint venture in India. Net earnings from affiliates in 2011 increased by $2.5 million, or 15.1%, as compared with 2010, primarily due to increased earnings of our FCD joint venture in India. Operating Income 2012 2011 2010 (Amounts in millions, except percentages) Operating income $ 675.8 $ 618.7 $ 581.4 Operating income as a percentage of sales 14.2 % 13.7 % 14.4 % Operating income in 2012 increased by $57.1 million, or 9.2% , as compared with 2011 . The increase included negative currency effects of approximately $36 million . The increase was primarily a result of the $67.4 million increase in gross profit. The improvement in operating income as a percentage of sales was primarily due to SG&A as a percentage of sales decreasing to 19.4% from 20.3% for the same period in 2011, partially offset by the slight decrease in gross profit margin. Operating income in 2011 increased by $37.3 million, or 6.4%, as compared with 2010. The increase included currency benefits of approximately $17 million. The increase included the effect of approximately $24 million in increased savings realized from our realignment programs as compared with 2010. The overall net increase was primarily a result of the $103.9 million i ncrease in gross profit, which was partially offset by the $69.1 million increase in SG&A, as discussed above. Interest Expense and Interest Income 2012 2011 2010 (Amounts in millions) Interest expense $ (43.5 ) $ (36.2 ) $ (34.3 ) Interest income 1.0 1.6 1.6 Interest expense in 2012 increased by $7.3 million as compared with 2011 . The increase was primarily attributable to interest expense associated with increased borrowings under our Bridge Loan and Senior Notes and $1.3 million in unamortized deferred loan costs related to our Prior Credit Agreement that were expensed in the third quarter of 2012. See Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for definition and discussion of our various credit resources. Interest expense in 2011 increased by $1.9 million as compared with 2010 primarily due to increased interest expense on local borrowings to fund short-term cash needs in support of growth in emerging markets and the impact of the refinancing of our credit facilities in late 2010. At December 31, 2012 , approximately 70% of our debt was at fixed rates, including the effects of $275.0 million of notional interest rate swaps. Interest income in 2012 decreased by $0.6 million as compared with 2011 . The decrease was primarily attributable to lower average cash balances in 2012 as compared with 2011. Interest income in 2011 was consistent with 2010. Other (Expense) Income, net 2012 2011 2010 (Amounts in millions) Other (expense) income, net $ (21.6 ) $ 3.7 $ (18.3 ) Other (expense) income, net in 2012 decreased $25.3 million to other expense, net of $21.6 million, as compared to other income, net of $3.7 million in 2011 . The decrease was primarily due to a $21.6 million increase in losses (reflecting a $14.3 million loss in 2012, relating primarily to the Euro and Mexican peso, as compared with a $7.3 million gain in 2011) arising from transactions in currencies other than our sites functional currencies, as well as a $3.4 million increase in losses on foreign exchange contracts. Other income (expense), net in 2011 increased $22.0 million to income of $3.7 million, as compared to expense of $18.3 million in 2010. The increase was primarily due to a $23.9 million increase in gains arising from transactions in currencies other than our sites' functional currencies, which reflect the relative strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus the Euro during 2011 as compared with 2010. Currency losses in 2010 included the impact of the $7.6 million net loss recorded as a result of Venezuela's currency devaluation and the settlement of U.S. dollar denominated liabilities at the more favorable essential items rate of 2.60 Bolivars to the U.S. dollar. These losses were partially offset by a $3.1 million gain on the sale of an investment in a joint venture in 2010 that was accounted for under the cost method. 31 Tax Expense and Tax Rate 2012 2011 2010 (Amounts in millions, except percentages) Provision for income taxes $ 160.8 $ 158.5 $ 141.6 Effective tax rate 26.3 % 27.0 % 26.7 % The 2012, 2011 and 2010 effective tax rates differed from the federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the net impact of foreign operations, which included the impacts of lower foreign tax rates, and changes in our reserves established for uncertain tax positions. On May 17, 2006, the Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act of 2005 was signed into law, creating an exclusion from U.S. taxable income for certain types of foreign related party payments of dividends, interest, rents and royalties that, prior to 2006, had been subject to U.S. taxation. This exclusion is effective for the years 2006 through 2013, and applies to certain of our related party payments. Our effective tax rate is based upon current earnings and estimates of future taxable earnings for each domestic and international location. Changes in any of these and other factors, including our ability to utilize foreign tax credits and net operating losses or results from tax audits, could impact the tax rate in future periods. As of December 31, 2012, we have foreign tax credits of $31.4 million , expiring in 2020 and 2021 against which we recorded no valuation allowances. Additionally, we have recorded other net deferred tax assets of $73.2 million , which relate to net operating losses, tax credits and other deductible temporary differences that are available to reduce taxable income in future periods, most of which do not have a definite expiration. Should we not be able to utilize all or a portion of these credits and losses, our effective tax rate would increase. Net Earnings and Earnings Per Share 2012 2011 2010 (Amounts in millions, except per share amounts) Net earnings attributable to Flowserve Corporation $ 448.3 $ 428.6 $ 388.3 Net earnings per share diluted $ 8.51 $ 7.64 $ 6.88 Average diluted shares 52.7 56.1 56.4 Net earnings in 2012 increased by $19.7 million to $448.3 million, or to $8.51 per diluted share, as compared with 2011 . The increase was primarily attributable to a $57.1 million increase in operating income, partially offset by a $25.3 million decrease in other income, net, a $7.3 million increase in interest expense and a $2.3 million increase in tax expense. Net earnings in 2011 increased by $40.3 million to $428.6 million, or to $7.64 per diluted share, as compared with 2010. The increase was primarily attributable to $37.3 million increase in operating income and a $22.0 million increase in other income (expense), net, partially offset by a $1.9 million increase in interest expense and a $16.9 million increase in tax expense. Other Comprehensive Loss 2012 2011 2010 (Amounts in millions) Other comprehensive loss $ (8.3 ) $ (65.6 ) $ (1.4 ) Other comprehensive loss in 2012 decreased by $57.3 million , primarily reflecting the strengthening of the Euro, Mexican peso and Indian rupee at December 31, 2012 as compared with December 31, 2011 . Other comprehensive loss in 2011 increased by $64.2 million, primarily reflecting the strengthening of the U.S. dollar exchange rate versus the Euro at December 31, 2011 as compared with December 31, 2010. Business Segments We conduct our operations through three business segments based on type of product and how we manage the business. We evaluate segment performance and allocate resources based on each segment operating income. See Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for further discussion of our segments. The key operating results for our three business segments, EPD, IPD and FCD, are discussed below. 32 Engineered Product Division Segment Results Our largest business segment is EPD, through which we design, manufacture, distribute and service custom and other highly-engineered pumps and pump systems, mechanical seals and auxiliary systems (collectively referred to as "original equipment"). EPD includes longer lead time, highly-engineered pump products, and shorter cycle engineered pumps and mechanical seals that are generally manufactured much more quickly. EPD also manufactures replacement parts and related equipment and provides a full array of replacement parts, repair and support services (collectively referred to as "aftermarket"). EPD primarily operates in the oil and gas, power generation, chemical, water management and general industries. EPD operates in 41 countries with 29 manufacturing facilities worldwide, nine of which are located in Europe, 11 in North America, four in Asia and five in Latin America, and it has 128 QRCs, including those co-located in manufacturing facilities and/or shared with FCD. EPD 2012 2011 (1) 2010 (Amounts in millions, except percentages) Bookings $ 2,373.1 $ 2,333.5 $ 2,242.0 Sales 2,403.1 2,321.4 2,152.7 Gross profit 811.2 803.4 782.9 Gross profit margin 33.8 % 34.6 % 36.4 % Segment operating income 396.1 395.2 412.6 Segment operating income as a percentage of sales 16.5 % 17.0 % 19.2 % Backlog (at period end) 1,400.3 1,441.6 1,435.5 _______________________________________ (1) Includes the post-acquisition operating results of LPI, which was acquired in October 2011. Bookings in 2012 increased by $39.6 million, or 1.7% , as compared with 2011 . The increase included negative currency effects of approximately $105 million. The increase in customer bookings was primarily driven by the chemical, oil and gas and general industries, partially offset by the power generation industry. Customer bookings increases of $80.1 million into North America, $ 53.0 million into Asia Pacific and $47.1 million into Europe were partially offset by a decrease of $129.8 million into the Middle East. The overall net increase was driven by aftermarket bookings. The increase included the impact of an order in the first quarter of 2011 in excess of $80 million to supply a variety of pumps for a refinery in the Middle East that did not recur in 2012. Of the $2.4 billion of bookings in 2012 , approximately 51% were from oil and gas, 17% from power generation, 15% from chemical, 2% from water management and 15% from general industries. The trend toward globalization is continuing to drive spending in the chemical, oil and gas and general industries in 2012. The North American pipeline business and the global fertilizer market strengthened compared to last year. Interdivision bookings (which are eliminated and are not included in consolidated bookings as disclosed above) decreased $11.2 million . Bookings in 2011 increased by $91.5 million, or 4.1%, as compared with 2010. The increase included currency benefits of approximately $65 million. Customer bookings increases of $94.1 million into North America, $64.5 million into Asia Pacific, $47.3 into the Middle East and $23.2 million into Latin America were partially offset by a decrease of $136.4 million into Europe. The overall net increase primarily consisted of an increase in the power generation and chemical industries. Of the $2.3 billion of bookings in 2011, approximately 50% were from oil and gas, 21% from power generation, 13% from chemical, 1% from water management and 15% from general industries. Interdivision bookings (which are eliminated and are not included in consolidated bookings as disclosed above) increased $3.3 million. Sales in 2012 increased $81.7 million, or 3.5% , as compared with 2011 . The increase included negative currency effects of approximately $106 million. The increase was more heavily weighted towards aftermarket sales, primarily resulting from customer sales increases of $75.0 million into North America, $52.9 million into the Middle East and $21.1 million into Asia Pacific, partially offset by sales decreases of $28.6 million into Europe and $21.6 million into Latin America. Interdivision sales (which are eliminated and are not included in consolidated sales as disclosed above) decreased $17.4 million. Sales in 2011 increased $168.7 million, or 7.8%, as compared with 2011. The increase included currency benefits of approximately $67 million. The increase was primarily driven by increased aftermarket sales. Sales increases of $71.7 million into Latin America, $49.4 million into North America, $43.7 million into Asia Pacific and $39.1 million into the Middle East were partially offset by sales decreases of $28.9 million into Europe. Interdivision sales (which are eliminated and are not included in consolidated sales as disclosed above) increased $16.3 million. Gross profit in 2012 increased by $7.8 million, or 1.0% , as compared with 2011 . Gross profit margin in 2012 of 33.8% decreased from 34.6% in 2011 . The decrease was primarily attributed to a larger effect on revenue of certain large, lower margin 33 projects that shipped from backlog, as compared with the same period in 2011, partially offset by the effects of operational execution improvements and a sales mix shift towards higher margin aftermarket sales. Gross profit in 2011 increased by $20.5 million, or 2.6%, as compared with 2010. Gross profit margin in 2011 of 34.6% decreased from 36.4% in 2010. The decrease was primarily attributable to a larger effect on revenue of certain large projects at low margins primarily in beginning of year backlog, the negative impact of currency on margins of U.S. dollar denominated sales produced in some of our non-U.S. facilities and incremental charges associated with certain projects that have not shipped or shipped late, partially offset by a sales mix shift towards higher margin aftermarket sales. Operating income in 2012 increased by $0.9 million, or 0.2% , as compared with 2011 . The increase included negative currency effects of approximately $20 million. The increase was due primarily to the gross profit increase of $7.8 million , partially offset by increased SG&A of $7.4 million (including a decrease due to currency effects of approximately $13 million ). The increase in SG&A included a $10.4 million gain from the sale of our manufacturing facility in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in preparation for opening a new manufacturing facility there in 2013, offset by increased SG&A costs associated with LPI, increased broad-based annual incentive compensation and increased selling-related expenses. Operating income in 2011 decreased by $17.4 million, or 4.2%, as compared with 2010. The decrease included currency benefits of approximately $9 million. The overall net decrease was due primarily to the SG&A increase of $37.9 million (including an increase due to currency effects of approximately $12 million), partially offset by increased gross profit of $20.5 million. Increased SG&A was attributable to incremental selling and marketing-related expenses associated with the above mentioned increase in sales, merit-related compensation increases, the impact of hiring associates to support high-growth areas of the business, acquisition-related and other incremental SG&A costs associated with the acquisition of LPI in the fourth quarter of 2011 and a $3.9 million penalty that was assessed by a Spanish regulatory commission in the second quarter of 2011. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in broad-based annual and long-term incentive program compensation. Backlog of $1.4 billion at December 31, 2012 decreased by $41.3 million, or 2.9% , as compared to December 31, 2011 . Currency effects provided an increase of approximately $11 million . Backlog at December 31, 2012 included $21.4 million of interdivision backlog (which is eliminated and not included in consolidated backlog as disclosed above). Backlog of $1.4 billion at December 31, 2011 increased by $6.1 million, or 0.4%, as compared to December 31, 2010. Currency effects provided a decrease of approximately $14 million. Backlog at December 31, 2011 included $19.9 million of interdivision backlog (which is eliminated and not included in consolidated backlog as disclosed above). Industrial Product Division Segment Results Through IPD we design, manufacture, distribute and service engineered, pre-configured industrial pumps and pump systems, including submersible motors and specialty products, collectively referred to as "original equipment." Additionally, IPD manufactures replacement parts and related equipment, and provides a full array of support services (collectively referred to as "aftermarket"). IPD primarily operates in the oil and gas, chemical, water management, power generation and general industries. IPD operates 12 manufacturing facilities, three of which are located in the U.S and six in Europe, and it operates 20 QRCs worldwide, including 11 sites in Europe and three in the U.S., including those co-located in manufacturing facilities. IPD 2012 2011 2010 (Amounts in millions, except percentages) Bookings $ 964.3 $ 905.4 $ 827.5 Sales 953.9 878.2 800.2 Gross profit 230.3 197.5 204.7 Gross profit margin 24.1 % 22.5 % 25.6 % Segment operating income 99.5 62.9 68.5 Segment operating income as a percentage of sales 10.4 % 7.2 % 8.6 % Backlog (at period end) 593.0 567.8 568.0 Bookings in 2012 increased by $58.9 million, or 6.5% , as compared with 2011 . The increase included negative currency effects of approximately $35 million. The increase was primarily driven by increased customer bookings in the oil and gas and chemical industries, partially offset by the power industry. The increase included the impact of 2012 orders in excess of $90 million to supply offshore oil and gas platform equipment over the next five years primarily to an end customer in Latin America. Customer bookings increases of $105.2 million into Latin America and $32.7 million into North America were partially offset by a decrease of $37.7 million into Europe and $22.8 million into Asia Pacific. The increase was more heavily weighted toward customer original 34 equipment bookings. Interdivision bookings (which are eliminated and are not included in consolidated bookings as disclosed above) decreased $24.7 million . Of the $964.3 million of bookings in 2012 , approximately 35% were from oil and gas, 16% from water management, 13% from chemical, 5% from power generation and 31% from general industries. In 2012, opportunities in the chemical industry were driven by inexpensive natural gas in North America and demand for product diversification in the Middle East. Additionally, stable pricing in 2012 promoted investment in both conventional and unconventional oil. Bookings in 2011 increased by $77.9 million, or 9.4%, as compared with 2010. The increase included currency benefits of approximately $29 million. Customer bookings increases of $49.8 million into Asia Pacific, $12.8 million into Africa and $12.7 million into Europe were partially offset by a decrease of $19.4 million into the Middle East and $15.5 million into Latin America. Customer bookings increases were driven by general and chemical industries, partially offset by decreased customer bookings in the water management industry. Interdivision bookings (which are eliminated and are not included in consolidated bookings as disclosed above) increased $32.2 million. Of the $905.4 million of bookings in 2011, approximately 29% were from oil and gas, 19% from water management, 11% from chemical, 8% from power generation and 33% from general industries. Sales in 2012 increased by $75.7 million, or 8.6% , as compared with 2011 . The increase included negative currency effects of approximately $31 million. The increase in customer sales was primarily driven by original equipment sales. Customer sales increases of $35.9 million into North America, $15.2 million into the Middle East, $14.3 million into Asia Pacific and $12.1 million into Latin America were partially offset by decreased sales of $22.7 million into Europe. Interdivision sales (which are eliminated and are not included in consolidated sales as disclosed above) increased $14.6 million . Sales in 2011 increased by $78.0 million, or 9.7%, as compared with 2010. The increase included currency benefits of approximately $29 million. The increase was primarily driven by increased aftermarket sales. The increase in customer sales was attributed to the increase of $48.9 million into North America. Interdivision sales (which are eliminated and are not included in consolidated sales as disclosed above) increased $30.0 million. Gross profit in 2012 increased by $32.8 million, or 16.6% , as compared with 2011 . Gross profit margin in 2012 of 24.1% increased from 22.5% in 2011 . The increase was primarily attributable to $7.1 million of IPD recovery plan realignment charges incurred in 2011 that did not recur in 2012, lower costs resulting from operational improvements and continued realization of realignment savings, partially offset by a sales mix shift to lower margin original equipment sales. Gross profit in 2011 decreased by $7.2 million, or 3.5%, as compared with 2010. Gross profit margin in 2011 of 22.5% decreased from 25.6% in 2010. The decrease is primarily attributable to less favorable pricing on projects shipped from backlog, increased material costs, charges related to the IPD recovery plan and incremental charges resulting from operational efficiency issues in certain sites, partially offset by increased savings realized from our realignment programs, as compared with the same period in 2010, and a mix shift to higher margin aftermarket sales. Operating income for 2012 increased by $36.6 million, or 58.2% , as compared with 2011 . The increase included negative currency effects of approximately $4 million . The increase was due to the $32.8 million increase in gross profit discussed above and a $3.8 million decrease in SG&A. Operating income for 2011 decreased by $5.6 million, or 8.2%, as compared with 2010. The decrease included currency benefits of approximately $2 million. The overall net decrease is due to the $7.2 million decrease in gross profit discussed above, partially offset by a $1.6 million decrease in SG&A. Backlog of $593.0 million at December 31, 2012 increased by $25.2 million , or 4.4% , as compared with December 31, 2011 . Currency effects provided an increase of approximately $13 million . Backlog at December 31, 2012 included $40.7 million of interdivision backlog (which is eliminated and not included in consolidated backlog as disclosed above). Backlog of $567.8 million at December 31, 2011 remained flat, as compared to December 31, 2010. Currency effects provided a decrease of approximately $13 million. Backlog at December 31, 2011 included $56.7 million of interdivision backlog (which is eliminated and not included in consolidated backlog as disclosed above). Flow Control Division Segment Results Our second largest business segment is FCD, which designs, manufactures and distributes a broad portfolio of engineered-to-order and configured-to-order isolation valves, control valves, valve automation products, boiler controls and related services. FCD leverages its experience and application know-how by offering a complete menu of engineered services to complement its expansive product portfolio. FCD has a total of 58 manufacturing facilities and QRCs in 25 countries around the world, with five of its 25 manufacturing operations located in the U.S. and 13 located in Europe. Based on independent industry sources, we believe that FCD is the fourth largest industrial valve supplier on a global basis. 35 FCD 2012 2011 2010 (1) (Amounts in millions, except percentages) Bookings $ 1,526.8 $ 1,603.0 $ 1,306.6 Sales 1,557.1 1,473.3 1,197.5 Gross profit 541.4 511.5 422.3 Gross profit margin 34.8 % 34.7 % 35.3 % Segment operating income 253.4 233.3 180.4 Segment operating income as a percentage of sales 16.3 % 15.8 % 15.1 % Backlog (at period end) 723.9 759.9 658.5 _______________________________________ (1) Includes the post-acquisition operating results of Valbart, which was acquired in July 2010. Bookings in 2012 decreased $76.2 million, or 4.8% , as compared with 2011 . The decrease included negative currency effects of approximately $63 million . The decrease in customer bookings was primarily attributable to customer project delays in the oil and gas industry and fewer pulp and paper projects in general industries. Customer bookings decreases of $68.6 million into Europe and $21.9 million into Latin America were partially offset by an increase of $13.6 million into the Middle East. The decrease was more heavily weighted toward original equipment bookings. Of the $1.5 billion of bookings in 2012 , approximately 29% were from oil and gas, 29% from chemical, 27% from general industries, 14% from power generation and 1% from water management. Bookings in 2011 increased $296.4 million, or 22.7%, as compared with 2010. The increase included currency benefits of approximately $54 million and Valbart bookings increases of $110.4 million. The increase in customer bookings was primarily attributable to strength in the oil and gas industry, and increased bookings in the chemical and general industries. Increased bookings were partially offset by decreases in the power generation industry due primarily to a slowdown in global nuclear power projects. Customer bookings increased $98.0 million into Europe, $79.4 into Asia Pacific, $62.7 million into North America and $38.0 million into Latin America. Of the $1.6 billion of bookings in 2011, approximately 31% were from oil and gas, 27% from chemical, 27% from general industries 14% from power generation and 1% from water management. Sales in 2012 increased $83.8 million, or 5.7% , as compared with 2011 . The increase included negative currency effects of approximately $67 million. The increase was primarily driven by customer original equipment sales in the oil and gas and chemical industries. Sales increases of $77.8 million into Asia Pacific and $47.5 million into North America were partially offset by a decrease of $42.4 million into Europe. Sales in 2011 increased $275.8 million, or 23.0%, as compared with 2010. The increase included currency benefits of approximately $48 million. Customer sales increased by approximately $92.7 million into Europe, reflecting continued recovery in the oil and gas industry and included Valbart sales increases of $74.6 million. Customer sales increased by $59.8 million into the Middle East, $49.8 million into Asia Pacific and $47.2 million into North America. Gross profit in 2012 increased by $29.9 million, or 5.8% as compared with 2011 . Gross profit margin in 2012 of 34.8% was comparable to the same period in 2011 . Gross profit in 2011 increased by $89.2 million, or 21.1% as compared with 2010. Gross profit margin in 2011 of 34.7% decreased from 35.3% for the same period in 2010. The decrease was attributable to increased material costs, partially offset by increased sales, which favorably impacted our absorption of fixed manufacturing costs, and various CIP initiatives. Operating income in 2012 increased by $20.1 million, or 8.6% , as compared with 2011 . The increase included negative currency effects of approximately $12 million. The increase was principally attributable to the $29.9 million increase in gross profit noted above, partially offset by a $7.2 million increase in SG&A (including a decrease due to currency effects of approximately $11 million ). Increased SG&A was primarily attributable to increased selling and research and development costs. Operating income in 2011 increased by $52.9 million, or 29.3%, as compared with 2010. The increase included currency benefits of approximately $7 million. The increase was principally attributable to the $89.2 million increase in gross profit discussed above. The increase was partially offset by a $38.8 million increase in SG&A, which was attributable to incremental selling and marketing-related expenses associated with the above mentioned increase in sales, merit-related compensation increases, increased research and development costs and the impact of hiring associates to support high-growth areas of the business. Backlog of $723.9 million at December 31, 2012 decreased by $36.0 million, or 4.7% , as compared to December 31, 2011 . Currency effects provided a decrease of approximately $3 million . Backlog of $759.9 million at December 31, 2011 increased 36 by $101.4 million, or 15.4%, as compared to December 31, 2010. Currency effects provided a decrease of approximately $24 million. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash Flow Analysis 2012 2011 2010 (Amounts in millions) Net cash flows provided by operating activities $ 517.1 $ 218.2 $ 355.8 Net cash flows used by investing activities (126.4 ) (194.2 ) (286.7 ) Net cash flows used by financing activities (428.9 ) (239.0 ) (142.9 ) Existing cash, cash generated by operations and borrowings available under our existing revolving credit facility are our primary sources of short-term liquidity. We monitor the depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents on a regular basis, and we believe that we have placed our deposits with creditworthy financial institutions. Our sources of operating cash generally include the sale of our products and services and the conversion of our working capital, particularly accounts receivable and inventories. Our total cash balance at December 31, 2012 was $304.3 million, compared with $337.4 million at December 31, 2011 and $557.6 million at December 31, 2010 . Our cash balance decreased by $33.1 million to $304.3 million as of December 31, 2012 as compared with December 31, 2011. The cash used in 2012 included $771.9 million for share repurchases, $135.5 million in capital expenditures, the funding of increased working capital requirements discussed below, $80.0 million in net payments on long-term debt and $73.8 million of dividend payments, partially offset by $498.1 million in proceeds from the issuance of Senior Notes (discussed below). Our cash provided by operating activities was $517.1 million , $218.2 million an d $355.8 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, which provided cash to support short-term working capital needs. Working capital increased in 2012 due primarily to higher inventory of $72.7 million and higher accounts receivable of $35.1 million . During 2012 , we contributed $28.1 million to our defined benefit pension plans. Working capital increased in 2011 due primarily to higher accounts receivable of $243.1 million and higher inventory of $139.8 million. During 2011, we contributed $27.0 million to our defined benefit pension plans. Increases in accounts receivable used $35.1 million of cash flow in 2012 , as compared with $243.1 million in 2011 and $52.0 million in 2010 . The use of cash for accounts receivable in 2012 was primarily attributable to delays in the collection of accounts receivable due to slower than anticipated payments from certain customers. The use of cash for accounts receivable in 2011 was primarily attributable to delays in the collection of accounts receivable due to slower than anticipated payments from certain customers, relatively strong sales in December 2011, in part due to the completion of certain previously past due projects, and contractually longer payment terms in 2011 as compared to 2010. For the fourth quarter of 2012 , our days' sales outstanding ("DSO") was 75 days as compared with 75 days and 66 days for the same periods in 2011 and 2010 , respectively. For reference purposes based on 2012 sales, a DSO improvement of one day could provide approximately $15 million in cash. We have not experienced a significant increase in customer payment defaults in 2012. Increases in inventory used $72.7 million of cash flow in 2012 compared with $139.8 million in 2011 and $52.9 million in 2010 . The use of cash for inventory in 2012 was primarily due to a decrease in progress billings on large orders at December 31, 2012 and higher raw material inventory needed to support an increased level of bookings. The use of cash for inventory in 2011 was primarily due to shipment delays and growth of short cycle orders during 2011, requiring higher raw material and work in process inventory to support end of period backlog. Inventory turns were 3.2 times at December 31, 2012 , compared with 3.4 times at both December 31, 2011 and 2010. Our calculation of inventory turns does not reflect the impact of advanced cash received from our customers. For reference purposes based on 2012 data, an improvement of one-tenth of a turn could yield approximately $26 million in cash. Cash flows used by investing activities were $126.4 million, $194.2 million and $286.7 million in 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively, due primarily to capital expenditures and cash paid for 2011 and 2010 acquisitions. Capital expenditures during 2012 were $135.5 million, an increase of $27.6 million as compared with 2011 . In 2012, our capital expenditures were focused on strategic initiatives to pursue new markets, geographic and capacity expansion, information technology infrastructure and cost reduction opportunities. Cash flows used by financing activities were $428.9 million in 2012 compared with $239.0 million in 2011 and $142.9 million in 2010 . Cash outflows during 2012 resulted primarily from the repurchase of $771.9 million of our common stock (including the $300.0 million ASR Program payment discussed below), $80.0 million in net payments on long-term debt and $73.8 million of dividend payments, partially offset by $498.1 million in net proceeds from the issuance of Senior Notes. Cash outflows during 37 2011 resulted primarily from the repurchase of $150.0 million of our common stock, payment of $69.6 million in dividends and $25.0 million of payments on long-term debt. On May 31, 2012, we announced that our Board of Directors endorsed an updated capital structure strategy designed to make our financial structure more efficient. This capital structure strategy includes: (i) targeting a long-term gross leverage ratio of 1.0x-2.0x total debt to EBITDA through the business cycle, versus then-current gross leverage ratio of 0.7x; and (ii) an expanded share repurchase program of $1.0 billion, which at authorization included approximately $233 million remaining under the previous repurchase authorization. The expanded share repurchase program includes amounts incremental to our previously-announced policy of annually returning 40% to 50% of running two-year average net earnings to shareholders. While we intend to adhere to this policy for the foreseeable future, any future returns of cash, whether through any combination of dividends or share repurchases, will be reviewed individually, declared by our Board of Directors and implemented by management at its discretion, depending on our financial condition, business opportunities at the time and market conditions. As a part of the $1.0 billion share repurchase program, on June 14, 2012, we entered into an ASR Program with J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, as agent for JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., London Branch, under which we agreed to repurchase an aggregate of $300.0 million of our common stock. The ASR Program was completed on December 12, 2012. Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report includes a discussion of our share repurchase program, including the ASR Program, and payments of quarterly dividends on our common stock. As a part of our continuing effort to execute our capital structure strategy, we entered into a new credit agreement that provides for an aggregate commitment of $1.25 billion , including a $400.0 million term loan facility with a maturity date of August 20, 2017 ( Term Loan Facility ) and an $850.0 million revolving credit facility with a maturity date of August 20, 2017 ( Revolving Credit Facility and, together with the Term Loan Facility, the Senior Credit Facility ). This new agreement provided additional debt capacity to execute on our growth initiatives and enhance our operating flexibility and reduced our borrowing costs. Additionally, on September 11, 2012, we issued $500.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes, which bear an annual stated interest rate of 3.50% (see Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report). Our cash needs for the next 12 months are expected to be less than those of 2012, resulting from a decreased level of anticipated share repurchases and improvements in working capital, partially offset by increases in pension contributions, incentive compensation payments and cash dividends. We believe cash flows from operating activities, combined with availability under our Revolving Credit Facility and our existing cash balances, will be sufficient to enable us to meet our cash flow needs for the next 12 months. However, cash flows from operations could be adversely affected by a decrease in the rate of general global economic growth, as well as economic, political and other risks associated with sales of our products, operational factors, competition, regulatory actions, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in interest rates, among other factors. We believe that cash flows from operating activities and our expectation of continuing availability to draw upon our credit agreements are also sufficient to meet our cash flow needs for periods beyond the next 12 months. Payments for Acquisitions We regularly evaluate acquisition opportunities of various sizes. The cost and terms of any financing to be raised in conjunction with any acquisition, including our ability to raise economical capital, is a critical consideration in any such evaluation. Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this this Annual Report contains a discussion of acquisitions. Financing A discussion of our refinanced Senior Credit Facility and our European Letter of Credit ("LOC") Facility and related covenants is included in Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this this Annual Report. We were in compliance with all covenants as of December 31, 2012 . Certain financing arrangements contain provisions that may result in an event of default if there was a failure under other financing arrangements to meet payment terms or to observe other covenants that could result in an acceleration of payment due. Such provisions are referred to as "cross default" provisions. Each of the Senior Credit Facility, the Senior Notes and the European LOC Facility is cross-defaulted to the other. The rating agencies assign credit ratings to certain of our debt. Our access to capital markets and costs of debt could be directly affected by our credit ratings. Any adverse action with respect to our credit ratings could generally cause borrowing costs to increase and the potential pool of investors and fundings sources to decrease. In particular, a decline in credit ratings would increase the cost of borrowing under our Senior Credit Facility. 38 We have entered into interest rate swap agreements to hedge our exposure to variable interest payments related to our Senior Credit Facility. These agreements are more fully described in Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report, and in "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk" below. Liquidity Analysis Our cash balance decreased by $33.1 million to $304.3 million as of December 31, 2012 as compared with December 31, 2011 . The cash usage included $771.9 million of share repurchases, $135.5 million in capital expenditures and $73.8 million in dividend payments partially offset by $418.1 million in net proceeds from issuance of long-term debt. Approximately 6% of our term loan is due to mature in 2013 and approximately 10% in 2014 . Our Senior Credit Facility matures in August 2017. After the effects of $275.0 million of notional interest rate swaps, approximately 70% of our term debt was at fixed rates at December 31, 2012 . As of December 31, 2012 , we had a borrowing capacity of $697.8 million on our $850.0 million Revolving Credit Facility (including outstanding letters of credit), and we had net available capacity under the European LOC Facility of 61.9 million ( $81.7 million ). Our Revolving Credit Facility and our European LOC Facility are committed and are held by a diversified group of financial institutions. At December 31, 2012 and 2011, as a result of increases in values of the plan assets and our contributions to the plan, our U.S. pension plan was fully-funded as defined by applicable law. After consideration of our intent to maintain fully funded status, we contributed $7.9 million to our U.S. pension plan in 2012, excluding direct benefits paid. We continue to maintain an asset allocation consistent with our strategy to maximize total return, while reducing portfolio risks through asset class diversification. At December 31, 2012, $299.4 million of our total cash balance of $304.3 million was held by foreign subsidiaries, $248.7 million of which we consider permanently reinvested outside the U.S. Based on the expected 2013 liquidity needs of our various geographies, we currently do not anticipate the need to repatriate any permanently reinvested cash to fund domestic operations that would generate adverse tax results. However, in the event this cash is needed to fund domestic operations, we estimate the $248.7 million could be repatriated without resulting in a material U.S. tax liability. OUTLOOK FOR 2013 Our future results of operations and other forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report, including this MD&A, involve a number of risks and uncertainties in particular, the statements regarding our goals and strategies, new product introductions, plans to cultivate new businesses, future economic conditions, revenue, pricing, gross profit margin and costs, capital spending, depreciation and amortization, research and development expenses, potential impairment of investments, tax rate and pending tax and legal proceedings. Our future results of operations may also be affected by the amount, type and valuation of share-based awards granted, as well as the amount of awards forfeited due to employee turnover. In addition to the various important factors discussed above, a number of other factors could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. See the risks described in "Item 1A. Risk Factors" of this Annual Report. Our bookings were $4,713.5 million during 2012 . Because a booking represents a contract that can be, in certain circumstances, modified or canceled, and can include varying lengths between the time of booking and the time of revenue recognition, there is no guarantee that the increase in bookings will result in a comparable increase in revenues or otherwise be indicative of future results. We expect a continued competitive economic environment in 2013; however, we anticipate benefits from the continuation of our end user strategy, the strength of our high margin aftermarket business, continued disciplined cost management, our diverse customer base, our broad product portfolio and our unified operating platform. Similar to prior years, we expect our results will be weighted towards the second half of the year. While we believe that our primary markets continue to provide opportunities, as evidenced by eight consecutive quarters of over $1 billion in bookings, we remain cautious in our outlook for 2013 given the continuing uncertainty of global economic conditions. For additional discussion on our markets and our opportunities, see the "Business Overview Our Markets" section of this MD&A. On December 31, 2012 , we had $498.1 million of fixed-rate Senior Notes outstanding and $395.0 million of variable-rate debt under our Senior Credit Facility. All of our borrowings under our Senior Credit Facility carry a floating rate of interest. As of December 31, 2012, we had $275.0 million of derivative contracts to convert a portion of floating interest rates to fixed interest rates to reduce our exposure to interest rate volatility. However, because a portion of our debt carries a floating rate of interest, our debt is subject to volatility in rates, which could impact interest expense. We expect our interest expense in 2013 will be higher than 2012 due to our increased level of debt. Our results of operations may also be impacted by unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate movements. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk of this Annual Report. We expect to generate sufficient cash from operations to fund our working capital, capital expenditures, dividend payments, share repurchases, debt payments and pension plan contributions in 2013 . The amount of cash generated or consumed by working 39 capital is dependent on our level of revenues, customer cash advances, backlog, customer-driven delays and other factors. We seek to improve our working capital utilization, with a particular focus on improving the management of accounts receivable and inventory. In 2013, our cash flows for investing activities will be focused on strategic initiatives to pursue new markets, geographic expansion, information technology infrastructure and cost reduction opportunities and are expected to be between $120 million and $130 million , before consideration of any potential acquisition activity. We have $25.0 million in scheduled principal repayments in 2013 under our Senior Credit Facility, and we expect to comply with the covenants under our Senior Credit Facility in 2013 . See Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for further discussion of our debt covenants. We currently anticipate that our minimum contribution to our qualified U.S. pension plan will be approximately $20 million, excluding direct benefits paid, in 2013 in order to maintain fully-funded status as defined by applicable law. We currently anticipate that our contributions to our non-U.S. pension plans will be approximately $10 million in 2013 . On February 8, 2013, the Venezuelan government announced its intention to devalue its currency (bolivar) from 4.3 to 6.3 bolivars to the U.S. dollar. Our operations in Venezuela generally consist of a service center that performs service and repair activities. In addition, certain of our operations in other countries sell equipment and parts that are typically denominated in U.S. dollars directly to Venezuelan customers. Our Venezuelan subsidiary's sales in 2012 and total assets at December 31, 2012 represented less than 1% of consolidated sales and total assets for the same period. Our preliminary assessment of the impact of the devaluation is that we will incur an after-tax charge of approximately $3 million in the first quarter of 2013 as a result of re-measuring using the rate of 6.3 bolivars to the U.S. dollar. We are currently assessing the ongoing impact of the currency devaluation on our Venezuelan operations and imports into the market, including further actions of the Venezuelan government and economic conditions in Venezuela, such as inflation and capital spending. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS The following table presents a summary of our contractual obligations at December 31, 2012 : Payments Due By Period Within 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years Beyond 5 Years Total (Amounts in millions) Term Loan Facility and Senior Notes $ 25.0 $ 85.0 $ 285.0 $ 500.0 $ 895.0 Fixed interest payments(1) 18.9 35.3 35.0 87.5 176.7 Variable interest payments(2) 7.1 12.3 7.3 26.7 Other debt and capital lease obligations 34.5 1.0 35.5 Operating leases 52.8 73.2 39.0 47.1 212.1 Purchase obligations:(3) Inventory 553.9 13.3 1.7 0.8 569.7 Non-inventory 39.5 3.1 0.1 42.7 Pension and postretirement benefits(4) 53.2 109.5 115.8 315.6 594.1 Total $ 784.9 $ 332.7 $ 483.9 $ 951.0 $ 2,552.5 _______________________________________ (1) Fixed interest payments represent net incremental payments under interest rate swap agreements related to the Term Loan Facility and interest payments on the Senior Notes. (2) Variable interest payments under our Senior Credit Facility were estimated using a base rate of three-month LIBOR as of December 31, 2012 . (3) Purchase obligations are presented at the face value of the purchase order, excluding the effects of early termination provisions. Actual payments could be less than amounts presented herein. (4) Retirement and postretirement benefits represent estimated benefit payments for our U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit plans and our postretirement medical plans, as more fully described below and in Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. As of December 31, 2012 , the gross liability for uncertain tax positions was $59.1 million. We do not expect a material payment related to these obligations to be made within the next twelve months. We are unable to provide a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of future payments relating to the uncertain tax positions. 40 The following table presents a summary of our commercial commitments at December 31, 2012 : Commitment Expiration By Period Within 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years Beyond 5 Years Total (Amounts in millions) Letters of credit $ 448.3 $ 150.8 $ 23.6 $ 53.0 $ 675.7 Surety bonds 105.3 22.5 127.8 Total $ 553.6 $ 173.3 $ 23.6 $ 53.0 $ 803.5 We expect to satisfy these commitments through performance under our contracts. PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS OBLIGATIONS Plan Descriptions We and certain of our subsidiaries have defined benefit pension plans and defined contribution plans for full-time and part-time employees. Approximately 69% of total defined benefit pension plan assets and approximately 55% of defined benefit pension obligations are related to the U.S. qualified plan as of December 31, 2012 . The assets for the U.S. qualified plan are held in a single trust with a common asset allocation. Unless specified otherwise, the references in this section are to all of our U.S. and non-U.S. plans. None of our common stock is directly held by these plans. Our U.S. defined benefit plan assets consist of a balanced portfolio of primarily U.S. equity and fixed income securities. Our non-U.S. defined benefit plan assets include a significant concentration of United Kingdom ("U.K.") equity and fixed income securities. In addition, certain of our defined benefit plans hold investments in European equity and fixed income securities as discussed in Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. We monitor investment allocations and manage plan assets to maintain acceptable levels of risk. Benefits under our defined benefit pension plans are based primarily on participants compensation and years of credited service. Assets under our defined benefit pension plans consist primarily of equity and fixed-income securities. At December 31, 2012 , the estimated fair market value of U.S. and non-U.S. plan assets for our defined benefit pension plans increased to $553.4 million from $495.1 million at December 31, 2011 . Assets were allocated as follows: U.S. Plan Asset category 2012 2011 U.S. Large Cap 28 % 28 % U.S. Small Cap 4 % 4 % International Large Cap 14 % 14 % Emerging Markets 4 % 4 % Equity securities 50 % 50 % Long-Term Government/Credit 21 % 21 % Intermediate Bond 29 % 29 % Fixed income 50 % 50 % Other(1) 0 % 0 % _______________________________________ (1) Less than 1% of holdings are in Other category in 2011. 41 Non-U.S. Plans Asset category 2012 2011 North American Companies 5 % 5 % U.K. Companies 19 % 20 % European Companies 6 % 6 % Asian Pacific Companies 5 % 5 % Global Equity 1 % 1 % Equity securities 36 % 37 % U.K. Government Gilt Index 21 % 21 % U.K. Corporate Bond Index 19 % 17 % Global Fixed Income Bond 22 % 23 % Fixed income 62 % 61 % Other 2 % 2 % The projected benefit obligation ("Benefit Obligation") for our defined benefit pension plans was $763.9 million and $658.8 million as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 , respectively. The estimated prior service cost and the estimated actuarial net loss for the defined benefit pension plans that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss into net pension expense in 2013 is less than $0.1 million and $20.4 million, respectively. We amortize estimated prior service costs and estimated net losses over the remaining expected service period or over the remaining expected lifetime for plans with only inactive participants. We sponsor defined benefit postretirement medical plans covering certain current retirees and a limited number of future retirees in the U.S. These plans provide for medical and dental benefits and are administered through insurance companies. We fund the plans as benefits are paid, such that the plans hold no assets in any period presented. Accordingly, we have no investment strategy or targeted allocations for plan assets. The benefits under the plans are not available to new employees or most existing employees. The Benefit Obligation for our defined benefit postretirement medical plans was $35.0 million at both December 31, 2012 and 2011 . The estimated actuarial net gain for the defined benefit postretirement medical plans that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss into net pension expense in 2013 is $1.2 million. No estimated prior service benefit or cost is expected to be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss into U.S. pension expense in 2013. We amortize any estimated prior service benefits and estimated net gain over the remaining expected service period of approximately three years. Accrual Accounting and Significant Assumptions We account for pension benefits using the accrual method, recognizing pension expense before the payment of benefits to retirees. The accrual method of accounting for pension benefits requires actuarial assumptions concerning future events that will determine the amount and timing of the benefit payments. Our key assumptions used in calculating our cost of pension benefits are the discount rate, the rate of compensation increase and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. We, in consultation with our actuaries, evaluate the key actuarial assumptions and other assumptions used in calculating the cost of pension and postretirement benefits, such as discount rates, expected return on plan assets for funded plans, mortality rates, retirement rates and assumed rate of compensation increases, and determine such assumptions as of December 31 of each year to calculate liability information as of that date and pension and postretirement expense for the following year. See discussion of our accounting for and assumptions related to pension and postretirement benefits in the Our Critical Accounting Estimates section of this MD&A. In 2012 , net pension expense for our defined benefit pension plans included in operating income was $41.4 million compared with $37.8 million in 2011 and $36.1 million in 2010 . The gain for the postretirement medical plans was $0.1 million in 2012 compared with $1.2 million in 2011 and $2.4 million in 2010 . 42 The following are assumptions related to our defined benefit pension plans as of December 31, 2012 : U.S. Plan Non-U.S. Plans Weighted average assumptions used to determine Benefit Obligation: Discount rate 3.75 % 4.16 % Rate of increase in compensation levels 4.25 3.84 Weighted average assumptions used to determine 2012 net pension expense: Long-term rate of return on assets 6.25 % 5.78 % Discount rate 4.50 5.09 Rate of increase in compensation levels 4.25 3.56 The following provides a sensitivity analysis of alternative assumptions on the U.S. qualified and aggregate non-U.S. pension plans and U.S. postretirement plans. Effect of Discount Rate Changes and Constancy of Other Assumptions: 0.5% Increase 0.5% Decrease (Amounts in millions) U.S. defined benefit pension plan: Effect on net pension expense $ (1.0 ) $ 1.1 Effect on Benefit Obligation (14.4 ) 15.6 Non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans: Effect on net pension expense (1.6 ) 1.7 Effect on Benefit Obligation (24.5 ) 27.2 U.S. Postretirement medical plans: Effect on postretirement medical expense (0.2 ) 0.2 Effect on Benefit Obligation (1.1 ) 1.2 Effect of Changes in the Expected Return on Assets and Constancy of Other Assumptions: 0.5% Increase 0.5% Decrease (Amounts in millions) U.S. defined benefit pension plan: Effect on net pension expense $ (1.7 ) $ 1.7 Non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans: Effect on net pension expense (0.7 ) 0.7 As discussed below, accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. ( GAAP ) provide that differences between expected and actual returns are recognized over the average future service of employees. At December 31, 2012 , as compared to December 31, 2011 , we decreased our discount rate for the U.S. plan from 4.50% to 3.75% based on an analysis of publicly-traded investment grade U.S. corporate bonds, which had a lower yield due to current market conditions. We decreased our average discount rate for non-U.S. plans from 5.09% to 4.16% based primarily on lower applicable corporate AA-graded bond yields for the Euro zone and the U.K. The average assumed rate of compensation remained constant at 4.25% for the U.S. plan and increased from 3.56% to 3.84% for our non-U.S. plans. To determine the 2012 pension expense, the expected rate of return on U.S. plan assets remained consistent with 2011 at 6.25% and we decreased our average rate of return on non-U.S. plan assets from 6.13% to 5.78% , primarily as a result of the decrease in the U.K. rate of return on assets. As the expected rate of return on plan assets is long-term in nature, short-term market changes do not significantly impact the rates. We expect that the net pension expense for our defined benefit pension plans included in earnings before income taxes will be approximately $10 million higher in 2013 than the $41.4 million in 2012 , reflecting, among other things, increased amortization of the actuarial net loss and increased service costs. We expect the 2013 net pension benefit for the postretirement medical plans to be $0.1 million higher than the $0.1 million benefit in 2012 . 43 We have used discount rates of 3.75% , 4.16% and 3.25% at December 31, 2012 , in calculating our estimated 2013 net pension expense for U.S. pension plans, non-U.S. pension plans and other postretirement plans, respectively. The assumed ranges for the annual rates of increase in health care costs were 8.0% for 2012 , 8.5% for 2011 and 9.0% for 2010 , with a gradual decrease to 5.0% for 2032 and future years. If actual costs are higher than those assumed, this will likely put modest upward pressure on our expense for retiree health care. Plan Funding Our funding policy for defined benefit plans is to contribute at least the amounts required under applicable laws and local customs. We contributed $28.1 million, $27.0 million and $50.2 million to our defined benefit plans in 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively. After consideration of our intent to remain fully-funded based on standards set by law, we currently anticipate that our contribution to our U.S. pension plan in 2013 will be approximately $20 million, excluding direct benefits paid. We expect to contribute approximately $10 million to our non-U.S. pension plans in 2013 . For further discussion of our pension and postretirement benefits, see Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The process of preparing financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires the use of estimates and assumptions to determine reported amounts of certain assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of related contingent assets and liabilities. These estimates and assumptions are based upon information available at the time of the estimates or assumptions, including our historical experience, where relevant. The most significant estimates made by management include: timing and amount of revenue recognition; deferred taxes, tax valuation allowances and tax reserves; reserves for contingent losses; pension and postretirement benefits; and valuation of goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets. The significant estimates are reviewed quarterly by management. Because of the uncertainty of factors surrounding the estimates, assumptions and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements, actual results may differ from the estimates, and the difference may be material. Our critical accounting policies are those policies that are both most important to our financial condition and results of operations and require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments on the part of management in their application, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. We believe that the following represent our critical accounting policies. For a summary of all of our significant accounting policies, see Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. Management and our external auditors have discussed our critical accounting estimates and policies with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. Revenue Recognition Revenues for product sales are recognized when the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the customers, which is typically based on the contractual delivery terms agreed to with the customer and fulfillment of all but inconsequential or perfunctory actions. In addition, our policy requires persuasive evidence of an arrangement, a fixed or determinable sales price and reasonable assurance of collectability. We defer the recognition of revenue when advance payments are received from customers before performance obligations have been completed and/or services have been performed. Freight charges billed to customers are included in sales and the related shipping costs are included in cost of sales in our consolidated statements of income. Our contracts typically include cancellation provisions that require customers to reimburse us for costs incurred up to the date of cancellation, as well as any contractual cancellation penalties. We enter into certain contracts with multiple deliverables that may include any combination of designing, developing, manufacturing, modifying, installing and commissioning of flow management equipment and providing services related to the performance of such products. Delivery of these products and services typically occurs within a one to two-year period , although many arrangements, such as "book and ship" type orders, have a shorter timeframe for delivery . We aggregate or separate deliverables into units of accounting based on whether the deliverable(s) have standalone value to the customer and when no general right of return exists. Contract value is allocated ratably to the units of accounting in the arrangement based on their relative selling prices determined as if the deliverables were sold separately. Revenues for long-term contracts that exceed certain internal thresholds regarding the size and duration of the project and provide for the receipt of progress billings from the customer are recorded on the percentage of completion method with progress measured on a cost-to-cost basis. Percentage of completion revenue represents less than 9% of our consolidated sales for each year presented. 44 Revenue on service and repair contracts is recognized after services have been agreed to by the customer and rendered. Revenues generated under fixed fee service and repair contracts are recognized on a ratable basis over the term of the contract. These contracts can range in duration, but generally extend for up to five years . Fixed fee service contracts represent aproximately 1% of consolidated sales for each year presented. In certain instances, we provide guaranteed completion dates under the terms of our contracts. Failure to meet contractual delivery dates can result in late delivery penalties or non-recoverable costs. In instances where the payment of such costs are deemed to be probable, we perform a project profitability analysis, accounting for such costs as a reduction of realizable revenues, which could potentially cause estimated total project costs to exceed projected total revenues realized from the project. In such instances, we would record reserves to cover such excesses in the period they are determined. In circumstances where the total projected revenues still exceed total projected costs, the incurrence of penalties or non-recoverable costs generally reduces profitability of the project at the time of subsequent revenue recognition. Our reported results would change if different estimates were used for contract costs or if different estimates were used for contractual contingencies. Deferred Taxes, Tax Valuation Allowances and Tax Reserves We recognize valuation allowances to reduce the carrying value of deferred tax assets to amounts that we expect are more likely than not to be realized. Our valuation allowances primarily relate to the deferred tax assets established for certain tax credit carryforwards and net operating loss carryforwards for non-U.S. subsidiaries, and we evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets by assessing the related valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of these allowances, if necessary. We assess such factors as our forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets in determining the sufficiency of our valuation allowances. Failure to achieve forecasted taxable income in the applicable tax jurisdictions could affect the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets and could result in an increase in our effective tax rate on future earnings. Implementation of different tax structures in certain jurisdictions could, if successful, result in future reductions of certain valuation allowances. The amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, which often result in proposed assessments. Significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and evaluating tax positions. We establish reserves for open tax years for uncertain tax positions that may be subject to challenge by various tax authorities. The consolidated tax provision and related accruals include the impact of such reasonably estimable losses and related interest and penalties as deemed appropriate. Tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from uncertain tax positions are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. While we believe we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters, our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities. To the extent that the expected tax outcome of these matters changes, such changes in estimate will impact the income tax provision in the period in which such determination is made. Reserves for Contingent Loss Liabilities are recorded for various contingencies arising in the normal course of business when it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and such loss is estimable. Assessments of reserves are based on information obtained from our independent and in-house experts, including recent legal decisions and loss experience in similar situations. The recorded legal reserves are susceptible to changes due to new developments regarding the facts and circumstances of each matter, changes in political environments, legal venue and other factors. Recorded environmental reserves could change based on further analysis of our properties, technological innovation and regulatory environment changes. Estimates of liabilities for unsettled asbestos-related claims are based on known claims and on our experience during the preceding two years for claims filed, settled and dismissed, with adjustments for events deemed unusual and unlikely to recur. A substantial majority of our asbestos-related claims are covered by insurance or indemnities. Estimated indemnities and receivables from insurance carriers for unsettled claims and receivables for settlements and legal fees paid by us for asbestos-related claims are estimated using our historical experience with insurance recovery rates and estimates of future recoveries, which include estimates of coverage and financial viability of our insurance carriers. We have claims pending against certain insurers that, if resolved more favorably than estimated future recoveries, would result in discrete gains in the applicable quarter. We are currently unable to estimate the impact, if any, of unasserted asbestos-related claims, although future claims would also be subject to existing indemnities and insurance coverage. Changes in claims filed, settled and dismissed and differences between actual and estimated settlement costs and insurance or indemnity recoveries could impact future expense. 45 Pension and Postretirement Benefits We provide pension and postretirement benefits to certain of our employees, including former employees, and their beneficiaries. The assets, liabilities and expenses we recognize and disclosures we make about plan actuarial and financial information are dependent on the assumptions and estimates used in calculating such amounts. The assumptions include factors such as discount rates, health care cost trend rates, inflation, expected rates of return on plan assets, retirement rates, mortality rates, turnover, rates of compensation increases and other factors. The assumptions utilized to compute expense and benefit obligations are shown in Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. These assumptions are assessed annually in consultation with independent actuaries and investment advisors as of December 31 and adjustments are made as needed. We evaluate prevailing market conditions and local laws and requirements in countries where plans are maintained, including appropriate rates of return, interest rates and medical inflation (health care cost trend) rates. We ensure that our significant assumptions are within the reasonable range relative to market data. The methodology to set our significant assumptions includes: Discount rates are estimated using high quality debt securities based on corporate or government bond yields with a duration matching the expected benefit payments. For the U.S. the discount rate is obtained from an analysis of publicly-traded investment-grade corporate bonds to establish a weighted average discount rate. For plans in the United Kingdom and the Euro zone we use the discount rate obtained from an analysis of AA-graded corporate bonds used to generate a yield curve. For other countries or regions without a corporate AA bond market, government bond rates are used. Our discount rate assumptions are impacted by changes in general economic and market conditions that affect interest rates on long-term high-quality debt securities, as well as the duration of our plans liabilities. The expected rates of return on plan assets are derived from reviews of asset allocation strategies, expected long-term performance of asset classes, risks and other factors adjusted for our specific investment strategy. These rates are impacted by changes in general market conditions, but because they are long-term in nature, short-term market changes do not significantly impact the rates. Changes to our target asset allocation also impact these rates. The expected rates of compensation increase reflect estimates of the change in future compensation levels due to general price levels, seniority, age and other factors. Depending on the assumptions used, the pension and postretirement expense could vary within a range of outcomes and have a material effect on reported earnings. In addition, the assumptions can materially affect benefit obligations and future cash funding. Actual results in any given year may differ from those estimated because of economic and other factors. We evaluate the funded status of each retirement plan using current assumptions and determine the appropriate funding level considering applicable regulatory requirements, tax deductibility, reporting considerations, cash flow requirements and other factors. We discuss our funding assumptions with the Finance Committee of our Board of Directors. Valuation of Goodwill, Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets The initial recording of goodwill and intangible assets requires subjective judgments concerning estimates of the fair value of the acquired assets. We test the value of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment as of December 31 each year or whenever events or circumstances indicate such assets may be impaired. The test for goodwill impairment involves significant judgment in estimating projections of fair value generated through future performance of each of the reporting units. The identification of our reporting units began at the operating segment level and considered whether components one level below the operating segment levels should be identified as reporting units for purpose of testing goodwill for impairment based on certain conditions. These conditions included, among other factors, (i) the extent to which a component represents a business and (ii) the aggregation of economically similar components within the operating segments and resulted in eight reporting units. Other factors that were considered in determining whether the aggregation of components was appropriate included the similarity of the nature of the products and services, the nature of the production processes, the methods of distribution and the types of industries served. Impairment losses for goodwill are recognized whenever the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value. We estimate the fair value of our reporting units based on an income approach, whereby we calculate the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. A discounted cash flow analysis requires us to make various judgmental assumptions about future sales, operating margins, growth rates and discount rates, which are based on our budgets, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows and market participants. Assumptions are also made for varying perpetual growth rates for periods beyond the long-term business plan period. We did not record an impairment of goodwill in 2012 , 2011 or 2010 . The fair values of our reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying values at December 31, 2012. 46 We also consider our market capitalization in our evaluation of the fair value of our goodwill. Our market capitalization increased as compared with 2011 and did not indicate a potential impairment of our goodwill as of December 31, 2012 . Impairment losses for indefinite-lived intangible assets are recognized whenever the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value. Fair values are calculated for trademarks using a "relief from royalty" method, which estimates the fair value of the trademarks by determining the present value of estimated royalty payments that are avoided as a result of owning the trademark. This method includes judgmental assumptions about sales growth and discount rates that have a significant impact on the fair value and are substantially consistent with the assumptions used to determine the fair value of our reporting units discussed above. We did not record a material impairment of our trademarks in 2012 , 2011 or 2010 . The net realizable value of other long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets, is reviewed when indicators of potential impairments are present. The net realizable value is based upon an assessment of the estimated future cash flows related to those assets, utilizing a methodology similar to that for goodwill. Additional considerations related to our long-lived assets include expected maintenance and improvements, changes in expected uses and ongoing operating performance and utilization. Due to uncertain market conditions and potential changes in strategy and product portfolio, it is possible that forecasts used to support asset carrying values may change in the future, which could result in non-cash charges that would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
