Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Company's consolidated financial statements and related notes. All references to years relate to fiscal years which ended on January 31 of the following calendar year. KEY STRATEGIES The Company's key strategies are: To enhance the customer experience through engaging service and store environments. To ensure a superior shopping experience, the Company employs highly qualified sales and customer service professionals, focuses on enhancing sales and product training programs, and is investing in enhancing its information systems for customer relationship management. The Company also focuses on enhancing the design of its stores, as well as the creative visual presentation of its merchandise, to provide an engaging luxury experience in both its new and existing stores. To regularly develop and introduce new products. The Company's product development strategy is to introduce new design collections, primarily in jewelry, and/or expand certain existing collections annually, both of which are intended to appeal to the Company existing customer base as well as to new customers. The Company is also investing in the watch category, which it deems appropriate for the Brand and which presents an incremental long-term growth opportunity. To enhance customer awareness of the TIFFANY & CO. trademark (the "Brand"), its heritage, its products and its association with quality and luxury. The Brand is the single most important asset of Tiffany and, indirectly, of the Company. Management intends to continue to invest in marketing and public relations programs designed to build awareness of the Brand, its heritage and its products, as well as to enhance the Brand association among consumers with quality and luxury. Management monitors these efforts and the strength of the Brand through market research. To expand and optimize its global distribution base. Management intends to continue to expand and optimize its global store base by evaluating potential markets for new TIFFANY & CO. stores, as well as through the renovation, relocation, or, in certain cases, the closure of existing stores. Management will also continue to pursue opportunities to grow sales through its e-commerce websites and utilize the websites to drive store traffic. Management recognizes that over-saturation of any market could diminish the distinctive appeal of the Brand, but believes that there are a number of potential worldwide locations remaining that meet financial and Brand requirements. To improve its business operations and processes, while efficiently managing its capital and costs The Company is focused on improving its business operations and processes, including by realizing greater efficiencies in its product supply chain and other operations, and enhancing its global procurement capabilities. To maintain substantial control over product supply through direct diamond sourcing and internal jewelry manufacturing. The Company has developed substantial product supply infrastructure related to the procurement and processing of diamonds and to the manufacturing of jewelry. This infrastructure is intended to ensure adequate product supply and favorable product costs while adhering to the Company's quality and ethical standards. The Company will continue to supplement its internal capabilities through its network of external suppliers. TIFFANY & CO. K- 27 Table of Contents Through the efforts above, management is committed to the following long-term financial objectives: To achieve improved operating margins, through both improved gross margin and efficient expense management. Management's long-term objective is to improve gross margin, including through controlling product input costs, realizing greater efficiencies in its product supply chain and adjusting retail prices when appropriate. Additionally, management is focused on efficient selling, general and administrative expense management, thereby generating sales leverage on fixed costs. These efforts are collectively intended to generate a higher rate of operating earnings growth relative to sales growth, and management targets an improvement in operating margin of 50 basis points per year over the long term. To increase store productivity and profitability. Management is focused on increasing the frequency of store visits and the percentage of store visitors who make a purchase, as well as optimal utilization of square footage, to grow sales and sales per square foot. To improve inventory and other asset productivity and cash flow. Management's long-term objective is to maintain inventory growth at a rate less than sales growth, with greater focus on efficiencies in product sourcing and manufacturing as well as optimizing store inventory levels, all of which is intended to contribute to improvements in cash flow and return on assets. To maintain a capital structure that provides financial strength and the ability to invest in strategic initiatives, while also allowing for the return of excess capital to shareholders. 2016 SUMMARY Worldwide net sales decreased 3% to $4.0 billion reflecting declines in the Americas and Europe partly offset by an increase in Japan and unchanged sales in Asia-Pacific, and comparable store sales decreased 5% due to declines in all regions except Japan. On a constant-exchange-rate basis (see "Non-GAAP Measures"), worldwide net sales decreased 3% and comparable store sales decreased 5% reflecting similar trends. The Company added a net of 6 TIFFANY & CO. stores (opening seven in Asia-Pacific, three in Europe and one in the Americas, while closing three in Asia-Pacific and one each in Japan and Europe and relocating 5 stores) resulting in a 3% net increase in gross retail square footage. The Company expanded its offerings within several existing jewelry collections, including its TIFFANY T and RETURN TO TIFFANY LOVE collections, and introduced new watch designs. Earnings from operations as a percentage of net sales ("operating margin") decreased 0.5 percentage point. Excluding impairment charges recorded in 2016 and 2015 (see "Non-GAAP Measures"), operating margin decreased 0.7 percentage point. An improvement in gross margin was more than offset by a lack of sales leverage on selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses. Net earnings decreased 4% to $446.1 million , or $3.55 per diluted share. Net earnings in 2016 included impairment charges of $0.19 per diluted share (see "Non-GAAP Measures") and an income tax benefit of $0.05 per diluted share (as a result of the conclusion of a tax examination). Net earnings in 2015 included charges of $0.24 per diluted share (see "Non-GAAP Measures"). Excluding these charges, net earnings per diluted share declined 2% to $3.75. Inventories, net decreased 3% . Cash flow from operating activities of $702.1 million in 2016 , compared with $813.6 million in 2015 . Free cash flow (see "Non-GAAP Measures") of $479.3 million in 2016 , compared with $560.9 million in 2015 . Cash flow from operating activities and free cash flow in 2016 include a voluntary cash contribution of TIFFANY & CO. K- 28 Table of Contents $120.0 million made by the Company to its U.S. pension plan (See "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note N. Employee Benefit Plans"). The Company returned cash to shareholders by continuing to pay regular quarterly dividends (which were increased 12.5% effective July 2016 to $0.45 per share, or an annualized rate of $1.80 per share) and spending $183.6 million to repurchase 2.8 million shares of its Common Stock. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Non-GAAP Measures The Company reports information in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP"). Internally, management also monitors and measures its performance using certain sales and earnings measures that include or exclude amounts, or are subject to adjustments that have the effect of including or excluding amounts, from the most directly comparable GAAP measure ("non-GAAP financial measures"). The Company presents such non-GAAP financial measures in reporting its financial results to provide investors with useful supplemental information that will allow them to evaluate the Company's operating results using the same measures that management uses to monitor and measure its performance. The Company's management does not, nor does it suggest that investors should, consider non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures presented here may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures used by other companies. Net Sales . The Company's reported net sales reflect either a translation-related benefit from strengthening foreign currencies or a detriment from a strengthening U.S. dollar. Internally, management monitors and measures its sales performance on a non-GAAP basis that eliminates the positive or negative effects that result from translating sales made outside the U.S. into U.S. dollars ("constant-exchange-rate basis"). Sales on a constant-exchange-rate basis are calculated by taking the current year's sales in local currencies and translating them into U.S. dollars using the prior year's foreign exchange rates. Management believes this constant-exchange-rate basis provides a useful supplemental basis for the assessment of sales performance and of comparability between reporting periods. The following table reconciles the sales percentage increases (decreases) from the GAAP to the non-GAAP basis versus the previous year: 2016 2015 GAAP Reported Translation Effect Constant- Exchange- Rate Basis GAAP Reported Translation Effect Constant- Exchange- Rate Basis Net Sales: Worldwide (3 )% % (3 )% (3 )% (5 )% 2 % Americas (5 ) (5 ) (4 ) (2 ) (2 ) Asia-Pacific (1 ) 1 (2 ) (5 ) 3 Japan 12 12 (2 ) (12 ) 10 Europe (10 ) (7 ) (3 ) (1 ) (13 ) 12 Other (8 ) (8 ) (13 ) (13 ) Comparable Store Sales: Worldwide (5 )% % (5 )% (6 )% (6 )% % Americas (6 ) (1 ) (5 ) (6 ) (2 ) (4 ) Asia-Pacific (9 ) (2 ) (7 ) (5 ) (5 ) Japan 16 11 5 (7 ) (12 ) 5 Europe (14 ) (5 ) (9 ) (5 ) (14 ) 9 Other (15 ) (15 ) (15 ) (15 ) TIFFANY & CO. K- 29 Table of Contents Statements of Earnings. Internally, management monitors and measures its earnings performance excluding certain items listed below. Management believes excluding such items provides a useful supplemental basis for the assessment of the Company's results relative to the corresponding period in the prior year. The following tables reconcile certain GAAP amounts to non-GAAP amounts: (in millions, except per share amounts) GAAP Impairment charges a Non-GAAP Year Ended January 31, 2017 SG&A expenses $ 1,769.1 $ (38.0 ) $ 1,731.1 As a % of sales 44.2 % 43.3 % Earnings from operations 721.2 38.0 759.2 As a % of sales 18.0 % 19.0 % Provision for income taxes b 230.5 14.0 244.5 Net earnings 446.1 24.0 470.1 Diluted earnings per share* 3.55 0.19 3.75 *Amounts may not add due to rounding. a Expenses associated with the following: $25.4 million of net pre-tax expense ($16.0 million net after tax expense, or $0.13 per diluted share) associated with an asset impairment charge related to software costs capitalized in connection with the development of a new finished goods inventory management and merchandising information system (see "Information Systems Assessment"); and $12.6 million of net pre-tax expense ($8.0 million net after tax expense, or $0.06 per diluted share) associated with impairment charges related to financing arrangements with diamond mining and exploration companies (see "Financing Arrangements with Diamond Mining and Exploration Companies"). b The income tax effect resulting from the adjustments has been calculated as both current and deferred tax benefit (expense), based upon the tax laws and statutory income tax rates applicable in the tax jurisdiction(s) of the underlying adjustment.

Free Cash Flow. Internally, management monitors its cash flow on a non-GAAP basis. Free cash flow is calculated by deducting capital expenditures from net cash provided by operating activities. The ability to generate free cash flow demonstrates how much cash the Company has available for discretionary and non-discretionary purposes after deduction of capital expenditures. The Company's operations require regular capital expenditures for the opening, renovation and expansion of stores and distribution and manufacturing facilities as well as ongoing investments in information technology. Management believes this provides a useful supplemental basis for assessing the Company's operating cash flows. The following table reconciles GAAP net cash provided by operating activities to non-GAAP free cash flow: Years Ended January 31, ( in millions) 2017 2016 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 702.1 $ 813.6 Less: Capital expenditures (222.8 ) (252.7 ) Free cash flow a $ 479.3 $ 560.9 a Free cash flow in 2016 reflects a voluntary cash contribution of $120.0 million made by the Company to its U.S. pension plan (See "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note N. Employee Benefit Plans"). Comparable Store Sales Comparable store sales include only sales transacted in Company-operated stores open for more than 12 months. Sales for relocated stores are included in comparable store sales if the relocation occurs within the same geographical market. Sales for a new store are not included in comparable store sales if that store was relocated from one department store to another or from a department store to a free-standing location. In all markets, the results of a store in which the square footage has been expanded or reduced remain in the comparable store base. TIFFANY & CO. K- 31 Table of Contents Net Sales The Company generates sales through its retail, Internet, wholesale, business-to-business and catalog channels (see "Item 1. Business - Financial Information about Reportable Segments"). Net sales by segment were as follows: (in millions) 2016 2015 2014 2016 vs 2015 % Change 2015 vs 2014 % Change Americas a $ 1,841.9 $ 1,947.0 $ 2,033.5 (5 )% (4 )% Asia-Pacific b 999.1 1,003.1 1,025.2 (2 ) Japan c 604.4 541.3 554.3 12 (2 ) Europe d 457.6 505.7 513.3 (10 ) (1 ) Other 98.8 107.8 123.6 (8 ) (13 ) $ 4,001.8 $ 4,104.9 $ 4,249.9 (3 )% (3 )% a) Represented 46% of worldwide net sales in 2016 , 47% in 2015 and 48% in 2014 , while sales in the U.S. represented 88% of net sales in the Americas in those periods. Total sales in the Company's New York Flagship store represented less than 10% of worldwide net sales in 2016, 2015 and 2014. b) Represented 25% of worldwide net sales in 2016 and 24% in 2015 and 2014 , while sales in Greater China represented more than half of Asia-Pacific's net sales in those periods. c) Represented 15% of worldwide net sales in 2016 and 13% in 2015 and 2014 . d) Represented 11% of worldwide net sales in 2016 and 12% in 2015 and 2014 , while sales in the United Kingdom ("U.K.") represented approximately 40% of European net sales in those periods. Net Sales 2016 compared with 2015 . In 2016 , worldwide net sales decreased $103.1 million , or 3% , reflecting declines in the Americas and Europe, an increase in Japan and unchanged sales in Asia-Pacific. There was no significant impact from foreign currency translation on worldwide net sales. In 2016, jewelry sales represented 92% of worldwide net sales. Changes in jewelry sales by product category relative to the prior year were as follows: (in millions) $ Change % Change High, fine & solitaire jewelry $ (75.0 ) (9 )% Engagement jewelry & wedding bands (20.2 ) (2 ) Fashion jewelry (11.8 ) (1 ) Designer jewelry 4.2 1 The decrease in sales of high, fine & solitaire jewelry reflected declines across the category, while the engagement jewelry & wedding bands category decreased due to a shift in sales mix towards wedding bands. The fashion jewelry category decreased as declines in silver jewelry, although at a smaller rate than in prior year, more than offset increases in gold jewelry. Items bearing the name of and attributed to one of the Company's "named" designers: Elsa Peretti and Paloma Picasso, which were previously reported across the high, fine & solitaire jewelry, engagement jewelry & wedding bands and fashion jewelry categories, have been reclassified into a designer jewelry category to conform with management's current internal analysis of product sales. Additionally, certain reclassifications within the jewelry categories have been made to the prior years' amounts to conform to the current year category presentation. TIFFANY & CO. K- 32 Table of Contents Changes in net sales by reportable segment were as follows: (in millions) Comparable Store Sales Non-comparable Store Sales Wholesale/Other Total Americas $ (96.1 ) $ 2.3 $ (11.3 ) $ (105.1 ) Asia-Pacific (80.1 ) 59.8 16.3 (4.0 ) Japan 78.8 (1.3 ) (14.4 ) 63.1 Europe (59.7 ) 13.1 (1.5 ) (48.1 ) In 2016, jewelry sales represented 90%, 98%, 93% and 96% of total sales in the Americas, Asia-Pacific, Japan and Europe, respectively. Changes in jewelry sales relative to the prior year were as follows: Average Price per Unit Sold As Reported Impact of Currency Translation Number of Units Sold Change in Jewelry Sales Americas 1 % % (6 )% Asia-Pacific (5 )% (2 )% 4 % Japan (2 )% 11 % 13 % Europe (1 )% (6 )% (9 )% Americas . In 2016 , total sales decreased $105.1 million , or 5% , which management attributed to lower sales to U.S. customers and foreign tourist spending (primarily Chinese tourists). Comparable store sales decreased $96.1 million , or 6% . On a constant-exchange-rate basis, both total sales and comparable store sales decreased 5% . The decrease in the number of jewelry units sold reflected declines across most categories, particularly in fashion silver jewelry. Asia-Pacific. In 2016 , total sales were approximately equal to the prior year, decreasing $4.0 million , partly reflecting new stores and increased wholesale sales; comparable store sales decreased $80.1 million , or 9% . Management attributed performance in this region to increased purchasing by local customers and declines in spending by foreign tourists. In addition, sales growth in China, increased wholesale sales in Korea, a decelerating rate of retail sales declines in Hong Kong and varying performance in other countries. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, total sales increased 1% and comparable store sales decreased 7% . The increase in the number of jewelry units sold reflected increases in fashion jewelry, particularly in silver jewelry, and wedding bands within the engagement category. Management attributed the decrease in the average price per jewelry unit sold to a shift in mix away from high, fine & solitaire jewelry to fashion jewelry and within the engagement jewelry & wedding bands category toward wedding bands. Japan. In 2016 , total sales increased $63.1 million , or 12% , and comparable store sales increased $78.8 million , or 16% . On a constant-exchange-rate basis, total sales were in line with prior year and comparable store sales increased 5% . Management attributed this performance to higher spending by local customers and lower spending by Chinese tourists, as well as lower wholesale sales. The increase in number of jewelry units sold primarily reflected increases in the fashion jewelry, designer jewelry and the engagement jewelry & wedding bands categories. Management attributed the decrease in the average price per jewelry unit sold to a shift away from the high, fine & solitaire jewelry category to designer jewelry, as well as a shift in sales mix within the fashion jewelry category towards silver jewelry. Europe. In 2016 , total sales decreased $48.1 million , or 10% , and comparable store sales decreased $59.7 million , or 14% , which management attributed to lower spending by foreign tourists and local customers across continental Europe. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, total sales decreased 3% and comparable store sales decreased 9% , as TIFFANY & CO. K- 33 Table of Contents softness across continental Europe was partially offset by sales increases in the U.K. (particularly in the second half of the year, largely attributable to foreign tourist spending). The decrease in the number of jewelry units sold reflected decreases across all categories, especially in fashion silver jewelry. Management attributed the decrease in average price per unit sold to the negative effect of currency translation, which offset a favorable shift toward higher-priced products within the engagement jewelry & wedding bands category. Other. In 2016 , total sales decreased $9.0 million , or 8% , partly due to a $16.9 million, or 22%, sales decline in the Emerging Markets region partly offset by an increase in wholesale sales of diamonds. Net Sales 2015 compared with 2014 . In 2015 , worldwide net sales decreased $145.0 million , or 3% , due to lower sales in all regions. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus other currencies had the translation effect of reducing worldwide net sales growth by 5%, with net sales on a constant-exchange-rate basis increasing 2% (due to growth in Europe, Japan and Asia-Pacific, while sales in the Americas decreased modestly from the prior year). In 2015, jewelry sales represented 93% of worldwide net sales. Changes in jewelry sales by product category were as follows: (in millions) $ Change % Change High, fine & solitaire jewelry $ (16.3 ) (2 )% Engagement jewelry & wedding bands (78.8 ) (6 ) Fashion jewelry (16.9 ) (1 ) Designer jewelry (20.7 ) (4 ) The decrease in the high, fine & solitaire jewelry category reflected lower sales of fine jewelry partly offset by increased high jewelry sales. The decrease in the engagement jewelry & wedding bands category reflected decreases in both solitaire diamond rings and wedding bands. The decrease in the fashion jewelry category reflected a decline in sales of entry-level price point jewelry, largely in silver, partly offset by growth in gold jewelry sales. The decrease in designer jewelry primarily reflected decreases in gold and silver jewelry. Items bearing the name of and attributed to one of the Company's "named" designers: Elsa Peretti and Paloma Picasso, which were previously reported across the high, fine & solitaire jewelry, engagement jewelry & wedding bands and fashion jewelry categories, have been reclassified into the designer jewelry category to conform with management's current internal analysis of product sales. Additionally, certain reclassifications within the jewelry categories have been made to the prior years' amounts to conform to the current year category presentation.

Management attributed the decrease in total sales and comparable store sales to lower foreign tourist spending in the U.S. (which management believes was the result of a strong U.S. dollar) as well as to lower sales to U.S. customers. The strong sales growth in Canada and Latin America was more than offset by currency translation. The decrease in the number of jewelry units sold reflected decreases across most categories, especially in entry-level price point silver jewelry. Management attributed the increase in the average price per jewelry unit sold to price increases and a shift in sales mix toward higher-priced products within the fashion jewelry category and toward high jewelry. Asia-Pacific. In 2015 , total sales decreased $22.1 million , or 2% , and comparable store sales decreased $46.0 million, or 5%, while on a constant-exchange-rate basis, total sales increased 3% and comparable store sales were unchanged. Sales rose in China and declined in Hong Kong; overall sales results were negatively affected by currency translation. The decrease in the number of jewelry units sold primarily reflected declines in entry-level price point silver jewelry. Management attributed the increase in the average price per jewelry unit sold to price increases and a shift in sales mix toward higher-priced products within the fashion jewelry category and toward high jewelry. Japan. In 2015 , total sales decreased $13.0 million , or 2% , and comparable store sales declined $36.4 million , or 7% , while on a constant-exchange-rate basis, total sales increased 10% and comparable store sales increased 5% . Management attributed the decrease in sales to currency translation, which offset higher spending by foreign tourists. Management attributed the decrease in average price per unit sold to currency translation, which offset the favorable effect of price increases and a shift in sales mix toward higher-priced products. Europe. In 2015 , total sales decreased $7.6 million , or 1% , and comparable store sales declined $24.0 million , or 5% , while on a constant-exchange-rate basis, total sales increased 12% and comparable store sales increased 9% . Growth across the region, which management attributed to higher spending by foreign tourists and, to a lesser extent, higher sales to local customers was entirely offset by currency translation. The decrease in the number of jewelry units sold was attributed to soft demand for silver jewelry. Management attributed the increase in average price per jewelry unit sold to price increases and a shift in sales mix toward higher-priced products, entirely offset by currency translation. Other. In 2015 , total sales decreased $15.8 million , or 13% , partly due to a $9.2 million, or 11%, sales decline in the Emerging Markets region that largely reflected lower comparable store sales. The remainder of the decrease was related to lower wholesale sales of diamonds. Store Data . In 2016 , the Company increased gross retail square footage by 3%, net, through store openings, closings and relocations. The Company opened 11 stores and closed five: opening seven in Asia-Pacific (three in China, two TIFFANY & CO. K- 35 Table of Contents in Australia and one each in Korea and New Zealand), three in Europe (two in Italy and one in the Netherlands) and one in the Americas (in Canada) while closing three stores in Asia-Pacific (two in China and one in Singapore) and one each in Japan and Europe (in Germany). In addition, the Company relocated five existing stores. In 2015 , the Company increased gross retail square footage by 4%, net, through store openings, closings and relocations. The Company opened 16 stores and closed four: opening three in the Americas (in the U.S., Canada and Chile), 11 in Asia-Pacific (five in China, two in Macau and one each in Korea, Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand) and two in Europe (in Spain and Switzerland) while closing one store in the Americas and three stores in Asia-Pacific. In addition, the Company relocated nine existing stores. Sales per gross square foot generated by all company-operated stores were approximately $2,700 in 2016 , $2,900 in 2015 and $3,100 in 2014 . The declines in 2016 and 2015 reflected the effects of decreased sales (which in 2015 were negatively affected by currency translation) and growth in retail square footage. Gross Margin (in millions) 2016 2015 2014 Gross profit $ 2,490.3 $ 2,491.3 $ 2,537.2 Gross profit as a percentage of net sales 62.2 % 60.7 % 59.7 % Gross margin (gross profit as a percentage of net sales) increased 1.5 percentage points in 2016 reflecting favorable product input costs and the effect of price increases, and, to a lesser extent, favorable changes in product sales mix. Gross margin increased 1.0 percentage point in 2015 reflecting favorable product input costs that were partly offset by a shift in sales mix to higher-priced, lower-margin products. In addition, the benefit from retail price increases was partly offset by the negative effect from the strong U.S. dollar. Management periodically reviews and adjusts its retail prices when appropriate to address product input cost increases, specific market conditions and changes in foreign currencies/U.S. dollar relationships. Its long-term strategy is to continue that approach, although significant increases in product input costs or weakening foreign currencies can affect gross margin negatively over the short-term until management makes necessary price adjustments. Among the market conditions that management considers are consumer demand for the product category involved, which may be influenced by consumer confidence, and competitive pricing conditions. Management uses derivative instruments to mitigate certain foreign exchange and precious metal price exposures (see "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note H. Hedging Instruments"). Management increased retail prices in both 2016 and 2015 across most geographic regions and product categories, some of which were intended to mitigate foreign currency fluctuations. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses (in millions) 2016 2015 2014 As reported: SG&A expenses $ 1,769.1 $ 1,731.2 $ 1,645.8 SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales 44.2 % 42.2 % 38.7 % Excluding items in "Non-GAAP Measures": SG&A expenses $ 1,731.1 $ 1,684.5 $ 1,645.8 SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales 43.3 % 41.0 % 38.7 % SG&A expenses increased $37.9 million , or 2% , in 2016 and $85.4 million, or 5%, in 2015. SG&A expenses in 2016 included various impairment charges and, in 2015, included loan impairment charges and certain expenses associated with specific cost-reduction initiatives. See "Non-GAAP Measures" for further details. SG&A expenses in 2016 (excluding the 2016 and 2015 items noted in "Non-GAAP Measures") increased $46.6 million, or 3%, largely reflecting increased store occupancy and depreciation expenses and labor and incentive compensation costs. There was no significant effect on SG&A expense changes from foreign currency translation. TIFFANY & CO. K- 36 Table of Contents SG&A expenses in 2015 (excluding the 2015 items noted in "Non-GAAP Measures") increased $38.7 million, or 2%, largely reflecting increased marketing expenses and store occupancy and depreciation expenses partly offset by decreased labor costs (primarily lower variable labor costs for incentive compensation and sales commissions partly offset by increased costs for U.S. pension and postretirement benefit plans). The strengthening of the U.S. dollar had the effect of decreasing SG&A expense growth by 4%. The Company's SG&A expenses are largely fixed in nature. Variable costs (which include items such as variable store rent, sales commissions and fees paid to credit card companies) typically represent approximately 15 - 20% of total SG&A expenses. Earnings from Operations (dollars in millions) 2016 2015 2014 As reported: Earnings from operations $ 721.2 $ 760.1 $ 891.4 Operating margin 18.0 % 18.5 % 21.0 % Percentage point change from prior year (0.5 ) (2.5 ) 13.5 Excluding other operating expenses: Earnings from operations $ 759.2 $ 806.8 $ 891.4 Operating margin 19.0 % 19.7 % 21.0 % Percentage point change from prior year (0.7 ) (1.3 ) 1.3 The declines in both 2016 and 2015 resulted from sales deleveraging of SG&A expenses, which were only partly offset by higher gross margins.

On a segment basis, the ratio of earnings from operations to each segment's net sales in 2016 compared with 2015 was as follows: Americas the ratio increased 0.2 percentage point due to an improvement in gross margin, largely offset by a lack of sales leverage on operating expenses resulting from a decrease in net sales; TIFFANY & CO. K- 37 Table of Contents Asia-Pacific the ratio decreased 0.8 percentage point due to a lack of sales leverage on operating expenses, primarily attributable to new store-related expenses, partly offset by an improvement in gross margin; Japan the ratio decreased 3.0 percentage points primarily due to a decrease in gross margin that reflected an unfavorable impact tied to the strengthening of the Yen on the Company's program to utilize Yen forward contracts for a portion of its forecasted merchandise purchases; and Europe the ratio decreased 1.5 percentage points due to a decrease in net sales resulting in a lack of sales leverage on operating expenses, partly offset by an improvement in gross margin. On a segment basis, the ratio of earnings from operations to each segment's net sales in 2015 compared with 2014 was as follows: Americas the ratio decreased 1.3 percentage points due to a decrease in net sales resulting in sales deleveraging of operating expenses, partly offset by an improvement in gross margin; Asia-Pacific the ratio decreased 1.1 percentage points due to increased store-related operating expenses and marketing spending, partly offset by an improvement in gross margin; Japan the ratio increased 1.5 percentage points due to leveraging of operating expenses (as operating expenses decreased at a higher rate than sales), partly offset by a decrease in gross margin attributable to currency translation; and Europe the ratio decreased 2.2 percentage points resulting from increased store-related operating expenses and marketing spending, partly offset by an improvement in gross margin. Unallocated corporate expenses include costs related to administrative support functions which the Company does not allocate to its segments. Such unallocated costs include those for centralized information technology, finance, legal and human resources departments. Unallocated corporate expenses increased by $9.8 million in 2016 and$15.0 million in 2015, primarily due to increased costs, including depreciation and amortization expense, associated with upgrades to the Company's information technology systems as well as increased incentive compensation expense in 2016. Included in other operating expenses in the table above, the 2016 amount represented $25.4 million associated with an impairment charge related to software costs capitalized in connection with the development of a new finished goods inventory management and merchandising information system (see "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note B. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note E. Property, Plant and Equipment") and $12.6 million associated with impairment charges related to financing arrangements with diamond mining and exploration companies (see "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note B. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies"). Included in other operating expenses in the table above, the 2015 amount represented $37.9 million associated with impairment charges related to a financing arrangement with Koidu Limited and $8.8 million of expenses associated with specific cost-reduction initiatives. See "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note J. Commitments and Contingencies." Interest Expense and Financing Costs Interest expense and financing costs decreased $3.0 million , or 6%, in 2016 due to lower interest expense. Interest expense and financing costs decreased $13.9 million, or 22%, in 2015 as a result of lower interest expense on long-term debt (reflecting the October 2014 redemption of long-term debt using proceeds from the issuance of lower-rate long-term debt in September 2014) as well as lower average credit facility borrowings. Other (Income) Expense, Net Other (income) expense, net includes interest income as well as gains/losses on investment activities and foreign currency transactions. Net income of $1.4 million in 2016 compared with net expense of $1.2 million in 2015. The $2.6 million change was primarily due to reduced foreign currency transaction losses. Net expense of $1.2 TIFFANY & CO. K- 38 Table of Contents million in 2015 compared with net income of $2.8 million in 2014. The $4.0 million change was primarily due to foreign currency transaction losses. Loss on Extinguishment of Debt In 2014, the Company recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $93.8 million associated with the redemption of all of the aggregate principal amount outstanding of the Company's (i) $100.0 million principal amount of 9.05% Series A Senior Notes due December 23, 2015; (ii) $125.0 million principal amount of 10.0% Series A-2009 Senior Notes due February 13, 2017; (iii) $50.0 million principal amount of 10.0% Series A Senior Notes due April 9, 2018; and (iv) $125.0 million principal amount of 10.0% Series B-2009 Senior Notes due February 13, 2019 (collectively, the "Private Placement Notes") prior to maturity in accordance with the respective note purchase agreements governing each series of Private Placement Notes, which included provisions for make-whole payments in the event of early repayment. Provision for Income Taxes The effective income tax rate was 34.1% in 2016 compared with 34.7% in 2015 and 34.4% in 2014 . The effective income tax rate in 2016 was reduced by 1.0 percentage point due to an income tax benefit of $6.6 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, resulting from the conclusion of a tax examination during the first quarter of 2016. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The Company's liquidity needs have been, and are expected to remain, primarily a function of its ongoing, seasonal and expansion-related working capital requirements and capital expenditure needs. Over the long term, the Company manages its cash and capital structure to maintain a strong financial position that provides flexibility to pursue strategic initiatives. Management regularly assesses its working capital needs, capital expenditure requirements, debt service, dividend payouts, share repurchases and future investments. Management believes that cash on hand, internally generated cash flows, the funds available under its revolving credit facilities and the ability to access the debt and capital markets are sufficient to support the Company's liquidity and capital requirements for the foreseeable future. As of January 31, 2017 , the Company cash and cash equivalents totaled $928.0 million , of which approximately one-third was held in locations outside the U.S. where the Company has the intention to indefinitely reinvest any undistributed earnings to support its continued expansion and investments outside of the U.S. Such cash balances are not available to fund U.S. cash requirements unless the Company were to decide to repatriate such funds and incur applicable income tax charges. The Company has sufficient sources of cash in the U.S. to fund its U.S. operations without the need to repatriate any of those funds held outside the U.S. The following table summarizes cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities: (in millions) 2016 2015 2014 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 702.1 $ 813.6 $ 615.1 Investing activities (236.8 ) (278.2 ) (217.0 ) Financing activities (382.8 ) (422.3 ) (23.4 ) Effect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents 1.9 0.5 9.5 Net increase in cash and cash equivalents $ 84.4 $ 113.6 $ 384.2 Operating Activities The Company had net cash inflows from operating activities of $702.1 million in 2016 , $813.6 million in 2015 and $615.1 million in 2014 . The decrease from 2015 to 2016 was primarily due to a $120.0 million voluntary contribution made by the Company to its U.S. pension plan in 2016. The year-over-year improvement from 2014 to 2015 was primarily due to reduced inventory purchases. TIFFANY & CO. K- 39 Table of Contents Working Capital. Working capital (current assets less current liabilities) increased to $2.9 billion at January 31, 2017 from $2.8 billion at January 31, 2016 . The increase was primarily due to the repayment of the 10.0 billion ($88.0 million) Senior Notes due in September 2016 (which had been classified as Current portion of long-term debt) and the issuance of the 10.0 billion Senior Notes due in August 2026 (which is classified as Long-term debt). See "Financing Activities" below for additional information. Accounts receivable, less allowances at January 31, 2017 were 10% higher than at January 31, 2016 largely attributable to sales growth in Japan and the timing of collections from department stores. Currency translation had the effect of increasing accounts receivable, less allowances by 2% from January 31, 2016 , primarily from the strengthening of the Japanese yen. On a 12-month rolling basis, accounts receivable turnover was 18 times in 2016 and 21 times in 2015 . Inventories, net at January 31, 2017 were 3% lower than at January 31, 2016 , which reflected similar declines in both finished goods inventories and combined raw material and work-in-process inventories. Currency translation did not have a significant effect on the change in inventories, net. Investing Activities The Company had net cash outflows from investing activities of $236.8 million in 2016 , $278.2 million in 2015 and $217.0 million in 2014 . The decrease in net cash outflows in 2016 was driven by decreased capital expenditures as well as reduced net purchases of marketable securities and short-term investments. The increased outflow in 2015 was primarily due to increased purchases of marketable securities and short-term investments. Marketable Securities and Short-Term Investments. The Company invests a portion of its cash in marketable securities and short-term investments. The Company had net purchases of $15.7 million during 2016 and $26.4 million during 2015 compared with net proceeds received from the sale of marketable securities and short-term investments of $15.2 million during 2014. Capital Expenditures. Capital expenditures are typically related to the opening, renovation and/or relocation of stores (which represented approximately 60% of capital expenditures in 2016 and approximately half in 2015 and 2014 ) as well as distribution and manufacturing facilities and ongoing investments in information technology. Capital expenditures were $222.8 million in 2016 , $252.7 million in 2015 and $247.4 million in 2014 , representing 6% of worldwide net sales in those years. Proceeds from Notes Receivable Funded. In 2016 and 2014, the Company received $1.7 million and $15.2 million of repayments associated with loans extended to diamond mining and exploration companies. No such proceeds were received in 2015. Financing Activities The Company had net cash outflows from financing activities of $382.8 million in 2016 , $422.3 million in 2015 and $23.4 million in 2014 . Year-over-year changes in cash flows from financing activities were largely driven by share repurchases and borrowings. TIFFANY & CO. K- 40 Table of Contents Recent Borrowings. The Company had net proceeds from (repayments of) short-term and long-term borrowings as follows: (in millions) 2016 2015 2014 Short-term borrowings: Proceeds from (repayments of) credit facility borrowings, net $ 14.2 $ (11.3 ) $ (12.5 ) Proceeds from other credit facility borrowings 76.8 24.8 19.8 Repayments of other credit facility borrowings (83.1 ) (16.0 ) (3.4 ) Net proceeds from (repayments of) short-term borrowings 7.9 (2.5 ) 3.9 Long-term borrowings: Proceeds from issuances 98.1 548.0 Repayments (97.1 ) (400.0 ) Net proceeds from long-term borrowings 1.0 148.0 Net proceeds from (repayments of) total borrowings 8.9 (2.5 ) 151.9 Payments of debt extinguishment costs (included in operating activities) (93.4 ) Net proceeds (repayments) $ 8.9 $ (2.5 ) $ 58.5 Credit Facilities. In 2014, the Registrant entered into a four-year $375.0 million and a five-year $375.0 million multi-bank, multi-currency, committed unsecured revolving credit facility, including letter of credit subfacilities (collectively, the "Credit Facilities"), resulting in a total borrowing capacity of $750.0 million. In October 2016, the maturity for each of the Credit Facilities was extended for one additional year pursuant to the terms set forth in the respective agreements governing the Credit Facilities. Therefore, the four-year and five-year Credit Facilities will mature in October of 2019 and 2020, respectively. See "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note G. Debt" for additional information. Other Credit Facilities. In 2016, the Registrant's wholly owned subsidiary, Tiffany & Co. (Shanghai) Commercial Company Limited ("Tiffany-Shanghai"), entered into a three-year multi-bank revolving credit agreement (the "Tiffany-Shanghai Credit Agreement"). The Tiffany-Shanghai Credit Agreement has an aggregate borrowing limit of RMB 990.0 million ( $143.8 million at January 31, 2017 ). The Tiffany-Shanghai Credit Agreement, which matures in July 2019, was made available to refinance amounts outstanding under Tiffany-Shanghai's previously existing RMB 930.0 million three-year multi-bank revolving credit agreement (the "2013 Agreement"), which expired pursuant to its terms in July 2016, as well as for Tiffany-Shanghai's general working capital requirements. See "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note G. Debt" for additional information. Under all of the Company's credit facilities, at January 31, 2017 , there were $228.7 million of borrowings outstanding, $4.0 million of letters of credit issued but not outstanding and $798.4 million available for borrowing. At January 31, 2016 , there were $221.6 million of borrowings outstanding, $5.6 million of letters of credit issued but not outstanding and $790.8 million available for borrowing. The weighted-average interest rate for borrowings outstanding was 2.71% at January 31, 2017 and 2.90% at January 31, 2016 . Senior Notes. In 2014, the Registrant issued $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.80% Senior Notes due 2024 (the "2024 Notes") and $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.90% Senior Notes due 2044 (the "2044 Notes" and, together with the 2024 Notes, the "Senior Notes"). The Senior Notes were issued at a discount with aggregate net proceeds of $548.0 million (with an effective yield of 3.836% for the 2024 Notes and an effective yield of 4.926% for the 2044 Notes). The Registrant used the net proceeds from the issuance of the Senior Notes to redeem $400.0 million in aggregate principal amount of long-term debt prior to their scheduled maturities which ranged from 2015 to 2019 and paid $93.4 million of debt extinguishment costs associated with the redemption. The Company used the remaining net proceeds from the sale of the Senior Notes for general corporate purposes. See "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note G. Debt" for additional information. TIFFANY & CO. K- 41 Table of Contents In August 2016, the Registrant issued 10.0 billion ( $88.0 million at January 31, 2017 ) of 0.78% Senior Notes due August 2026 (the "Yen Notes") in a private transaction. The Yen Notes bear interest at a rate of 0.78% per annum, payable semi-annually on February 26 and August 26 of each year, commencing February 26, 2017. The proceeds from the issuance of the Yen Notes were used to repay the Registrant's 10.0 billion 1.72% Senior Notes due September 2016 upon the maturity thereof. See "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note G. Debt" for additional information. The ratio of total debt (short-term borrowings, current portion of long-term debt and long-term debt) to stockholders' equity was 37% at both January 31, 2017 and 2016 . At January 31, 2017 , the Company was in compliance with all debt covenants. Share Repurchases. In March 2014, the Company's Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program ("2014 Program") which authorized the Company to repurchase up to $300.0 million of its Common Stock through open market transactions. The program had an expiration date of March 31, 2017, but was terminated in January 2016 in connection with the authorization of a new program with increased repurchase capacity (as described in more detail below). Approximately $58.6 million remained available for repurchase under the 2014 Program at the time of its termination. In January 2016, the Company's Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase program ("2016 Program") which authorizes the Company to repurchase up to $500.0 million of its Common Stock through open market transactions, block trades or privately negotiated transactions and terminated the 2014 Program. Purchases under the 2014 Program were, and purchases under the 2016 Program have been, executed under a written plan for trading securities as specified under Rule 10b5-1 promulgated under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the terms of which are within the Company's discretion, subject to applicable securities laws, and are based on market conditions and the Company's liquidity needs. The 2016 Program will expire on January 31, 2019. Approximately $310.4 million remained available for repurchase under the 2016 Program at January 31, 2017 . The Company's share repurchase activity was as follows: (in millions, except per share amounts) 2016 2015 2014 Cost of repurchases $ 183.6 $ 220.4 $ 27.0 Shares repurchased and retired 2.8 2.8 0.3 Average cost per share $ 65.24 $ 78.40 $ 89.91 Dividends. The cash dividend on the Company's Common Stock was increased once in each of 2016 , 2015 and 2014 . The Company's Board of Directors declared quarterly dividends which totaled $1.75, $1.58 and $1.48 per common share in 2016 , 2015 and 2014 with cash dividends paid of $218.8 million , $203.4 million and $191.2 million in those respective years. The dividend payout ratio (dividends as a percentage of net earnings) was 49% , 44% and 39% in 2016 , 2015 and 2014 . Dividends as a percentage of adjusted net earnings (see "Non-GAAP Measures") were 47% in 2016, 41% in 2015 and 35% in 2014. At least annually, the Company's Board of Directors reviews its policies with respect to dividends and share repurchases with a view to actual and projected earnings, cash flows and capital requirements. Financing Arrangements with Diamond Mining and Exploration Companies The Company has provided financing to diamond mining and exploration companies in order to obtain rights to purchase the output from mines owned by these companies. At January 31, 2016, there was $43.8 million of principal outstanding under a financing arrangement (the "Loan") with Koidu Limited (previously Koidu Holdings S.A.) ("Koidu"), with a carrying amount, net of valuation allowance, of $5.9 million . The Loan, which was entered into between Koidu and Laurelton Diamonds, Inc. ("Laurelton"), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, in March 2011, originally provided that repayments of principal would begin in March 2013. However, in March 2013, the Company agreed to Koidu's request to defer the principal and interest payments due in 2013 to subsequent years and, in March 2014, the Company agreed to Koidu's request to provide for monthly rather than semi-annual payments of the principal payments due in 2014. The Company received such scheduled monthly payments from Koidu in 2014. On April 30, 2015, the Company also agreed to defer Koidu's principal payment due on March 30, TIFFANY & CO. K- 42 Table of Contents 2015 ("2015 Amendment"), subject to certain conditions set forth in the 2015 Amendment, which were met in June 2015. As of January 31, 2016, Koidu had not made any of its interest payments due in July 2015 and thereafter, nor its principal payment due in September 2015. The missed payments constitute events of default under the Loan. In February 2016, the Company received the results from two separate and independent reviews of Koidu's operational plans, forecasts, and cash flow projections for the mine, which were commissioned by the Company and by Koidu's largest creditor, respectively. Based on these factors, ongoing discussions with Koidu, and consideration of the possible actions that all parties, including the Government of Sierra Leone and Koidu's largest creditor, might take under the circumstances, management determined that it was probable that it would be unable to collect a portion of the amounts due under the contractual terms of the Loan, and recorded impairment charges, and a related valuation allowance, of $37.9 million in 2015. Additionally, the Company ceased accruing interest income on the outstanding Loan balance as of July 31, 2015. The carrying amount of the Company loan receivable from Koidu, net of the valuation allowance, was $5.9 million at January 31, 2016. Koidu did not make any payments due to the Company under the Loan in 2016. On March 17, 2017, the Company entered into an agreement with Koidu's largest creditor under which that creditor has agreed to purchase the Company's interest in the loan, on and effective March 22, 2017, for $1.7 million. Based on this agreement, the Company has recorded an additional impairment charge, and a related valuation allowance, of $4.2 million in 2016 to reduce the carrying amount of the Company loan receivable from Koidu, net of the valuation allowance, to $1.7 million at January 31, 2017. Additionally, on March 16, 2017, the Company and Koidu entered into an agreement to terminate the supply agreement between the parties, pursuant to which Laurelton had previously been required to purchase at fair market value certain diamonds recovered from Koidu's mine that met Laurelton's quality standards. See "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note B. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note J. Commitments and Contingencies" for additional information on this financing arrangement. The Company also recorded an impairment charge, and a related valuation allowance, of $8.4 million during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2017 related to a separate financing arrangement with another diamond mining and exploration company. Information Systems Assessment The Company is engaged in a multi-year program to evaluate and, where appropriate, upgrade and/or replace certain of its information systems. As part of this program, the Company identified opportunities to enhance its finished goods inventory management and merchandising capabilities, and began development efforts to replace certain of its existing systems and provide these enhanced capabilities. The Company recently completed an assessment of the replacement system under development to evaluate whether the continued development of this system would deliver sufficiently improved operating capabilities. Following the completion of this assessment, in the three months ended January 31, 2017, the Company concluded that the development of this system should be modified such that the finished goods inventory management and merchandising capabilities that were intended to be delivered utilizing this new system will instead be delivered through further development of the Company current Enterprise Resource Planning system and continued implementation of a new order management system. Accordingly, the Company has evaluated the costs capitalized for the development of the replacement system for impairment in accordance with its policy on the review of long-lived assets, and determined, based on specific identification of costs capitalized pertaining to the development of specific capabilities in the new system, that $25.4 million of such capitalized costs relate to software functionality which will not be utilized, and therefore will not have future benefit to the Company. As such, the Company recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $25.4 million as a component of Selling, General and Administrative expenses in the three months ended January 31, 2017. This multi-year program is ongoing and, as previously disclosed, may require significant capital expenditures and dedication of resources in both current and future periods, though management believes that the modified approach referenced above will ultimately result in a lower overall cost to the Company in delivering these capabilities. TIFFANY & CO. K- 43 Table of Contents Contractual Cash Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following is a summary of the Company's contractual cash obligations at January 31, 2017 : (in millions) Total 2017 2018-2019 2020-2021 Thereafter Unrecorded contractual obligations: Operating leases a $ 1,552.7 $ 286.2 $ 390.8 $ 317.5 $ 558.2 Inventory purchase obligations b 196.6 196.6 Interest on debt c 665.0 35.9 71.8 71.8 485.5 Other contractual obligations d 71.4 48.9 15.4 1.0 6.1 Recorded contractual obligations: Short-term borrowings 228.7 228.7 Long-term debt e 888.0 888.0 $ 3,602.4 $ 796.3 $ 478.0 $ 390.3 $ 1,937.8 a) Operating lease obligations do not include obligations for contingent rent, property taxes, insurance and maintenance that are required by most lease agreements. Contingent rent for the year ended January 31, 2017 totaled $32.4 million . See "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note J. Commitment and Contingencies" for a discussion of the Company operating leases. b) The Company will, from time to time, enter into arrangements to purchase rough diamonds that contain minimum purchase obligations. Inventory purchase obligations associated with these agreements have been estimated at approximately $60.0 million for 2017 and included in this table. Purchases beyond 2017 that are contingent upon mine production have been excluded as they cannot be reasonably estimated. c) Excludes interest payments on amounts outstanding under available lines of credit, as the outstanding amounts fluctuate based on the Company's working capital needs. d) Consists primarily of technology licensing and service contracts, fixed royalty commitments, construction-in-progress and packaging supplies. e) Amounts exclude any unamortized discount or premium. The summary above does not include the following items: Cash contributions to the Company's pension plan and cash payments for other postretirement obligations. The Company funds the Qualified Plan's trust in accordance with regulatory limits to provide for current service and for the unfunded benefit obligation over a reasonable period and for current service benefit accruals. To the extent that these requirements are fully covered by assets in the Qualified Plan, the Company may elect not to make any contribution in a particular year. No cash contribution was required in 2016, and none is required in 2017, to meet the minimum funding requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act ("ERISA"). However, the Company periodically evaluates whether to make discretionary cash contributions to the Qualified Plan and made a voluntary cash contribution of $120.0 million in 2016 but currently does not anticipate making such contributions in 2017. This expectation is subject to change based on management's assessment of a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, asset performance, interest rates and changes in actuarial assumptions. The Company estimates cash payments for postretirement health-care and life insurance benefit obligations to be $1.9 million in 2017 . Unrecognized tax benefits at January 31, 2017 of $3.4 million and accrued interest and penalties of $8.3 million . The final outcome of tax uncertainties is dependent upon various matters including tax examinations, interpretation of the applicable tax laws or expiration of statutes of limitations. The Company believes that its tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that it has adequately provided for these matters. However, the examinations may result in proposed assessments where the ultimate resolution may result in the Company owing additional taxes. At January 31, 2017 , approximately $1.0 million of total unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would affect the effective income tax rate. As of January 31, 2017, TIFFANY & CO. K- 44 Table of Contents unrecognized tax benefits are not expected to change materially in the next 12 months. Future developments may result in a change in this assessment.

In addition, the Company has other available letters of credit and financial guarantees of $76.1 million of which $26.4 million was outstanding at January 31, 2017 . Of those available letters of credit and financial guarantees, $57.5 million expires within one year. Seasonality As a jeweler and specialty retailer, the Company's business is seasonal in nature, with the fourth quarter typically representing approximately one-third of annual net sales and a higher percentage of annual net earnings. Management expects such seasonality to continue. Critical Accounting Estimates The Company's consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These principles require management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and related notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates and the differences could be material. Periodically, the Company reviews all significant estimates and assumptions affecting the financial statements and records any necessary adjustments. The development and selection of critical accounting estimates and the related disclosures below have been reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Directors. The following critical accounting policies that rely on assumptions and estimates were used in the preparation of the Company's consolidated financial statements: Inventory. The Company writes down its inventory for discontinued and slow-moving products. This write-down is equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and its estimated market value, and is based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write-downs might be required. The Company has not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish its reserve for discontinued and slow-moving products during the past three years. At January 31, 2017 , a 10% change in the reserve for discontinued and slow-moving products would have resulted in a change of $6.5 million in inventory and cost of sales. Property, plant and equipment and intangibles assets and key money . The Company reviews its property, plant and equipment and intangibles assets and key money for impairment when management determines that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable due to events or changes in circumstances. Recoverability of these assets is evaluated by comparing the carrying value of the asset with estimated future undiscounted cash flows. If the comparisons indicate that the value of the asset is not recoverable, an impairment loss is calculated as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the asset and the loss is recognized during that period. In 2016, the Company recorded an asset impairment charge of $25.4 million associated with software costs capitalized in connection with the development of a new finished goods inventory management and merchandising information system (see "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note B. Summary of Significant Accounting TIFFANY & CO. K- 45 Table of Contents Policies and Note E. Property, Plant and Equipment" for additional information). The Company did not record any material impairment charges in 2015 or 2014 . Goodwill . The Company performs its annual impairment evaluation of goodwill during the fourth quarter of its fiscal year or when circumstances otherwise indicate an evaluation should be performed. A qualitative assessment is first performed for each reporting unit to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If it is concluded that this is the case, an evaluation, based upon discounted cash flows, is performed and requires management to estimate future cash flows, growth rates and economic and market conditions. The 2016 , 2015 and 2014 evaluations resulted in no impairment charges. Notes receivable and other financing arrangements. The Company has provided financing to diamond mining and exploration companies in order to obtain rights to purchase the mine's output. Management evaluates these financing arrangements for potential impairment by reviewing the parties' financial statements and projections along with business, operational and other economic factors on a periodic basis. If the analyses indicate that the financing receivable is not recoverable, an impairment loss is recognized, in respect to all or a portion of the financing, during that period. In 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded impairment charges totaling $12.6 million and $37.9 million, respectively (see "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note B. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note J. Commitments and Contingencies" for additional information). The Company did not record any material impairment charges in 2014 . Income taxes . The Company is subject to income taxes in U.S. federal and state, as well as foreign jurisdictions. The calculation of the Company's tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across the Company's global operations. Significant judgments and estimates are required in determining consolidated income tax expense. The Company's income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for uncertain tax positions reflect management's best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid. Foreign and domestic tax authorities periodically audit the Company's income tax returns. These audits often examine and test the factual and legal basis for positions the Company has taken in its tax filings with respect to its tax liabilities, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions ("tax filing positions"). Management believes that its tax filing positions are reasonable and legally supportable. However, in specific cases, various tax authorities may take a contrary position. In evaluating the exposures associated with the Company's various tax filing positions, management records reserves using a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold for income tax positions taken or expected to be taken. Earnings could be affected to the extent the Company prevails in matters for which reserves have been established or is required to pay amounts in excess of established reserves. At January 31, 2017 , total unrecognized tax benefits were $3.4 million of which approximately $1.0 million, if recognized, would affect the effective income tax rate. As of January 31, 2017, unrecognized tax benefits are not expected to change materially in the next 12 months. Future developments may result in a change in this assessment. In evaluating the Company's ability to recover its deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise, management considers all available evidence. The Company records valuation allowances when management determines it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized in the future. Employee benefit plans . The Company maintains several pension and retirement plans, as well as provides certain postretirement health-care and life insurance benefits for retired employees. The Company makes certain assumptions that affect the underlying estimates related to pension and other postretirement costs. Significant changes in interest rates, the market value of securities and projected health-care costs would require the Company to revise key assumptions and could result in a higher or lower charge to earnings. The Company used discount rates of 4.50% to determine 2016 expense for its U.S. Qualified Plan as well as its postretirement plans and 4.25% for its Excess Plan/SRIP. Holding all other assumptions constant, a 0.5% increase in the discount rates would have decreased 2016 pension and postretirement expenses by $6.1 million and $0.5 million. A decrease of 0.5% in the discount rates would have increased the 2016 pension and postretirement expenses by $6.6 million and $0.3 million. The discount rate is subject to change each year, consistent with changes in the yield on applicable high-quality, long-term corporate bonds. Management selects a discount rate at which pension and postretirement benefits could be effectively settled based on (i) an analysis of expected benefit payments attributable to current employment service and (ii) appropriate yields related to such cash flows. TIFFANY & CO. K- 46 Table of Contents The Company used an expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets of 7.00% to determine its 2016 pension expense. Holding all other assumptions constant, a 0.5% change in the long-term rate of return would have changed the 2016 pension expense by approximately $1.7 million. The expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets is selected by taking into account the average rate of return expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for the benefits included in the projected benefit obligation. More specifically, consideration is given to the expected rates of return (including reinvestment asset return rates) based upon the plan's current asset mix, investment strategy and the historical performance of plan assets. For postretirement benefit measurement purposes, a 7.00% annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care was assumed for 2017 . The rate was assumed to decrease gradually to 4.75% by 2023 and remain at that level thereafter. A one-percentage-point change in the assumed health-care cost trend rate would not have a significant effect on the Company's accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for the year ended January 31, 2017 or aggregate service and interest cost components of the 2016 postretirement expense. 2017 Outlook For the fiscal year ending January 31, 2018 ("fiscal 2017"), management's outlook calls for: (i) worldwide net sales increasing over the prior year by a low-single-digit percentage and by a mid-single-digit percentage on a constant-exchange-rate basis and (ii) net earnings per diluted share increasing by a high-single-digit percentage over 2016's earnings per diluted share of $3.55 and by a mid-single-digit percentage over 2016's earnings per diluted share (excluding charges) of $3.75 (see "Non-GAAP Measures"). These expectations are approximations and are based on the Company's plans and assumptions, including: (i) worldwide gross retail square footage increasing 3%, net through 11 store openings, 9 relocations and 6 closings; (ii) operating margin above the prior year entirely due to an expected increase in gross margin, with SG&A expenses increasing slightly faster than sales growth; (iii) interest and other expenses, net of approximately $40 million; (iv) an effective income tax rate consistent with the prior year; (v) the U.S. dollar in 2017 stronger overall than other foreign currencies on a year-over-year basis; and (vi) minimal benefit to net earnings per diluted share from share repurchases. Management also expects for fiscal 2017: (i) net cash provided by operating activities of approximately $700 million and (ii) free cash flow (see "Non-GAAP Measures") of approximately $450 million. These expectations are approximations and are based on the Company's plans and assumptions, including: (i) net inventories unchanged from the prior year, (ii) capital expenditures of $250 million and (iii) net earnings in line with management expectations as described above.
