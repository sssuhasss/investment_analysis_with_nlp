Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is provided as a supplement to our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to help provide an understanding of our financial condition, the changes in our financial condition and our results of operations. Our discussion is organized as follows: Overview . This section contains background information on our company and the services and products that we provide, our enterprise priorities and the trends and business developments affecting our industry in order to provide context for management discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations. Critical accounting policies and estimates . This section contains a discussion of the accounting policies that we believe are important to our financial condition and results of operations and that require judgment and estimates on the part of management in their application. In addition, all of our significant accounting policies, including critical accounting policies, are summarized in Note 1 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Results of operations . This section contains an analysis of our results of operations presented in the accompanying consolidated statements of income by comparing the results for the year ended December 31, 2013 to the results for the year ended December 31, 2012 and by comparing the results for the year ended December 31, 2012 to the results for the year ended December 31, 2011. Liquidity and capital resources . This section provides an analysis of our cash flows and a discussion of our outstanding debt and commitments at December 31, 2013. 20 Table of Contents Overview Company Background We are a leading global provider of financial services technology. We provide account processing systems, electronic payments processing products and services, internet and mobile banking systems, and related services. We serve approximately 14,500 clients worldwide, including banks, thrifts, credit unions, investment management firms, leasing and finance companies, retailers, merchants and government agencies. The majority of our revenue is generated from recurring account- and transaction-based fees under contracts that generally have terms of three to five years. We also have had high contract renewal rates with our clients. The majority of the services we provide are necessary for our clients to operate their business and are, therefore, non-discretionary in nature. Our operations are primarily in the United States and are comprised of the Payments and Industry Products ( Payments ) segment and the Financial Institution Services ( Financial ) segment. The Payments segment primarily provides electronic bill payment and presentment services, debit and other card-based payment products and services, internet and mobile banking software and services, and other electronic payments software and services, including account-to-account transfers and person-to-person payments. Our businesses in this segment also provide investment account processing services for separately managed accounts, card and print personalization services, and fraud and risk management products and services. The Financial segment provides banks, thrifts and credit unions with account processing services, item processing and source capture services, loan origination and servicing products, cash management and consulting services, and other products and services that support numerous types of financial transactions. The Corporate and Other segment primarily consists of unallocated corporate expenses, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, intercompany eliminations and other costs that are not considered when management evaluates segment performance. On November 20, 2013, our Board of Directors declared a two-for-one stock split of our common stock and a proportionate increase in the number of our authorized shares of common stock. The additional shares were distributed on December 16, 2013 to shareholders of record at the close of business on December 2, 2013. Our common stock began trading at the split-adjusted price on December 17, 2013. All share and per share amounts are retroactively presented on a split-adjusted basis. In the fourth quarter of 2013, StoneRiver Group, L.P., a joint venture in which we own a 49% interest and account for under the equity method, completed a partial divestiture of a subsidiary business, resulting in a gain. Our share of the gain on the transaction was $71 million, with related income tax expense of $17 million. In the first quarter of 2013, we acquired Open Solutions Inc. ( Open Solutions ), a provider of account processing technology for financial institutions, for a cash purchase price of $55 million and the assumption of approximately $960 million of debt. With this acquisition, we added DNA, a real-time, open architecture account processing system, along with 3,300 existing Open Solutions clients. This acquisition advanced Fiserv go-to-market strategies by adding a number of products and services and by expanding the number of account processing clients to which we can provide our broad array of add-on solutions. In the third quarter of 2011, we acquired CashEdge Inc. ( CashEdge ), a leading provider of consumer and business payments solutions such as account-to-account transfer, account opening and funding, data aggregation, small business invoicing and payments, and person-to-person payments, for approximately $460 million, net of cash acquired. The acquisition of CashEdge has advanced our digital payments strategies. In the first quarter of 2011, we acquired Mobile Commerce Ltd. ( M-Com ), an international mobile banking and payments provider, and two other companies for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $50 million, net of cash acquired. M-Com has enhanced our mobile and payments capabilities, and the other acquired companies have added to or enhanced specific products or services that we already provide. 21 Table of Contents Enterprise Priorities We continue to implement a series of strategic initiatives to help accomplish our mission of providing integrated technology and services solutions that enable best-in-class results for our clients. These strategic initiatives include active portfolio management of our various businesses, enhancing the overall value of our existing client relationships, improving operational effectiveness, being disciplined in our allocation of capital, and differentiating our products and services through innovation. Our key enterprise priorities for 2014 are: (i) to continue to build high-quality revenue growth while meeting our earnings goals; (ii) to extend market momentum deeper into client relationships with a larger share of our strategic solutions; and (iii) to deliver innovation and integration which enhances results for our clients. Industry Trends Market and regulatory conditions have continued to create a difficult operating environment for financial institutions and other businesses in the United States and internationally. In particular, legislation such as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act has generated, and will continue to generate, numerous new regulations that will impact the financial industry. Financial institutions have generally remained cautious in their information technology spending as a result. These conditions have, however, created interest in solutions that help financial institutions win and retain customers, generate incremental revenue and enhance operating efficiency. Examples of these solutions include our digital channels and electronic payments solutions, including mobile banking and person-to-person payments. Despite the difficult environment over the past several years, our revenue increased 9% to $4.8 billion in 2013 as compared to 2012, our net income per share from continuing operations increased to $2.44 in 2013 as compared to $2.15 in 2012 and net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was $1.0 billion in 2013 compared to $826 million in 2012. We believe these financial results demonstrate the resilience of our recurring, fee-based revenue model, the largely non-discretionary nature of our products and services, and mild improvement in the general condition of the financial industry. We anticipate that we will benefit over the long term from the trend of financial institutions moving from in-house technology solutions to outsourced solutions. During the past 25 years, the number of financial institutions in the United States has declined at a relatively steady rate of approximately 3% per year, primarily as a result of voluntary mergers and acquisitions. An acquisition benefits us when a newly combined institution is processed on our system, or elects to move to one of our systems, and negatively impacts us when a competing system is selected. Financial institution acquisitions also impact our financial results due to early contract termination fees in our multi-year client contracts. Contract termination fees are primarily generated when an existing client with a multi-year contract is acquired by another financial institution. These fees can vary from period to period based on the number and size of clients that are acquired and how early in the contract term the contract is terminated. Business Developments We continue to invest in the development of new and strategic products in categories such as payments, including Popmoney for person-to-person payments; Mobiliti for mobile banking and payments services; and others that we believe will increase value to our clients and enhance the capabilities of our existing solutions. In January 2013, we acquired Open Solutions and its DNA account processing system. We believe our wide range of industry-leading solutions along with the investments we are making in new and differentiated products will favorably position us and our clients to capitalize on opportunities in the marketplace. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which require management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. We continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our consolidated financial 22 Table of Contents statements and base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions that we believe are reasonable in light of current circumstances. Actual amounts and results could differ materially from these estimates. Acquisitions We allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction at their estimated fair values. The estimates used to determine the fair value of long-lived assets, such as intangible assets, can be complex and require significant judgments. We use information available to us to make fair value determinations and engage independent valuation specialists, when necessary, to assist in the fair value determination of significant acquired long-lived assets. While we use our best estimates and assumptions as a part of the purchase price allocation process, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of income. We are also required to estimate the useful lives of intangible assets to determine the amount of acquisition-related intangible asset amortization expense to record in future periods. We periodically review the estimated useful lives assigned to our intangible assets to determine whether such estimated useful lives continue to be appropriate. Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets We review the carrying value of goodwill for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is tested for impairment at a reporting unit level, determined to be at an operating segment level or one level below. When reviewing goodwill for impairment, we consider the amount of excess fair value over the carrying value of each reporting unit, the period of time since a reporting unit last quantitative test, the extent a reorganization or disposition changes the composition of one or more of our reporting units, and other factors to determine whether or not to first perform a qualitative test. When performing a qualitative test, we assess numerous factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units are less than their respective carrying values. Examples of qualitative factors that we assess include our share price, our financial performance, market and competitive factors in our industry and other events specific to our reporting units. If we conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we perform a two-step quantitative impairment test. The first step in the quantitative test is to compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value. We determine the fair value of a reporting unit based primarily on the present value of estimated future cash flows. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the unit net assets, goodwill of that reporting unit is not impaired and further testing is not required. If the carrying value of the reporting unit net assets exceeds the fair value of the unit, then we perform the second step of the quantitative test to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill and any impairment charge. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves judgment and the use of significant estimates and assumptions, which include assumptions regarding the revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate estimated future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates and future economic and market conditions. Our most recent impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of 2013 determined that our goodwill was not impaired as the estimated fair values of the respective reporting units substantially exceeded the carrying values. We review acquired intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability is assessed by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. Measurement of any impairment loss is based on estimated fair value. Given the significance of our goodwill and intangible asset balances, an adverse change in fair value could result in an impairment charge, which could be material to our consolidated financial statements. Based on our impairment assessments in 2013, we determined that our acquired intangible assets were not impaired. 23 Table of Contents Revenue Recognition The majority of our revenue is generated from monthly account- and transaction-based fees. Revenue is recognized as services are provided and is primarily recognized under service agreements that are long-term in nature, generally three to five years, and that do not require management to make significant judgments or assumptions. Additionally, given the nature of our business and the rules governing revenue recognition, our revenue recognition practices generally do not involve significant estimates that materially affect our results of operations. Additional information about our revenue recognition policies is included in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. Results of Operations Components of Revenue and Expenses The following summary describes the components of revenue and expenses as presented in our consolidated statements of income. Processing and Services Processing and services revenue, which in 2013 represented 84% of our consolidated revenue, is primarily generated from account- and transaction-based fees under contracts that generally have terms of three to five years. Revenue is recognized when the related transactions are processed and services have been performed. Processing and services revenue is most reflective of our business performance because a significant amount of our total operating profit is generated by these services. Cost of processing and services includes costs directly associated with providing services to clients and includes the following: personnel; equipment and data communication; infrastructure costs, including costs to maintain software applications; client support; depreciation and amortization; and other operating expenses. Product Product revenue, which in 2013 represented 16% of our consolidated revenue, is derived from integrated print and card production (13%) and software licenses (3%). Cost of product includes costs directly associated with the products sold and includes the following: costs of materials and software development; personnel; infrastructure costs; depreciation and amortization; and other costs directly associated with product revenue. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses primarily consist of: salaries, wages and related expenses paid to sales personnel, administrative employees and management; advertising and promotional costs; depreciation and amortization; and other selling and administrative expenses. 24 Table of Contents Financial Results On March 14, 2013, the Company sold its club solutions business ( Club Solutions ). The results of operations and cash flows of Club Solutions, which were previously included within the Payments segment, have been reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented. The following table presents certain amounts included in our consolidated statements of income, the relative percentage that those amounts represent to revenue and the change in those amounts from year to year. This information should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.

Total Revenue Total revenue increased $378 million, or 9%, in 2013 and increased $147 million, or 3%, in 2012 compared to the prior years. The increase in total revenue during 2013 was attributable to 13% revenue growth in our Financial segment due primarily to the acquisition of Open Solutions and 4% revenue growth in our Payments segment, in each case, as compared to 2012. The increase in total revenue during 2012 was primarily due to 5% revenue growth in our Payments segment and 2% revenue growth in our Financial segment, in each case, as compared to 2011. Revenue from acquired companies contributed $270 million and $43 million to revenue in 2013 and 2012, respectively. Revenue in our Payments segment increased $109 million, or 4%, in 2013 and increased $110 million, or 5%, in 2012 compared to the prior years. Payments segment revenue growth during 2013 and 2012 was primarily driven by our recurring revenue businesses as processing and services revenue increased $114 million and $100 million in 2013 and 2012, respectively, or 6% each year. The growth in both years was primarily due to new clients and increased transaction volumes from existing clients in our card services business and digital channels business, which includes our online and mobile banking solutions, as well as our biller solutions and bill payment businesses in 2013. In 2012, revenue from acquired companies totaling $40 million and higher postage pass-through revenue, which is included in both product revenue and cost of product in our output solutions business, positively impacted revenue growth by approximately three percentage points as compared to 2011. The positive 26 Table of Contents revenue growth in both 2013 and 2012 was partially offset by lower software license revenue, along with a discount on the renewal of a bill payment contract in 2013 and the loss of a client that was acquired by another financial institution in 2012. Revenue in our Financial segment increased $269 million, or 13%, in 2013 and increased $36 million, or 2%, in 2012 compared to the prior years. Financial segment revenue growth in 2013 was driven by the acquisition of Open Solutions, which contributed $270 million in revenue. Excluding the Open Solutions acquisition, revenue growth in 2013 was flat compared to the prior year, primarily due to the migration of an account processing client from our system to its parent company account processing system. In 2012, revenue growth in our Financial segment was favorably impacted by an increase of $67 million, or 4%, in processing and services revenue primarily attributed to increased revenue in our account processing and lending businesses, partially offset by volume declines in our check processing business. In addition, Financial segment growth was negatively impacted by approximately two percentage points in 2012 primarily due to lower software license revenue as compared to 2011. Total Expenses Total expenses increased $365 million, or 11%, in 2013 compared to 2012 and increased $89 million, or 3%, in 2012 compared to 2011. Total expenses as a percentage of total revenue were 78.0%, 76.4% and 76.9% in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The increase in total expenses and as a percentage of total revenue in 2013 is due primarily to the acquisition of Open Solutions. Cost of processing and services as a percentage of processing and services revenue decreased to 51.6% in 2013 compared to 52.9% in 2012 and 54.4% in 2011. Cost of processing and services as a percentage of processing and services revenue was favorably impacted in both 2013 and 2012 by increased operating leverage in our recurring revenue businesses and by operating efficiency initiatives across the company that lowered our cost structure. Cost of product as a percentage of product revenue was 89.2% in 2013 compared to 81.2% in 2012 and 75.7% in 2011. The increase in cost of product as a percentage of product revenue in 2013 was primarily attributable to merger and integration costs resulting from the Open Solutions acquisition, including a $30 million non-cash impairment charge related to the replacement of our Acumen account processing system with DNA, an Open Solutions account processing system. The increase in cost of product as a percentage of product revenue in 2012 was primarily due to a decrease in high-margin software license sales, as well as an increase in postage pass-through revenue and expenses in our output solutions business, as compared to 2011. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $153 million, or 19%, and $29 million, or 4%, in 2013 and 2012, respectively, compared to the prior years. Selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of total revenue was 20.3%, 18.6% and 18.5% in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue in 2013 was primarily due to higher acquired intangible amortization and merger and integration costs of $53 million attributable to our acquisition of Open Solutions. Operating Income and Operating Margin Total operating income increased $13 million, or 1%, in 2013 and $58 million, or 6%, in 2012 compared to the prior years. Operating margin decreased to 22.0% in 2013 from 23.6% in 2012 and increased in 2012 from 23.1% in 2011. The operating margin decline of 160 basis points in 2013 was due to increased operating losses of $125 million in our Corporate and Other segment, which negatively impacted our operating margin by 260 basis points due primarily to acquired intangible amortization and merger and integration costs of $115 million associated with the acquisition of Open Solutions. This negative impact was partially offset by positive margin increases in our Payments and Financial segments in 2013. The operating margin improvement of 50 basis points in 2012 was due in part to increased operating leverage in our recurring revenue businesses and operational effectiveness activities that lowered our cost structure. 27 Table of Contents Operating income in our Payments segment increased $45 million, or 7%, and $9 million, or 1%, in 2013 and 2012, respectively, compared to the prior years. Operating margins were 27.5%, 26.9% and 27.8% in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, and increased 60 basis points in 2013 and decreased 90 basis points in 2012. The increases in operating income were primarily due to revenue growth and scale efficiencies in our card services business in 2013 and 2012, as well as our digital channels business in 2013. Payments segment operating margins were negatively impacted by a decrease in higher-margin software license revenue in both years, along with a discount on the renewal of a bill payment contract in 2013 and the loss of a client that was acquired by another financial institution in 2012. Operating margin in 2012 was also negatively impacted by increased expenses associated with the development, support and integration of new products and services, including Popmoney for person-to-person payments and Mobiliti for mobile banking and payment services. Operating income in our Financial segment increased $93 million, or 14%, and $39 million, or 6%, in 2013 and 2012, respectively, compared to the prior years. Operating margin in 2013 improved slightly to 32.2% as compared to 2012, which improved to 32.0% from 30.6% in 2011. These improvements in operating income and margin in 2013 and 2012 were primarily due to scale efficiencies and operational effectiveness benefits, partially offset by the migration of an account processing client to its parent company account processing system in 2013 and a decrease in higher-margin software license revenue in 2012 as compared to 2011. The operating loss in the Corporate and Other segment increased $125 million in 2013 and decreased $10 million in 2012 compared to the prior years. The increase in operating loss in 2013 was primarily attributable to merger and integration costs of $65 million resulting from the Open Solutions acquisition, including a $30 million non-cash impairment charge related to the replacement of our Acumen account processing system with DNA, an Open Solutions account processing system. In addition, amortization expenses increased by $50 million in 2013, primarily related to Open Solutions acquired intangible assets. The decrease in operating loss in 2012 was primarily due to reduced employee severance and merger and integration costs as compared to 2011. Interest Expense Interest expense decreased $10 million, or 6%, and $14 million, or 7%, in 2013 and 2012, respectively, compared to the prior years. These decreases were primarily due to lower average interest rates in 2013 and 2012 as compared to the prior years as a result of our debt refinancing activities. The interest expense decrease in 2013 was partially offset by additional debt assumed in connection with the acquisition of Open Solutions. In 2012, interest expense was negatively impacted by $4 million of expense associated with hedge ineffectiveness recognized upon the settlement of our forward-starting interest rate swap agreements ( Forward-Starting Swaps ) in September of 2012. Interest and Investment Income Interest and investment income decreased $6 million in 2013 as compared to 2012 due to a gain recognized on a sale of an investment in the prior year period. Loss on Early Debt Extinguishment In 2011, we issued $1.0 billion principal amount of senior notes in a public debt offering and used the proceeds to repay our senior notes which matured in November 2012. The premium paid on the early retirement of debt and other costs associated with the transaction resulted in pre-tax charges of $85 million in 2011. Income Tax Provision Our effective income tax rate for continuing operations was 36.5% in 2013, 34.0% in 2012 and 35.1% in 2011. The increase in the effective tax rate from 2012 to 2013 was primarily due to the income tax expense associated with our share of a gain on a partial divestiture of a subsidiary business by our unconsolidated affiliate, StoneRiver Group, L.P. ( StoneRiver ). The lower effective tax rate in 2012 compared to 2011 was primarily due to increased deductions resulting from federal tax planning initiatives, including the associated discrete tax benefits. 28 Table of Contents Income from Investment in Unconsolidated Affiliate Our share of the income of StoneRiver, a joint venture in which we own a 49% interest, was $80 million, $11 million and $18 million in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The 2013 increase in income was due to our $71 million share of a gain on a partial divestiture of a subsidiary business by StoneRiver. (Loss) Income from Discontinued Operations (Loss) income from discontinued operations related to Club Solutions and prior dispositions totaled $(2) million, $19 million and $(15) million in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, and included income tax (expense) benefits of $(4) million, $(13) million and $11 million, respectively. Net Income Per Share - Diluted from Continuing Operations Net income per share-diluted from continuing operations was $2.44 in 2013 compared to $2.15 in 2012 and $1.69 in 2011. Net income per share-diluted from continuing operations in 2013 was favorably impacted by $0.20 per share from our share of a gain on a partial divestiture of a subsidiary business by StoneRiver, offset by merger and integration costs of $0.20 per share incurred due to the acquisition of Open Solutions. Net income per share-diluted from continuing operations was negatively impacted by a loss on early debt extinguishment of $0.18 per share in 2011. The amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets also reduced net income per share-diluted from continuing operations by $0.51, $0.37 and $0.34 in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary liquidity needs are: (i) to fund normal operating expenses; (ii) to meet the interest and principal requirements of our outstanding indebtedness; and (iii) to fund capital expenditures and operating lease payments. We believe these needs will be satisfied using cash flow generated by our operations, our cash and cash equivalents of $400 million at December 31, 2013 and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility. The following table presents our operating cash flow and capital expenditure amounts for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Year Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease) (In millions) 2013 2012 $ % Income from continuing operations $ 650 $ 592 $ 58 Depreciation and amortization 403 350 53 Share-based compensation 46 44 2 Deferred income taxes (9 ) 5 (14 ) Income from investment in unconsolidated affiliate (80 ) (11 ) (69 ) Non-cash impairment charge 30 - 30 Dividends from unconsolidated affiliate 6 23 (17 ) Settlement of interest rate hedge contracts - (88 ) 88 Net changes in working capital and other (7 ) (89 ) 82 Operating cash flow $ 1,039 $ 826 $ 213 26 % Capital expenditures $ 236 $ 193 $ 43 22 % Our net cash provided by operating activities, or operating cash flow, was $1,039 million in 2013, an increase of 26% compared with $826 million in 2012. This increase was primarily due to increased earnings, favorable working capital changes and a payment of $88 million for the settlement of Forward-Starting Swaps in 2012. In 2013, our working capital was positively impacted by timing of various cash payments and receipts and overall 29 Table of Contents lower income tax payments compared to 2012. In addition, working capital was negatively impacted in 2012 by an increase in payments for discretionary and incentive-based employee compensation, including company 401(k) profit sharing contributions. Our current policy is to use our operating cash flow primarily to repay debt and to fund capital expenditures, acquisitions and share repurchases, rather than to pay dividends. Our capital expenditures in 2013 increased by $43 million compared to 2012 and were less than 5% of our total revenue in each year. In the first quarter of 2013, we acquired Open Solutions for a cash purchase price of $16 million, net of cash acquired, and sold Club Solutions for $35 million in cash. In 2013 and 2012, we received cash dividends of $122 million and $55 million, respectively, from StoneRiver. The portions of these dividends that represented returns on our investment, $6 million in 2013 and $23 million in 2012, are reported in cash flows from operating activities. Share Repurchases We purchased $578 million and $634 million of our common stock in 2013 and 2012, respectively. On each of February 22, 2012 and August 5, 2013, our board of directors authorized the purchase of up to 20.0 million shares of our common stock. As of December 31, 2013, we had approximately 18.5 million shares remaining under this authorization. Shares repurchased are generally held for issuance in connection with our equity plans.

In October 2013, we obtained a $900 million term loan under a new loan agreement with a syndicate of banks and used the net proceeds from the term loan to repay outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility. At December 31, 2013, our long-term debt consisted primarily of $2.95 billion of senior notes and $900 million of term loan borrowings. We were in compliance with all financial debt covenants in 2013. Term Loan On October 25, 2013, we obtained a $900 million term loan under a new loan agreement with a syndicate of banks. This term loan bears interest at a variable rate based on LIBOR or the bank base rate, plus a specified margin based on our long-term debt rating in effect from time to time, and matures in October 2018. The weighted average variable interest rate on the term loan borrowings was 1.4% at December 31, 2013. Scheduled principal payments of $90 million are due on the last business day of December of each year, commencing on 30 Table of Contents December 31, 2014, with the remaining principal balance of $540 million due in October 2018. The term loan facility contains various restrictions and covenants substantially similar to those contained in the revolving credit facility described below. Revolving Credit Facility In connection with the term loan financing described above, on October 25, 2013, we entered into an amendment to our existing $2.0 billion revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of banks that conformed certain of its provisions to those in the new term loan agreement and extended its maturity to October 25, 2018. The revolving credit facility was previously scheduled to expire on August 1, 2017. Borrowings under the amended revolving credit facility bear interest at a variable rate based on LIBOR or the bank base rate, plus a specified margin based on our long-term debt rating in effect from time to time. There are no significant commitment fees and no compensating balance requirements. As of December 31, 2013, there were no borrowings outstanding under the facility. The revolving credit facility contains various restrictions and covenants that require us, among other things, to (i) limit our consolidated indebtedness as of the end of each fiscal quarter to no more than three and one-half times consolidated net earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and certain other adjustments during the period of four fiscal quarters then ended, and (ii) maintain consolidated net earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and certain other adjustments of at least three times consolidated interest expense as of the end of each fiscal quarter for the period of four fiscal quarters then ended. Senior Notes In September 2012, we issued $700 million aggregate principal amount of 3.5% senior notes due in October 2022, which pay interest semi-annually on April 1 and October 1 of each year. In June 2011, we issued $1.0 billion of senior notes comprised of $600 million of 3.125% senior notes due in June 2016 and $400 million of 4.75% senior notes due in June 2021, which pay interest semi-annually on June 15 and December 15 of each year. Our 3.125% senior notes due in October 2015 and our 4.625% senior notes due in October 2020 pay interest at the stated rate on April 1 and October 1 of each year. Our 6.8% senior notes due in November 2017 pay interest at the stated rate on May 20 and November 20 of each year. The interest rates applicable to the senior notes are subject to an increase of up to two percent in the event that our credit rating is downgraded below investment grade. The indenture governing the senior notes contains covenants that, among other matters, limit (i) our ability to consolidate or merge into, or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all of our properties and assets to, another person, (ii) our and certain of our subsidiaries ability to create or assume liens, and (iii) our and certain of our subsidiaries ability to engage in sale and leaseback transactions. Interest Rate Hedge Contracts To manage exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, we maintained Forward-Starting Swaps, designated as cash flow hedges, with a total notional value of $550 million to hedge against changes in interest rates applicable to forecasted five-year and ten-year fixed rate borrowings. Upon the issuance of senior notes in September 2012, we paid $88 million, included in cash flows from operating activities, to settle the Forward-Starting Swaps and recognized approximately $4 million of interest expense due to hedge ineffectiveness. The remaining $84 million was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of income taxes of $33 million, and is being recognized as interest expense over the terms of the originally forecasted interest payments. In addition, we maintained interest rate swap agreements ( Swaps ) that expired in September of 2012, designated as cash flow hedges, with a total notional value of $1.0 billion to hedge against changes in interest rates on floating rate term loan borrowings. There were no Forward-Starting Swaps or Swaps outstanding as of December 31, 2013. Other Access to capital markets impacts our cost of capital, our ability to refinance maturing debt and our ability to fund future acquisitions. Our ability to access capital on favorable terms depends on a number of factors, including general market conditions, interest rates, credit ratings on our debt securities, perception of our potential future earnings and the market price of our common stock. As of December 31, 2013, we had a credit 31 Table of Contents rating of Baa2 with a stable outlook from Moody Investors Service, Inc. ( Moody ) and BBB- with a stable outlook from Standard & Poor Ratings Services ( S&P ) on our senior unsecured debt securities. The interest rates payable on our senior notes, term loan and revolving credit facility are subject to adjustment from time to time if Moody or S&P changes the debt rating applicable to the notes. If the ratings from Moody or S&P decrease below investment grade, the per annum interest rates are subject to increase by up to two percent. In no event will the total increase in the per annum interest rates exceed two percent above the original interest rates, nor will the per annum interest rate be reduced below the original interest rate applicable to the senior notes. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations We do not participate in, nor have we created, any off-balance sheet variable interest entities or other off-balance sheet financing, other than letters of credit. The following table details our contractual cash obligations at December 31, 2013: (In millions) Total Less than 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than 5 years Long-term debt including interest (1) (2) $ 4,588 $ 231 $ 1,334 $ 1,304 $ 1,719 Minimum operating lease payments (1) 333 83 132 70 48 Purchase obligations (1) 251 112 107 24 8 Income tax obligations 60 16 24 15 5 Total $ 5,232 $ 442 $ 1,597 $ 1,413 $ 1,780 (1) Interest, operating lease and purchase obligations are reported on a pre-tax basis.
