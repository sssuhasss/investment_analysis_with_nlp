ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview The following Management Discussion and Analysis is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and the financial condition of the Company. Management Discussion and Analysis is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, the Company consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements. The Company results continue to be correlated to the direction of the U.S. equity markets and are subject to volatility due to changes in interest rates, valuation of financial instruments, economic and political trends and industry competition. During 2008, the market was impacted by volatile energy prices, a housing market slowdown, the subprime lending collapse that led to an overall credit crisis, a weakening U.S. dollar and declining interest rates. The Company Private Client Group recruitment and retention of Financial Advisors was positively impacted by industry consolidation. RJBank benefited from the widening interest rate spreads and what management feels are quality loans available for purchase that resulted from a desire for liquidity in the markets in response to the credit crisis. 25 Results of Operations - Total Company The Company currently operates through the following eight business segments: Private Client Group; Capital Markets; Asset Management; RJBank; Emerging Markets; Stock Loan/Borrow; Proprietary Capital and certain corporate activities in the Other segment. The following table presents consolidated and segment financial information for the Company for the years indicated: Year Ended September 30, September 30, September 30, 2008 2007 2006 (in 000's) Total Company Revenues $ 3,204,932 $ 3,109,579 $ 2,645,578 Pre-tax Earnings 386,854 392,224 342,066 Private Client Group Revenues 1,950,292 1,938,154 1,679,813 Pre-tax Earnings 177,696 219,864 168,519 Capital Markets Revenues 506,007 506,498 487,419 Pre-tax Earnings 50,169 68,966 78,221 Asset Management Revenues 236,928 234,875 207,821 Pre-tax Earnings 58,865 60,517 48,749 RJBank Revenues 405,304 279,572 114,692 Pre-tax Earnings 112,282 27,005 16,003 Emerging Markets Revenues 41,269 59,083 55,263 Pre-tax (Loss) Earnings (3,260) 3,640 2,857 Stock Loan/Borrow Revenues 36,843 68,685 59,947 Pre-tax Earnings 7,034 5,003 8,001 Proprietary Capital Revenues 22,775 8,280 17,312 Pre-tax Earnings 7,341 3,577 8,468 Other Revenues 5,514 14,432 23,311 Pre-tax (Loss) Earnings (23,273) 3,652 11,248 26 Year ended September 30, 2008 Compared with the Year ended September 30, 2007 - Total Company The Company had record annual gross and net revenues for the year, exceeding the prior year by 3% and 8%, respectively. Gross revenues were fueled by strong institutional sales commissions offset by trading losses, while net revenues also benefited from record net interest earnings. Non-interest expenses grew by 9%, thus net income declined 6% from the prior year. Three of the Company four major segments experienced increases in revenues, but only RJBank generated an increase in pre-tax income. Year ended September 30, 2007 Compared with the Year ended September 30, 2006 - Total Company The Company had record earnings for the fourth consecutive year, with 2007 total revenues surpassing $3 billion and net income surpassing $250 million. Revenues exceeded the prior year by 18% while net income exceeded the prior year by 17%. Net revenues were $2.6 billion, or up 11% over the prior year, thus positive operating leverage was realized. Non-interest expenses also rose by 11%. Once again, results were driven by an increase in net interest earnings, which were up 31%. All of the Company four major segments had higher revenues and three of the four had higher pre-tax income than in the prior year. Net Interest Analysis The following table presents average balance data and interest income and expense data for the Company, as well as the related net interest income: Year Ended September 30, 2008 September 30, 2007 September 30, 2006 Operating Average Operating Average Operating Average Average Interest Yield/ Average Interest Yield/ Average Interest Yield/ Balance Inc./Exp.

Average interest-earning assets at RJBank increased 70% over the prior year. Average bank loan balances increased 93% from $3.2 billion to $6.1 billion. This increase was funded by the growth in new client cash balances which are a result of the positive recruiting results and the third bulk transfer of client cash deposits of $550 million in March 2008 as well as clients raising cash to historically high levels in their accounts. Average customer margin balances grew only modestly during 2008, thus the increased client cash balances in the firm Client Interest Program led to an increase in assets segregated pursuant to regulations. Net interest on the stock loan/borrow business increased 9%, due to increased spreads primarily on hard-to-locate securities. Other interest revenue and expense include earnings on corporate cash, inventory balances, interest on overnight borrowings and the mortgage on the headquarters facility.

As a result, commission revenue increased $68 million, only 5% over the prior year, with $56 million of that increase in RJA due to the recruitment of 184 employee Financial Advisors in fiscal 2008 (for a net increase of 93) and 153 in fiscal 2007 (for a net increase of 59). It generally takes newly recruited Financial Advisors two years to reach their previous production levels. Average production per employee Financial Advisor increased to $515,000 in fiscal 2008 driven by the recruiting of above-average producers. RJFS recruited 398 independent contractor Financial Advisors in fiscal 2008 (for a net increase of 81). Independent contractor Financial Advisor average production increased from $316,000 in fiscal 2007 to $330,000 in fiscal 2008, again driven by recruiting above average producers. As a result of these two factors, RJFS securities commissions and fees increased $10 million despite the difficult market environment. Offsetting this modest increase in securities commissions and fees was a 26% decrease in gross and net interest from the prior year as interest rates declined and spreads narrowed. Sales commission expense increased 6% in comparison to the 5% increase in commission revenue as it includes the increased expenses associated with recruiting such as hiring bonuses and guaranteed payout amounts. Total non-interest expenses increased 7% as a result of company growth. Administrative expense includes the compensation for additional support personnel, primarily in branch offices. Business development expense includes transition expense (i.e. account transfer fees) and the direct expenses associated with recruiting such as bringing Financial Advisors to the corporate headquarters. Occupancy expense includes the expenses associated with the opening of new branch offices. RJA added 19 offices during fiscal 2008 and 14 during fiscal 2007. The 7% increase in non-interest expense exceeded the 4% increase in net revenues, resulting in a 19% decline in pre-tax earnings from the prior year. Overall PCG margins decreased from 12.6% to 9.8%. While over half of the Private Client Group revenues are recurring in nature, much of that is asset based. With the decline in the equity markets, client assets have declined and revenues based on these balances will be lower until the market values recover. Historically, in uncertain markets individual investors within PCG execute fewer transactions as they often prefer to wait and see, hoping for positive market movement. Both of these factors will have a negative impact on PCG revenues in the near term. Meanwhile the turmoil within the financial services industry has led to increased opportunities to recruit successful Financial Advisors. Year ended September 30, 2007 Compared with the Year ended September 30, 2006 Private Client Group The Private Client Group was significantly impacted by the successful recruiting of employee Financial Advisors and increased productivity throughout domestic PCG. RJA added a net 59 employee Financial Advisors and increased average production per Financial Advisor 22% to $493,000, resulting in a 31% increase in RJA PCG securities commissions and fees. Average assets under management per RJA Financial Advisor increased 24% to $72 million. RJA continues to benefit from the industry consolidation and the resultant unrest and Financial Advisor turnover. Securities commissions and fees increased 10% in RJFS despite a 6% decline in the number of Financial Advisors, most of which was by design in the strategic upgrading initiative. The increased commission and fee revenue is the result of a 16% increase in average production to $316,000 per Financial Advisor. RJ Ltd 4% increase in number of Financial Advisors generated a 6.5% increase in securities commissions and fees. Financial service fees in the prior year included a one-time adjustment of approximately $10 million related to the change in accounting for IRA fees. Excluding this adjustment, financial service fees increased modestly over the prior year. Other revenue increased $9 million, or 12% over the prior year, as a result of increased mutual fund networking and educational and marketing support fees from mutual fund companies. 29 Commission expense within PCG was up 14%, relatively proportional to the increase in commission revenues and fees of 15%. Administrative compensation, occupancy and business development expenses increased proportionately to net revenues. These increases include expenses associated with new branches, sales support staff, home office visits and account transfer fees. Information processing expenses rose only 4% and reflect the benefit of operating leverage despite continued investment in systems upgrades. The decrease in other expense is the result of lower legal costs and settlements as the last of the outstanding large cases related to the 2000 2002 market decline were settled in the prior year. Overall PCG margins increased by 16% over the prior year, reaching 12.6%.

Equity institutional sales commissions were higher both domestically and in Canada as volatile market conditions generated increased activity. The equally volatile fixed income markets produced an even greater increase in commission revenue as institutions sought expertise on various products, and many altered their weighting in fixed income products. 30 These increases were offset by reduced investment banking fee revenue compared to the prior year. Equity underwriting fees were $26 million and $3 million below the prior year in the U.S. and Canada, respectively. This was attributable to the lack of underwritings due to the uncertain market conditions. During the year Capital Markets managed or co-managed 82 transactions in the U.S. and Canada, compared to 108 transactions in the prior year. In addition, the prior year was a record year for mergers and acquisition fees. RJTCF saw a dramatic decrease of $15 million in deal related fee revenue (included in underwriting fees) as several of its major clients are no longer in the market. Total Company trading profits declined $18 million (over 100%) with $12.8 million of that decline in the Capital Markets segment. While domestic equity facilitation losses remained consistent at $8 million, overall fixed income trading profits increased from $11 million in fiscal 2007 to $15 million in fiscal 2008. This included a particularly difficult fixed income trading environment due to a flight to quality, especially during the fourth quarter. RJ Ltd. trading profits reversed from a $2.8 million profit in fiscal 2007 to a $6 million loss in fiscal 2008. This was a combined result of an increase in facilitation losses of $6.6 million and a $2.6 million decline in proprietary trading gains. Gross revenues were flat with the prior year and net revenues were up 5%. However, due to the $42 million increase in non-interest expense, pre-tax earnings were down 27% from the prior year. Commission expense increased in line with commission revenues. The other compensation expenses, occupancy and communications and information processing expenses increased due to growth as the Company has taken advantage of the opportunity to add quality Capital Markets teams. Equity Capital Markets has added a net seven professionals in Investment Banking over the past year, as well as additional Sales and Research personnel. This segment moved or substantially renovated several of its larger offices this year, including offices in New York, Atlanta and Chicago, and opened one new office in San Francisco. Fixed Income has taken advantage of market conditions in the taxable fixed income institutional sales area and in Public Finance to recruit a combined 49 additional professionals, representing a 20% increase in its producing professionals. These hires were accomplished at lower costs than possible in recent years. Year ended September 30, 2007 Compared with the Year ended September 30, 2006 Capital Markets The Capital Markets segment pre-tax earnings declined 12% despite a 2% increase in net revenues. Commission revenue was down slightly, the net of a decline in equity commissions related to the decline in commissions generated by underwriting transactions, and an increase in fixed income commissions, a result of the increased volatility. Commissions generated by underwriting transactions reached a record $41 million in the prior year and were only $22 million in the current year. The increase in underwriting fees included increases of $3 million at RJA, despite a decline in the number of deals from 97 to 78, and $3 million at RJ Ltd. on 30 deals versus 29 in the prior year. Merger and acquisition fees were up $15 million, reaching an all time record level of $60 million for the year. During fiscal 2007, RJA closed 15 individual merger and acquisition transactions with fees in excess of $1 million. Trading profits were down 58% from the prior year, reflecting a particularly difficult fixed income trading environment during the fourth quarter. As credit issues drove fixed income product values down there was a flight to quality and the firm economic hedges (short positions in US Treasuries) contributed additional losses. Meanwhile, there were also increased losses in equity customer facilitations and OTC market making. Raymond James Tax Credit Fund ( RJTCF ) revenues increased 11% as they invested $375 million for institutional investors versus $277 million in the prior year. Interest revenue increased related to higher average fixed income inventory levels. Expenses were generally in line with revenue growth with two exceptions. Communications and information processing increased predominantly due to increased costs associated with market information systems and software development costs. Other expense reflects a shift to the use of electronic and other non-exchange clearing methods and includes transaction related underwriting expenses incurred by RJTCF. 31 Results of Operations - Asset Management The following table presents consolidated financial information for the Asset Management segment for the years indicated: Year Ended September 30, % Incr.

Expenses were well controlled, thus pre-tax income declined only 3%. Assets under management declined by 10% or $3.8 billion during the year as positive net sales did not offset a significant decline in the market value of portfolios. Portfolios managed by Eagle experienced approximately $1.9 billion in market depreciation in 2008 compared to $2.1 billion in appreciation during the prior year. Market depreciation of RJCS/Freedom portfolios was approximately $4.0 billion compared to appreciation of $1.3 billion in fiscal 2007. Other fee based programs (non-managed) witnessed a decline in market values in the amount of $5.9 billion in 2008 as compared to a gain of $1.4 billion in the prior year. Despite adverse market conditions, net inflows for the segment amounted to approximately $7 billion in 2008. This included approximately $2.3 billion in managed accounts (including Eagle) and $4.7 billion in non-managed fee based accounts. Money market fund assets increased despite the transfer of $550 million to RJBank in March 2008. Performance results were very good, as 87% of the investment managers participating in the Raymond James Consulting Services program outperformed their indices for the five year period ended September 30, 2008. Of Eagle 11 principal investment programs, 10 outperformed their indices during the same period. At September 30, 2008, five of the eight funds managed by Heritage had earned a four-star overall rating from Morningstar. 33 Year ended September 30, 2007 Compared with the Year ended September 30, 2006 - Asset Management The Asset Management segment has benefited significantly from the successful recruiting in PCG. New Financial Advisors bring additional client assets, a portion of which is often directed into an asset management alternative. In addition, both Eagle and Heritage have been successful in their efforts to increase their presence on outside broker-dealer platforms. Eagle retail sales to outside broker-dealers were 33% of their total 2007 sales, while Heritage were 78% of their total sales. Revenues in this segment increased 13% on a 17% increase in assets under management, as there continues to be some fee compression. Expenses increased only 10%, generating a 24% increase in pre-tax earnings and a 26% margin as a result of operating leverage. Money market fund balances declined as a result of the transfer of $1.3 billion to RJBank in March 2007.

Year ended September 30, 2008 Compared with the Year ended September 30, 2007 - RJBank Net interest income increased 155% and pre-tax profits at RJBank more than quadrupled during the fiscal year compared to the prior year. Interest revenue at RJBank increased 46% despite falling rates, with the loan balances increasing from $4.7 billion to $7.1 billion. The loan increase consisted primarily of 24% purchased residential mortgage pools and 73% corporate loans, with 97% of the latter purchased or originated participations in syndicated loans. As a result, total assets increased from $6.3 billion to $9.4 billion, adjusted to exclude the investment of the $1.9 billion FHLB advance repaid on October 1, 2008. Corporate loans increased from $2.8 billion to $4.6 billion, while retail and residential loans increased from $1.9 billion to $2.6 billion. The growth in loans was funded by the growth in customer deposits. The influx of client cash balances into the RJBank Deposit Program (reaching historically high levels), generated by a combination of new clients bringing cash to the firm, clients raising cash, and clients electing to hold their cash in FDIC insured accounts, plus the bulk transfer of $550 million in cash balances in March 2008, resulted in a $3.2 billion increase in deposit balances from $5.6 billion to $8.8 billion. As a result of the falling interest rate environment, interest expense fell 1% despite the higher balances. RJBank has benefited from the declining interest rate environment as the rates on the interest earning assets have declined at a slower pace than the rates paid on deposits. In addition, RJBank corporate loan portfolio is predominantly LIBOR based and LIBOR was unusually high in comparison to other rates for a period of time during the year, generating particularly good spreads. The growth in loan balances at RJBank gave rise to an attendant increase in loan loss provisions; the provisions for loan loss and unfunded lending commitments were $57.1 million compared to $32.1 million in the prior year. Net loan charge-offs for the year were $13.6 million compared to $1.1 million in the prior year. RJBank has no exposure to subprime loans. 35 In addition to the increase in the allowance for loan loss, charge-offs and nonperforming assets have increased as the loan portfolio has grown and aged. The Company does not believe that this is related to a significant decline in the loan credit quality other than for loans to borrowers in the Residential Acquisition and Development/Homebuilder industry. During the year ended September 30, 2008, RJBank experienced some credit quality deterioration in corporate credits in this industry segment. Four credits in this segment account for approximately $35.7 million in nonaccrual loans (91% of the nonperforming corporate assets above) and three of those credits contributed $8.5 million in net charge-offs (83% of the corporate loan charge-offs above) for the year ended September 30, 2008. Total loans outstanding and commitments in this industry segment are $98 million and $116 million, respectively. Committed exposures to this industry segment have been reduced by more than 40% over the past year. Credit trends in other segments of our corporate loan portfolio have remained relatively stable to date. RJBank does not own any payment option ARM loans or subprime mortgage loans. Shared National Credits ( SNCs ), large syndicated corporate loans that are reviewed under a common program in which several bank regulatory agencies participate, comprise approximately 90% of RJBank corporate loan portfolio. RJBank residential loan portfolio consists of 76% in interest-only mortgages. 7% of the residential loan portfolio was originated under a streamlined documentation feature for high net worth clients or with reduced documentation, which may be considered Alt A. However, for streamlined documentation, very strict standards must be met including a minimum $1.0 million account relationship, maximum loan-to-value ( LTV ) of 70%, and minimum credit score of 720. In addition, the streamlined documentation feature is only available for purchases and is not available for cash out refinance transactions. As of October 31, 2008, the unrealized loss on the Company available for sale securities portfolio was $114.4 million, compared to $89.0 million as of September 30, 2008, a decrease in value of $25.4 million. The decline in value was due to a significant widening of interest rate spreads across market sectors related to the continued illiquidity and uncertainty in the markets. No factors were identified that would indicate additional securities were considered to be other-than-temporarily impaired and therefore had no impact on earnings. Year ended September 30, 2007 Compared with the Year ended September 30, 2006 - RJBank The Company completed its second bulk transfer of cash balances into the RJBank Deposit Program in March 2007, moving another $1.3 billion. This, combined with organic growth from the influx of new client assets, resulted in a $2.6 billion increase in average deposit balances. This increase in average deposit balances provided the funding for the $1.6 billion increase in average loan balances. This increase was 38% purchased residential mortgage pools and 62% corporate loans, 98% of which are purchased interests in corporate loan syndications with the remainder originated by RJBank. As a result of this growth, RJBank net interest income increased 108% to $84.5 million. Due to robust loan growth, the associated allowance for loan losses that are established upon recording a new loan and making new unfunded commitments required a provision of over $32 million in 2007. Accordingly, RJBank pre-tax income increased only 69%. During periods of growth when new loans are originated or purchased, an allowance for loan losses is established for potential losses inherent in those new loans. Accordingly, a robust period of growth generally results in charges to earnings in that period, while the benefits of higher interest earnings are realized in later periods. 36 The following table presents average balance data and operating interest income and expense data for the Company's banking operations, as well as the related interest yields and rates and interest spread for the years indicated: Year Ended September 30, 2008 September 30, 2007 September 30, 2006 Operating Average Operating Average Operating Average Average Interest Yield/ Average Interest Yield/ Average Interest Yield/ Balance Inc./Exp.

(2) Negotiable Order of Withdrawal ( NOW ) account. (3) The increase in interest spreads is due to a rapid decline in short-term interest rates, which led to a decline in RJBank cost of funds. (4) RJBank has gone through a period of rapid loan growth and accordingly established allowances for loan losses for potential losses inherent in the loan portfolios. These charges to earnings have a negative impact on returns during periods of loan growth. Increases and decreases in interest income and operating interest expense result from changes in average balances (volume) of interest-earning banking assets and liabilities, as well as changes in average interest rates. The following table shows the effect that these factors had on the interest earned on RJBank's interest-earning assets and the interest incurred on its interest-bearing liabilities. The effect of changes in volume is determined by multiplying the change in volume by the previous year's average yield/cost. Similarly, the effect of rate changes is calculated by multiplying the change in average yield/cost by the previous year's volume. Changes applicable to both volume and rate have been allocated proportionately . 38 2008 Compared to 2007 2007 Compared to 2006 Increase (Decrease) Due To Increase (Decrease) Due To Volume Rate Total Volume Rate Total (in 000 s) Interest Revenue Interest-Earning Banking Assets: Loans, Net of Unearned Income $ 191,005 $ (49,404) $141,601 $ 93,992 $ 15,601 $ 109,593 Reverse Repurchase Agreements (4,873) (18,726) (23,599) 40,189 (248) 39,941 Agency Mortgage Backed Securities 1,468 (4,328) (2,860) 2,092 1,161 3,253 Non-agency Collateralized Mortgage Obligations 8,435 2,231 10,666 11,285 372 11,657 Other Government Agency Obligations - - - (404) - (404) Corporate Debt and Asset Backed Securities - - - (499) - (499) Money Market Funds, Cash and Cash Equivalents 7,145 (4,262) 2,883 723 203 926 FHLB Stock and Other 317 (133) 184 (318) 34 (284) Total Interest-Earning Banking Assets $ 203,497 $ (74,622) $ 128,875 $ 147,060 $ 17,123 $ 164,183 Interest Expense Interest-Bearing Banking Liabilities: Retail Deposits: Certificates Of Deposit $ 119 $ (360) $ (241) $ (1,227) $ 1,376 $ 149 Money Market, Savings and NOW Accounts 138,808 (144,297) (5,489) 103,372 25,056 128,428 FHLB Advances and Other 4,426 (906) 3,520 (8,577) 218 (8,359) Total Interest-Bearing Banking Liabilities 143,353 (145,563) (2,210) 93,568 26,650 120,218 Change in Net Operating Interest Income $ 60,144 $ 70,941 $131,085 $ 53,492 $ (9,527) $ 43,965 Results of Operations Emerging Markets Year Ended September 30, % Incr.

The results in the emerging market segment declined from a $3.6 million profit in the prior year to a $3.3 million loss in fiscal 2008. This decline was a result of a greater decline in revenues than an increase in expenses. Expenses were impacted by the Company investment in Brazil. The global economic slowdown and credit crisis significantly impacted emerging markets in all business lines. Commission revenue declined 23% as the economic slowdown and a series of political crises in Turkey and Argentina severely undermined investors confidence in these countries. Trading profits declined due to losses taken in proprietary positions in Turkey. The commission expense portion of compensation expense declined in proportion to the decline in commission revenue. Other expenses in the prior year were unusually high due to the accrual of tax liabilities and the related legal expenses. The Company is still awaiting the final outcome of the court case in Turkey, and in light of the suspension of the entity license, its ability to continue as a going concern is uncertain. The Company has fully reserved for its investment in the Turkish joint venture. Accordingly, pre-tax earnings do not include any net impact of the Turkish joint venture. Year ended September 30, 2007 Compared with the Year ended September 30, 2006 Emerging Markets This segment consists of the results of the Company joint ventures in Argentina, Uruguay and Turkey. Securities commissions declined in Turkey, increased in Argentina, and the joint venture in India generated $2 million in commissions in fiscal 2006 whereas none were included in fiscal 2007 due to the Company sale of its interest in this joint venture early in 2007. Investment banking revenues were flat. Trading profits increased $3.5 million in Argentina, stemming from a large volume of ADR trades. Other income includes the $2.5 million gain on the sale of the Company interest in its joint venture in India. The $2 million increase in expense is predominantly related to the accrual of estimated tax liabilities in Turkey . Results of Operations Stock Loan/Borrow Year Ended September 30, % Incr.

The vast majority of the balances continue to be matched book business with similar asset and liability balances. Average spreads on the matched book business increased from 0.5% to 0.65%, resulting in the increased net interest. Expenses were lower than in the prior year resulting in a 41% increase in pre-tax profits. Year ended September 30, 2007 Compared with the Year ended September 30, 2006 Stock Loan/Borrow The Company stock borrow balances averaged $1.1 billion during fiscal year 2007 vs. $1.0 billion in fiscal 2006. The Company stock loan balances are predominantly the result of a matched-book however, box loan/borrow balances are also carried. As the Company stock loan business is predominantly a matched-book business, stock borrow balances were similar. Average spreads decreased from 2.0% in fiscal 2006 to 0.5% in 2007, resulting in a 24% decrease in net interest income and a 37% decrease in pre-tax profits. 40 Results of Operations Proprietary Capital The following table presents consolidated financial information for the Propriety Capital segment for the years indicated: Year Ended September 30, % Incr.

Expenses in this segment are predominantly executive compensation and certain compensation accruals related to the Company benefit plans as a result of increased profitability at RJBank. Year ended September 30, 2007 Compared with the Year ended September 30, 2006 - Other Revenue in the Other segment includes $1 million in gains on corporate investments, including Eagle asset managed accounts, and nearly $3 million in proceeds from company owned life insurance. Interest income represents earnings on available corporate cash balances. Expenses in this segment are predominantly executive compensation. Liquidity and Capital Resources The Company senior management establishes the liquidity and capital policies of the Company. These policies include senior management review of short- and long-term cash flow forecasts, review of monthly capital expenditures, the monitoring of the availability of alternative sources of financing, and the daily monitoring of liquidity in the Company significant subsidiaries. Decisions on the allocation of capital to business units considers, among other factors, projected profitability and cash flow, risk and impact on future liquidity needs. The Company Treasury Department assists in evaluating, monitoring and controlling the impact that the Company business activities have on its financial condition, liquidity and capital structure as well as maintains the relationships the Company has with various lenders. The objectives of these policies are to support the successful execution of the Company business strategies while ensuring ongoing and sufficient liquidity. The unprecedented volatility of the financial markets, accompanied by a severe deterioration of economic conditions worldwide, has had a pronounced adverse affect on the availability of credit through traditional sources. As a result of concern about the stability of the markets generally and the strength of counterparties specifically, many lenders have reduced and, in some cases, ceased to provide funding to the Company. See Sources of Liquidity-Borrowings section below for additional information. Further, the current environment is not conducive to most types of financings. Liquidity is provided primarily through the Company business operations and financing activities. Cash provided by operating activities during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2008 was approximately $84.3 million, primarily attributable to the decrease in stock borrowed receivables, the modest increases in brokerage client deposits (directly correlated to the increase in segregated assets) and payables to broker-dealers and clearing organizations. This was partially offset by the decrease in stock loaned payables and modest increases in segregated assets. Investing activities used $2.7 billion, which is primarily due to activity at RJBank, including loans originated and purchased and purchases of available for sale securities. This was partially offset by loan repayments, the reduction in securities purchased under agreements to resell and maturations and repayments of available for sale securities at RJBank. Financing activities provided $5.2 billion, the result of an increase in deposits at RJBank, proceeds from borrowed funds, which includes a $1.9 billion overnight borrowing to meet point-in-time regulatory balance sheet composition requirements related to RJBank qualifying as a thrift institution, and cash provided from the exercise of stock options and employee stock purchases. This was partially offset by the purchase of treasury stock, including the open market purchase of 2.7 million shares during the fiscal year, and the payment of cash dividends. The Company believes its existing assets, most of which are liquid in nature, together with funds generated from operations and potential external financing, should provide adequate funds for continuing operations at current levels of activity. 42 Sources of Liquidity In addition to the liquidity provided through the Company business operations, the Company has various potential sources of capital. Liquidity Available from Subsidiaries The Company two principal domestic broker-dealer subsidiaries are required to maintain net capital equal to the greater of $250,000 or 2% of aggregate debit balances arising from customer transactions. At September 30, 2008, both of these brokerage subsidiaries far exceeded their minimum net capital requirements. At that date, these subsidiaries had excess net capital of $324.1 million, of which approximately $150 to $200 million is available for dividend (subject to cash availability and possibly to regulatory approval) while still maintaining a capital level well above regulatory early warning guidelines. Subject to notification and in some cases approval by the OTS, RJBank may dividend to the Company as long as RJBank maintains its well capitalized status under bank regulatory capital guidelines. Liquidity available to the Company from its subsidiaries, other than its broker-dealer subsidiaries and RJBank, is not limited by regulatory requirements. Borrowings and Financing Arrangements The following table presents the Company financial arrangements as of September 30, 2008: Committed Committed Uncommitted Uncommitted Total Financing Unsecured Secured Secured Unsecured Arrangements (in 000 s) RJA (with third party lenders) $ - $ 150,000 $ 835,100 $ 200,000 $ 1,185,100 RJA (with related parties) - - 360,000 - 360,000 RJF 200,000 - - - 200,000 Total Company $ 200,000 $ 150,000 $ 1,195,100 $ 200,000 $ 1,745,100 43 At September 30, 2008, the Company maintained three 364-day committed and several uncommitted financing arrangements denominated in U.S. dollars and one uncommitted line of credit denominated in Canadian dollars ( CDN ). At September 30, 2008, the aggregate domestic facilities were $1.4 billion and the Canadian line of credit was CDN $40 million with third party lenders. Shortly before the fiscal year end, the lender in RJA $600 million uncommitted tri-party repurchase arrangement notified RJA that this facility was on hold and financing was not available until further notice, pending the completion of the lender acquisition by a new parent. Subsequent to September 30, 2008, $50 million of RJA uncommitted, unsecured lines of credit were cancelled. Lenders are under no obligation to lend to the Company under uncommitted lines and there have been several recent instances where they were unwilling to do so. RJF maintained a $200 million committed unsecured revolving line of credit which was fully drawn at September 30, 2008. RJF committed line of credit is subject to a 0.125% per annum facility fee. Upon expiration in October 2008, RJF extended $100 million of its 364-day, unsecured revolving credit agreement to January 2009, subject to modification or renewal. The extended fully drawn facility amortizes 25% after one month, another 25% after two months, and the remaining 50% at the maturity date. RJA maintains a $50 million committed secured line of credit and a $100 million committed tri-party repurchase arrangement. There were collateralized financings of $80 million outstanding under the $100 million tri-party repurchase arrangement at September 30, 2008, which are included in Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition. RJA committed facilities are subject to 0.15% and 0.125% per annum facility fees, respectively. In addition, RJA maintains $235 million in uncommitted secured facilities. RJA also maintains $360 million in uncommitted tri-party repurchase arrangements with related parties. RJBank has provided $300 million of those uncommitted arrangements to RJA, which is guaranteed by RJF. Approximately $240 million is only available until January 30, 2009 under an exception from affiliate lending regulations granted by the OTS, unless the exemption is extended. Collateral for loans under secured lines of credit and securities sold under repurchase agreements (collectively collateral ) are Company owned and/or client margin securities, as permitted by regulatory requirements. The required market value of the collateral ranges from 102% to 125% of the cash provided. At September 30, 2008, the $80 million outstanding is collateralized by company-owned securities with a market value of $89.4 million. Although the Company has $510 million committed or related party collateralized financing arrangements available, the Company inventory levels, which could serve as collateral, are substantially less. RJA supplements its secured lines of credit and repurchase arrangements with $200 million of uncommitted unsecured lines of credit. The interest rates for all of the Company financing facilities are variable and are based on the Fed Funds rate, LIBOR, or Canadian prime rate as applicable. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2008, interest rates on the financing facilities ranged from 1.58% to 7.75%. On September 30, 2008, RJBank had advances outstanding at the FHLB of $1.95 billion, which included $1.9 billion in overnight advances to meet point in time regulatory balance sheet composition requirements related to its qualifying as a thrift institution. The latter action was discussed well in advance with the OTS. These borrowed funds were invested in qualifying assets and the necessary qualification was met. Prior to the advance, the Company infused $120 million of additional capital into RJBank to ensure RJBank retained its well capitalized status as of September 30, 2008, under bank regulatory capital guidelines. After the $1.9 billion advance was repaid on October 1, 2008, RJBank made a return of capital distribution of $60 million back to RJF on October 2, 2008, to return a portion of the excess capital above the amount necessary to meet all regulatory capital requirements for well capitalized status. Due to its outstanding overnight advances, RJBank had no immediate credit available from the FHLB at September 30, 2008 but had total available credit of $1.38 billion with the pledging of additional collateral to the FHLB. Following the repayment of the $1.9 billion overnight advance on October 1, 2008, RJBank had $1.71 billion in immediate credit available from the FHLB and total available credit of $3.29 billion with the pledging of additional collateral to the FHLB. The Company joint ventures in Turkey and Argentina have settlement lines of credit. The Company has guaranteed certain of these settlement lines of credit as follows: one in Turkey totaling $8 million and one in Argentina for $9 million. At September 30, 2008, there were no outstanding balances on the settlement lines in Argentina or Turkey. At September 30, 2008, these joint ventures had aggregate unsecured settlement lines of credit available of $40.5 million, and there were no outstanding balances on these lines. The interest rates for these lines of credit ranged from 9% to 18%. Subsequent to September 30, 2008, the Company Turkish joint venture has had to halt all trading activities due to a technical capital inadequacy. See Legal and Regulatory section below for additional information. At September 30, 2008 and September 30, 2007, the Company had loans payable of $2.2 billion and $122.6 million, respectively. The balance at September 30, 2008 is comprised of a $62.2 million loan for its home-office complex, $1.95 billion in FHLB advances (RJBank), and $200 million outstanding on its committed line of credit. 44 Other Sources of Liquidity The Company is pursuing eligibility for the FDIC Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program ( TLGP ). Participation in the TLGP would be expected to assist the Company in obtaining up to $250 million of senior unsecured debt financing at the holding company level. The Company is pursuing several alternative forms of debt financing that could utilize the TLGP, if eligibility is obtained. It is also pursuing other forms of debt financing that would not benefit from the TLGP. There is no assurance that either form of financing will be obtained. The Company believes that it qualifies to participate in the U.S. Treasury Capital Purchase Program ( CPP ) and submitted an application through its primary regulator in November 2008. While there is no guarantee that the Company will be approved, the Company estimates that this program could provide up to approximately $300 million in new preferred equity, at rates substantially discounted to current market rates. While the Company views additional capital as beneficial in the current environment, it would also have the potential to significantly improve the Company liquidity position, which would be important in the event that TLGP eligibility is not obtained. If the Company were unable to obtain external financing, it may be necessary to reduce cash contributions to its subsidiaries, extract capital from its subsidiaries to the extent permitted to maintain continued compliance with regulatory requirements or reduce investments in private equity and venture capital endeavors. Those courses of action could result in foregoing opportunities to recruit additional financial advisors or acquire new business operations, reducing inventory levels of carried securities or scaling back of current business operations. A consequence of any of those courses of action would likely have a negative impact on near term earnings. Statement of Financial Condition Analysis The Company statement of financial condition consists primarily of cash and cash equivalents (a large portion of which are segregated for the benefit of customers), receivables and payables. Total assets of $18.8 billion (excluding the cash received from the $1.9 billion overnight borrowing at RJBank) at September 30, 2008 were up approximately 16% over September 30, 2007. Most of this increase is due to the growth of RJBank, with the increased loan balances being funded by increased deposits. RJBank loan balances increased significantly as the Company took advantage of quality loans available for purchase at attractive prices resulting from a desire for liquidity in the markets in response to the credit crisis. Significant decreases in assets were in securities purchased under agreements to resell and stock borrowed receivables (stock loaned payables experienced a similar decrease on the liability side). The broker-dealer gross assets and liabilities, including trading inventory, stock loan/borrow, receivables and payables from/to brokers, dealers and clearing organizations and clients fluctuate with the Company's business levels and overall market conditions. As of September 30, 2008, the Company's liabilities were comprised primarily of deposits of $8.8 billion at RJBank and brokerage client payables of $5.8 billion at the broker-dealer subsidiaries, as well as loans payable of $312 million (excluding $1.9 billion in overnight borrowings at RJBank, which were repaid on October 1, 2008). The Company primarily acts as an intermediary in stock loan/borrow transactions. As a result, the liability of $696 million associated with the stock loan transactions is related to the $675 million receivable comprised of the Company's cash deposits for stock borrowed transactions. To meet its obligations to clients and operating needs, the Company has approximately $1.3 billion in cash (excluding the cash received from the $1.9 billion overnight borrowing at RJBank) and $4.3 billion in assets segregated pursuant to regulations. The Company also has client brokerage receivables of $1.9 billion and $7.1 billion in loans at RJBank. 45 Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies The Company has contractual obligations to make future payments in connection with its short and long-term debt, non-cancelable lease agreements, partnership investments, commitments to extend credit, loans purchased but not settled, underwriting commitments and a naming rights agreement. The following table sets forth these contractual obligations by fiscal year: Total 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter (in 000 s) Long-Term Debt $ 112,224 $ 2,891 $ 23,060 $ 33,239 $ 3,429 $ 3,630 $ 45,975 Variable Interest Entities Loans Payable (1) 102,564 13,987 12,489 12,967 13,030 13,425 36,666 Short-Term Debt (2) 2,100,000 2,100,000 - - - - - Operating Leases 200,262 36,345 33,534 29,510 25,228 20,655 54,990 Investments Private Equity Partnerships (3) 48,700 48,700 - - - - - Certificates of Deposit 248,207 129,974 54,264 34,559 11,295 18,115 - Commitments to Extend Credit - RJBank (4) 2,727,493 2,727,493 - - - - - RJBank Loans Purchased, Not Yet Settled 8,500 8,500 - - - - - Commitments to Real Estate Partnerships (5) 60,800 60,800 - - - - - RJ Multi-Family Finance Loan Commitments 26,038 20,176 5,862 - - - - Commitments to Unsold RJTCF Fund Interests (5) 75,000 75,000 - - - - - Underwriting Commitments 8,669 8,669 - - - - - Naming Rights for Raymond James Stadium 26,937 3,278 3,409 3,545 3,687 3,835 9,183 Total $5,745,394 $5,235,813 $ 132,618 $ 113,820 $ 56,669 $ 59,660 $ 146,814 (1) Loans which are non-recourse to the Company. See Notes 6 and 9 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. (2) Includes $1.9 billion in overnight borrowing to meet point-in-time regulatory balance sheet composition requirements related to RJBank qualifying as a thrift institution. This borrowing was repaid on October 1, 2008. (3) The Company has committed a total of $56.3 million, in amounts ranging from $200,000 to $5 million, to 42 different independent venture capital or private equity partnerships. As of September 30, 2008, the Company has invested $36.3 million of that amount and has received $30.2 million in distributions. Additionally, the Company is the general partner in two internally sponsored private equity limited partnerships to which it has committed $14 million. Of that amount, the Company has invested $13.0 million and has received $9.2 million in distributions as of September 30, 2008. The Company is not the controlling general partner in another internally sponsored private equity limited partnership to which it has committed $30 million. As of September 30, 2008, the Company has invested $2.3 million of that amount and has not received any distributions. Although the combined remaining balance of $48.7 million has been included in fiscal year 2009 above, the contributions to the partnerships may occur after that time and are dependent upon the timing of the capital calls by the general partners. (4) Because many commitments expire without being funded in whole or part, the contract amounts are not estimates of future liquidity requirements. (5) RJTCF is committed to additional future fundings related to real estate partnerships. The Company Board of Directors approved up to $200 million in short-term or mezzanine financing investments, primarily related to investment banking transactions. As of September 30, 2008, the Company did not have any such investments. The Board of Directors has approved the use of up to $75 million for investment in proprietary merchant banking opportunities. As of September 30, 2008, the Company has invested $32.3 million. The use of this capital is subject to availability of funds. 46 The Company is authorized by the Board of Directors to repurchase its common stock for general corporate purposes. There is no formal stock repurchase plan at this time. In May 2004 the Board authorized the repurchase of up to $75 million of shares. During March 2008, the Company exhausted this authorization. On March 11, 2008, the Board of Directors authorized an additional $75 million for repurchases at the discretion of the Board Share Repurchase Committee. As of September 30, 2008 the unused portion of this authorization was $72.1 million. RJBank provides to its affiliate, Raymond James Capital Services, Inc. (RJCS), on behalf of certain corporate borrowers, a guarantee of payment in the event of the borrower default for exposure under interest rate swaps entered into with RJCS. At September 30, 2008, the aggregate exposure under these guarantees was $2.5 million, which was underwritten as part of the larger corporate credit relationships. There was no aggregate exposure at September 30, 2007. The estimated total potential exposure under these guarantees is $12.1 million. RJBank has outstanding at any time a significant number of commitments to extend credit, and other credit-related off balance sheet financial instruments such as standby letters of credit and loan purchases. Because many loan commitments expire without being funded in whole or part, the contract amounts are not estimates of the Company future liquidity requirements. Based on the underlying terms and conditions of these loans, management believes it is highly unlikely that a material percentage of these commitments would be drawn. Many of these loan commitments have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and, historically, a large percentage of the letters of credit expire without being funded. As of September 30, 2008, RJBank had entered into overnight reverse repurchase agreements totaling $705 million with three counterparties, with individual exposures of $350 million, $305 million and $50 million. Although RJBank is exposed to risk that these counterparties may not fulfill their contractual obligations, the Company believes the risk of default is minimal due to the creditworthiness of these counterparties, which is closely monitored, collateral received and the short duration of these agreements. The Company has also committed to lend to RJTCF, or guarantee obligations in connection with RJTCF low income housing development/rehabilitation and syndication activities, aggregating up to $125 million upon request, subject to certain limitations as well as annual review and renewal. RJTCF borrows in order to invest in partnerships that purchase and develop properties qualifying for tax credits. These investments in project partnerships are then sold to various tax credit funds, which have third party investors, and for which RJTCF serves as the managing member or general partner. RJTCF typically sells these investments within 90 days of their acquisition, and the proceeds from the sales are used to repay RJTCF borrowings. During the quarter ended September 30, 2008, the Company made a commitment to purchase and potentially hold up to $75 million of unsold interests in one of RJTCF current fund offerings. In such an event, the Company would expect to resell these interests to other investors, however the holding period of these interests could be much longer than 90 days. Subsequent to September 30, 2008, RJTCF closed this fund offering and purchased $58 million of the unsold interests. In addition to the interests purchased, RJTCF provided certain specific performance guarantees to the investors of the fund. The Company has guaranteed RJTCF $58 million capital contribution obligation as well as the specified performance guarantees provided to the fund investors. Additionally, RJTCF may make short-term loans or advances to project partnerships on behalf of the tax credit funds in which it serves as managing member or general partner. At September 30, 2008, cash funded to invest in either loans or investments in project partnerships was $30.3 million. At September 30, 2008, RJTCF is also committed to additional future fundings of $45.9 million related to project partnerships that have not yet been sold to various tax credit funds (including the fund offering mentioned previously that the Company made a commitment to purchase and potentially hold up to $75 million of unsold interests). The Company and RJTCF also issue certain guarantees to various third parties related to project partnerships, interests in which have been or are expected to be sold to one or more tax credit funds under RJTCF management. In some instances, RJTCF is not the primary guarantor of these obligations which aggregate to a cumulative maximum obligation of approximately $14.9 million as of September 30, 2008. Through RJTCF wholly owned lending subsidiary, Raymond James Multi-Family Finance, Inc., certain construction loans or loans of longer duration ( permanent loans ) may be made directly to certain project partnerships. As of September 30, 2008, nine such construction loans are outstanding with an unfunded balance of $20.2 million available for future draws on such loans. Similarly, five permanent loan commitments are outstanding as of September 30, 2008. Each of these commitments will only be funded if certain conditions are achieved by the project partnership and in the event such conditions are not met, generally expire two years after their issuance. The total amount of such unfunded permanent loan commitments as of September 30, 2008 is $5.9 million. 47 The Company is the lessor in a leveraged commercial aircraft transaction with Continental Airlines, Inc. ( Continental ). The Company's ability to realize its expected return is dependent upon this airline ability to fulfill its lease obligation. In the event that this airline defaults on its lease commitment and the Trustee for the debt holders is unable to re-lease or sell the plane with adequate terms, the Company would suffer a loss of some or all of its investment. The value of the Company leveraged lease with Continental was approximately $8.8 million as of September 30, 2008. The Company's equity investment represented 20% of the aggregate purchase price; the remaining 80% was funded by public debt issued in the form of equipment trust certificates. The residual value of the aircraft at the end of the lease term of approximately 17 years is projected to be 15% of the original cost. This lease expires in May 2014. Although Continental remains current on its lease payments to the Company, the inability of Continental to make its lease payments, or the termination or modification of the lease through a bankruptcy proceeding, could result in the write-down of the Company's investment and the acceleration of certain income tax payments. The Company continues to monitor this lessee for specific events or circumstances that would increase the likelihood of a default on Continental obligations under this lease. The Company utilizes client marginable securities to satisfy deposits with clearing organizations. At September 30, 2008, the Company had client margin securities valued at $210.0 million pledged with a clearing organization to meet the point in time requirement of $139.9 million. At September 30, 2007, the Company had client margin securities valued at $135.7 million pledged with a clearing organization to meet the point in time requirement of $67.5 million. In the normal course of business, certain subsidiaries of the Company act as general partner and may be contingently liable for activities of various limited partnerships. These partnerships engaged primarily in real estate activities. In the opinion of the Company, such liabilities, if any, for the obligations of the partnerships will not in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial position. See Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the Company's commitments and contingencies. In addition, see Item 3, Legal Proceedings, for discussion of auction rate securities ( ARS ) and the potential implications of the Company current liquidity position on its ability to resolve these matters. Regulatory The Company's broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to requirements of the SEC in the United States and the IIROC in Canada relating to liquidity and capital standards. The domestic broker-dealer subsidiaries of the Company are subject to the requirements of the Uniform Net Capital Rule (Rule 15c3-1) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. RJA, a member firm of FINRA, is also subject to the rules of FINRA, whose requirements are substantially the same. Rule 15c3-1 requires that aggregate indebtedness, as defined, not exceed 15 times net capital, as defined. Rule 15c3-1 also provides for an alternative net capital requirement , which RJA, RJFS, HFD and Raymond James (USA) Ltd. have elected. It requires that minimum net capital, as defined, be equal to the greater of $250,000 or 2% of Aggregate Debit Items arising from client transactions. FINRA may require a member firm to reduce its business if its net capital is less than four percent of Aggregate Debit Items and may prohibit a member firm from expanding its business and declaring cash dividends if its net capital is less than 5% of Aggregate Debit Items. RJA, RJFS, HFD, Raymond James (USA) Ltd. all had net capital in excess of minimum requirements as of September 30, 2008. RJ Ltd. is subject to the Minimum Capital Rule (By-Law No. 17 of the IIROC) and the Early Warning System (By-Law No. 30 of the IIROC). The Minimum Capital Rule requires that every member shall have and maintain at all times Risk Adjusted Capital greater than zero calculated in accordance with Form 1 (Joint Regulatory Financial Questionnaire and Report) and with such requirements as the Board of Directors of the IIROC may from time to time prescribe. Insufficient Risk Adjusted Capital may result in suspension from membership in the stock exchanges or the IIROC. The Early Warning System is designed to provide advance warning that a member firm is encountering financial difficulties. This system imposes certain sanctions on members who are designated in Early Warning Level 1 or Level 2 according to its capital, profitability, liquidity position, frequency of designation or at the discretion of the IIROC. Restrictions on business activities and capital transactions, early filing requirements, and mandated corrective measures are sanctions that may be imposed as part of the Early Warning System. RJ Ltd. was not in Early Warning Level 1 or Level 2 during fiscal 2008 or 2007. 48 RJBank is subject to various regulatory and capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory, and possibly, additional discretionary actions by regulators. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, RJBank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of RJBank's assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. RJBank's capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings, and other factors. Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require RJBank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of Total and Tier I Capital (as defined in the regulations) to risk-weighted assets (as defined). Management believes, as of September 30, 2008, that RJBank meets all capital adequacy requirements to which it is subject. See Notes 13 and 18 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the Company legal matters and regulatory environment. Critical Accounting Policies The Company financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The following is a summary of the Company critical accounting policies. For a full description of these and other accounting policies, see Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company believes that its significant accounting policies described below involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity. These critical accounting policies require estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses reported in the consolidated financial statements. Due to their nature, estimates involve judgments based upon available information. Actual results or amounts could differ from estimates and the difference could have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. Therefore, understanding these policies is important in understanding the reported results of operations and the financial position of the Company. Valuation of Financial Instruments and Other Assets Trading instruments and Available for sale securities are reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value. In accordance with SFAS 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities , unrealized gains and losses related to these financial instruments are reflected in net income or other comprehensive income, depending on the underlying purpose of the instrument. See Notes 2, 3, and 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. The following table presents the Company trading instruments and available for sale securities segregated into trading securities (i.e., non-derivative), derivative contracts, and available for sale securities: September 30, 2008 Financial Instruments Owned at Fair Value Financial Instruments Sold but not yet Purchased at Fair Value (in 000 s) Trading Securities $ 278,693 $ 104,454 Derivative Contracts 46,393 30,250 Available for Sale Securities 577,933 - Total $ 903,019 $ 134,704 49 Trading Securities, Derivative Contracts and Available for Sale Securities Trading securities are valued at fair market value, and securities which are not readily marketable are carried at estimated fair value as determined by management with changes recognized in current earnings. To corroborate management estimated valuation, the Company uses prices from independent sources, which include pricing services. Depending upon the type of security, the pricing service may provide a listed price or a matrix price. If listed market prices are unavailable to the pricing service, then it may use other methods including broker or dealer price quotations, or spread-based models periodically re-calibrated to market trades in similar securities in order to derive the fair value of the instruments. For positions in securities that do not have available determinable fair values, the Company uses estimated fair values. Estimated fair values are determined by management based upon consideration of available information, including trading levels of similar securities, standard spread-based pricing models re-calibrated from time to time to trade activity in in similar assets, the coupon level and possible early redemption features of the security, and current financial information regarding the issuer. Fair values for derivative contracts are obtained from pricing models that consider current market trading levels and the contractual prices for the underlying financial instruments, as well as time value and yield curve or other volatility factors underlying the positions. Changes in fair value of derivative contracts are recognized into current earnings. The fair value of available for sale securities is based on bid quotations received from a pricing service or securities dealers with changes to fair value being recognized in Other Comprehensive Income. Positions valued in this manner represent approximately 98% of the available for sale portfolio. If these sources are not available or are deemed unreliable when an active market does not exist, then the fair value is estimated using quoted market prices for similar securities, pricing models, or discounted cash flow analyses, using observable market data where available. Unrealized losses deemed to be other-than-temporary for available for sale securities are included in current period earnings within Other Revenue and a new cost basis for the security is established. In order to evaluate the Company risk exposure and any potential impairment of these securities, characteristics of each security owned such as collateral type, delinquency and foreclosure levels, credit enhancement, projected loan losses and collateral coverage are reviewed monthly by management. These factors, in addition to the Company intent and ability to hold the investment for a time period sufficient to allow for the anticipated valuation recovery to the Company cost basis, are also considered in determining whether these securities are other-than-temporarily impaired. Evidence considered in this assessment includes the reasons for the impairment, the severity and duration of the impairment, changes in value subsequent to year-end, and forecasted performance of the security. The following table presents the carrying value of trading securities, derivative contracts and available for sale securities for which fair value is measured based on quoted prices or other independent sources versus those for which fair value is determined by management: September 30, 2008 Financial Instruments Owned at Fair Value Financial Instruments Sold but not yet Purchased at Fair Value (in 000 s) Fair Value Based on Quoted Prices and Independent Sources $ 833,795 $ 104,454 Fair Value Determined by Management (1) 69,224 30,250 Total $ 903,019 $ 134,704 (1) Includes trading securities which are not readily marketable and derivative contracts. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (the Act ) was signed into law on October 3, 2008. The Act grants the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury authority to purchase debt securities from and make capital injections into financial institutions. The Act was a significant change in circumstances that occurred after September 30, 2008, that has not been considered in the Company assessment of whether securities are other-than-temporarily impaired as of September 30, 2008. 50 Private Equity Investments Private equity investments, held primarily by the Company Proprietary Capital segment, are reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition at management estimate of fair value. The valuation of these investments requires significant management judgment due to the absence of quoted market prices, inherent lack of liquidity and long-term nature of these assets. Direct private equity investments are valued initially at transaction price until significant transactions or developments indicate that a change in the carrying values of these investments is appropriate. Generally, the carrying values of these investments will be adjusted based on financial performance, investment-specific events, financing and sales transactions with third parties and changes in market outlook. Investments in funds structured as limited partnerships are generally valued using similar methodologies. As of September 30, 2008, the Company had $169.7 million in direct and third party private equity investments, which represented less than 1% of its total assets. Goodwill Goodwill is related to the acquisitions of Roney & Co. (now part of RJA) and Goepel McDermid, Inc. (now called Raymond James Ltd.). This goodwill, totaling $63 million, was allocated to the reporting units within the Private Client Group and Capital Markets segments pursuant to SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets . Goodwill represents the excess cost of a business acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired. In accordance with this pronouncement, indefinite-life intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Rather, they are subject to impairment testing on an annual basis, or more often if events or circumstances indicate there may be impairment. This test involves assigning tangible assets and liabilities, identified intangible assets and goodwill to reporting units and comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount. If the fair value is less than the carrying amount, a further test is required to measure the amount of the impairment. When available, the Company uses recent, comparable transactions to estimate the fair value of the respective reporting units. The Company calculates an estimated fair value based on multiples of revenues, earnings, and book value of comparable transactions. However, when such comparable transactions are not available or have become outdated, the Company uses discounted cash flow scenarios to estimate the fair value of the reporting units. As of September 30, 2008, goodwill had been allocated to the Private Client Group of RJA, and both the Private Client Group and Capital Markets segments of Raymond James Limited ( RJ Ltd. ). As of the most recent impairment test performed in March 2008, the Company determined that the carrying value of the goodwill for each reporting unit had not been impaired. However, changes in current circumstances or business conditions could result in an impairment of goodwill. As required, the Company will continue to perform impairment testing on an annual basis or when an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. Subsequent to September 30, 2008, stocks at financial institutions, including the Company s, are experiencing significant downward pressure in connection with the current economic downturn. As a result, the Company will evaluate whether it needs to perform an impairment test during the quarter ending December 31, 2008. Allowance for Loan Losses and Other Provisions The Company recognizes liabilities for contingencies when there is an exposure that, when fully analyzed, indicates it is both probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. When a range of probable loss can be estimated, the Company accrues the most likely amount; if not determinable, the Company accrues at least the minimum of the range of probable loss. The Company records reserves related to legal proceedings in Trade and Other Payables. Such reserves are established and maintained in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies" ( SFAS 5 ), and Financial Interpretation No. 14, Reasonable Estimation of the Amount of a Loss ( FIN 14 ). The determination of these reserve amounts requires significant judgment on the part of management. Management considers many factors including, but not limited to: the amount of the claim; the amount of the loss in the client's account; the basis and validity of the claim; the possibility of wrongdoing on the part of an employee of the Company; previous results in similar cases; and legal precedents and case law. Each legal proceeding is reviewed with counsel in each accounting period and the reserve is adjusted as deemed appropriate by management. Lastly, each case is reviewed to determine if it is probable that insurance coverage will apply, in which case the reserve is reduced accordingly. Any change in the reserve amount is recorded in the consolidated financial statements and is recognized as a charge/credit to earnings in that period. 51 The Company also records reserves or allowances for doubtful accounts related to client receivables and loans. Client receivables at the broker-dealers are generally collateralized by securities owned by the brokerage clients. Therefore, when a receivable is considered to be impaired, the amount of the impairment is generally measured based on the fair value of the securities acting as collateral, which is measured based on current prices from independent sources such as listed market prices or broker-dealer price quotations. Client loans at RJBank are generally collateralized by real estate or other property. RJBank provides for both an allowance for losses in accordance with SFAS 5, and a reserve for individually impaired loans in accordance with SFAS No. 114, "Accounting by a Creditor for Impairment of a Loan." The calculation of the SFAS 5 allowance is subjective as management segregates the loan portfolio into different homogeneous classes and assigns each class an allowance percentage based on the perceived risk associated with that class of loans. The factors taken into consideration when assigning the reserve percentage to each reserve category include estimates of borrower default probabilities and collateral values; trends in delinquencies; volume and terms; changes in geographic distribution, lending policies, local, regional, and national economic conditions; concentrations of credit risk and past loss history. In addition, the Company provides for potential losses inherent in RJBank unfunded lending commitments using the criteria above, further adjusted for an estimated probability of funding. A commercial loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. For individual loans identified as impaired, RJBank measures impairment based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate, the loan's observable market price, or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is supported by collateral. At September 30, 2008, the amortized cost of all RJBank loans was $7.2 billion and an allowance for loan losses of $88.2 million was recorded against that balance. The total allowance for loan losses, including $9.2 million in reserves for off-balance sheet exposures maintained in Trade and Other Payables, is equal to 1.35% of the amortized cost of the loan portfolio. The following table allocates RJBank allowance for loan losses by loan category: September 30, September 30, September 30, 2008 2007 2006 Loan Category Loan Category Loan Category as a % of as a % of as a % of Total Loans Total Loans Total Loans Allowance Receivable Allowance Receivable Allowance Receivable ($ in 000 s) Commercial Loans (1) $10,147 10% $ 4,471 7% $ 3,663 12% Real Estate Construction Loans 7,061 5% 2,121 3% 548 2% Commercial Real Estate Loans (2) 62,197 49% 35,766 49% 10,603 28% Residential Mortgage Loans 8,589 36% 4,659 41% 3,878 58% Consumer Loans 161 - 5 - 2 - Total $88,155 100% $47,022 100% $18,694 100% (1) Loans not secured by real estate.

(2) Loans wholly or partially secured by real estate. The Company also makes loans or pays advances to Financial Advisors, primarily for recruiting and retention purposes. The Company provides for an allowance for doubtful accounts based on an evaluation of the Company ability to collect such receivables. The Company ongoing evaluation includes the review of specific accounts of Financial Advisors no longer associated with the Company and the Company historical collection experience. At September 30, 2008 the receivable from Financial Advisors was $176.1 million, which is net of an allowance of $2.0 million for estimated uncollectibility. Income Taxes SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes , as interpreted by FIN 48, establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes. The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Company financial statements or tax returns. FIN No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes ( FIN 48 ), clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise financial statements in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ( SFAS ) No. 109, Accounting for income Taxes . FIN 48 establishes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Under FIN 48, evaluation of income tax benefits is a two-step process. First, income tax benefits can be recognized in financial statements for a tax position if it is considered more likely not (as defined in SFAS 5, Accounting for Contingencies ) of being sustained on audit based solely on the technical merits of the income tax position. Second, if the recognition criteria are met, the amount of income tax benefits to be recognized is measured based on the largest income tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely to be realized on ultimate resolution of the tax position. This interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim period, disclosure, and transition. Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Company financial statements or tax returns. Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact the Company financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. The Company recognizes the accrual of interest and penalties related to income tax matters in interest expense and other expense, respectively. See Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the Company income taxes. 53 Effects of recently issued accounting standards, not yet adopted In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements ( SFAS 157 ). SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements required under other accounting pronouncements, but does not change existing guidance as to whether or not an instrument is carried at fair value. SFAS 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 (October 1, 2008 for the Company), and interim periods within those fiscal years. Although the Company will have to comply with the additional disclosure requirements of this pronouncement, it does not expect SFAS 157 to have a material impact on the financial position or operating results of the Company. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities ( SFAS 159 ). SFAS 159 allows companies to elect to follow fair value accounting for certain financial assets and liabilities on an instrument by instrument basis. SFAS 159 is applicable only to certain financial instruments and is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 (October 1, 2008 for the Company). The Company does not expect SFAS 159 to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Company and elected not to adopt the fair value option for any recognized financial assets and liabilities as permitted by SFAS 159. In April 2007, the FASB issued Staff Position ( FSP ) FIN No. 39-1, "Amendment of FASB Interpretation No. 39 ( FSP FIN No. 39-1 ). FSP FIN No. 39-1 defines "right of setoff" and specifies what conditions must be met for a derivative contract to qualify for this right of setoff. FSP FIN No. 39-1 also addresses the applicability of a right of setoff to derivative instruments and clarifies the circumstances in which it is appropriate to offset amounts recognized for those instruments in the statement of financial position. In addition, this FSP permits offsetting of fair value amounts recognized for multiple derivative instruments executed with the same counterparty under a master netting arrangement and fair value amounts recognized for the right to reclaim cash collateral (a receivable) or the obligation to return cash collateral (a payable) arising from the same master netting arrangement as the derivative instruments. This interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 (October 1, 2008 for the Company), with early application permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of FSP FIN No. 39-1 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. In May 2007, the FASB issued FSP FIN No. 46R-7, "Application of FASB Interpretation No. 46(R) to Investment Companies". FSP FIN No. 46R-7 amends the scope of the exception to FIN 46R to state that investments accounted for at fair value in accordance with the specialized accounting guidance in the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants ("AICPA") Audit and Accounting Guide, Investment Companies, (the Guide ) are not subject to consolidation under FIN 46R. This FSP remains effective only upon initial adoption of Statement of Position ( SOP ) 07-1, "Clarification of the Scope of the Audit and Accounting Guide Investment Companies and Accounting by Parent Companies and Equity Method Investors for Investments in Investment Companies" ( SOP 07-1 ). The Company does not expect the adoption of FSP FIN No. 46R-7 to have a material impact on the consolidated financials. In June 2007, the Accounting Standards Executive Committee of the AICPA issued SOP 07-1. This SOP provides guidance for determining whether an entity is within the scope of the Guide. Additionally, it provides guidance as to whether a parent company or an equity method investor can apply the specialized industry accounting principles of the Guide (referred to as investment company accounting). In February 2008, the FASB issued FSP SOP 07-1-1, Effective Date of AICPA Statement of Position 07-1 , which delays indefinitely the effective date of SOP 07-1. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141R, Business Combinations ( SFAS 141R ). SFAS 141R provides new guidance on accounting for business combinations which includes the fundamental principle of recording the acquired business at fair value. In addition, this statement requires extensive disclosures about the acquisition quantitative and qualitative effects including validation of the fair value of goodwill. This statement is effective for all business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008 (October 1, 2009 for the Company). Earlier application is prohibited. 54 In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements ( SFAS 160 ). SFAS 160 requires noncontrolling interests to be treated as a separate component of equity, not as a liability or other item outside of permanent equity. This statement is applicable to the accounting for noncontrolling interests and transactions with noncontrolling interest holders in consolidated financial statements and is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2008 (October 1, 2009 for the Company). In February 2008, the FASB issued FSP SFAS No. 157-2, Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157 ( FSP SFAS No. 157-2 ). FSP SFAS No. 157-2 delays the effective date of SFAS No. 157 for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are not remeasured at fair value on a recurring basis (at least annually) until fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008 (October 1, 2009 for the Company), and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company does not expect the adoption of FSP SFAS No. 157-2 will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. In October 2008, the FASB issued FSP SFAS No. 157-3, Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset When the Market for That Asset is Not Active ( FSP SFAS No. 157-3 ). FSP SFAS No. 157-3 clarifies the application of SFAS 157 in a market that is not active and provides an example to illustrate key considerations in determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that financial asset is not active. This statement is effective upon issuance, but will be adopted once SFAS 157 is effective for the Company (October 1, 2008 for the Company). The Company does not expect the adoption of FSP SFAS No. 157-3 will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. In February 2008, the FASB issued FSP SFAS No. 140-3, Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assets and Repurchase Financing Transactions ( FSP SFAS No. 140-3 ). FSP SFAS No. 140-3 addresses the issue of whether these transactions should be viewed as two separate transactions or as one "linked" transaction. The FSP includes a "rebuttable presumption" that presumes linkage of the two transactions unless the presumption can be overcome by meeting certain criteria. The FSP will be effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008 (October 1, 2009 for the Company) and will apply only to original transfers made after that date; early adoption will not be allowed. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of FSP SFAS No. 140-3 will have on its consolidated financial statements. In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities ( SFAS 161 ). SFAS 161 requires companies to expand its disclosures regarding derivative instruments and hedging activities to include how and why an entity is using a derivative instrument or hedging activity, an explanation of its accounting under SFAS 133, and how this instrument affects the entity financial position and performance as well as cash flows. SFAS 161 also clarifies that derivative instruments are subject to concentration-of-credit-risk disclosures which amends SFAS 107, Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments . This statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008 (March 31, 2009 for the Company) with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of SFAS 161 will have on its consolidated financial statements. In June 2008, the FASB issued FSP Emerging Issues Task Force ( EITF ) 03-6-1, Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities ( FSP EITF 03-6-1 ). FSP EITF 03-6-1 requires unvested share-based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents to be treated as participating securities as defined in EITF Issue No. 03-6, "Participating Securities and the Two-Class Method under FASB Statement No. 128," and, therefore, included in the earnings allocation in computing earnings per share under the two-class method described in FASB Statement No. 128, Earnings per Share . This FSP is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008 (October 1, 2009 for the Company), and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of FSP EITF 03-6-1 will have on its consolidated financial statements. 55 Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Information concerning the Company's off balance sheet arrangements is included in Note 19 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Such information is hereby incorporated by reference. Effects of Inflation The Company's assets are primarily liquid in nature and are not significantly affected by inflation. However, the rate of inflation affects the Company's expenses, including employee compensation, communications and occupancy, which may not be readily recoverable through charges for services provided by the Company.
