INTRODUCTION On June 28, 2013 Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc. and its subsidiaries (formerly known as News Corporation) (together, Twenty-First Century Fox or the Company ) completed the separation of its business into two independent publicly traded companies (the Separation ) by distributing to its stockholders all of the outstanding shares of the new News Corporation ( News Corp ). The Company retained its interests in a global portfolio of media and entertainment assets spanning six continents. News Corp holds the Company former businesses including newspapers, information services and integrated marketing services, digital real estate services, book publishing, digital education and sports programming and pay-TV distribution in Australia. The Company completed the Separation by distributing to its stockholders one share of News Corp Class A common stock for every four shares of the Company Class A common stock held on June 21, 2013, and one share of News Corp Class B common stock for every four shares of the Company Class B common stock held on June 21, 2013. The Company stockholders received cash in lieu of fractional shares. Following the Separation, the Company does not beneficially own any shares of News Corp Class A common stock or News Corp Class B common stock. Effective June 28, 2013, the Separation qualified for discontinued operations treatment in accordance with ASC 205-20, Discontinued Operations , and accordingly the Company has deconsolidated News Corp balance sheet as of June 30, 2013, and presented its results for the three years in the period ended June 30, 2013 as discontinued operations on the statements of operations and cash flows. The Company has reflected the Separation as a distribution on the statement of equity as of June 30, 2013. The footnotes to the financial statements have also been revised accordingly. Management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations describes the Company giving effect to the Separation, except where stated otherwise. Management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is intended to help provide an understanding of the Company financial condition, changes in financial condition and results of operations. This discussion is organized as follows: Overview of the Company Business This section provides a general description of the Company businesses, as well as developments that occurred either during fiscal 2013 or early fiscal 2014 that the Company believes are important in understanding its results of operations and financial condition or to disclose known trends. 42 Table of Contents Results of Operations This section provides an analysis of the Company results of operations for the three fiscal years ended June 30, 2013. This analysis is presented on both a consolidated and a segment basis. In addition, a brief description is provided of significant transactions and events that impact the comparability of the results being analyzed. Liquidity and Capital Resources This section provides an analysis of the Company cash flows for the three fiscal years ended June 30, 2013, as well as a discussion of the Company outstanding debt and commitments, both firm and contingent, that existed as of June 30, 2013. Included in the discussion of outstanding debt is a discussion of the amount of financial capacity available to fund the Company's future commitments and obligations, as well as a discussion of other financing arrangements. Critical Accounting Policies This section discusses accounting policies considered important to the Company financial condition and results of operations, and which require significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in application. In addition, Note 2 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements of Twenty-First Century Fox summarizes the Company's significant accounting policies, including the critical accounting policy discussion found in this section. OVERVIEW OF THE COMPANY S BUSINESS The Company has realigned its reporting segments following the Separation and the Other segment has been renamed; Other, Corporate and Eliminations. This segment includes costs not directly associated with an operating segment, such as corporate overhead and eliminations. The Company is a diversified global media and entertainment company, which manages and reports its businesses in the following five segments: Cable Network Programming , which principally consists of the production and licensing of programming distributed through cable television systems, direct broadcast satellite operators and telecommunication companies primarily in the U.S., Latin America, Europe and Asia. Television , which principally consists of the broadcasting of network programming in the U.S. and the operation of 28 full power broadcast television stations, including 10 duopolies, in the U.S. (of these stations, 18 are affiliated with the FOX Broadcasting Company ( FOX ) and 10 are affiliated with Master Distribution Service, Inc. ( MyNetworkTV )). Filmed Entertainment , which principally consists of the production and acquisition of live-action and animated motion pictures for distribution and licensing in all formats in all entertainment media worldwide, and the production and licensing of television programming worldwide. Direct Broadcast Satellite Television , which consists of the distribution of programming services via satellite, cable, and broadband directly to subscribers in Italy, Germany and Austria. Other, Corporate and Eliminations , which principally consists of corporate overhead and eliminations and other businesses. Television and Cable Network Programming The Company television operations primarily consist of FOX, MyNetworkTV and the 28 television stations owned by the Company. The television operations derive revenues primarily from the sale of advertising and to a lesser extent, retransmission consent revenue. Adverse changes in general market conditions for advertising may affect revenues. The U.S. television broadcast environment is highly competitive and the primary methods of competition are the development and acquisition of popular programming. Program success is measured by ratings, which are an indication of market acceptance, with the top rated programs commanding the highest 43 Table of Contents advertising prices. FOX is a broadcast network that airs original programming and MyNetworkTV is a programming distribution service that airs original and off-network programming. FOX and MyNetworkTV compete with broadcast networks, such as ABC, CBS, NBC and The CW Television Network, independent television stations, cable and Direct Broadcast Satellite Television program services, as well as other media, including DVDs, Blu-rays, video games, print and the Internet for audiences, programming and advertising revenues. In addition, FOX and MyNetworkTV compete with the other broadcast networks and other programming distribution services to secure affiliations with independently owned television stations in markets across the U.S. ABC, NBC and CBS each broadcasts a greater number of hours of programming than FOX and, accordingly, may be able to designate or change time periods in which programming is to be broadcast with greater flexibility than FOX. In addition, future technological developments may affect competition within the television marketplace. U.S. law governing retransmission consent revenue provides a mechanism for the television stations owned by the Company to seek and obtain payment from multi-channel video programming distributors who carry the Company broadcast signals. Retransmission consent revenue consists of per subscriber-based compensatory fees paid to the Company by cable and satellite distribution systems that distribute the Company television stations affiliated with FOX and MyNetworkTV. The Company also receives compensation from independently-owned television stations that are affiliated with FOX and MyNetworkTV. The television stations owned and operated by the Company compete for programming, audiences and advertising revenues with other television stations and cable systems in their respective coverage areas and, in some cases, with respect to programming, with other station groups, and in the case of advertising revenues, with other local and national media. The competitive position of the television stations owned by the Company is largely influenced by the quality and strength of FOX and MyNetworkTV programming, and, in particular, their respective prime-time viewership. The Company U.S. cable network programming operations primarily consist of the Fox News Channel ( FOX News ), FX Networks, LLC ( FX ), Regional Sports Networks ( RSNs ), the National Geographic Channels, and the Big Ten Network. The Company is also planning the launch of Fox Sports 1 in August 2013 and FXX in September of 2013. The Company international cable networks consist of the Fox International Channels ( FIC ) and STAR. FIC produces and distributes entertainment, lifestyle, factual, sports and movie channels through distribution channels in Europe, Africa, Asia and Latin America using several brands, including Fox Channel, Fox Crime, Fox Life, FX, Fox Sports and National Geographic Channel. STAR owned and affiliated channels are distributed in the following countries and regions: India; Greater China; Indonesia; the rest of South East Asia; Pakistan; the Middle East and Africa; the United Kingdom and Europe; and North America. Generally, the Company cable networks, which target various demographics, derive a majority of their revenues from monthly affiliate fees received from cable television systems and direct broadcast satellite operators based on the number of their subscribers. Affiliate fee revenues are net of the amortization of cable distribution investments (capitalized fees paid to U.S. multi-channel video programming distributors to typically facilitate the carriage of a domestic cable network). The Company defers the cable distribution investments and amortizes the amounts on a straight-line basis over the contract period. Cable television and direct broadcast satellite are currently the predominant means of distribution of the Company program services in the U.S. Internationally, distribution technology varies region by region. The Company cable networks compete for carriage on cable television systems, direct broadcast satellite systems and other distribution systems with other program services. A primary focus of competition is for distribution of the Company cable network channels that are not already distributed by particular cable television or direct broadcast satellite systems. For such program services, distributors make decisions on the use of bandwidth based on various considerations, including amounts paid by programmers for launches, subscription fees payable by distributors and appeal to the distributors subscribers. 44 Table of Contents The most significant operating expenses of the Television segment and the Cable Network Programming segment are the acquisition and production expenses related to programming and the expenses related to operating the technical facilities of the broadcaster or cable network. Other expenses include promotional expenses related to improving the market visibility and awareness of the broadcaster or cable network and its programming. Additional expenses include sales commissions paid to the in-house advertising sales force, as well as salaries, employee benefits, rent and other routine overhead expenses. National sports programming is obtained through license agreements with professional or collegiate sports leagues or organizations. The Company current licenses with the NFL, MLB, college football conferences, NASCAR and UFC are secured by long-term agreements, including recent extensions of the NFL, MLB and NASCAR national rights. The profitability of certain U.S. national sports contracts is based on the Company best estimates at June 30, 2013 of attributable revenues and costs; such estimates may change in the future and such changes may be significant. Should revenues decline from estimates applied at June 30, 2013, additional amortization of rights may be recorded. Should revenues improve as compared to estimated revenues, the Company may have improved results related to the contract, which may be recognized over the remaining contract term. While the Company seeks to ensure compliance with federal indecency laws and related Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) regulations, the definition of indecency is subject to interpretation and there can be no assurance that the Company will not broadcast programming that is ultimately determined by the FCC to violate the prohibition against indecency. Such programming could subject the Company to regulatory review or investigation, fines, adverse publicity or other sanctions, including the loss of station licenses. Filmed Entertainment The Filmed Entertainment segment derives revenue from the production and distribution of live-action and animated motion pictures and television series. In general, motion pictures produced or acquired for distribution by the Company are exhibited in U.S. and foreign theaters, followed by home entertainment, including sale and rental of DVDs and Blu-rays, video-on-demand and pay-per-view television, on-line and mobile distribution, premium subscription television, network television and basic cable and syndicated television exploitation. Television series initially produced for the networks and first-run syndication are generally licensed to domestic and international markets concurrently and subsequently released in seasonal DVD and Blu-ray box sets and made available via digital distribution platforms. More successful series are later syndicated in domestic markets. The length of the revenue cycle for television series will vary depending on the number of seasons a series remains in active production and, therefore, may cause fluctuations in operating results. License fees received for television exhibition (including international and U.S. premium television and basic cable television) are recorded as revenue in the period that licensed films or programs are available for such exhibition, which may cause substantial fluctuations in operating results. The revenues and operating results of the Filmed Entertainment segment are significantly affected by the timing of the Company theatrical and home entertainment releases, the number of its original and returning television series that are aired by television networks and cable channels and the number of its television series in off-network syndication. Theatrical and home entertainment release dates are determined by several factors, including timing of vacation and holiday periods and competition in the marketplace. The distribution windows for the release of motion pictures theatrically and in various home entertainment products and services (including subscription rentals, rental kiosks and Internet streaming services), have been compressing and may continue to change in the future. A further reduction in timing between theatrical and home entertainment releases could adversely affect the revenues and operating results of this segment. The Company enters into arrangements with third parties to co-produce many of its theatrical productions. These arrangements, which are referred to as co-financing arrangements, take various forms. The parties to these 45 Table of Contents arrangements include studio and non-studio entities, both domestic and foreign. In several of these agreements, other parties control certain distribution rights. The Filmed Entertainment segment records the amounts received for the sale of an economic interest as a reduction of the cost of the film, as the investor assumes full risk for that portion of the film asset acquired in these transactions. The substance of these arrangements is that the third-party investors own an interest in the film and, therefore, receive a participation based on the respective third-party investor interest in the profits or losses incurred on the film. Consistent with the requirements of Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 926 Entertainment Films ( ASC 926 ), the estimate of a third-party investor interest in profits or losses on the film is based on total estimated ultimate revenues. Operating costs incurred by the Filmed Entertainment segment include: exploitation costs, primarily theatrical prints and advertising and home entertainment marketing and manufacturing costs; amortization of capitalized production, overhead and interest costs; and participations and talent residuals. Selling, general and administrative expenses include salaries, employee benefits, rent and other routine overhead. The Company competes with other film studios, such as Disney, Paramount, Sony, Universal, Warner Bros., and other independent film producers in the production and distribution of motion pictures, DVDs and Blu-rays. As a producer and distributor of television programming, the Company competes with studios, television production groups and independent producers and syndicators, such as Disney, Sony, NBC Universal, Warner Bros. and Paramount Television, to sell programming both domestically and internationally. The Company also competes to obtain creative talent and story properties, which are essential to the success of the Company filmed entertainment businesses. Direct Broadcast Satellite Television The Direct Broadcast Satellite Television ( DBS ) segment operations consist of SKY Italia and the Company majority-owned subsidiary Sky Deutschland AG ( Sky Deutschland ), which provide basic, premium and pay-per-view programming services via satellite, cable and broadband directly to subscribers in Italy (in the case of SKY Italia) and Germany and Austria (in the case of Sky Deutschland). The DBS segment derives revenues principally from subscriber fees. The Company believes that the quality and variety of programming, audio and interactive programming including personal video recorders, quality of picture including high definition channels, access to service, customer service and price are the key elements for gaining and maintaining market share. The DBS segment competition includes companies that offer video, audio, interactive programming, telephony, data and other information and entertainment services, including broadcasters of free-to-air television channels, broadband Internet providers, digital terrestrial transmission ( DTT ) services, wireless companies and companies that are developing new media technologies. The DBS segment most significant operating expenses are those related to the acquisition of entertainment, movie and sports programming and subscribers and the expenses related to operating the technical facilities. Operating expenses related to sports programming are generally recognized over the course of the related sport season, which may cause fluctuations in the operating results of this segment. The continued challenging economic environment in Europe has contributed to a reduction in consumer spending and has posed challenges for subscriber retention and growth. If this trend continues, it could have a material effect on the operating results of the DBS segment. Other, Corporate and Eliminations The Other, Corporate and Eliminations segment consists primarily of corporate overhead and eliminations and other businesses. 46 Table of Contents Other Business Developments In July 2012, the Company sold its 49% investment in NDS Group Limited ( NDS ) to Cisco Systems Inc. for approximately $1.9 billion in total consideration. In November 2012, the Company acquired a controlling 51% ownership stake in Eredivisie Media & Marketing CV ( EMM ) for approximately $350 million, of which $325 million was cash and $25 million was contingent consideration. EMM is a media company that holds the collective media and sponsorship rights of the Dutch Premier League. The remaining 49% of EMM is owned by the Dutch Premier League and the global TV production company Endemol. In November 2012, the Company acquired the remaining 50% interest in ESPN STAR Sports, now operating as Fox Sports Asia, that it did not already own for approximately $220 million, net of cash acquired. Fox Sports Asia is a leading sports broadcaster in Asia and the Company now, through its wholly owned subsidiaries, owns 100% of Fox Sports Asia. In December 2012, the Company acquired a 49% equity interest in the Yankees Entertainment and Sports Network ( YES Network ), a RSN, for approximately $584 million and simultaneous with the closing of this transaction the Company paid approximately $250 million of upfront costs on behalf of YES Network. Under the purchase agreement, the Company may acquire an additional stake in YES Network, starting in December 2015, that could bring its ownership to 80%. In December 2012, the Company acquired SportsTime Ohio, a RSN serving the Cleveland, Ohio market, for an estimated total purchase price of approximately $285 million, of which $135 million was in cash. The balance of the purchase price represents the fair value of deferred payments and payments that are contingent upon achievement of certain performance objectives. During the third quarter of fiscal 2013, the Company acquired, through a combination of a private placement and a rights offering, approximately 92 million additional shares of Sky Deutschland increasing its ownership to approximately 55%. The aggregate cost of the shares acquired by the Company was approximately 410 million (approximately $550 million). As a result of these transactions, the results of Sky Deutschland are included in the Company consolidated results of operations beginning in January 2013. 47 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Results of Operations Fiscal 2013 versus Fiscal 2012 The following table sets forth the Company operating results for fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012.

The increase in affiliate revenues was attributable to higher average rates per subscriber across most channels, the consolidations of Fox Sports Asia and Fox Pan American Sports LLC, doing business as Fox Sports Latin America ( FSLA ), the acquisition of EMM and higher retransmission consent revenues. The increase in subscription revenue was due to the consolidation of Sky Deutschland in January 2013, partially offset by lower subscription revenue at SKY Italia. The higher content revenue was due to an increase in worldwide theatrical revenues. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar against local currencies resulted in a revenue decrease of approximately $370 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012. Operating expenses increased 12% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012, primarily due to increased operating expenses at the Direct Broadcast Satellite Television, Cable Network Programming and Filmed Entertainment Segment segments of $850 million, $770 million and $210 million, respectively. The increase at the Direct Broadcast Satellite Television segment was primarily the result of the consolidation of Sky Deutschland and higher programming costs while the increase at the Cable Network Programming segment was primarily due to the consolidations of Fox Sports Asia and FSLA, the acquisition of EMM, new cricket contracts in India and the launch of new channels. The increase at the Filmed Entertainment segment was primarily due to higher theatrical marketing costs. 48 Table of Contents Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 8% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012, primarily due to increased expenses at the Cable Network Programming, the Filmed Entertainment and Television segments of approximately $160 million, $70 million and $36 million, respectively. The increase at the Cable Network Programming segment was primarily due to the consolidations of Fox Sports Asia and FSLA, the acquisition of EMM and the launch of new channels. The increase at the Filmed Entertainment and Television segments was primarily due to higher personnel costs and higher legal expenses for cases relating to protection of the Company intellectual property rights. Depreciation and amortization increased 12% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012, primarily due to consolidations of Sky Deutschland, Fox Sports Asia and FSLA and the acquisition of EMM. Goodwill impairment and restructuring charges During fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012, the Company recorded non-cash goodwill impairment charges of $35 million and $201 million, respectively, related to the sale of a business in its Digital Media Group in fiscal 2013. The Company recorded restructuring charges from continuing operations of $13 million and $41 million, respectively. The restructuring charges related to accretion on facility termination obligations in both fiscal 2013 and 2012 and one-time termination benefits in fiscal 2012. Equity earnings of affiliates Equity earnings of affiliates increased $19 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012, primarily due to improved results at the DBS equity affiliates of $168 million partially offset by losses at the other equity affiliates. The improvement in DBS equity results was driven by the absence of approximately $85 million in losses as a result of the consolidation of Sky Deutschland and improved results of approximately $75 million from British Sky Broadcasting Group plc ( BSkyB ). These improvements were partially offset by lower contributions of approximately $70 million from Hulu LLC ( Hulu ), as a result of the redemption of Providence Equity Partners equity interest in October 2012 and the absence of approximately $55 million in equity earnings resulting from the sale of the Company investment in NDS in July 2012. For the years ended June 30, 2013 2012 Change % Change (in millions, except %) DBS equity affiliates $ 826 $ 658 $ 168 26 % Cable channel equity affiliates (52 ) (34 ) (18 ) 53 % Other equity affiliates (119 ) 12 (131 ) * * Total Equity earnings of affiliates from continuing operations $ 655 $ 636 $ 19 3 % ** not meaningful Interest expense, net Interest expense, net increased $31 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012, primarily due to the issuance of $1.0 billion of 3.00% Senior Notes due 2022 in September 2012 and increased interest expense related to the consolidation of Sky Deutschland debt. 49 Table of Contents Other, net For the years ended June 30, 2013 2012 (in millions) Gain on Sky Deutschland transaction (a) (b) $ 2,069 $ Gain on sale of investment in NDS (b) 1,446 Gain on Fox Sports Asia transaction (a) 174 Gain on Phoenix Satellite Television transaction (b) 81 Loss on the sale of Baltimore station (a) (92 ) Gain on FSLA transaction (a) 158 Gain on Hathway Cable transaction (b) 23 BSkyB termination fee (b) (63 ) Change in fair value of securities (b) 86 (61 ) Other (4 ) 9 Total Other, net $ 3,760 $ 66 (a) See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements of Twenty-First Century Fox. (b) See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements of Twenty-First Century Fox. Income tax expense The Company tax provision and related effective tax rate of 19% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013 was lower than the statutory rate of 35% primarily due to a 7% rate reduction as a result of adjustments to valuation allowances primarily for the utilization of foreign tax credit carryforwards in connection with the NDS transaction and the consolidation of Sky Deutschland, which, in accordance with ASC 740, reduced income tax expense due to the removal of a historical valuation allowance. In addition, there is a 4% rate reduction resulting from the sale of interests in subsidiaries and the non-taxable gain on the consolidation of Fox Sports Asia, as well as a 2% rate reduction from our foreign operations due to tax credits and deductions arising from a corporate restructuring. The effect of foreign operations was lower than in prior years primarily as a result of the substantial increase in income from continuing operations. The Company tax provision and related effective tax rate of 25% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012 was lower than the U.S. statutory rate of 35% primarily due to a 6% rate reduction from the Company foreign operations due to tax credits and deductions arising from a corporate restructuring as well as a 4% rate reduction resulting from the sale of interests in subsidiaries and the non-taxable gain on the consolidation of FSLA. Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013, the Company recorded income from discontinued operations of $277 million as compared to a loss of $1,997 million in fiscal 2012. This improvement was due to lower restructuring and impairment charges and a non-taxable gain from News Corp revaluation of its previously held equity interest in Foxtel, as a result of the acquisition of Consolidated Media Holdings Ltd. These improvements were partially offset by transaction costs related to the Separation. Net income Net income increased for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012, primarily due to the gain on the Sky Deutschland transaction as well as the gains on the sale of the Company investment in NDS and improved results from continuing and discontinued operations. The Company share repurchase program resulted in a $0.20 increase to earnings per share. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests increased for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012, primarily due to higher results at the Company majority-owned businesses and the issuances of additional noncontrolling interests at the Company cable businesses. These increases were partially offset by the noncontrolling interests share of Sky Deutschland net losses. 50 Table of Contents Segment Analysis Segment OIBDA is defined as revenues less operating expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses. Segment OIBDA does not include: Depreciation and amortization, amortization of cable distribution investments, impairment and restructuring charges, equity earnings of affiliates, interest expense, interest income, other, net, income tax expense and net income attributable to noncontrolling interests. Management believes that Total Segment OIBDA is an appropriate measure for evaluating the operating performance of the Company business segments because it is the primary measure used by the Company chief operating decision maker to evaluate the performance and allocate resources within the Company businesses. Total Segment OIBDA provides management, investors and equity analysts a measure to analyze operating performance of each of the Company business segments and its enterprise value against historical data and competitors data, although historical results may not be indicative of future results (as operating performance is highly contingent on many factors, including customer tastes and preferences). Total Segment OIBDA is a non-GAAP measure and should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, net income, cash flow and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP. In addition, this measure does not reflect cash available to fund requirements and excludes items, such as depreciation and amortization and impairment and restructuring charges, which are significant components in assessing the Company financial performance. The following table reconciles Total Segment OIBDA to Income from continuing operations before income tax expense.

The strengthening of the U.S. dollar against local currencies resulted in a revenue decrease of approximately $175 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012. Domestic net affiliate revenues increased 12% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013 as compared to fiscal year 2012, primarily due to higher average rates per subscriber across most channels, additional subscribers due to the acquisition of an RSN in Ohio and the launch of Fox Sports San Diego. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013, domestic advertising revenues increased 6% as compared to fiscal 2012, primarily due to higher pricing and ratings at FX and the National Geographic Channels, which comprised 80% of the growth. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013, international net affiliate revenues increased 35% and international advertising revenues increased 20% as compared to fiscal 2012. Over half of the international affiliate revenues increase and three-quarters of the international cable channels advertising revenues growth were due to local currency growth at the non-sports channels at FIC and STAR. The balance of the growth was attributable to the international sports channels, including FSLA, Fox Sports Asia, EMM, the launch of new channels and the new contracts to broadcast cricket matches in India. These increases in international advertising revenues and international affiliate revenues were partially offset by an 8% and 7% adverse impact from the strengthened U.S. dollar, respectively. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013, Segment OIBDA at the Cable Network Programming segment increased $628 million, or 18%, as compared to fiscal 2012, primarily due to the revenue increases noted above, partially offset by expense increases of $929 million. This increase was due to higher operating expenses primarily due to increased programming costs from the inclusion of expenses from Fox Sports Asia, FSLA and EMM and the new cricket contracts in India which accounted for 60% of this increase. The launch of new channels, as noted above, and higher programming costs accounted for 30% of this increase. The higher programming cost was a result of new shows launched on FX and new contracts for mixed martial arts matches, U.S. college football games and higher NBA costs due to the NBA lockout in the prior year period, partially offset by reduced NHL costs resulting from the NHL lockout in the current fiscal year. The balance of the increase was due to higher selling, general and administrative expenses primarily related to higher personnel costs as a result of the expansion of the business. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar against local currencies resulted in a Segment OIBDA decrease of approximately $80 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013, as compared to fiscal 2012. 52 Table of Contents Television (18% and 19% of the Company consolidated revenues in fiscal 2013 and 2012, respectively) For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013, revenues at the Television segment increased $57 million, or 1%, as compared to fiscal 2012, primarily due to higher affiliate fee revenues resulting from higher retransmission consent revenues which more than doubled in comparison to the prior year, partially offset by decreased advertising revenues of approximately $190 million. The decrease in advertising revenues was due to lower primetime ratings driven by declines at X-Factor and American Idol. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013, Segment OIBDA at the Television segment increased $64 million, or 8%, as compared to fiscal 2012, primarily due to the revenue increases noted above and lower operating expenses of $43 million due to reduced entertainment programming costs as a result of the final season of House in fiscal 2012 and lower licensing fees for returning series. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses of $36 million primarily due to higher legal expenses for cases relating to protection of the Company intellectual property rights. Filmed Entertainment (31% and 33% of the Company consolidated revenues in fiscal 2013 and 2012, respectively) For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013, revenues at the Filmed Entertainment segment increased $279 million, or 3%, as compared to fiscal 2012, primarily due to higher worldwide theatrical revenues of approximately $420 million. These revenue increases were partially offset by decreased home entertainment revenues of approximately $135 million. Fiscal 2013 included the worldwide theatrical and home entertainment success of Ice Age: Continental Drift, Life of Pi and Taken 2, the worldwide theatrical success of The Croods , a product of the Company new DreamWorks Animation distribution deal, and the worldwide home entertainment and pay television performance of Prometheus , as compared to fiscal 2012 which included the successful worldwide theatrical and home entertainment release of Rise of the Planet of the Apes and Alvin and the Chipmunks: Chipwrecked , the worldwide theatrical success of Prometheus and the home entertainment and pay television performances of Rio and X-Men: First Class . For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013, Segment OIBDA at the Filmed Entertainment segment was consistent with fiscal 2012, as the revenue increases were offset by higher expenses. Operating expenses increased by approximately $210 million primarily due to higher theatrical marketing costs associated with the theatrical releases noted above as well as the initial pre-launch costs for Wolverine , and the distribution of Turbo for DreamWorks Animation. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by approximately $70 million primarily due to higher personnel costs. Direct Broadcast Satellite Television (16% and 15% of the Company consolidated revenues in fiscal 2013 and 2012, respectively) For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013, revenues at the Direct Broadcast Satellite Television segment increased $699 million, or 19%, as compared to fiscal 2012, primarily due to the inclusion of $900 million in revenues resulting from the consolidation of Sky Deutschland, partially offset by a decrease of approximately $200 million in revenues at SKY Italia. The decrease at SKY Italia was primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Euro, which resulted in a revenue decrease of approximately $120 million as compared to fiscal 2012 and the balance of the change was primarily due to a decrease in activation, advertising and subscription revenues. SKY Italia had a net decrease of approximately 146,000 subscribers during fiscal 2013, which decreased SKY Italia total subscriber base to 4.8 million at June 30, 2013, reflecting the continued challenging economic environment in Italy. The total churn for fiscal 2013 was approximately 684,000 subscribers on an average subscriber base of 4.8 million, as compared to churn of approximately 641,000 subscribers on an average subscriber base of 4.9 million in fiscal 2012. During the fiscal year 2013, Sky Deutschland had a net increase of 53 Table of Contents approximately 90,000 subscribers, which increased Sky Deutschland total subscriber base to 3.5 million. The total churn for fiscal 2013 was approximately 179,000 subscribers on an average subscriber base of 3.4 million, as compared to churn of approximately 159,000 subscribers on an average subscriber base of 3.1 million in fiscal 2012. Subscriber churn for the period represents the number of subscribers whose service was disconnected during the period. SKY Italia average revenue per subscriber ( ARPU ) of approximately 42 in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013 remained relatively consistent with the corresponding period of fiscal 2012. Sky Deutschland ARPU of approximately 34 in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013 increased from approximately 32 reported in fiscal 2012, primarily due to a higher increase in total subscriber-related revenues. ARPU is calculated by dividing total subscriber-related revenues, such as subscription and pay-per-view revenues, for the period by the average subscribers for the period and dividing that amount by the number of months in the period. Average subscribers are calculated for the respective periods by adding the beginning and ending subscribers for the period and dividing by two. SKY Italia subscriber acquisition costs per subscriber ( SAC ) of approximately 350 in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013 decreased from approximately 400 in fiscal 2012, due to lower commissions and installation costs on a per subscriber basis. The lower commissions were a result of a change in the sales channel mix and the lower installation costs were a result of fewer customers taking up the full subscription offer. SAC is calculated by dividing total subscriber acquisition costs for a period by the number of gross subscribers added during the period. Subscriber acquisition costs include the cost of the commissions paid to retailers and other distributors, the cost of equipment sold directly to subscribers and the costs related to installation and acquisition advertising net of any upfront activation fee. SAC excludes the value of equipment capitalized under equipment lease programs, as well as payments and the value of returned equipment related to disconnected lease program subscribers from subscriber acquisition costs. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013, Segment OIBDA at the Direct Broadcast Satellite Television segment decreased $164 million, or 29%, as compared to fiscal 2012, primarily due to higher programming expenses of approximately $150 million at SKY Italia associated with the broadcast of the Olympics and expanded UEFA Champions and Europa League, and Formula One coverage. This decrease in Segment OIBDA was partially offset by the consolidation of Sky Deutschland. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Euro resulted in a Segment OIBDA decrease of approximately $12 million as compared to fiscal 2012. Other, Corporate and Eliminations ((4)% of the Company consolidated revenues in fiscal 2013 and 2012) The Other, Corporate and Eliminations segment contains the Company corporate entities and intercompany eliminations and other businesses. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013, revenues related to business activities at the Other, Corporate and Eliminations segment decreased as compared to fiscal 2012, due to the exclusion of revenues from the disposition of the Company digital media businesses in the third quarter of fiscal 2013. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013, Segment OIBDA related to business activities at the Other, Corporate and Eliminations segment decreased as compared to fiscal 2012, primarily due to higher compensation expense. 54 Table of Contents Results of Operations Fiscal 2012 versus Fiscal 2011 The following table sets forth the Company operating results for fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011. For the years ended June 30, 2012 2011 Change % Change (in millions, except %) Revenues: Affiliate $ 6,348 $ 5,430 $ 918 17 % Subscription 3,408 3,527 (119 ) (3 )% Advertising 7,552 7,830 (278 ) (4 )% Content 7,060 6,755 305 5 % Other 683 690 (7 ) (1 )% Total Revenues: 25,051 24,232 819 3 % Operating expenses (15,663 ) (15,745 ) 82 (1 )% Selling, general and administrative (3,719 ) (3,759 ) 40 (1 )% Depreciation and amortization (711 ) (777 ) 66 (8 )% Impairment and restructuring charges (242 ) (288 ) 46 (16 )% Equity earnings of affiliates 636 352 284 81 % Interest expense, net (1,032 ) (962 ) (70 ) 7 % Interest income 77 75 2 3 % Other, net 66 (30 ) 96 * * Income before income tax expense 4,463 3,098 1,365 44 % Income tax expense (1,094 ) (673 ) (421 ) 63 % Income from continuing operations 3,369 2,425 944 39 % (Loss) income from discontinued operations, net of tax (1,997 ) 443 (2,440 ) * * Net income 1,372 2,868 (1,496 ) (52 )% Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests (193 ) (129 ) (64 ) 50 % Net income attributable to Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc. stockholders $ 1,179 $ 2,739 $ (1,560 ) (57 )% ** not meaningful Overview The Company revenues increased 3% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011, primarily due to higher affiliate and content revenues partially offset by decreases in advertising and Direct Broadcast Satellite Television subscription revenues. The increase in affiliate revenues was attributable to higher average rates per subscriber across most channels, the consolidation of FSLA and higher retransmission consent revenues. The increase in content revenue was primarily due to the additional revenues of approximately $700 million from Shine Limited ( Shine ), which was acquired in fiscal 2011, and was partially offset by a $400 million decrease in theatrical and home entertainment revenue. The decrease in advertising revenues was primarily due to the absence of approximately $380 million in revenues resulting from the dispositions of Myspace, Fox Mobile and News Outdoor Russia (the Dispositions ). Operating expenses decreased 1% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011, primarily due to the absence of operating expenses from the Dispositions and lower operating expenses at the Filmed Entertainment segment. Operating expenses at the Filmed Entertainment segment decreased approximately $30 million as the inclusion of Shine operating expenses of approximately $550 million were more than offset by lower marketing and releasing costs. The decrease in operating expenses was partially offset by an approximate $525 million increase at the Cable Network Programming segment primarily due to higher programming costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 1% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011, primarily due to decreased expenses at the Other, Corporate and Eliminations segment resulting from the Dispositions, partially offset by the inclusion of expenses related to Shine. 55 Table of Contents Depreciation and amortization decreased 8% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011, primarily due to lower depreciation and amortization of approximately $80 million at the Other, Corporate and Eliminations segment due to the Dispositions, partially offset by additional depreciation and amortization of approximately $25 million from the acquisition of Shine at the Filmed Entertainment segment. Goodwill impairment and restructuring charges During fiscal 2012 and 2011, the Company recorded non-cash goodwill impairment charges of $201 million and $168 million, respectively. The fiscal 2012 charge related to the pending sale of a business in its Digital Media Group below its carrying value. In fiscal 2011, the Company performed an interim impairment assessment of the Digital Media Group reporting unit goodwill. As a result of the review performed, the Company recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $168 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011. In fiscal 2012, the Company recorded restructuring charges from continuing operations of $41 million, primarily reflecting $29 million of one-time termination benefits and a $12 million charge for accretion on facility termination obligations. In fiscal 2011, the Company recorded restructuring charges from continuing operations of approximately $120 million, of which $115 million related to the Company digital media properties resulting from an organizational restructuring to align resources more closely with business properties and consisted of facility related costs of $95 million, termination benefits of $18 million and other associated costs of $2 million. Equity earnings of affiliates Equity earnings of affiliates increased $284 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011, primarily due to a gain on the sale of a portion of the Company BSkyB investment in accordance with its share repurchase program of $270 million and improved results of approximately $60 million from BSkyB and approximately $75 million from Sky Deutschland. These increases were partially offset by the absence of approximately $135 million in gains recognized by NDS and BSkyB on the sale of certain of their businesses in fiscal 2011.

Income tax expense The Company tax provision and related effective tax rate of 25% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012 was lower than the U.S. statutory rate of 35% primarily due to a 6% rate reduction from the Company foreign operations due to tax credits and deductions arising from a corporate restructuring as well as a 4% rate reduction resulting from the sale of interests in subsidiaries and the non-taxable gain on the consolidation of FSLA. The Company tax provision and related effective tax rate of 22% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2011 was lower than the U.S. statutory rate of 35% primarily due to a 6% rate reduction from the Company foreign operations due to tax credits and deductions arising from a corporate restructuring, a 5% rate reduction from the resolution of tax matters, as well as a 4% rate reduction resulting from the sale of interests in subsidiaries. (Loss) income from discontinued operations, net of tax For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012, the Company recorded a net loss from discontinued operations, net of tax primarily due to impairment charges of approximately $2.6 billion in fiscal 2012 resulting from adverse trends affecting several businesses in News Corp News and Information Services segment, including secular declines in the economic environment in Australia, a decline in in-store advertising spend by consumer packaged goods manufacturers in the U.S. and lower forecasted revenues from certain businesses utilizing various trade names owned by News Corp newspaper operations. The charges also reflected the expected sale of certain assets at a value below their carrying value. For the fiscal year ended June 2011, the Company recorded net income from discontinued operations, net of tax of approximately $700 million in relation to News Corp business operations partially offset by a loss from discontinued operations of approximately $254 million as a result of the disposition of Myspace. The Company transferred the equity and related assets of Myspace to a digital media company in exchange for an equity interest in the acquirer. Net income Net income decreased for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011, primarily due to the loss from discontinued operations partially offset by the revenue increases and higher equity earnings of affiliates, as noted above. The Company share repurchase program resulted in a $0.03 increase to earnings per share. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests increased for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011, primarily due to higher results at the Company majority-owned businesses and the issuance of a noncontrolling interest in a majority-owned subsidiary. 57 Table of Contents Segment Analysis The following table reconciles Total Segment OIBDA to Income from continuing operations before income tax expense.

For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012, domestic advertising revenues increased approximately $130 million primarily due to higher pricing and volume at FX and FOX News. The increases in domestic net affiliate and advertising revenues were partially offset by lower revenues resulting from allowances at the RSNs and fewer NBA telecasts, respectively, related to the NBA lockout during the 2011-2012 NBA season. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012, international net affiliate revenues increased approximately $265 million, with approximately two thirds of the increase primarily due to higher subscribers at FIC and the remaining increase resulting from the consolidation of FSLA. International advertising revenues increased approximately $120 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012, primarily due to improved advertising revenues in Asia and Latin America, with FSLA contributing approximately $20 million of the increase. Also contributing to the increase was higher advertising revenues at STAR due to higher pricing, increased market share and improved ratings. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012, Segment OIBDA at the Cable Network Programming segment increased approximately $540 million, or 18%, as compared to fiscal 2011, primarily due to the revenue increases noted above, partially offset by expense increases of approximately $570 million as a result of higher programming costs. Domestically the programming increase was due to additional movies acquired at FX, the launch of FSN San Diego and the rights fees for the Ultimate Fighting Championship, which was not broadcast in fiscal 2011. Internationally, the increase was due to the inclusion of approximately $95 million in expenses due to the consolidation of the FSLA, the acquisition of additional programming and the launch of new channels. Television (19% and 20% of the Company consolidated revenues in fiscal 2012 and 2011, respectively) For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012, revenues at the Television segment decreased $41 million, or 1%, as compared to fiscal 2011, primarily due to lower advertising revenues of approximately $190 million partially offset by increased affiliate revenue. The decrease was due to the absence of advertising revenues generated from the broadcast of the Super Bowl, which was broadcast on FOX in fiscal 2011, lower ratings for American Idol , and lower political advertising revenues at the Company television stations due to the 2010 mid-term elections in fiscal 2011 which resulted in a total decrease of approximately $400 million. Partially offsetting this decrease was an increase of approximately $200 million from higher pricing, primarily from the launch of the new series The X-Factor and higher NFL and MLB advertising revenues. The NFL advertising revenue increased due to higher pricing and the MLB advertising revenue increased due to the broadcast of two additional post-season games during fiscal 2012. The increase in affiliate revenues was primarily due to higher retransmission consent revenues which more than doubled in comparison to the prior year. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012, Segment OIBDA at the Television segment increased $21 million, or 3%, as compared to fiscal 2011, primarily due to lower programming costs at the Company television stations due to the non-renewal of series. The absence of programming costs related to the broadcast of the Super Bowl was offset by higher programming and marketing costs in support of the launch of the new series and increases in other sports programming rights. Filmed Entertainment (33% and 32% of the Company consolidated revenues in fiscal 2012 and 2011, respectively) For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012, revenues at the Filmed Entertainment segment increased $550 million, or 7%, as compared to fiscal 2011, primarily due to the inclusion of approximately $700 million in revenues from Shine, which was acquired in fiscal 2011, an increase of approximately $285 million related to higher digital distribution revenues from the licensing of the Company television content and higher syndication and license fees for How I Met Your Mother and Avatar . These revenue increases were partially offset by a $400 million decrease in theatrical and home entertainment revenue. Fiscal 2012 included the 59 Table of Contents worldwide theatrical and home entertainment success of Rise of the Planet of the Apes and Alvin and the Chipmunks: Chipwrecked , the worldwide theatrical success of Prometheus and the home entertainment and pay television performances of Rio and X-Men: First Class as compared to fiscal 2011 which included the successful worldwide theatrical and home entertainment release of The Chronicles of Narnia: Voyage of the Dawn Treader and Black Swan , the worldwide theatrical release of Rio and X-Men: First Class and the home entertainment and pay television performances of Avatar . For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012, Segment OIBDA at the Filmed Entertainment segment increased $254 million, or 24%, as compared to fiscal 2011, primarily due to the revenue increases noted above, partially offset by an increase of approximately $300 million in expenses. Operating expense increased approximately $90 million due to the inclusion of expenses related to Shine and higher television production costs, partially offset by lower film production costs primarily due to lower marketing and releasing costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by approximately $210 million primarily due to the inclusion of expenses related to Shine. Direct Broadcast Satellite Television (15% and 16% of the Company consolidated revenues in fiscal 2012 and 2011, respectively) For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012, SKY Italia revenues decreased $21 million, or 1%, as compared to fiscal 2011 primarily due to lower subscription revenues. SKY Italia had a net decrease of approximately 71,000 subscribers during fiscal 2012, which decreased SKY Italia total subscriber base to 4.9 million at June 30, 2012, reflecting the continued challenging economic environment in Italy. The total churn for fiscal 2012 was approximately 641,000 subscribers on an average subscriber base of 4.9 million, as compared to churn of approximately 508,000 subscribers on an average subscriber base of 4.9 million in fiscal 2011. Subscriber churn for the period represents the number of SKY Italia subscribers whose service was disconnected during the period. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Euro resulted in a revenue decrease of approximately $78 million as compared to fiscal 2011. ARPU of approximately 41 in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012 decreased from approximately 43 reported in fiscal 2011, primarily due to the negative impact of subscriber discounts. SAC of approximately 400 in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012 increased from fiscal 2011, primarily due to higher marketing costs on a per subscriber basis. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012, SKY Italia Segment OIBDA increased $15 million, or 3%, as compared to fiscal 2011 principally from the absence of the FIFA World Cup and lower advertising costs from the absence of the fiscal 2011 rebranding campaign. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012, the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the Euro resulted in a Segment OIBDA increase of approximately $9 million as compared to fiscal 2011. Other, Corporate and Eliminations ((4)% and (2)% of the Company consolidated revenues in fiscal 2012 and 2011, respectively) The Other, Corporate and Eliminations segment contains the Company corporate entities and intercompany eliminations and other businesses. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012, revenues related to business activities at the Other, Corporate and Eliminations segment decreased as compared to fiscal 2011, primarily due to the exclusion of revenues from the Dispositions. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012, Segment OIBDA at the Other, Corporate and Eliminations segment improved as compared to fiscal 2011, primarily due to the net impact of the Dispositions. 60 Table of Contents LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Current Financial Condition The Company principal source of liquidity is internally generated funds. The Company also has a five-year unused $2 billion revolving credit facility, which expires in May 2017, and has access to various film co-production alternatives to supplement its cash flows. In addition, the Company has access to the worldwide capital markets, subject to market conditions. As of June 30, 2013, the Company was in compliance with all of the covenants under the revolving credit facility, and it does not anticipate any violation of such covenants. The Company internally generated funds are highly dependent upon the state of the advertising markets and public acceptance of its film and television products. As of June 30, 2013, the Company consolidated assets included $6.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents, of which $1.4 billion was held by the Company foreign subsidiaries. The Company earns income outside the U.S., which is deemed to be permanently reinvested in certain foreign jurisdictions. The Company does not currently intend nor foresee a need to repatriate these funds. Should the Company require more capital in the U.S. than is generated by or available to its domestic operations, the Company could elect to repatriate funds held in foreign jurisdictions which may result in higher effective tax rates and higher cash paid for income taxes for the Company. The principal uses of cash that affect the Company liquidity position include the following: investments in the production and distribution of new feature films and television programs; the acquisition of and payments under programming rights for entertainment and sports programming; operational expenditures including employee costs; capital expenditures; interest expenses; income tax payments; investments in associated entities; dividends; acquisitions; debt repayments; and stock repurchases. Under the separation and distribution agreement, the Company agreed to provide a cash contribution to News Corp immediately prior to the Separation so that as of the Separation News Corp would have approximately $2.6 billion of cash on hand. Accordingly, immediately prior the Separation the Company distributed approximately $2.4 billion to News Corp, which was comprised of $1.6 billion in cash funding and approximately $800 million that was held by News Corp subsidiaries immediately prior to the Separation. The Company expects to make a final cash distribution of approximately $200 million, subject to adjustment pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement, within the next three months and has included this amount in Other current assets and a corresponding payable in Other current liabilities in the Company consolidated balance sheet for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013. In addition to the acquisitions, sales and possible acquisitions disclosed elsewhere, the Company has evaluated, and expects to continue to evaluate, possible acquisitions and dispositions of certain businesses and the Company capital structure. Such transactions may be material and may involve cash, the Company securities or the assumption of additional indebtedness. The Company anticipates that in fiscal 2014, its growth will be impacted by several strategic initiatives, most notably the launch of sports networks in the United States and in Asia, as well as the launch of FXX. The Company also expects adverse currency effects to impact fiscal 2014 growth, principally from Latin American currencies and the Indian rupee. Sources and Uses of Cash Fiscal 2013 vs. Fiscal 2012 Net cash provided by operating activities for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013 and 2012 was as follows (in millions): For the years ended June 30, 2013 2012 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 3,002 $ 2,834 61 Table of Contents The increase in net cash provided by operating activities during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 was primarily due to higher receipts at the Cable Network Programming segment driven by higher Segment OIBDA of $628 million, lower pension contributions of $112 million and higher cash distributions received from affiliates of $43 million. This increase was partially offset by higher film and television production spend in the Film segment, higher sports program rights payments in the Television segment, higher program rights payments in the Direct Broadcast Satellite Television segment principally from the consolidation of Sky Deutschland and higher cash taxes paid of $164 million. Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013 and 2012 was as follows (in millions): For the years ended June 30, 2013 2012 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities $ 86 $ (766 ) The increase in net cash provided by investing activities during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 was primarily due to the sale of its 49% investment in NDS for approximately $1.9 billion in total consideration, partially offset by additional cash utilized for acquisitions, property, plant and equipment and the purchase of a 49% equity interest in the YES Network. Net cash used in financing activities for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013 and 2012 was as follows (in millions): For the years ended June 30, 2013 2012 Net cash used in financing activities $ (4,571 ) $ (5,102 ) The decrease in net cash used in financing activities for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013 as compared to net cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2012 was primarily due to lower share repurchases of approximately $2.6 billion and an increase in net borrowing of approximately $550 million. These sources of cash were partially offset by the cash contribution to News Corp in connection with the Separation. In August 2013, the Board authorized the repurchase of $4 billion of Class A Common Stock, excluding commissions, which replaced the remaining amount under the stock repurchase program. The Company intends to complete this stock repurchase program within the next twelve months and expects to fund this through a combination of cash generated by operations and cash on hand. The total dividends declared related to fiscal 2013 results were $0.21 per share of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock. In August 2013, the Company declared the final dividend on fiscal 2013 results of $0.125 per share for Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock. This together with the interim dividend of $0.085 per share of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock constitute the total dividend relating to fiscal 2013. Based on the number of shares outstanding as of June 30, 2013, the total aggregate cash dividends expected to be paid to stockholders in fiscal 2014 is approximately $580 million. Sources and Uses of Cash Fiscal 2012 vs. Fiscal 2011 Net cash provided by operating activities for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012 and 2011 was as follows (in millions): For the years ended June 30, 2012 2011 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 2,834 $ 3,038 62 Table of Contents The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 was primarily due to lower receipts at the Television segment and higher programming payments at the Direct Broadcast Satellite Television segment as well as higher tax, pension and interest payments. This decrease was partially offset by higher receipts at the Cable and Filmed Entertainment segments and higher cash distributions from affiliates. The decrease in the Television segment was due to the absence of the Super Bowl. The increase in the Cable Programming segment was due to higher affiliate receipts and the increase in the Filmed Entertainment segment was due to higher licensing of television product. Net cash used in investing activities for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2012 and 2011 was as follows (in millions): For the years ended June 30, 2012 2011 Net cash used in investing activities $ (766 ) $ (1,369 ) The decrease in net cash used in investing activities during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 was primarily due to the proceeds of approximately $335 million due to the sale of a portion of the Company BSkyB investment in accordance with BSkyB share repurchase program and a decrease of approximately $200 million in the amount invested in Sky Deutschland in fiscal 2012. Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2012 and 2011 was as follows (in millions): For the years ended June 30, 2012 2011 Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities $ (5,102 ) $ 1,383 The change in net cash used in financing activities for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012 as compared to net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2011 was primarily due to share repurchases of $4.6 billion during fiscal 2012, with no comparable share repurchases in fiscal 2011. Debt Instruments The following table summarizes borrowings and repayments for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2013, 2012 and 2011.

(b) In January 2013, Sky Deutschland, a majority owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a credit agreement with major financial institutions that NAI and the Company have both guaranteed. The credit agreement provides a 300 million unsecured credit facility with a sub-limit of 75 million revolving credit facility available for cash drawdowns or the issuance of letters of credit and a maturity date of January 2018. Sky Deutschland may request that the maturity date be extended for one year. The significant terms of the agreement include limitations on liens and indebtedness. Fees under the credit agreement are based on the Company long-term senior unsecured non-credit enhanced debt ratings. Given the current debt ratings of the Company, Sky Deutschland pays a facility fee of 0.125% and interest of Eurocurrency Rate plus 1.125%. As of June 30, 2013, 225 million ($293 million) was outstanding under this credit agreement and 75 million available for either additional financing or letters of credit. The proceeds were used to pay off existing Sky Deutschland debt. (c) See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements of Twenty-First Century Fox for information with respect to the Shine acquisition. (d) Debt acquired in the Sky Deutschland transaction. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements of Twenty-First Century Fox for further discussion. Ratings of the Public Debt The table below summarizes the Company credit ratings as of June 30, 2013. Rating Agency Senior Debt Outlook Moody Baa1 Stable S&P BBB+ Stable Revolving Credit Agreement In May 2012, NAI entered into a credit agreement (the Credit Agreement ), among NAI as Borrower, the Company as Parent Guarantor, the lenders named therein, the initial issuing banks named therein, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. ( JPMorgan Chase ) and Citibank, N.A. as Co-Administrative Agents, JPMorgan Chase as Designated Agent and Bank of America, N.A. as Syndication Agent. The Credit Agreement provides a $2 billion unsecured revolving credit facility with a sub-limit of $400 million (or its equivalent in Euros) available for the issuance of letters of credit and a maturity date of May 2017. Under the Credit Agreement, the Company may request an increase in the amount of the credit facility up to a maximum amount of $2.5 billion and the Company may request that the maturity date be extended for up to two additional one-year periods. Borrowings are issuable in U.S. dollars only, while letters of credit are issuable in U.S. dollars or Euros. The significant terms of the agreement include the requirement that the Company maintain specific leverage ratios and limitations on secured indebtedness. Fees under the Credit Agreement will be based on the Company long-term senior unsecured non-credit enhanced debt ratings. Given the current debt ratings, NAI pays a facility fee of 0.125% and an initial drawn cost of LIBOR plus 1.125%. 64 Table of Contents Commitments and Guarantees The Company has commitments under certain firm contractual arrangements ( firm commitments ) to make future payments. These firm commitments secure the future rights to various assets and services to be used in the normal course of operations. The following table summarizes the Company material firm commitments as of June 30, 2013. As of June 30, 2013 Payments Due by Period Total 1 year 2-3 years 4-5 years After 5 years (in millions) Contracts for capital expenditure $ 148 $ 121 $ 22 $ 5 $ Operating leases (a) Land and buildings 2,046 281 499 413 853 Transponder service agreements and other 2,415 428 747 591 649 Other commitments Borrowings 16,458 137 950 1,043 14,328 Sports programming rights (b) 47,713 4,961 10,380 8,702 23,670 Entertainment programming rights 4,826 2,147 1,850 686 143 Other commitments and contractual obligations (c) 6,292 1,614 2,605 1,038 1,035 Total commitments, borrowings and contractual obligations $ 79,898 $ 9,689 $ 17,053 $ 12,478 $ 40,678 The Company also has certain contractual arrangements in relation to certain investees that would require the Company to make payments or provide funding if certain circumstances occur ( contingent guarantees ). The Company does not expect that these contingent guarantees will result in any material amounts being paid by the Company in the foreseeable future. The timing of the amounts presented in the table below reflect when the maximum contingent guarantees will expire and does not indicate that the Company expects to incur an obligation to make payments during that time frame. As of June 30, 2013 Amount of Guarantees Expiration Per Period Contingent guarantees: Total Amounts Committed 1 year 2-3 years 4-5 years After 5 years (in millions) Sports programming rights (d) $ 511 $ 392 $ 119 $ $ Hulu indemnity (e) 115 115 Letters of credit and other 62 62 $ 688 $ 454 $ 119 $ 115 $ (a) The transponder service agreements represent approximately $1.8 billion of the total amounts committed and the balance includes leases for office facilities, equipment and microwave transmitters used to carry broadcast signals. These leases, which are classified as operating leases, expire at certain dates through fiscal 2036. Included in the total amounts committed of $2.4 billion, are $225 million of office facilities that have been sub-leased to News Corp. (b) Under the Company contract with the NFL, remaining future minimum payments for program rights to broadcast certain football games are payable over the remaining term of the contract through fiscal 2022. The Company contract with the MLB gives the Company rights to broadcast certain regular season and post season games, as well as exclusive rights to broadcast MLB World Series and All-Star Game through the 2021 MLB season. 65 Table of Contents The Company contracts with NASCAR give the Company rights to broadcast certain races and ancillary content through calendar year 2022. Under the Company contracts with certain collegiate conferences, remaining future minimum payments for program rights to broadcast certain sporting events are payable over the remaining terms of the contracts. Under the Company contract with Italy National League Football, remaining future minimum payments for programming rights to broadcast National League Football matches are payable over the remaining term of the contract through August 2015. Under the Company contract with the Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ), remaining future minimum payments for program rights to broadcast international and domestic cricket matches and series are payable over the remaining term of the contract through fiscal 2018. In addition, the Company has certain other local sports broadcasting rights. (c) Primarily includes obligations relating to distribution agreements, marketing agreements and television rating services. (d) In connection with the agreement with BCCI, the Company was required to obtain a bank guarantee covering its programming rights obligation. (e) In October 2012, Hulu redeemed Providence Equity Partners equity interest for $200 million. In connection with the transaction, Hulu incurred a charge primarily related to employee equity-based compensation. Accordingly, the Company recorded approximately $60 million to reflect its share of the charge in the second quarter of fiscal 2013. The Company has guaranteed $115 million of Hulu $338 million five-year term loan which was used by Hulu, in part, to finance the transaction. The fair value of this guarantee was calculated using level 3 inputs and was included in the consolidated balance sheet in other liabilities. In July 2013, the Company invested an additional $125 million in Hulu and has committed to invest an additional $125 million in Hulu to maintain its ownership percentage of approximately 33%. The Company will continue to account for its interest in Hulu as an equity method investment. The table excludes the Company pension, other postretirement benefits ( OPEB ) obligations and the gross unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions as the Company is unable to reasonably predict the ultimate amount and timing. The Company made contributions of $95 million and $255 million to its pension plans in fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012, respectively. The majority of these contributions were voluntarily made to improve the funding status of the plans. Future plan contributions are dependent upon actual plan asset returns and interest rates and statutory requirements. Assuming that actual plan asset returns are consistent with the Company expected plan returns in fiscal 2013 and beyond, and that interest rates remain constant, the Company would not be required to make any material contributions to its U.S. pension plans for the immediate future. Required pension plan contributions for the next fiscal year are not expected to be material but the Company may make voluntary contributions in future periods. Payments due to participants under the Company pension plans are primarily paid out of underlying trusts. Payments due under the Company OPEB plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are paid as medical costs are incurred by covered retiree populations, and are principally dependent upon the future cost of retiree medical benefits under the Company pension plans. The Company expects its net OPEB payments to not be material in 2014. (See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements of Twenty-First Century Fox for further discussion of the Company pension and OPEB plans.) Contingencies Other than as disclosed in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, the Company is party to several other purchase and sale arrangements which become exercisable over the next ten years by the Company or the counter-party to the agreement. None of these arrangements that become or are exercisable in the next twelve months are material. Purchase arrangements that are exercisable by the counter-party to the agreement, and that are outside the sole control of the Company, are accounted for in accordance with ASC 480-10-S99-3A, 66 Table of Contents Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity. Accordingly, the fair values of such purchase arrangements are classified in redeemable noncontrolling interests. As disclosed in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, the Company and News Corp are subject to ongoing investigations by U.K. and U.S. regulators and governmental authorities relating to phone hacking, illegal data access and inappropriate payments to officials at The News of the World and The Sun and related matters (the U.K. Newspaper Matters ). The Company is cooperating with these investigations. It is not possible at this time to estimate the liability, if any, of the Company relating to these investigations. In connection with the Separation, the Company and News Corp agreed in the Separation and Distribution Agreement that the Company will indemnify News Corp, on an after-tax basis, for payments made after the Separation arising out of civil claims and investigations relating to the U.K. Newspaper Matters, as well as legal and professional fees and expenses paid in connection with the related criminal matters, other than fees, expenses and costs relating to employees who are not (i) directors, officers or certain designated employees or (ii) with respect to civil matters, co-defendants with News Corp (the Indemnity ). Upon Separation, the parent-subsidiary relationship between the Company and News Corp no longer exists and, as such, the Indemnity is subject to recognition under ASC 460 by the Company. As of June 30, 2013, the Company recognized approximately $40 million related to the fair value of amounts accrued by News Corp as of the date of the Separation which are expected to be covered by the Indemnity and has provided an additional $110 million for the fair value of expected future payments to be made under the Indemnity. If additional information becomes available, the Company will update the liability provision for the Indemnity. Any changes to the fair value of the liability provision for the Indemnity in the future will impact the results of operations for that period. The liability provision for the Indemnity was estimated by probability weighting expected payments to be made to News Corp under such Agreement and discounting probability-weighted expected payments to the valuation date, using a discount rate based on the Company cost of debt. It is possible that these proceedings and any adverse resolution thereof, including any fines or other penalties associated with any plea, judgment or similar result could damage the Company reputation, impair its ability to conduct its business and adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition. The Company operations are subject to tax in various domestic and international jurisdictions and as a matter of course, the Company is regularly audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. The Company believes it has appropriately accrued for the expected outcome of all pending tax matters and does not currently anticipate that the ultimate resolution of pending tax matters will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial condition, future results of operations or liquidity. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES An accounting policy is considered to be critical if it is important to the Company's financial condition and results and if it requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application. The development and selection of these critical accounting policies have been determined by management of the Company and the related disclosures have been reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Company Board of Directors. For the Company's summary of significant accounting policies, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements of Twenty-First Century Fox. Use of Estimates The preparation of the Company consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts that are reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying disclosures. Although these estimates are based on management best knowledge of current events and actions that the Company may undertake in the future, actual results may differ from the estimates. 67 Table of Contents Revenue Recognition Television, Cable Network Programming and Direct Broadcast Satellite Advertising revenue is recognized as the commercials are aired, net of agency commissions. Subscriber fees received from subscribers, cable systems and DBS operators are recognized as revenue in the period that services are provided, net of amortization of cable distribution investments, in the case of Cable Network Programming revenues. The Company defers the cable distribution investments and amortizes the amounts on a straight-line basis over the contract period. Filmed Entertainment Revenues from distribution of feature films are recognized in accordance with ASC 926. Revenues from the theatrical distribution of motion pictures are recognized as they are exhibited and revenues from DVD and Blu-ray sales, net of a reserve for estimated returns, are recognized on the date that DVD and Blu-ray units are made widely available for sale by retailers and all Company-imposed restrictions on the sale of DVD and Blu-ray units have expired. Revenues from television distribution are recognized when the motion picture or television program is made available to the licensee for broadcast. Management bases its estimates of ultimate revenue for each film on the historical performance of similar films, incorporating factors such as the past box office record of the lead actors and actresses, the genre of the film, pre-release market research (including test market screenings) and the expected number of theaters in which the film will be released. Management updates such estimates based on information available on the actual results of each film through its life cycle. License agreements for the broadcast of theatrical and television product in the broadcast network, syndicated television and cable television markets are routinely entered into in advance of their available date for broadcast. Cash received and amounts billed in connection with such contractual rights for which revenue is not yet recognizable is classified as deferred revenue. Because deferred revenue generally relates to contracts for the licensing of theatrical and television product which have already been produced, the recognition of revenue for such completed product is principally only dependent upon the commencement of the availability period for broadcast under the terms of the related licensing agreement. Filmed Entertainment and Television Programming Costs Accounting for the production and distribution of motion pictures and television programming is in accordance with ASC 926, which requires management judgment as it relates to total revenues to be received and costs to be incurred throughout the life of each program or its license period. These judgments are used to determine the amortization of capitalized filmed entertainment and television programming costs, the expensing of participation and residual costs associated with revenues earned and any fair value adjustments. In accordance with ASC 926, the Company amortizes filmed entertainment and television programming costs using the individual-film-forecast method. Under the individual-film-forecast method, such programming costs are amortized for each film or television program in the ratio that current period actual revenue for such title bears to management estimated ultimate revenue as of the beginning of the current fiscal year to be recognized over approximately a six year period or operating profits to be realized from all media and markets for such title. Management bases its estimates of ultimate revenue for each film on factors such as historical performance of similar films, the star power of the lead actors and actresses and once released actual results of each film. For each television program, management bases its estimates of ultimate revenue on the performance of the television programming in the initial markets, the existence of future firm commitments to sell additional episodes of the program and the past performance of similar television programs. Management regularly reviews, and revises when necessary, its total revenue estimates on a title-by-title basis, which may result in a change in the rate of amortization and/or a write-down of the asset to fair value. The costs of national sports contracts at FOX and for international sports rights agreements are charged to expense based on the ratio of each current period profit for each contract to the estimated total remaining profit 68 Table of Contents for each contract. Estimates of total profit can change and accordingly, are reviewed periodically and amortization is adjusted as necessary. Such changes in the future could be material. The costs of local and regional sports contracts for a specified number of events are amortized on an event-by-event basis, while costs for local and regional sports contracts for a specified season are amortized over the season on a straight-line basis. In the first quarter of fiscal 2012, the Company voluntarily changed its method of recognizing losses on its multi-year U.S. national sports agreements by no longer accruing for estimated future losses. The Company will, however, continue to recognize programming rights at the lower of unamortized cost or estimated net realizable value in accordance with ASC 920, Entertainment Broadcasters ( ASC 920 ). The Company believes that this method is preferable because the change will (1) align the Company policy with peer companies in the media industry; (2) result in better correspondence with the substance of the event being recognized as estimated future losses will no longer be recognized; and (3) limit the effect of judgment on any potential impairment loss because the impairment analysis, which involves significant judgment about future revenue and revenue allocations, will only affect programming rights recorded on the balance sheet. Retrospective application of the change in accounting policy had no effect on the consolidated financial statements of the Company for any of the periods presented. Original cable programming is amortized on an accelerated basis. Management regularly reviews, and revises when necessary, its total revenue estimates on a contract basis, which may result in a change in the rate of amortization and/or a write-down of the asset to fair value. Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost and are depreciated on a straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of such assets. Changes in circumstances, such as technological advances, changes to the Company business model or capital strategy, could result in the actual useful lives differing from the Company estimates. In those cases, where the Company determines that the useful life of buildings and equipment should be shortened, the Company would depreciate the asset over its revised remaining useful life thereby increasing depreciation expense. Intangible Assets The Company has a significant amount of intangible assets, including goodwill, film and television libraries, FCC licenses, and other copyright products and trademarks. Intangible assets acquired in business combinations are recorded at their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is recorded as the difference between the cost of acquiring an entity and the estimated fair values assigned to its tangible and identifiable intangible net assets and is assigned to one or more reporting units for purposes of testing for impairment. The judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of intangible assets acquired, their reporting unit, as well as their useful lives can significantly impact net income. The Company accounts for its business acquisitions under the purchase method of accounting. The total cost of acquisitions is allocated to the underlying net assets, based on their respective estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the tangible net assets acquired is recorded as intangibles. Amounts recorded as goodwill are assigned to one or more reporting units. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including assumptions with respect to future cash inflows and outflows, discount rates, asset lives and market multiples, among other items. Identifying reporting units and assigning goodwill to them requires judgment involving the aggregation of business units with similar economic characteristics and the identification of existing business units that benefit from the acquired goodwill. The Company allocates goodwill to disposed businesses using the relative fair value method. 69 Table of Contents Carrying values of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed at least annually for possible impairment in accordance with ASC 350. The Company impairment review is based on, among other methods, a discounted cash flow approach that requires significant management judgments. The Company uses its judgment in assessing whether assets may have become impaired between annual valuations. Indicators such as unexpected adverse economic factors, unanticipated technological change or competitive activities, loss of key personnel and acts by governments and courts, may signal that an asset has become impaired. The Company uses direct valuation methods to value identifiable intangibles for purchase accounting and impairment testing. The direct valuation method used for FCC licenses requires, among other inputs, the use of published industry data that are based on subjective judgments about future advertising revenues in the markets where the Company owns television stations. This method also involves the use of management judgment in estimating an appropriate discount rate reflecting the risk of a market participant in the U.S. broadcast industry. The resulting fair values for FCC licenses are sensitive to these long-term assumptions and any variations to such assumptions could result in an impairment to existing carrying values in future periods and such impairment could be material. The Company goodwill impairment reviews are determined using a two-step process. The first step of the process is to compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. In performing the first step, the Company determines the fair value of a reporting unit by primarily using a discounted cash flow analysis and market-based valuation approach methodologies. Determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgments, including judgments about appropriate discount rates, long-term growth rates, relevant comparable company earnings multiples and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows. The cash flows employed in the analyses are based on the Company estimated outlook and various growth rates have been assumed for years beyond the long-term business plan period. Discount rate assumptions are based on an assessment of the risk inherent in the future cash flows of the respective reporting units. In assessing the reasonableness of its determined fair values, the Company evaluates its results against other value indicators, such as comparable public company trading values. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired and the second step of the impairment review is not necessary. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the goodwill impairment review is required to be performed to estimate the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination. That is, the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit (including any unrecognized intangible assets) as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the estimated fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid. The implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill is compared with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. During fiscal 2013, the Company recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $35 million reflecting the pending sale of a business in its Digital Media Group below its carrying value. The business was subsequently sold in fiscal 2013. As a result of the fiscal 2013 annual impairment review performed, the Company did not record an impairment charge during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013. The Company determined there are no reporting units with goodwill considered to be at risk and will continue to monitor its goodwill and intangible assets for possible future impairment. Income Taxes The Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions in which it operates. The Company computes its annual tax rate based on the statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to it in the various jurisdictions in which it earns income. Tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities. Significant judgment is required in determining the Company tax expense and in evaluating its tax positions including evaluating uncertainties under ASC 740, Income Taxes . 70 Table of Contents The Company records valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. In making this assessment, management analyzes future taxable income, reversing temporary differences and ongoing tax planning strategies. Should a change in circumstances lead to a change in judgment about the realizability of deferred tax assets in future years, the Company would adjust related valuation allowances in the period that the change in circumstances occurs, along with a corresponding increase or charge to income. Employee Costs The measurement and recognition of costs of the Company various pension and other postretirement benefit plans require the use of significant management judgments, including discount rates, expected return on plan assets, future compensation and other actuarial assumptions. The Company maintains defined benefit pension plans covering a significant number of its employees and retirees. The primary plans are closed to new participants. In connection with the Separation, the Company entered into an Employee Matters Agreement with News Corp which provides that employees of News Corp no longer participate in benefit plans sponsored or maintained by the Company as of the Separation date. Upon the Separation, the Company plans transferred assets and obligations to the News Corp plans resulting in a net decrease in sponsored pension and postretirement plan obligations of $558 million. Additionally, as a result of the Separation, deferred items of approximately $500 million were transferred to News Corp. For financial reporting purposes, net periodic pension expense is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions, including a discount rate for plan obligations, an expected rate of return on plan assets and mortality. The Company considers current market conditions, including changes in investment returns and interest rates, in making these assumptions. In developing the expected long-term rate of return, the Company considered the pension portfolio's past average rate of returns, and future return expectations of the various asset classes. The expected long-term rate of return is based on an asset allocation assumption of 48% equities, 37% fixed-income securities and 15% in cash and other investments. The mortality assumption reflects the experience of recent studies which indicate improvements in mortality. The assumption selected by the Company assumes there will be continuous improvement in future mortality. The discount rate reflects the market rate for high-quality fixed-income investments on the Company annual measurement date of June 30 and is subject to change each fiscal year. The discount rate assumptions used to account for pension and other postretirement benefit plans reflect the rates at which the benefit obligations could be effectively settled. The rate was determined by matching the Company expected benefit payments for the primary plans to a hypothetical yield curve developed using a portfolio of several hundred high-quality corporate bonds. The key assumptions used in developing the Company fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011 net periodic pension expense for its plans consist of the following: 2013 2012 2011 ($ in millions) Discount rate used to determine net periodic benefit cost 4.3 % 5.7 % 5.7 % Assets: Expected rate of return 7.0 % 7.0 % 7.0 % Expected return (a) $ 110 $ 185 $ 171 Actual return (b) 116 68 326 Gain/(Loss) $ 6 $ (117 ) $ 155 One year actual return 7.8 % 2.5 % 13.7 % Five year actual return 4.4 % 2.6 % 4.5 % (a) Fiscal years ended June 30, 2012 and 2011 include expected returns from discontinued operations of $82 million and $74 million, respectively. (b) Fiscal years ended June 30, 2012 and 2011 include actual returns from discontinued operations of $39 million and $157 million, respectively. 71 Table of Contents The weighted average discount rate is volatile from year to year because it is determined based upon the prevailing rates in the U.S. and Europe as of the measurement date. The Company will utilize a weighted average discount rate of 5.2% in calculating the fiscal 2014 net periodic pension expense for its plans. The Company will use a weighted average long-term rate of return of 7.0% for fiscal 2014 based principally on a combination of asset mix and historical experience of actual plan returns. The accumulated net pre-tax losses on the Company pension plans at June 30, 2013 were approximately $625 million which decreased from approximately $1.5 billion at June 30, 2012. This decrease of approximately $900 million was primarily due to the $500 million transfer of deferred items to News Corp, as noted above, and the increase in the discount rate used to measure the benefit obligation at June 30, 2013. The accumulated pre-tax net losses at June 30, 2013 were primarily the result of changes in discount rates and deferred asset losses. Lower discount rates increase present values of benefit obligations and increase the Company deferred losses and also increase subsequent-year pension expense. Higher discount rates decrease the present values of benefit obligations and reduce the Company accumulated net loss and also decrease subsequent-year pension expense. These deferred losses are being systematically recognized in future net periodic pension expense in accordance with ASC 715, Compensation Retirement Benefits. Unrecognized losses in excess of 10% of the greater of the market-related value of plan assets or the plans projected benefit obligation are recognized over the average future service of the plan participants. The Company made contributions of $275 million, $255 million and $158 million to its pension plans in fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively of which $95 million, $207 million and $113 million related to continuing operations, respectively. The majority of these contributions were voluntarily made to improve the funding status of the plans which were impacted by the economic conditions noted above. Future plan contributions are dependent upon actual plan asset returns, statutory requirements and interest rate movements. Assuming that actual plan returns are consistent with the Company expected plan returns in fiscal 2013 and beyond, and that interest rates remain constant, the Company would not be required to make any material statutory contributions to its primary U.S. pension plans for the immediate future. The Company will continue to make voluntary contributions as necessary to improve funded status. Changes in net periodic pension expense may occur in the future due to changes in the Company expected rate of return on plan assets and discount rate resulting from economic events. The following table highlights the sensitivity of the Company pension obligations and expense to changes in these assumptions, assuming all other assumptions remain constant: Changes in Assumption Impact on Annual Pension Expense Impact on PBO 0.25 percentage point decrease in discount rate Increase $11 million Increase $91 million 0.25 percentage point increase in discount rate Decrease $10 million Decrease $85 million 0.25 percentage point decrease in expected rate of return on assets Increase $4 million 0.25 percentage point increase in expected rate of return on assets Decrease $4 million Fiscal 2014 net periodic pension expense for the Company pension plans is expected to be approximately $107 million as compared to $177 million for fiscal 2013. The decrease is primarily related to the increase in discount rate from 4.3% to 5.2%.
