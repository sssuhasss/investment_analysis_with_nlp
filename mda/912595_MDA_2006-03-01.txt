ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This and other sections of this Annual Report contain certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which are intended to be covered by the safe harbors created thereby. These statements include, but are not limited to, statements about anticipated market conditions, expected growth rates of revenues and expenses, planned asset dispositions, disposition pricing, planned acquisitions and developments, property financings, expected interest rates and planned capital expenditures. Although the Company believes that the assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements are reasonable, any of the assumptions could be inaccurate and, therefore, there can be no assurance that the forward-looking statements included in this report on Form 10-K will prove to be accurate. In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in the forward-looking statements included herein, the inclusion of such information should not be regarded as a representation by the Company or any other person that the objectives and plans of the Company will be achieved. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Company consolidated financial statements, and the notes thereto, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires the Company to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and circumstances. The Company believes that its estimates and assumptions are reasonable in the circumstances; however, actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions. The Company believes that the estimates and assumptions that are most important to the portrayal of its financial condition and results of operations, in that they require the most subjective judgments, form the basis of accounting policies deemed to be most critical. These critical accounting policies include revenue recognition, capitalization of expenditures and depreciation of assets, impairment of long-lived assets, including goodwill, and fair value of derivative financial instruments. Revenue Recognition The Company leases multifamily residential apartments under operating leases primarily with terms of one year or less. Rental revenues are recognized using a method that represents a straight-line basis over the term of the lease and other revenues are recorded when earned. The Company records all gains and losses on real estate in accordance with Statement No. 66 Accounting for Sales of Real Estate . Capitalization of expenditures and depreciation of assets The Company carries its real estate assets at their depreciated cost. Depreciation is computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, which range from 8 to 40 years for land improvements and buildings, 5 years for furniture, fixtures, and equipment, and 3 to 5 years for computers and software, all of which are subjective determinations. Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred while significant improvements, renovations, and replacements are capitalized. The cost to complete any deferred repairs and maintenance at properties acquired by the Company in order to elevate the condition of the property to the Company standards are capitalized as incurred. Impairment of long-lived assets, including goodwill The Company accounts for long-lived assets in accordance with the provisions of Statement No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets ( Statement 144 ) and evaluates its goodwill 20 for impairment under Statement No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets ( Statement 142 ). The Company evaluates its goodwill for impairment on an annual basis in the Company fiscal fourth quarter, or sooner if a goodwill impairment indicator is identified. The Company periodically evaluates its long-lived assets, including its investments in real estate and goodwill, for indicators that would suggest that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. The judgments regarding the existence of such indicators are based on factors such as operating performance, market conditions, and legal factors. In accordance with Statement 144, long-lived assets, such as real estate assets, equipment, and purchased intangibles subject to amortization, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. Assets to be disposed of are separately presented in the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and are no longer depreciated. The assets and liabilities of a disposed group classified as held for sale are presented separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the balance sheet. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment, and is tested for impairment more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. An impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the asset fair value. This determination is made at the reporting unit level and consists of two steps. First, the Company determines the fair value of a reporting unit and compares it to its carrying amount. In the apartment industry, the primary method used for determining fair value is to divide annual operating cash flows by an appropriate capitalization rate. The Company determines the appropriate capitalization rate by reviewing the prevailing rates in a property market or submarket. Second, if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation, in accordance with Statement No. 141, Business Combinations . The residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill. Fair value of derivative financial instruments The Company utilizes certain derivative financial instruments, primarily interest rate swaps and caps, during the normal course of business to manage, or hedge, the interest rate risk associated with the Company variable rate debt or as hedges in anticipation of future debt transactions to manage well-defined interest rate risk associated with the transaction. The valuation of the derivative financial instruments under Statement No. 133 as amended requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the fair value of the instruments. In order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedging instrument, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item must be highly effective. While the Company calculation of hedge effectiveness contains some subjective determinations, the historical correlation of the cash flows of the hedging instruments and the underlying hedged item are measured by the Company before entering into the hedging relationship and have been found to be highly correlated. The Company performs ineffectiveness tests using the change in the variable cash flows method at the inception of the hedge and for each reporting period thereafter, through the term of the hedging instruments. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded in earnings. The change in fair value of the interest rate swaps and caps designated as cash flow hedges are recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income in the statement of shareholders equity. OVERVIEW OF THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2005 The Company results for 2005 were positively influenced by both the improvement in operational results of communities held throughout both the current and prior period ( same store ) and the positive impact from acquisitions in 2004 and 2005. 21 The Company 2005 same store operating results were helped by signs of economic recovery in the Company geographic areas of operation. Same store occupancy and average rental rates were both improved from the prior year. The Company grew externally during 2004 by following its acquisition strategy to invest in large and mid-sized growing markets in the southeastern United States. The Company acquired six properties in 2004 for which it benefited from a full year of revenues in 2005. The Company acquired an additional three properties in 2005. The Company sold one property in 2005. A joint venture the Company was invested in with Crow Holdings sold two properties in 2005 resulting in the winding up of the joint venture and generating approximately $3 million in gains and $1.7 million related to a one-time incentive fee for the Company. The Company did experience an increase in interest expense in 2005 as its total debt outstanding and average borrowing costs both increased from prior year levels. The following is a discussion of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of the Company for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003. This discussion should be read in conjunction with all of the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As of December 31, 2005, the total number of apartment units the Company owned or had an ownership interest in, including the properties owned by the Crow JV was 38,227 in 132 Communities compared to the 37,904 apartment units in 132 Communities owned at December 31, 2004, and the 35,734 apartment units in 127 Communities owned at December 31, 2003. For properties owned 100% by the Company, the average monthly rental per apartment unit, excluding units in lease-up, increased to $695 at December 31, 2005, from $680 at December 31, 2004, and $667 at December 31, 2003. For these same units, overall occupancy at December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003 was 94.6%, 93.6%, and 92.7%, respectively. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COMPARISON OF THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2005, TO THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004 Property revenues for the year ended December 31, 2005, increased by approximately $29,928,000 from the year ended December 31, 2004, due to (i) a $12,816,000 increase in property revenues from the six properties acquired in 2004 (the 2004 Acquisitions ), (ii) a $8,934,000 increase in property revenues from the properties held throughout both periods, and (iii) a $8,178,000 increase in property revenues from the three properties acquired in 2005 (the 2005 Acquisitions ). Property operating expenses include costs for property personnel, building repairs and maintenance, real estate taxes and insurance, utilities, landscaping and other property related costs. Property operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2005, increased by approximately $10,968,000 from the year ended December 31, 2004, due primarily to increases of property operating expenses of (i) $5,356,000 from the 2004 Acquisitions, (ii) $3,336,000 from the 2005 Acquisitions, and (iii) $2,276,000 from the properties held throughout both periods. Depreciation expense increased by approximately $6,397,000 primarily due to the increases of depreciation expense of (i) $4,217,000 from the 2004 Acquisitions, (ii) $3,954,000 from the 2005 Acquisitions, and (iii) $1,424,000 from the communities held throughout both periods. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in depreciation expense of $3,198,000 from the expiration of the amortization of fair market value of leases of 13 communities acquired by the Company in 2003. Property management expenses increased by approximately $1,514,000 from the year ended December 31, 2004, to the year ended December 31, 2005, partially due to increased personnel expenses and incentive compensation both related to property acquisitions. General and administrative expenses increased by approximately $1,114,000 over this same period. Property management expenses and general and administrative expenses for 2005 were both impacted by a cumulative charge to amortize four years of a ten year senior management incentive plan which the Company previously expected would expense from 2007 through 2011. Interest expense increased approximately $7,893,000 in 2005 from 2004 due primarily to the increase in the amount of debt outstanding from 2004 and the increase in the Company average borrowing cost from 5.0% over the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, to 5.3% over the twelve months ended December 31, 2005. 22 For the year ended December 31, 2005, the Company recorded total gains of approximately $3,034,000 from the sale of two properties owned by a joint venture of the Company. The sales of these properties resulted in an additional incentive fee being paid to the Company of approximately $1,723,000 in 2005. For the year ended December 31, 2004, the Company recorded a total of approximately $9,074,000 in gains from two property sales, of which approximately $3,249,000 represented the Company share of the gain from the sale of a property which was owned by a joint venture of the Company. In 2005 and 2004, the Company refinanced the debt on several of its communities primarily to take advantage of the lower interest rate environment. In 2005, this resulted in a loss on debt extinguishment of approximately $409,000 due to the write-off of deferred financing costs and prepayment penalties. In 2004, the Company recorded a gain of approximately $1,095,000 related to the early extinguishment of debt. For the years ended December 31, 2005, and 2004, the Company recorded net gains on insurance and other settlement proceeds totaling approximately $749,000 mainly related to insurance settlements from hurricane damage experienced at some of the Company Communities and $2,683,000 mainly related to insurance settlements from fires at some of the Company Communities, respectively. Primarily as a result of the foregoing, net income decreased by approximately $5,454,000 in 2005 over 2004. COMPARISON OF THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004, TO THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003 Comparisons of income from property operations for the years ended December 31, 2004, and 2003, were impacted by various factors. As a result of the buyout in August of 2003 of the partnership interest in Bre/Maac Associates, LLC, (the BreMaac Buyout ), the Company joint venture with Blackstone Real Estate Advisors ( Blackstone ), the Company consolidated financial statements for 2003 include the impact of approximately only four months of operations of the 10 properties which were previously owned by the joint venture and accounted for using the equity method. The Company consolidated financial statements for 2004 include a full twelve months of operations for these 10 properties. The Company consolidated financial statements for 2003 also included only partial year results for the four properties acquired during 2003 (one of which was subsequently transferred to Mid-America CH/Realty, LP, the Company joint venture with Crow Holdings (the Green Oaks Transfer )). The Company also acquired an additional six properties during the course of 2004. During 2003, the Company had two development communities which completed lease-up. Finally, the Company performance during 2004 and 2003 was impacted by changes in performance of the communities that were held throughout both periods. Property revenues for the year ended December 31, 2004, increased by approximately $31,262,000 from the year ended December 31, 2003, due to (i) a $12,481,000 increase in property revenues from the BreMaac Buyout, (ii) a $7,759,000 increase in property revenues from 2004 Acquisitions, (iii) a $7,372,000 increase in property revenues from the acquisitions of the Los Rios Park, Lighthouse Court and Legacy Pines communities in 2003 (the 2003 Acquisitions ), (iv) a $4,062,000 increase in property revenues from the communities held throughout both periods, and (v) a $189,000 increase in property revenues from the communities in lease-up in 2003 (the Communities in Lease-up ). These increases were partially offset by a decrease in property revenues of $601,000 due to the Green Oaks Transfer. Property operating expenses include costs for property personnel, building repairs and maintenance, real estate taxes and insurance, utilities, landscaping and other property related costs. Property operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2004, increased by approximately $14,056,000 from the year ended December 31, 2003, due primarily to increases of property operating expenses of (i) $6,008,000 from the BreMaac Buyout, (ii) $3,966,000 from the 2003 Acquisitions, (iii) $3,307,000 from the 2004 Acquisitions, (iv) $593,000 from the communities held throughout both periods, (v) $514,000 from expenses related to the extraordinary hurricane season in 2004, and (vi) $27,000 from the Communities in Lease-up. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in property operating expenses of $359,000 from the Green Oaks Transfer. Depreciation expense increased by approximately $10,579,000 primarily due to the increases of depreciation expense of (i) $3,659,000 from the 2003 Acquisitions, (ii) $3,362,000 from the 2004 Acquisitions, (iii) $2,781,000 from the BreMaac Buyout, and (iv) $802,000 from the communities held 23 throughout both periods. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in depreciation expense of $25,000 from the Communities in Lease-up. Property management expenses increased by approximately $1,922,000 from the year ended December 31, 2003, to the year ended December 31, 2004, partially due to increased personnel expenses and incentive compensation related to property acquisitions. General and administrative expenses increased by approximately $2,005,000 over this same period partially related to expenses associated with the implementation of new property management software and expenses resulting from new regulatory requirements. Interest expense increased approximately $5,867,000 from 2003 due primarily to the increase in the amount of debt outstanding from 2003. The Company average borrowing cost at December 31, 2004, and 2003, was 5.4%. For the year ended December 31, 2004, the Company recorded a total of approximately $9,074,000 in gains from two property sales, of which approximately $3,249,000 represented the Company share of the gain from the sale of a property which was owned by one of the Company joint ventures. In 2003, the Company sold one property and recorded a gain of approximately $1,919,000. In 2004, and 2003, the Company refinanced the debt on several of its communities primarily to take advantage of the lower interest rate environment. This resulted in gains of approximately $1,095,000 and $111,000 related to the early extinguishment of debt in 2004 and 2003, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2004, and 2003, the Company recorded net gains on insurance and other settlement proceeds totaling approximately $2,683,000, mainly related to insurance settlements from fires at some of the Company Communities, and approximately $2,860,000, mainly related to insurance settlements from the fire at the Company headquarters in March 2002, respectively. Primarily as a result of the foregoing, net income increased by $4,992,000 in 2004 over 2003. FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS Funds from operations ( FFO ) represents net income (computed in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP ) excluding extraordinary items, minority interest in Operating Partnership income, gain on disposition of real estate assets, plus depreciation of real estate, and adjustments for joint ventures to reflect FFO on the same basis. This definition of FFO is in accordance with the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trust ( NAREIT ) definition. Disposition of real estate assets includes sales of discontinued operations as well as proceeds received from insurance and other settlements from property damage. In response to the Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Policy Statement relating to EITF Topic D-42 concerning the calculation of earnings per share for the redemption of preferred stock, the Company has included the amount charged to retire preferred stock in excess of carrying values in its FFO calculation. The Company policy is to expense the cost of interior painting, vinyl flooring, and blinds as incurred for stabilized properties. During the stabilization period for acquisition properties, these items are capitalized as part of the total repositioning program of newly acquired properties, and, thus are not deducted in calculating FFO. FFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income or any other GAAP measurement of performance, as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating, investing, and financing activities as a measure of liquidity. The Company believes that FFO is helpful to investors in understanding the Company operating performance in that such calculation excludes depreciation expense on real estate assets. The Company believes that GAAP historical cost depreciation of real estate assets is generally not correlated with changes in the value of those assets, whose value does not diminish predictably over time, as historical cost depreciation implies. The Company calculation of FFO may differ from the methodology for calculating FFO utilized by other REITs and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other REITs. 24 The following table is a reconciliation of FFO to net income for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003 (dollars and shares in thousands): Years ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Net income $ 19,744 $ 25,198 $ 20,206 Depreciation real estate assets 73,704 67,302 56,701 Net gain on insurance and other settlement proceeds (749 ) (2,683 ) (2,860 ) Gain on disposition within unconsolidated entities (3,034 ) (3,249 ) Net loss (gain) on insurance and other settlement proceeds of discontinued operations 25 (526 ) (82 ) Depreciation real estate assets of discontinued operations 681 1,022 Gain on sale of discontinued operations (5,825 ) (1,919 ) Depreciation real estate assets of unconsolidated entities 482 1,688 2,345 Preferred dividend distribution (14,329 ) (14,825 ) (15,419 ) Minority interest in operating partnership income 1,571 2,264 1,360 Premiums and original issuance costs associated with the redemption of preferred stock (5,987 ) Funds from operations $ 77,414 $ 70,025 $ 55,367 Weighted average shares and units: Basic 24,025 22,981 21,093 Diluted 24,227 23,316 21,354 FFO increased during 2005 by approximately $7,389,000 to $77,414,000 versus $70,025,000 in 2004 principally because of improved operation results both from the Company same store portfolio and the addition of properties from the 2004 Acquisitions and 2005 Acquisitions as previously reviewed in the net income discussion above. FFO increased during 2004 by approximately $14,658,000 to $70,025,000 versus $55,367,000 in 2003 principally because of the addition of properties through the BreMaac Buyout and 2003 Acquisitions and 2004 Acquisitions as previously reviewed in the net income discussion above. FFO for 2003 included a charge of $5,987,000 for premiums and original issuance costs associated with the redemption of preferred stock. TRENDS Property performance over the past four years has been pressured by an imbalance between supply and demand for apartment units in many of the Company markets, but has begun to show signs of improvement. The Company believes that demand by apartment renters is most impacted by household formation, which is driven by job formation. Job formation has been quite weak in many of the Company markets, and most noticeably in the larger metro areas, such as Atlanta, Houston and Dallas. Some of the smaller and mid-size markets in which the Company operates, such as Jackson, Mississippi, Jacksonville, Florida, and Columbus, Georgia have been less impacted. On the supply side, low interest rates encouraged over-building of apartments, especially in the larger metropolitan areas. Delivery of new apartment units during this period of weakened apartment demand increased competition, reducing apartment occupancy levels, especially in the larger markets. In addition, single-family homes, which are direct competition for apartments, became even more affordable, and home ownership continued to climb in the Company markets. In 2005, the Company began to see a turn in many of its markets, particularly in Florida and Georgia, where there are some signs of improving demand coupled with a slight slow down in supply. The Company large-tier markets, which have been under the most pressure during the economic downturn, are beginning to show signs of absorbing the oversupply of new apartments and returning to historical occupancy and pricing levels, while the Company smaller tier and mid-sized markets are benefiting from improving market fundamentals which support continued stable growth. The policies of the Federal Reserve, which has raised short-term interest rates by 300 basis points in a short span of time, also seem to be having some early impact 25 on the supply of new apartments. Development costs of apartments and of single-family homes also appear to be rising, as are mortgage interest rates, with the likelihood that this may slightly alleviate this competition. The Company believes that the impact of higher demand from apartment renters, a reduced rate of increase in supply, and reduced competition from single-family homes will contribute to better operating results in 2006. While rising interest rates will also increase the Company cost of borrowing, the Company has mitigated part of the impact of this by putting in place $25 million of forward swap, such that the interest rate on approximately 87% of its debt has been fixed, swapped, forward swapped, or capped, compared to 81% at the end of 2004. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Net cash flow provided by operating activities increased by approximately $11,458,000 to $99,687,000 for 2005 compared to $88,229,000 for 2004 mainly related to the growth of the Company through acquisitions and improved operating results in 2005. Net cash flow provided by operating activities increased by approximately $11,709,000 to $88,229,000 for 2004 compared to $76,520,000 for 2003 mainly related to the growth of the Company through the BreMaac Buyout and the 2003 Acquisitions and 2004 Acquisitions. Net cash used in investing activities decreased by approximately $60,031,000 from $168,383,000 in 2004 to $108,352,000 in 2005. Net cash used in investing activities in 2003 was approximately $139,555,000. A total of approximately $105,643,000 was invested in 2005 to acquire properties, this compares to approximately $155,088,000 in 2004, and $138,688,000 in 2003. Capital improvements to existing real estate assets during 2005, 2004 and 2003 totaled approximately $27,301,000, $30,413,000 and $22,832,000, respectively. Net cash provided by financing activities decreased approximately $66,896,000 to $13,596,000 in 2005 from $80,492,000 in 2004 and $61,680,000 in 2003. Cash provided from credit lines and notes payable decreased approximately $223,851,000 from approximately $280,930,000 in 2004 to $57,079,000 in 2005. Cash provided from credit lines and notes payable was approximately $245,897,000 in 2003. Principal payments on notes payable dropped to approximately $10,921,000 in 2005 from $152,046,000 in 2004 and $175,852,000 in 2003 as the Company had fewer refinancings in 2005. Proceeds from issuances of common shares and units increased in 2005 to approximately $39,459,000 mainly related to the Company use of its DRSPP. Proceeds from issuances of common shares and units decreased approximately $34,628,000 from 2003 to 2004 as the Company sold 1,765,000 shares of common stock to certain advisory clients of Cohen & Steers Capital Management, Inc. and to Scudder RREEF Real Estate Fund II, Inc. in 2003 to partially fund the BreMaac Buyout and 2003 Acquisitions. The weighted average interest rate at December 31, 2005, for the $1.14 billion of debt outstanding was 5.4% compared to 5.4% on $1.08 billion of debt outstanding at December 31, 2004. The Company utilizes both conventional and tax exempt debt to help finance its activities. Borrowings are made through individual property mortgages and secured credit facilities. The Company utilizes fixed rate borrowings, interest rate swaps and interest rate caps to manage its current and future interest rate risk. More details on the Company borrowings can be found in the schedule on page 28. At December 31, 2005, the Company had secured credit facilities relationships with Prudential Mortgage Capital which are credit enhanced by the Federal National Mortgage Association ( FNMA ), FNMA, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ( Freddie MAC ), and a group of banks led by AmSouth Bank. Together, these credit facilities provided a total borrowing capacity of $1.1 billion at December 31, 2005, with an availability to borrow of $1.0 billion. At December 31, 2005, the Company had total borrowings outstanding under these credit facilities of $920 million. Approximately 71% of the Company outstanding obligations at December 31, 2005, were borrowed through facilities with/or credit enhanced by FNMA (the FNMA Facilities ). The FNMA Facilities have a combined line limit of $950 million, $881 million of which was available to borrow at December 31, 2005. Various traunches of the facilities mature from 2010 through 2014. The FNMA Facilities provide for both fixed and variable rate borrowings. The interest rate on the majority of the variable portion renews every 90 days and is based on the FNMA Discount Mortgage Backed Security ( DMBS ) rate on the date of renewal, 26 which has typically approximated three-month LIBOR less an average spread of 0.04% over the life of the FNMA Facilities, plus a credit enhancement fee of 0.62% to 0.795%. Each of the Company secured credit facilities is subject to various covenants and conditions on usage, and are subject to periodic re-evaluation of collateral. If the Company were to fail to satisfy a condition to borrowing, the available credit under one or more of the facilities could not be drawn, which could adversely affect the Company liquidity. In the event of a reduction in real estate values the amount of available credit could be reduced. Moreover, if the Company were to fail to make a payment or violate a covenant under a credit facility, after applicable cure periods one or more of its lenders could declare a default, accelerate the due date for repayment of all amounts outstanding and/or foreclose on properties securing such facilities. Any such event could have a material adverse effect on the Company. On May 26, 2005, the Company gave the required one year notice to redeem all of the issued and outstanding shares of its 8-5/8% Series G Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock ( Series G ) on May 26, 2006, for the total redemption price of $10 million. As a result, in accordance with Statement No. 150, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity , the Company classified the Series G as a liability within notes payable as of May 26, 2005, on the accompanying consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2005, the Company had interest rate swaps in effect totaling a notional amount of approximately $659 million. To date, these swaps have proven to be highly effective hedges. The Company also had entered into a future interest rate swap totaling a notional amount of $25 million. This swap goes into effect in February 2006. The Company also had interest rate cap agreements totaling a notional amount of approximately $23 million in effect as of December 31, 2005. 27 Summary details of the debt outstanding at December 31, 2005, follows in the table below: Line Limit Line Availability Outstanding Balance/ Notional Amount Average Interest Rate Average Rate Maturity Average Contract Maturity COMBINED DEBT Fixed Rate or Swapped Conventional $ 847,354,719 5.7 % 4/20/2011 4/20/2011 Tax Exempt 87,015,000 4.5 % 6/25/2013 6/25/2013 Preferred Series G 10,000,000 8.6 % 5/26/2006 5/26/2006 Subtotal Fixed Rate or Swapped 944,369,719 5.6 % 6/13/2011 6/13/2011 Variable Rate Conventional 162,245,891 4.8 % 2/24/2006 6/14/2012 Tax Exempt 10,855,004 4.0 % 1/15/2006 5/30/2020 Conventional Capped 11,720,000 4.9 % 3/1/2009 3/1/2009 Tax Exempt Capped 10,855,000 3.9 % 4/25/2008 4/25/2008 Subtotal Variable Rate 195,675,895 4.7 % 2/19/2006 1/16/2013 Total Combined Debt Outstanding $ 1,140,045,614 5.4 % 7/15/2010 9/21/2011 UNDERLYING DEBT Individual Property Mortgages/Bonds Conventional Fixed Rate $ 139,354,719 5.0 % 11/7/2014 11/7/2014 Tax Exempt Fixed Rate 25,685,000 5.5 % 12/2/2024 12/2/2024 Tax Exempt Variable Rate 4,760,004 4.2 % 1/15/2006 6/1/2028 Preferred Series G 10,000,000 8.6 % 5/26/2006 5/26/2006 FNMA Credit Facilities Tax Free Borrowings $ 88,280,000 $ 78,280,000 78,280,000 3.9 % 1/15/2006 3/1/2014 Conventional Borrowings Fixed Rate Borrowings 110,000,000 110,000,000 110,000,000 7.2 % 1/10/2009 1/10/2009 Variable Rate Borrowings 751,720,000 692,955,000 623,102,000 4.9 % 2/28/2006 5/20/2013 Subtotal FNMA Facilities 950,000,000 881,235,000 811,382,000 5.1 % 7/15/2006 11/12/2012 Freddie Mac Credit Facility 100,000,000 96,404,000 96,404,000 5.0 % 3/9/2006 7/1/2011 AmSouth Credit Facility 40,000,000 30,203,438 12,459,891 6.0 % 1/31/2006 5/24/2007 Union Planters Bank 40,000,000 5.4 % 1/31/2006 4/1/2009 Total Underlying Debt Outstanding $ 1,140,045,614 5.1 % 11/30/2007 1/31/2013 HEDGING INSTRUMENTS Interest Rate Swaps LIBOR indexed $ 598,000,000 5.5 % 9/24/2010 LIBOR indexed Forward Interest Rate Swap 25,000,000 5.3 % 2/1/2013 BMA indexed 61,330,000 4.1 % 9/10/2008 Total Interest Rate Swaps $ 684,330,000 5.4 % 8/19/2010 Interest Rate Caps LIBOR indexed $ 11,720,000 6.0 % 3/1/2009 BMA indexed 10,855,000 6.0 % 4/25/2008 Total Interest Rate Caps $ 22,575,000 6.0 % 10/2/2008 During 2005, the Company offered an average 1.5% discount through its DRSPP and issued approximately 784,000 shares of common stock through the direct stock purchase feature of this plan, generating approximately $32.3 million in proceeds. During 2004, the Company offered an average discount of 2.0% from August through December through its DRSPP. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, the Company issued approximately 392,000 shares of common stock through the direct stock purchase feature of this plan, generating approximately $15.1 million in proceeds. On July 10, 2003, in an underwritten public offering, the Company sold 5,600,000 shares of its 8.30% Series H Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock ( Series H ) at $25 per share less an underwriting discount of $0.7875 per share. The net proceeds of the sale were applied to the redemption of all the issued and 28 outstanding shares of the Company 9.5% Series A Cumulative Preferred Stock and 9-3/8% Series C Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock as well as 1,600,000 shares of the 1,938,830 issued and outstanding shares of the Company 8-7/8% Series B Cumulative Preferred Stock ( Series B ) on August 12, 2003. On July 16, 2003, the underwriters of the Company Series H offering exercised an option to purchase an additional 525,000 shares of the Series H preferred stock for $25 per share less the underwriting discount, and on August 4, 2003, the underwriters exercised an option to purchase the remaining additional 75,000 shares of the Series H preferred stock for $25 per share less the underwriting discount. The net proceeds were used to redeem the remaining issued and outstanding shares of the Series B preferred stock on August 18, 2003. On August 22, 2003, the Company sold 700,000 shares of its common stock to certain advisory clients of Cohen & Steers Capital Management, Inc. The stock was sold at a price of $28.40 per share. The $19,870,000 in net proceeds from the sale were used to partially fund the BreMaac Buyout. On September 19, 2003, the Company sold 665,000 shares of its common stock to certain advisory clients of Cohen & Steers Capital Management, Inc. and to Scudder RREEF Real Estate Fund II, Inc. The stock was sold at a price of $29.36 per share. The $19,500,000 in net proceeds from the sale were used to partially fund the purchase of the Los Rios Park apartments. On December 2, 2003, the Company sold 400,000 shares of its common stock to RREEF America, L.L.C. on behalf of itself and Scudder RREEF Real Estate Fund II, Inc. The stock was sold at a price of $30.00 per share. The $11,996,000 in net proceeds from the sale were used to partially fund the acquisition of the Lighthouse Court apartments. The Company believes that it has adequate resources to fund its current operations, annual refurbishment of its properties, and incremental investment in new apartment properties. The Company is relying on the efficient operation of the financial markets to finance debt maturities, and also is heavily reliant on the creditworthiness of FNMA, which provides credit enhancement for approximately $811 million of the Company debt. The interest rate market for FNMA DMBS, which in the Company experience is highly correlated with three-month LIBOR interest rates, is also an important component of the Company liquidity and interest rate swap effectiveness. In the event that the FNMA DMBS market becomes less efficient, or the credit of FNMA becomes impaired, the Company would seek alternative sources of debt financing. For the year ended December 31, 2005, the Company net cash provided by operating activities exceeded improvements to existing real estate assets, distributions to unitholders, and dividends paid on common and preferred shares by approximately $1.6 million. This compares to shortfalls for the years ended December 31, 2004, and 2003, of approximately $10.9 million and $11.0 million, respectively. While the Company has sufficient liquidity to permit distributions at current rates, from time to time the Company may utilize additional borrowings to cover shortfalls if necessary. Any significant deterioration in operations could result in the Company financial resources to be insufficient to pay distributions to shareholders at the current rate, in which event the Company would be required to reduce the distribution rate. The following table reflects the Company total contractual cash obligations which consists of its long-term debt and operating leases as of December 31, 2005, (dollars in 000 s): Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Thereafter Total Long-Term Debt (1) $ 38,889 $ 17,017 $ 110,510 $ 106,846 $ 121,948 $ 744,836 $ 1,140,046 Operating Lease 4 4 4 12 Total $ 38,893 $ 17,021 $ 110,514 $ 106,846 $ 121,948 $ 744,836 $ 1,140,058 (1) Represents principal payments. OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS At December 31, 2005, and 2004, the Company did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually 29 narrow or limited purposes. The Company joint venture with Blackstone (terminated in 2003) was established in order to raise capital through asset sales to fund development (while acquiring management fees to help offset the reduction in FFO from the sale), share repurchases, and other capital requirements. The Company joint ventures with Crow Holdings were established to acquire approximately $200 million of multifamily properties. In addition, the Company does not engage in trading activities involving non-exchange traded contracts. As such, the Company is not materially exposed to any financing, liquidity, market, or credit risk that could arise if it had engaged in such relationships. The Company does not have any relationships or transactions with persons or entities that derive benefits from their non-independent relationships with the Company or its related parties other than what is disclosed in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 13. The Company investments in its real estate joint ventures are unconsolidated and are recorded on the equity method as the Company does not have a controlling interest. INSURANCE In the opinion of management, property and casualty insurance is in place that provides adequate coverage to provide financial protection against normal insurable risks such that it believes that any loss experienced would not have a significant impact on the Company liquidity, financial position, or results of operations. INFLATION Substantially all of the resident leases at the Communities allow, at the time of renewal, for adjustments in the rent payable there under, and thus may enable the Company to seek rent increases. Almost all leases are for one year or less. The short-term nature of these leases generally serves to reduce the risk to the Company of the adverse effects of inflation. IMPACT OF RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement No. 153, Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets, an amendment of APB Opinion No. 29 ( Statement 153 ). Statement 153 was a result of a joint effort by the FASB and the IASB to improve financial reporting by eliminating certain narrow differences between their existing accounting standards. Statement 153 amends APB Opinion No. 29 to eliminate the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance. A nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange. Statement 153 is applied prospectively for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005. The adoption of Statement 153 did not have a material impact on the Company consolidated financial condition or results of operations taken as a whole. In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement No. 123 (revised December 2004), Share-Based Payment ( Statement 123(R) ). Statement 123(R) replaces FASB Statement No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation , and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees . Statement 123(R) will require compensation costs related to share-based payment transactions to be recognized in the financial statements. With limited exceptions, the amount of compensation cost will be measured based on the grant date fair value of the equity or the liability instruments issued. In addition, liability awards will be remeasured each reporting period. Compensation cost will be recognized over the period that an employee provides service in exchange for the award. Statement 123(R) is effective as of the beginning of the first annual reporting period that begins after June 15, 2005. The Company will adopt Statement 123(R) effective January 1, 2006, and does not believe it will have a material impact on the Company consolidated financial condition or results of operations taken as a whole. In March 2005, the SEC issued SAB 107 to provide public companies additional guidance in applying the provisions of Statement 123(R). Among other things, SAB 107 describes the SEC staff expectations in determining the assumptions that underlie the fair value estimates and discusses the interaction of Statement 123(R) with certain existing SEC guidance. The guidance is also beneficial to users of financial statements in 30 analyzing the information provided under statement 123(R). SAB 107 will be applied upon the adoption of Statement 123(R). In March 2005, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations-an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143 ( Interpretation 47 ). Interpretation 47 clarifies that the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in FASB Statement No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations , ( Statement 143 ) refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and/or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity. Interpretation 47 is effective no later than the end of fiscal years ending after December 15, 2005, (December 31, 2005, for calendar-year enterprises). Retrospective application for interim financial information is permitted but is not required. The adoption of Interpretation 47 did not have a material impact on the Company consolidated financial condition or results of operations taken as a whole. In June 2005, the FASB ratified EITF 04-5: Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights ( EITF 04-5 ). EITF 04-5 provides a framework for determining whether a general partner is required to consolidate limited partners. The new framework is significantly different than the guidance in SOP 78-9 and would make it more difficult for a general partner to overcome the presumption that it controls the limited partnership, requiring the limited partner to have substantive kick-out or participating rights. Kick-out rights are the right to dissolve or liquidate the partnership or to otherwise remove the general partner without cause and participating rights are the right to effectively participate in significant decisions made in the ordinary course of the partnership business. EITF 04-5 became effective immediately for all newly formed limited partnerships and existing limited partnerships which are modified. The guidance will become effective for existing limited partnerships which are not modified the beginning of the first reporting period in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. The Company does not believe the adoption of EITF 04-5 will have a material impact on the Company consolidated financial condition or results of operations taken as a whole.
