Item 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The purpose of this Management Discussion and Analysis ( MD&A ) is to provide an overview of the Company financial condition and results of operations as well as an analysis of the factors that caused certain key elements of our financial statements to change from one year to the next. In this discussion, we may make statements that are not based on historical fact. All such statements are expressly forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although such statements are based on management current estimates and expectations, and currently available competitive, financial, and economic data, forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain. We therefore caution the reader that there are a variety of factors could cause business conditions and results to differ materially from what is contained in our forward-looking statements. A list of some of the factors most likely to occur that could cause actual results to differ from our forward-looking statements is presented at the end of this MD&A. In this MD&A, we use certain terms and abbreviations that are defined as follows: APB Accounting Principles Board Babtie Group The Babtie Group Limited is a leading provider of technical and professional services to clients operating in the infrastructure, facilities, environmental, defense, and outsourcing markets, among other. The Babtie Group employs approximately 3,500 people in offices located throughout primarily the United Kingdom and Asia, and was acquired during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004. Backlog Backlog represents the total dollar amount of revenues we expect to record in the future as a result of performing work under contracts that have been awarded to us. Our policy with respect to O&M contracts, however, is to include in backlog the amount of revenues we expect to receive for one succeeding year, regardless of the remaining life of the contract. For federal programs (other than federal O&M contracts), our policy is to include in backlog the full contract award, whether funded or unfunded, and exclude option periods. Operating profit From the Consolidated Statements of Earnings; operating profit means revenues, less direct costs of contracts and SG&A expenses. SFAS Statement of Financial Accounting Standards; an accounting standard adopted by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ). SG&A expenses From the Consolidated Statements of Earnings; SG&A expenses means selling, general and administrative expenses. Overview Net earnings in fiscal 2005 increased by 17.1% as compared to last year, and EPS (diluted) grew by 14.2%. We saw increased revenues from clients operating in many of the industry groups and markets we serve, but in particular, oil & gas and refining, and infrastructure. Contributing to the increase in revenues were the effects of including the results of operations of the Babtie Group for all Page 21 Table of Contents of fiscal 2005, and a 31.7% increase in pass-through costs. When we are responsible for subcontract labor or third-party materials and equipment, we reflect the costs of such items in both revenues and costs. Since pass-through costs (which are incurred primarily on projects requiring field services) typically do not have significant margins, it is not unusual for us to experience an increase or decrease in revenues without experiencing a corresponding increase or decrease in our gross margins and operating profit. Our cash balances more than doubled during fiscal 2005. Cash and cash equivalents increased from $100.1 million at September 30, 2004 to $239.8 million at September 30, 2005. Our net cash (defined as cash and cash equivalents less bank debt) increased from $20.1 million at September 30, 2004 to $143.9 million at September 30, 2005. Additions to property and equipment used $43.9 million of cash and cash equivalents during fiscal 2005 as compared to $37.1 million last year. Our cash balances, combined with a borrowing capacity of $290.0 million under our long-term, unsecured revolving credit facility, provide sufficient capital resources for us to fund our on-going operations. Critical Accounting Policies In order to understand better the changes that may occur to key elements of our financial condition and operating results, a reader of this MD&A should endeavor to understand the critical accounting policies we apply in preparing our consolidated financial statements. The Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this report were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and the financial statements of any business entity performing long-term engineering and construction-type contracts requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect both the entity results of operations as well as the carrying values of its assets and liabilities. Although our significant accounting polices are described in Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the following discussion is intended to describe those accounting policies most critical to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Revenue Accounting for Contracts and Use of Joint Ventures In accounting for long-term engineering and construction-type contracts, we follow the provisions of the AICPA Statement of Position 81-1 Accounting for Performance of Construction-Type and Certain Production-Type Contracts . In general, we recognize revenues at the time we provide services. Depending on the commercial terms of the contract, we recognize revenues either when costs are incurred, or using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting by relating contract costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion. This method of revenue recognition requires us to prepare estimates of costs to complete contracts in progress. In making such estimates, judgments are required to evaluate contingencies such as potential variances in schedule, the cost of materials and labor, and productivity; and the impact of change orders, liability claims, contract disputes, and achievement of contractual performance standards. Many of our engineering and construction contracts provide for reimbursement of costs plus a fixed or percentage fee. In some of the markets we serve there is an increasing trend towards cost-reimbursable contracts with incentive-fee arrangements. In certain instances, we base our incentive fees on achievement of target completion dates, target costs, and/or other performance criteria. Failure to meet these targets or increases in contract costs can result in unrealized incentive fees or non-recoverable costs, which could exceed revenues recognized from the project. One such contract is with the U.S. Department of Energy for the Fernald Closure Project. This contract provides for incentive fees based on schedule and cost. In addition, the terms of the contract stipulate that the incentive fees may not be fully billed to the DOE until the completion of the project, currently estimated to occur in 2007. At September 30, 2005 we had recognized $38.4 million of deferred fees relating to this contract-completion. We provide for contract losses in their entirety in the period they become known, without regard to the percentage of completion. Page 22 Table of Contents The nature of our business results in clients, subcontractors or vendors occasionally presenting claims against us for recovery of costs they incurred in excess of what they expected to incur, or for which they believe they are not contractually responsible. Similarly, and in the normal course of business, we may present claims to our clients for costs we have incurred for which we believe we are not contractually responsible. In those situations where a claim against us may result in additional costs to the contract, we would include in the total estimated costs of the contract (and therefore, the estimated amount of margin to be earned under the contract) an estimate, based on all relevant facts and circumstances available, of the additional costs to be incurred. In those situations where we have incurred additional costs for which we believe the client is contractually responsible, we may present a claim to the client for such costs. In such situations, we include in revenues the amount of costs incurred, without profit, to the extent it is probable that the claims will result in additional contract revenue, and the amount of such additional revenue can be reliably estimated. Costs associated with unapproved change orders are included in revenues using substantially the same criteria used for claims. Certain cost-reimbursable contracts with government customers as well as certain commercial clients provide that contract costs are subject to audit and adjustment. In this situation, revenues are recorded at the time services are performed based upon the amounts we expect to realize upon completion of the contracts. In those situations where an audit indicates that we may have billed a client for costs not allowable under the terms of the contract, we estimate the amount of such nonbillable costs and adjust our revenues accordingly. As is common in the industry, we execute certain contracts jointly with third parties through various forms of joint ventures. For certain of these joint ventures (i.e., where we have an undivided interest in the assets and liabilities of the venture), we recognize our proportionate share of joint venture revenues, costs and operating profit in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings. For other investments in engineering and construction joint ventures, we use the equity method of accounting. Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees We account for stock-based employee compensation using the intrinsic value method, in accordance with APB Opinion No. 25 Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees . Accordingly, on the date a stock option is granted to an employee, we measure compensation cost based on the excess, if any, of the market price of the Company common stock over the exercise price of the awarded option. In accordance with current accounting standards, we compute a pro forma expense amount for stock options issued, and we disclose this pro forma expense amount in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to compute the pro forma expense amount. The Black-Scholes model, however, was developed for use in estimating the value of publicly-traded options that have no vesting restrictions and which are fully transferable. In addition, the Black-Scholes model requires the use of assumptions in order to compute the hypothetical, fair value of an option. Changes in these assumptions can cause drastically different values being assigned to a stock option. Accordingly, we caution the readers of our consolidated financial statements that the results of applying the Black-Scholes model are not necessarily a reliable measure of the true fair value of stock options granted to employees. In December 2004, the FASB adopted SFAS No. 123R Accounting for Share-Based Payment. SFAS 123R supersedes APB 25 and requires companies to record an expense in their financial statements for stock-based awards using valuation methods like Black-Scholes. SFAS 123R will be effective for the Company beginning with the first quarter of fiscal 2006. Although we presently intend to adopt SFAS 123R retrospectively, there are several reasons why the expense we expect to record in the future relating to share-based compensation may differ from the amounts we ve disclosed in our prior pro forma disclosures. First, we have modified certain provisions of our broad-based employee Page 23 Table of Contents stock purchase plans to substantially eliminate the amount of expense that would otherwise be recorded under SFAS 123R. Second, the amount of stock options we will grant in the future is likely to be different from the level of awards that were made in the past. And third, the value assigned to the stock options we award in the future will be dependent on the assumptions used to value them. To the extent these assumptions change, the amount of expense we ll recognize in the future will most likely vary from amounts recognized in the past. Accounting for Pension Plans In accounting for pension plans, we follow the provisions of SFAS No. 87 Employers Accounting for Pensions. SFAS 87 requires the use of assumptions and estimates in order to calculate periodic pension cost, and the value of the plans assets and liabilities. These assumptions involve discount rates, investment returns, and projected salary increases, among others. We rely on qualified actuaries to assist us in valuing the financial position of the plans, and to provide advice regarding the actuarial assumptions used. The expected rates of return on plan assets for fiscal 2005 ranged from 6.0% to 9.0%; unchanged from last year. We believe this range of rates reflects the long-term returns expected on the plans assets, considering projected rates of inflation, the diversification of the plans assets, and the expected real rates of market returns. The discount rates used to compute plan liabilities were lowered from a range of 5.3% to 6.3% in fiscal 2004 to a range of 4.0% to 5.5% in fiscal 2005. Changes in the actuarial assumptions may have a material affect on the plans assets and liabilities, and the associated pension expense. Management, together with our actuaries, monitors trends in the marketplace within which our pension plans operate in order to assure the fairness of the actuarial assumptions used. In connection with the fiscal 2001 acquisition of certain engineering and contracting businesses from Stork N.V., we are negotiating the value of certain plan assets and prior service obligations that may be transferred from a multiemployer pension plan into a new, single-employer pension plan we formed during fiscal 2004 for the benefit of our employees in the Netherlands. If such a transfer were to occur presently, we believe the value of the assets we would receive would be less than the value of the prior service pension obligations we would assume. Included in Other Deferred Liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet at September 30, 2005 is approximately $40.4 million for the prior service obligations relating to the multiemployer pension plan in the Netherlands. Accounting for Income Taxes We account for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109 Accounting for Income Taxes . Judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the normal course of our business, we may engage in numerous transactions every day for which the ultimate tax outcome (including the period in which the transaction will ultimately be included in income or deducted as an expense) is uncertain. Additionally, we file income, franchise, gross receipts and similar tax returns in many jurisdictions. Our tax returns are subject to audit and investigation by the Internal Revenue Service, most states in the United States, and by various government agencies representing many jurisdictions outside the United States. Our effective tax rate increased from 35% during each of fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2004 to 36% during fiscal 2005. We routinely monitor the appropriateness of our worldwide tax rate, and we adjust our income tax expense in the period it is probable that actual results will differ from our estimates. Insurance Matters, Litigation, Claims, and Contingencies In the normal course of business, we are subject to certain contractual guarantees and litigation. Generally, such guarantees relate to project schedules and plant performance. Most of the litigation in which we are concerned involves the Company as a defendant in workers compensation, personal injury, environmental, environmental exposure, professional liability, and other similar lawsuits. We maintain insurance coverage for various aspects of our business and operations. However, we have elected to retain a portion of losses that may occur through the use of various deductibles, limits, and retentions under our insurance programs. Page 24 Table of Contents This situation may subject us to some future liability for which we are only partially insured, or completely uninsured. In addition, as a contractor providing services to various agencies of the United States federal government, we are subject to many levels of audits, investigations, and claims by, or on behalf of, the U.S. federal government with respect to contract performance, pricing, costs, cost allocations, and procurement practices. In accordance with SFAS No. 5 Accounting for Contingencies , we record in our Consolidated Balance Sheets amounts representing our estimated liability relating to such claims, guarantees, litigation, and audits and investigations. We rely on qualified actuaries to assist us in determining the level of reserves to establish for insurance-related claims that are known and have been asserted against us, and for insurance-related claims that are believed to have been incurred based on actuarial analysis, but have not yet been reported to our claims administrators as of the respective balance sheet dates. We include any adjustments to such insurance reserves in our consolidated results of operations. Testing Goodwill for Impairment In accordance with SFAS No. 142 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets , the amount of goodwill carried in our Consolidated Balance Sheets is tested annually for possible impairment. In conducting the impairment test, we may apply, in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 142, various valuation techniques to estimate the fair value of our reporting units. The values resulting from the application of these valuation techniques are not necessarily representative of the values we might obtain in a sale of our reporting units to a willing third party. Since the adoption of SFAS 142 in fiscal 2002, we have not recorded any impairment loss associated with our goodwill. Foreign Currencies In general, our principal exposure to fluctuating exchange rates relates to the effects of translating the financial statements of our subsidiaries operating outside the United States, which are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, into the U.S. dollar. We follow the provisions of SFAS No. 52 Foreign Currency Translation in preparing our consolidated financial statements. We believe our exposure to the effects that fluctuating foreign currencies may have on our consolidated results of operations is limited because our various operations invoice clients and satisfy their financial obligations primarily in their respective local functional currencies. In situations where our operations incur contract costs in currencies other than their functional currencies, we strive to have a portion of the related contract revenues denominated in the same currencies as the costs. Results of Operations General Our business focuses exclusively on providing technical, professional, and construction services to a large number of industrial, commercial, and governmental clients around the world. The services we provide generally fall into four broad categories: project services (which includes engineering, design, architectural, and similar services); construction services (which includes revenues earned from traditional field construction activities as well as modular construction activities); operations and maintenance ( O&M ) services (which includes revenues from contracts requiring us to operate and maintain large, complex facilities on behalf of clients as well as contracts involving process plant maintenance services and activities); and process, scientific, and systems consulting services (which includes revenues earned from providing a wide variety of scientific and consulting services to clients). Page 25 Table of Contents The scope of services we can provide our clients, therefore, ranges from consulting and conceptual design services (which are often required by clients in the very early stages of a project) to complete, single-responsibility, design-build-operate contracts. The following table sets forth our revenues by type of service for each year ended September 30 (in thousands): 2005 2004 2003 Project Services $ 2,469,879 $ 2,060,288 $ 1,894,777 Construction 1,884,066 1,581,023 1,751,875 Operations and Maintenance 895,356 704,206 743,094 Process, Scientific and Systems Consulting 385,700 248,718 225,855 $ 5,635,001 $ 4,594,235 $ 4,615,601 Certain amounts for fiscal 2003 have been reclassified to conform to the fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2005 presentation. We focus our services on clients operating in certain industry groups and markets. We believe these industry groups and markets have sufficient common needs to permit cross-utilization of our resources. The following table sets forth our revenues by these industry groups and markets for each year ended September 30 (in thousands): 2005 2004 2003 Oil & Gas and Refining $ 1,957,471 $ 1,270,468 $ 1,093,047 Federal Programs 1,160,664 1,051,016 1,070,740 Chemicals and Polymers 737,872 559,733 559,166 Pharmaceuticals and Biotechnology 514,836 713,566 652,036 Infrastructure 464,400 304,977 288,193 Buildings 462,147 354,742 352,998 Technology and Manufacturing 118,059 203,579 464,589 Pulp and Paper 63,562 42,339 58,076 Other 155,990 93,815 76,756 $ 5,635,001 $ 4,594,235 $ 4,615,601 Other includes projects for clients operating in a number of industries including food and consumer products, and basic resources (such as mining, minerals, and fertilizers). Fiscal 2005 Compared to Fiscal 2004 We recorded net earnings of $151.0 million, or $2.57 per diluted share, for fiscal year ended September 30, 2005, compared to net earnings of $129.0 million, or $2.25 per diluted share for fiscal 2004. Total revenues for fiscal 2005 increased by $1.0 billion, or 22.7%, to $5.6 billion, compared to total revenues of $4.6 billion for fiscal 2004. Revenues increased among most of the industry groups and markets we serve, lead by a 54.1% increase in revenues from clients operating in the oil & gas and refining industries, and a 52.3% increase in revenues from clients operating in the infrastructure market. The increase in revenues from our clients operating in the oil & gas and refining industries was due primarily to continuing projects we re executing in the area of clean fuels, combined with new awards of projects assisting refiners improve and enhance capacity. Also contributing to the increase in revenues were new awards in the upstream area of this market relating to oil sands extraction projects. The increase in revenues from clients operating in the infrastructure market was due primarily to the Page 26 Table of Contents inclusion of the Babtie Group for all of fiscal 2005. The Babtie Group contributed approximately $324.1 million of revenue during fiscal 2005, compared to approximately $54.0 million last year (the Babtie Group was acquired during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004). Also contributing to the increase in revenues was a $369.8 million increase in pass-through costs. When we are responsible for subcontract labor or third-party materials and equipment, we reflect the costs of such items in both revenues and costs. The level of pass-through costs included in revenues and costs will vary between reporting periods depending principally on the amount of procurement that clients choose to do themselves as opposed to using our services as well as on the normal winding down of field services activities on construction and O&M projects. See Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding pass-through costs. As a percentage of revenues, direct costs of contracts were 85.7% for fiscal 2005, compared to 85.5% for fiscal 2004. The percentage relationship between direct costs of contracts and revenues will fluctuate between reporting periods depending on a variety of factors including the mix of business during the reporting periods being compared as well as the level of margins earned from the various types of services provided. The increase in direct costs of contracts as a percentage of revenues was due to the increase in pass-through costs, off-set in part by the inclusion of the Babtie Group for all of fiscal 2005 (whose revenues are weighted towards project services). Since pass-through costs (which are incurred primarily on projects requiring field services) typically do not generate significant margins, it is not unusual for us to experience an increase or decrease in revenues without experiencing a corresponding increase or decrease in our gross margins and operating profit. SG&A expenses during fiscal 2005 increased by $98.4 million, or 21.1%, to $564.8 million, compared to $466.4 million during fiscal 2004. Contributing to the increase in SG&A expenses during fiscal 2005 was the inclusion of the Babtie Group for the entire year. The Babtie Group contributed approximately $89.6 million of SG&A expenses during fiscal 2005, versus approximately $13.5 million of SG&A expenses last year. The balance of the increase was due primarily to the effects of foreign currency translation, and higher spending in support of our professional technical services activities. Operating profit fiscal 2005 increased by $43.2 million, or 21.8%, to $241.5 million, compared to $198.3 million during fiscal 2004. The increase in operating profit during fiscal 2005 as compared to last year was due to the overall increase in business activity. As a percentage of revenues, operating profit was 4.3% for fiscal 2005 and 2004. In spite of the significant increase in pass-through costs, the Company was able to maintain its level of operating profit by limiting the increase in SG&A expenses. Interest income increased by $1.3 million to $4.3 million during fiscal 2005, compared to $3.1 million of interest income during fiscal 2004. The increase in interest income was due primarily to higher cash balances on deposit during fiscal 2005 as compared to last year. Interest expense increased by $2.9 million to $6.5 million during fiscal 2005, compared to $3.6 million of interest expense during fiscal 2004. The increase in interest expense reflects the effects of the debt incurred in connection with the acquisition of the Babtie Group being outstanding for all of fiscal 2005, versus only a portion of fiscal 2004. We recorded income tax expense of $85.0 million during fiscal 2005, compared to $69.4 million during fiscal 2004. Our overall effective tax rate was 36.0% for fiscal 2005 and 35.0% for fiscal 2004. In the normal course of our business, we may engage in numerous transactions for which the ultimate tax outcome (including the period in which the transaction will ultimately be included in income or deducted as an expense) is uncertain. Additionally, we file income, franchise, gross receipts and similar tax returns in many jurisdictions. Our tax returns are subject to audit and investigation by the Internal Revenue Service, most states in the United States, and by various government agencies representing many jurisdictions outside the United States. We continually monitor the appropriateness of the rate, and we adjust our income tax expense in the period it is probable that actual results will differ from our Page 27 Table of Contents estimates. The increase in our overall tax rate during fiscal 2005 as compared to last year was due primarily the effects of the non-deductibility for tax purposes of the amortization of certain intangible assets we acquired in connection with the Babtie Group, combined with a shift in earnings among our non-U.S. operations. Fiscal 2004 Compared to Fiscal 2003 We recorded net earnings of $129.0 million, or $2.25 per diluted share, for fiscal year ended September 30, 2004, compared to net earnings of $128.0 million, or $2.27 per diluted share for fiscal 2003. Total revenues for fiscal 2004 remained relatively unchanged from fiscal 2003 at $4.6 billion. The amount of pass-through costs included in revenues in fiscal 2004 declined by approximately $223.6 million, or 16.1%, as compared to fiscal 2003. Off-setting this decline in field services activity in part was approximately $54.0 million of revenues of the Babtie Group, which we acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004. As a percentage of revenues, direct costs of contracts were 85.5% for fiscal 2004 compared to 86.4% for fiscal 2003. In general, the percentage improvement in this performance indicator from fiscal 2003 to 2004 was due primarily to a higher portion of our total revenues being derived from technical professional services versus field services. SG&A expenses for fiscal 2004 increased by $37.6 million, or 8.8%, to $466.4 million, compared to $428.8 million for fiscal 2003. Included in SG&A expenses for fiscal 2004 is approximately $13.5 million of SG&A expenses from the Babtie Group. The balance of the increase was due primarily to the effects of foreign currency translation, and higher spending in support of our professional technical services activities. Operating profit for fiscal 2004 totaled $198.3 million; relatively unchanged from the fiscal 2003 amount of $197.1 million. As a percentage of revenues, operating profit was 4.3% for both fiscal 2004 and 2003. Interest income increased by $1.7 million to $3.1 million for fiscal 2004, compared to $1.4 million for fiscal 2003. The increase in interest income was due primarily to higher cash balances on deposit during fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003. Interest expense increased by $0.3 million, or 9.6%, to $3.6 million for fiscal 2004, compared to $3.3 million for fiscal 2003. The increase in interest expense was due primarily to slightly higher borrowings under our long-term, revolving credit facility. Contractual Obligations The following table sets forth certain information about our contractual obligations as of September 30, 2005 (in thousands): Payments Due by Fiscal Period Total Less than 1 Year 1 - 3 Years 3 - 5 Years More than 5 Years Bank debt $ 95,983 $ 6,351 $ $ 89,632 $ Operating leases 342,414 78,753 123,824 80,859 58,978 Obligations under defined benefit pension plans (a) 246,420 36,141 76,677 82,934 50,668 Obligations under nonqualified deferred compensation plans (b) 59,009 4,519 9,588 10,370 34,532 Purchase obligations (c) 558,168 558,168 Total $ 1,301,994 $ 683,932 $ 210,089 $ 263,795 $ 144,178 Page 28 Table of Contents (a) Assumes that future contributions will be consistent with amounts projected to be contributed in fiscal 2006, allowing for certain growth based on rates of inflation and salary increases, but limited to the amount recorded as of September 30, 2005. Actual contributions will depend on a variety of factors, including amounts required by local laws and regulations, and other funding requirements. (b) Assumes that future payments will be consistent with amounts paid in fiscal 2005, allowing for certain growth. Due to the nonqualified nature of the plans, and the fact that benefits are based in part on years of service, the payments included in the schedule was limited to the amount recorded as of September 30, 2005. (c) Represents those liabilities estimated to be under firm contractual commitments as of September 30, 2005. Backlog The following table summarizes our total backlog at September 30, 2005, 2004, and 2003 (in millions): 2005 2004 2003 Technical professional services $ 4,329.0 $ 3,989.0 $ 3,383.2 Total 8,643.0 7,452.5 7,041.0 Because the entire value of contracts is added to backlog as soon as the contracts are awarded to us (rather than adding the contracts to backlog gradually over time), and many of our contracts require us to provide services that span over a number of fiscal quarters (and sometimes over fiscal years), we evaluate our backlog on a year-over-year basis, rather than on a sequential, quarter-over-quarter basis. Our backlog at September 30, 2005 increased by $1.2 billion, or 16.0%, to $8.6 billion from $7.5 billion at September 30, 2004. The increase in backlog during fiscal 2005 was attributable primarily to new awards from clients operating within the oil & gas, federal programs, and the civil and infrastructure industry groups and markets. In accordance with industry practice, substantially all of our contracts are subject to cancellation or termination at the discretion of the client. However, we have not experienced cancellations that have had a material effect on the reported backlog amounts. In a situation where a client terminates a contract, we would ordinarily be entitled to receive payment for work performed up to the date of termination and, in certain instances, we may be entitled to allowable termination and cancellation costs. While management uses all information available to it to determine backlog, our backlog at any given time is subject to changes in the scope of services to be provided as well as increases or decreases in costs relating to the contracts included therein. Total backlog at September 30, 2005 included approximately $2.2 billion, or 25.3% of total backlog, relating to work to be performed either directly or indirectly for the U.S. federal government and its agencies. This compares to approximately $2.3 billion, or 30.2% of total backlog, and $1.9 billion, or 27.7% of total backlog, of U.S. federal backlog at September 30, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Most of our federal contracts require that services be provided beyond one year. In general, these contracts must be funded annually (i.e., the amounts to be spent under the contract must be appropriated by the U.S. Congress to the procuring agency, and then the agency must allot these sums to the specific contracts). We estimate that approximately $4.3 billion, or 50.2% of total backlog at September 30, 2005 will be realized as revenues within the next fiscal year. Page 29 Table of Contents Effects of Inflation During fiscal 2005, 2004, and 2003, approximately 85%, 83%, and 82%, respectively, of our consolidated revenues were earned under cost-reimbursable type contracts. Because a significant portion of our revenues is earned from such contracts, the effects of inflation on our financial condition and results of operations continue to be generally low. However, as we expand our business into markets and geographic areas where fixed-price and lump-sum work is more prevalent, inflation may have a larger impact on our results of operations in the future. To the extent permitted by competition, we intend to continue to emphasize contracts which are either cost-reimbursable or negotiated fixed-price. For contracts with fixed-price and lump-sum terms, we closely monitor the actual costs on the project as compared to the original estimates. On these projects, we also attempt to secure fixed-price commitments from key subcontractors and vendors. However, due to the competitive nature of our business, combined with the fluctuating demands and prices associated with personnel, equipment and materials we traditionally need in order to perform on our contracts, there can be no guarantee that inflation will not affect our results of operations in the future. Liquidity and Capital Resources We finance our operations primarily through cash provided by operations. At September 30, 2005, our principal source of liquidity consisted of $239.8 million of cash and cash equivalents, and $200.4 million of available capacity under our $290.0 million unsecured, revolving credit facility discussed below. During fiscal 2005, our cash and cash equivalents increased by $139.8 million, to $239.8 million. This compares to a net decrease in cash and cash equivalents of $26.1 million during fiscal 2004, and to a net increase of $77.7 million during fiscal 2003. During fiscal 2005, we experienced net cash inflows from operating activities and financing activities of $161.3 million and $49.7 million, respectively. These inflows were offset in part by net cash outflows from investing activities and the effect of exchange rate changes of $68.3 million and $2.9 million, respectively. Our operations provided net cash of $161.3 million during fiscal 2005. This compares to net cash inflows of $87.8 million and $147.5 million during fiscal 2004 and 2003, respectively. The $73.6 million increase in cash provided by operations in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 was due primarily to a $22.0 million increase in net earnings and a $20.2 million increase relating to the timing of cash receipts and payments within our working capital accounts. Also contributing to the increase in cash flows from operations were a $12.2 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense (a non-cash expense); an $11.2 million decrease in gains attributable to the sale of assets (a common reclassification within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows so that the cash flows from the sales of assets may be shown in the investing section of the statements); and the effects of a $6.9 million change in the deferred income tax accounts. We used $68.3 million of cash and cash equivalents during fiscal 2005 for investing activities. This compares to net cash outflows of $203.1 million and $17.7 million during fiscal 2004 and 2003, respectively. In comparing our investing activities during fiscal 2005 to last year, the largest single variance related to cash used for acquisitions of businesses; we used $163.8 million of cash and cash equivalents for acquisitions last year, and zero during fiscal 2005. This reduction in cash outflows was partially off-set by a $17.8 million increase in miscellaneous, non-current assets (relating primarily to increases in prepaid pension assets), and a $6.8 million increase in additions to property, plant and equipment. Our financing activities resulted in net cash inflows of $49.7 million during fiscal 2005. This compares to net cash inflows of $91.4 million during fiscal 2004, and net cash outflows of $55.0 million during fiscal 2003. The $41.7 million decrease in cash flows from financing activities during fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 was due primarily to a $46.4 million decrease in borrowings, net of Page 30 Table of Contents repayments, under our long-term credit facilities, combined with a net $8.6 million increase during fiscal 2005 in short-term borrowings. The higher borrowing activity during fiscal 2004 was due primarily to the acquisition of the Babtie Group. Also contributing to the improvement in cash flows from financing activities during fiscal 2005 as compared to last year was a $9.4 million increase in proceeds from issuances of common stock through our stock option and stock purchase plans. We believe we have adequate liquidity and capital resources to fund our operations and service our debt for the foreseeable future. We had $239.8 million in cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2005, compared to $100.1 million at September 30, 2004. Our consolidated working capital position at September 30, 2005 was $552.3 million, compared to $397.6 million at September 30, 2004. We have a long-term, unsecured revolving credit facility providing up to $290.0 million of debt capacity, under which only $89.6 million was utilized at September 30, 2005 in the form of direct borrowings. We believe that the capacity, terms and conditions of our long-term revolving credit facility is adequate for our working capital and general business requirements. We also had, at September 30, 2005, $36.0 million of borrowing capacity available to us through committed, short-term credit facilities. Under our stock repurchase program, we are authorized by our Board of Directors to buy-back up to 6.0 million shares of the common stock of the Company in the open market. Repurchases of common stock are financed from existing credit facilities and available cash balances. From inception of the program through September 30, 2005, we have repurchased a total of 3,732,400 shares of common stock in the open market at a total cost of $59.0 million. No shares of common stock were repurchased during fiscal 2005 and 2004. Substantially all shares of common stock held in treasury were eventually reissued for our employee stock purchase and incentive stock plans. New Accounting Pronouncements On December 16, 2004, SFAS No. 123R Accounting for Share-Based Payment was issued. SFAS 123R is a revision of SFAS 123 and supersedes APB 25. SFAS 123R requires companies to record compensation expense for stock-based awards using a fair value method and is effective for annual periods beginning after June 15, 2005 (effective in fiscal 2006 for the Company). Compensation expense will be recorded over the requisite service period, which is typically the vesting period of the award. We currently plan to adopt SFAS 123R effective October 1, 2005, using the modified retrospective application method, and have begun the process of collecting and analyzing the information required. We estimate that the adoption of SFAS 123R will have an after tax impact of approximately $8.5 million in fiscal 2006. Factors That May Affect Forward-Looking Statements As mentioned above, there are a variety of factors that could cause business conditions and results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements contained in this MD&A, including, in no particular order, the following: Increase in competition by United States and international competitors; Changes in global business, economic, political, and social condition; Availability of qualified engineers, architects, designers and other home-office staff needed to execute contracts; Availability of qualified craft personnel in the geographic areas where our construction and maintenance sites are located; Page 31 Table of Contents The timing of new awards and the funding of such awards; Delays, cancellations, or suspensions of, or changes in the scope to, existing contracts; Our ability to meet performance or schedule guarantees; Cost overruns on fixed-price, guaranteed maximum price, or unit priced contracts; The possible effects of inflation on margins available on fixed-price contracts; The effects that fluctuating exchange rates may have on the U.S. dollar results of our international operations; The outcome of pending and future claims, litigation, and any government audits, investigations or proceedings; The cyclical nature of the individual markets in which our clients operate; Delays or defaults by clients in making payments due under contracts; The successful integration of recent and future acquisitions; The effect on future earnings due to the implementation of SFAS 123R; and The effects (through the force majeure clauses of our contracts, or otherwise) of major disasters globally. The preceding list is not all-inclusive, and we undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
