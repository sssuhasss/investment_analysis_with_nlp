MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A ) is provided as a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the accompanying notes ( Notes ) included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based on management current expectations, estimates and projections about our business and operations. Our actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated and expressed in such forward-looking statements. This overview provides our perspective on the individual sections of MD&A. MD&A includes the following sections: Our Business a general description of our business; the value drivers of our business; and opportunities and risks facing our Company; Results of Operations an analysis of our consolidated results of operations for the three years presented in our financial statements; Liquidity and Capital Resources an analysis of our cash flows, sources and uses of cash and contractual obligations; Accounting Policies and Pronouncements a discussion of accounting policies that require critical judgments and estimates including newly issued accounting pronouncements; Sales details of our sales measured on a quarterly basis in both dollars and cases; Inflation information about the impact that inflation may or may not have on our results; Forward Looking Statements cautionary information about forward looking statements and a description of certain risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the company historical results or our current expectations or projections; and Market Risks Information about market risks and risk management. (See Forward Looking Statements and Part II, Item 7A Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures About Market Risks ). Our Business Overview We develop, market, sell and distribute alternative beverage category natural sodas, fruit juices and juice drinks, energy drinks and energy sports drinks, fruit juice smoothies and functional drinks, non-carbonated ready-to-drink iced teas, children multi-vitamin juice drinks, Junior Juice juices, Junior Juice Water and flavored sparkling beverages under the Hansen brand name. We also develop, market, sell and distribute energy drinks under the following brand names: Monster Energy ; Monster Hitman Energy Shooter ; Lost Energy and Joker Mad Energy brand names as well as Rumba , Samba and Tango brand energy juices. We also market, sell and distribute the Java Monster line of non-carbonated dairy based coffee drinks. Additionally, we market, sell and distribute natural sodas, premium natural sodas with supplements, organic natural sodas, seltzer waters, sports drinks and energy drinks under the Blue Sky brand name. In July 2008, we began to market, sell and distribute enhanced water beverages under the Vidration brand name. We have two reportable segments, namely DSD, whose principal products comprise energy drinks, and Warehouse, whose principal products comprise juice based and soda beverages. The DSD segment develops, markets and sells products primarily through an exclusive distributor network, whereas the Warehouse segment develops, markets and sells products primarily direct to retailers. Our Monster Energy brand energy drinks include Monster Energy drinks (introduced in April 2002), lo-carb Monster Energy drinks (introduced in August 2003), Monster Energy Assault energy drinks (introduced in September 2004), Monster Energy Khaos TM energy drinks (introduced in August 2005), Monster Energy M-80 TM energy drinks (introduced in March 2007, named RIPPER in certain countries), Monster Energy Heavy Metal energy drinks (introduced in November 2007) and Monster Energy MIXXD energy drinks (introduced in December 2007). 34 A substantial portion of our gross sales are derived from our Monster Energy brand energy drinks. Any decrease in sales of our Monster Energy brand energy drinks could significantly adversely affect our future revenues and net income. Our DSD segment represented 90.7%, 89.5% and 84.9% of our net sales for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Competitive pressure in the energy drink category could adversely affect our operating results. (See Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors ). Our sales and marketing strategy for all our beverages is to focus our efforts on developing brand awareness and trial through sampling both in stores and at events. We use our branded vehicles and other promotional vehicles at events where we sample our products to consumers. We utilize push-pull methods to achieve maximum shelf and display space exposure in sales outlets and maximum demand from consumers for our products, including advertising, in-store promotions and in-store placement of point-of-sale materials and racks, prize promotions, price promotions, competitions, endorsements from selected public and extreme sports figures, coupons, sampling and sponsorship of selected causes such as cancer research. Our extreme sports team endorsements include teams such as the Pro Circuit Kawasaki Motocross and Supercross teams, Kawasaki Factory Motocross and Supercross teams, Robby Gordon Racing Team, Ken Block Rally Racing Team and the Tech 3 Moto GP Team (new for 2009). Our individual athlete and/or personality endorsements include extreme sports figures and athletes such as NASCAR Camping World Truck Series racer Ricky Carmichael, Moto GP motorcycle racer Valentino Rossi (new for 2009), television personalities such as Rob Dyrdek as well as many athletes that compete in other sports related activities, particularly, the Winter and Summer X-Games, supercross, motocross, freestyle motocross, surfing, skateboarding, wakeboarding, skiing, snowboarding, BMX, mountain biking, snowmobile freestyle, snowmobile racing, etc. Our event endorsements include a wide range of events such as the Monster Energy Supercross Series, the AMA Pro Motocross Championship Series and the Vans Warped Tour. In-store posters, outdoor posters, print, radio and television advertising, together with price promotions and coupons, may also be used to promote our brands. We believe that one of the keys to success in the beverage industry is differentiation, such as making Hansen products visually distinctive from other beverages on the shelves of retailers. We review our products and packaging on an ongoing basis and, where practical, endeavor to make them different, better and unique. The labels and graphics for many of our products are redesigned from time to time to maximize their visibility and identification, wherever they may be placed in stores, and we will continue to reevaluate the same from time to time. During 2008, we continued to expand our existing product lines and further develop our markets. In particular, we continued to focus on developing and marketing beverages that fall within the category generally described as the alternative beverage category, with particular emphasis on energy type drinks. During the second quarter of 2006, we entered into the Off-Premise Agreements with AB. Under the Off-Premise Agreements, select AB Distributors distribute and sell, in markets designated by HBC, HBC Monster Energy and Lost Energy TM brands non-alcoholic energy drinks and Rumba , Samba and Tango brand energy juice, as well as additional products that may be agreed between the parties. During the fourth quarter of 2008, we entered into the Monster Energy Distribution Coordination Agreement (the TCCC North American Coordination Agreement ) with The Coca-Cola Company ( TCCC ). Pursuant to the TCCC North American Coordination Agreement, we have designated, and in 35 the future may designate, territories in which bottlers from TCCC network of partially owned and independent bottlers, including Coca-Cola Enterprises, Inc. ( CCE ), Coca-Cola Bottling Company ( CCBC ), CCBCC Operations, LLC ( Consolidated ), United Bottling Contracts Company, LLC ( United ), and other TCCC independent bottlers (collectively, the TCCC North American Bottlers ) will distribute and sell primarily our Monster Energy beverages (the Products ) in the United States and Canada. During the fourth quarter of 2008, we entered into the Monster Energy Distribution Agreement with CCE pursuant to which CCE was appointed to distribute, directly and through certain sub-distributors, the Products in portions of twenty-four U.S. states (the U.S. Territories ). We may designate additional territories within reasonable proximity to the U.S. Territories and CCE will use reasonable good faith efforts to add the additional territories. During the fourth quarter of 2008, we entered into the Monster Energy Canadian Distribution Agreement with CCBC, pursuant to which CCBC has been appointed to distribute, directly and through certain sub-distributors, the Products in Canada, with performance commencing on January 1, 2009. In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2008, we entered into distribution agreements with Consolidated, United and other TCCC North American Bottlers for the distribution of Products in various territories within the United States. During the fourth quarter of 2008, we entered into the Monster Energy International Coordination Agreement (the TCCC International Coordination Agreement ) with TCCC. Pursuant to the TCCC International Coordination Agreement, we have designated, and in the future may designate, countries in which we wish to appoint TCCC distributors to distribute and sell the Products. During the fourth quarter of 2008, we entered into the Monster Energy International Distribution Agreement and the Monster Energy Belgium Distribution Agreement with CCE pursuant to which CCE has been appointed to distribute directly and through certain sub-distributors the Products in Great Britain, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Monaco. Pursuant to the new and/or amended distribution agreements entered into with certain distributors as discussed above, net amounts of $113.0 million and $21.0 million from such distributors, relating to the cost of terminating certain of our prior distributors, were recorded for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Such amounts have been accounted for as deferred revenue and will be recognized as revenue ratably over the anticipated life of the respective distribution agreements, generally 20 years. Distributor receivables related to these new and/or amended distribution agreements totaled $90.7 million and $5.4 million as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Revenue recognized was $14.3 million, $1.9 million and $0.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Included in the $14.3 million of revenue recognized for the year ended December 31, 2008, is $11.6 million related to the acceleration of deferred revenue balances associated with certain of our prior distributors who were terminated in the fourth quarter of 2008. We incurred termination costs to certain of our prior distributors amounting to $118.1 million, $15.3 million and $12.7 million in aggregate for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Such termination costs have been expensed in full and are included in operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006. Accrued distributor terminations in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2008 and 2007 (representing termination costs not paid to our prior distributors prior to the end of the fiscal year) were $102.3 million and $4.3 million, respectively. In addition, inventory returned to us by certain of our prior terminated distributors resulted in a reduction of gross sales of approximately $9.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. As discussed under Review of Historic Stock Option Granting Practices in Item 7, Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations , included in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006, and Item 2 Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations , included in our Form 10-Q for the quarter 36 ended March 31, 2007, a special committee of our Board of Directors concluded its review of our stock option grants and granting practices. In connection with this review, and with respect to related litigation and other related matters, we incurred professional service fees, net of insurance proceeds, of ($0.2) million, $9.8 million and $3.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The following table summarizes the selected items discussed above for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006: Balance Sheet Items (in thousands): 2008 2007 2006 Included in Deferred Revenue: Contributions from, net of reimbursements to certain distributors $ 112,963 $ 21,029 $ 20,851 Income Statement Items (in thousands): 2008 2007 2006 Included in Net Sales: Recognition of deferred revenue $ 14,331 $ 1,916 $ 411 Included in Operating Expenses: Termination costs to prior distributors 1 $ 118,134 $ 15,266 $ 12,728 Professional service fees (net of insurance proceeds) associated with the review of stock option grants and granting practices, related litigation and other related matters $ (202 ) $ 9,760 2 $ 3,753 1 includes terminations in Canada and Mexico 2 net of $2.5 million insurance reimbursements We again achieved record gross sales of $1,182.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase in gross sales in 2008 was primarily attributable to increased sales of certain of our existing products, particularly our Monster Energy brand energy drinks and to increased sales by volume of our Java Monster TM line of non-carbonated dairy based coffee drinks. Gross sales for the year ended December 31, 2008 were impacted by a price increase announced during the fourth quarter of 2007 for all of our Monster Energy brand energy drinks in 16-ounce cans and our Java Monster line of non-carbonated dairy based coffee drinks, effective January 1, 2008. We estimate that gross sales for the year ended December 31, 2008 were reduced by approximately 2% as a result of purchases made by our customers in advance of such price increases. We did not limit the amount of purchases our customers could execute at our existing 2007 fourth quarter prices. Our percentage increase in gross sales was 15.3%, 47.3% and 67.6% for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. We believe our growth rate decline was attributable to the decline of the overall growth rates in the markets in which we operate, and more recently, to general economic conditions. Consumer spending habits, including spending for the merchandise that we sell, are affected by, among other things, prevailing economic conditions, inflation, levels of employment, salaries and wage rates, prevailing interest rates, housing costs, energy and gas costs, income tax rates and policies, consumer confidence and consumer perception of economic conditions. In addition, consumer purchasing patterns may be influenced by consumers disposable income, credit availability and debt levels. A continued or incremental slowdown in the U.S. economy, an uncertain economic 37 outlook or an expanded credit crisis could continue to adversely affect consumer spending habits resulting in lower net sales and profits than expected on a quarterly or annual basis. During 2008, there was significant deterioration in the global financial markets and economic environment, which we believe negatively impacted consumer spending at many retailers for our products. In response to this, we have taken steps to increase opportunities to profitably drive sales and to operate our business more efficiently. If these adverse economic trends worsen, or if our efforts to counteract the impacts of these trends are not sufficiently effective, there could be a negative impact on our financial performance and position in future fiscal periods. For further discussion of the risks to us regarding general economic conditions (See Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors ). Gross sales shipped outside of California represented 77%, 73% and 69% of our gross sales, for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Gross sales to customers outside the United States amounted to $96.3 million, $55.7 million and $24.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Such sales were approximately 8.2%, 5.4% and 3.5% of gross sales for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The reclassification of certain military customers from gross sales to customers within the United States to gross sales to customers outside the United States, resulted in an increase in gross sales outside the United States of $14.8 million and $5.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, over amounts previously reported. Our customers are primarily retail grocery and specialty chains, wholesalers, club stores, drug chains, mass merchandisers, convenience chains, full service beverage distributors, health food distributors and food service customers. Gross sales to our various customer types for 2008, 2007 and 2006 are reflected below. The allocations below reflect changes made by the Company to the categories historically reported. 2008 2007 2006 Retail grocery, specialty chains and wholesalers 8% 8% 12% Club stores, drug chains & mass merchandisers 14% 14% 14% Full service distributors 74% 73% 69% Health food distributors 1% 2% 2% Other 3% 3% 3% Our customers include CCE, CCBC, Consolidated, United and other TCCC North American Bottlers, Wal-Mart, Inc. (including Sam Club), AB Distributors, Kalil Bottling Group, Trader Joe s, John Lenore & Company, Pepsi Canada (terminated by us effective December 31, 2008), Swire Coca-Cola, Costco, The Kroger Co., Safeway Inc. and Albertsons. A decision by any large customer to decrease amounts purchased from the Company or to cease carrying our products could have a material negative effect on our financial condition and consolidated results of operations. Dr. Pepper Snapple Group, Inc., a former customer of the DSD division, accounted for approximately 13%, 16% and 19% of our net sales for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Our distribution agreement with the Dr. Pepper Snapple Group, Inc. was terminated by us effective November 9, 2008. The related terminated distributor territories are now serviced by a combination of TCCC North American Bottlers and AB Distributors. Wal-Mart, Inc. (including Sam Club), a customer of both the DSD and Warehouse divisions, accounted for approximately 11%, 12% and 12% of our net sales for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. We continue to incur expenditures in connection with the development and introduction of new products and flavors. 38 Value Drivers of our Business We believe that the key value drivers of our business include the following: Profitable Growth We believe functional , better for you brands properly supported by marketing and innovation, targeted to a broad consumer base, drive profitable growth. We continue to broaden our family of brands. In particular, we are expanding our specialty beverages and energy drinks to provide more alternatives to consumers. We are focused on maintaining profit margins. We believe that tailored branding, packaging, pricing and channeling strategies help achieve profitable growth. We are implementing these strategies with a view to accelerating profitable growth. Cost Management The principal focus of cost management will continue to be on supplies and cost reduction. One key area of focus is to decrease raw material costs, co-packing fees and general and administrative costs as a percentage of net operating revenues. Another key area of focus is the reduction of inventory days on hand. Efficient Capital Structure Our capital structure is intended to optimize our cost of capital. We believe our strong capital position, our ability to raise funds if necessary at low effective cost and low overall costs of borrowing provide a competitive advantage. We believe that, subject to increases in the costs of certain raw materials being contained, these value drivers, when properly implemented, will result in: (1) maintaining our gross profit margin; (2) providing additional leverage over time through reduced expenses as a percentage of net operating revenues; and (3) optimizing our cost of capital. The ultimate measure of success is and will be reflected in our current and future results of operations. Gross and net sales, gross profits, operating income, and net income and net income per share represent key measurements of the above value drivers. These measurements will continue to be a key management focus in 2009 and beyond. ( See Part II, Item 7 Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2008 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2007 ). As of December 31, 2008, the Company had working capital of $374.0 million compared to $187.3 million as of December 31, 2007. The overall increase in working capital was primarily attributable to the transfer of our investments from long-term instruments to short-term instruments (See Part II, Item 8, Note 3 Investments in our consolidated financial statements). For the year ended December 31, 2008, our net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $199.5 million as compared to $135.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. Principal uses of cash flows are repurchases of our common stock, purchases of inventory, increases in accounts receivable and other assets, acquisition of property and equipment and acquisition of trademarks. Payment of accrued distributor terminations, purchases of our common stock, accounts payable and income taxes payable are expected to be and remain our principal recurring use of cash and working capital funds. (See Part II, Item 7 Liquidity and Capital Resources ). Opportunities, Challenges and Risks Looking forward, our management has identified certain challenges and risks that demand the attention of the beverage industry and our Company. Uncertainty and volatility in domestic and international economic markets could negatively affect both the stability of our industry and our Company. Decreased consumer discretionary spending represents a challenge to the successful marketing and purchase of our products. Increases in consumer and regulatory awareness of the health problems arising from obesity and inactive lifestyles continues to represent a challenge. We recognize 39 that obesity is a complex and serious public health problem. Our commitment to consumers begins with our broad product line and a wide selection of diet, light and lo-carb beverages, juices and juice drinks, sports drinks and waters and energy drinks. We continuously strive to meet changing consumer needs through beverage innovation, choice and variety. Our historical success is attributable, in part, to our introduction of different and innovative beverages. Our future success will depend, in part, upon our continued ability to develop and introduce different and innovative beverages, although there can be no assurance of our ability to do so. In order to retain and expand our market share, we must continue to develop and introduce different and innovative beverages and be competitive in the areas of quality, health, method of distribution, brand image and intellectual property protection. The beverage industry is subject to changing consumer preferences and shifts in consumer preferences that may adversely affect us if we misjudge such preferences. In addition, other key challenges and risks that could impact our Company future financial results include, but are not limited to: the impact of the slowing economy in the United States and other countries in which we operate; maintenance of our brand image and product quality; profitable expansion and growth of our family of brands in the competitive market place (See Part I, Item 1 Business - Competition and Sales and Marketing ); restrictions on imports and sources of supply; duties or tariffs; changes in government regulations; protection of our existing intellectual property portfolio of trademarks and the continuous pursuit to develop and protect new and innovative trademarks for our expanding product lines; limitations on available quantities of certain package containers such as the 24-ounce cap can, the 32-ounce can, and copacking availability; the imposition of additional restrictions. (See Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors ) for additional information about risks and uncertainties facing our Company. We believe that the following opportunities exist for us: growth potential for the alternative beverage category including energy drinks, sparkling beverages, carbonated soft drinks and teas, juices and juice drinks and enhanced waters; new product introductions intended to contribute to higher profitability; premium packages intended to generate strong revenue growth; significant package, pricing and channel opportunities to maximize profitable growth; proper positioning to capture industry growth; and broadening distribution/expansion opportunities in both domestic and international markets. 40 Results of Operations Percentage Change 2008 2007 2006 08 vs. 07 07 vs. 06 Gross sales, net of discounts & returns* $ 1,182,876 $ 1,025,795 $ 696,322 15.3% 47.3% Less: Promotional and other allowances** 149,096 121,330 90,548 22.9% 34.0% Net sales 1,033,780 904,465 605,774 14.3% 49.3% Cost of sales 494,986 436,452 289,180 13.4% 50.9% Gross profit 538,794 468,013 316,594 15.1% 47.8% Gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales 52.1% 51.7% 52.3% Operating expenses , 375,203 237,027 158,015 58.3% 50.0% Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales 36.3% 26.2% 26.1% Operating income , , 163,591 230,986 158,579 (29.2%) 45.7% Operating income as a percentage of net sales 15.8% 25.5% 26.2% Interest and other income, net 9,886 8,770 3,660 12.7% 139.6% Income before provision for income taxes 173,477 239,756 162,239 (27.6%) 47.8% Provision for income taxes 65,445 90,350 64,290 (27.6%) 40.5% Net income $ 108,032 $ 149,406 $ 97,949 (27.7%) 52.5% Net income as a percentage of net sales 10.5% 16.5% 16.2% Net income per common share: Basic $1.17 $1.64 $1.09 (28.7%) 50.5% Diluted $1.11 $1.51 $0.99 (26.7%) 52.1% Case sales (in thousands) (in 192-ounce case equivalents) 102,659 98,453 72,740 4.3% 35.3% Includes $14.3 million, $1.9 million and $0.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, related to the recognition of deferred revenue attributable to new and/or amended distribution agreements entered into with certain distributors. Includes $118.1 million, $15.3 million and $12.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, related to expenditures attributable to the costs associated with terminating existing distributors. Includes ($0.2) million, $9.8 million and $3.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, related to professional service fees, net of insurance proceeds in connection with our special investigation of stock option grants and granting practices, related litigation and other related matters. * Gross sales, although used internally by management as an indicator of operating performance, should not be considered as an alternative to net sales, which is determined in accordance with GAAP, and should not be used alone as an indicator of operating performance in place of net sales. Additionally, gross sales may not be 41 comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies as gross sales has been defined by our internal reporting requirements. However, gross sales is used by management to monitor operating performance including sales performance of particular products, salesperson performance, product growth or declines and our overall performance. The use of gross sales allows evaluation of sales performance before the effect of any promotional items, which can mask certain performance issues. Management believes the presentation of gross sales allows a more comprehensive presentation of our operating performance. Gross sales may not be realized in the form of cash receipts as promotional payments and allowances may be deducted from payments received from customers. (See Part II, Item 6 Selected Financial Data ). ** Although the expenditures described in this line item are determined in accordance with GAAP and meet GAAP requirements, the disclosure thereof does not conform with GAAP presentation requirements. Additionally, the presentation of promotional and other allowances may not be comparable to similar items presented by other companies. The presentation of promotional and other allowances facilitates an evaluation of the impact thereof on the determination of net sales and illustrates the spending levels incurred to secure such sales. Promotional and other allowances constitute a material portion of our marketing activities. Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2008 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2007 Gross Sales.* Gross sales were $1,182.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, an increase of approximately $157.1 million, or 15.3% higher than gross sales of $1,025.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in gross sales was primarily attributable to increased sales by volume and increased sales price per case for certain of our Monster Energy brand energy drinks and our Java Monster line of non-carbonated dairy based coffee drinks (introduced in April 2007), as well as sales of certain new products such as Monster Hitman Energy Shooter (introduced in September 2008), Monster Energy MIXXD energy drinks (introduced in December 2007) and Monster Energy Heavy Metal energy drinks (introduced in November 2007). To a lesser extent, the increase in gross sales was attributable to increased sales by volume of apple juice, aseptic juices and sales of Vidration vitamin enhanced water (introduced in July 2008). In addition, the increase in gross sales was partially attributable to the recognition of $11.6 million of revenue related to the acceleration of the deferred revenue balance associated with certain of our prior distributors terminated in the fourth quarter of 2008. The increase in gross sales was partially offset by inventory returned to us by certain of our terminated distributors of approximately $9.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2008, decreased sales by volume of juice blends, Lost Energy brand energy drinks (introduced in January 2004), iced teas, Unbound Energy brand energy drinks (introduced in October 2006), Rumba brand energy juice (introduced in December 2004), Hansen energy drinks and smoothies in cans. Gross sales for the year ended December 31, 2008 were impacted by a price increase announced during the fourth quarter of 2007 for all of our Monster Energy brand energy drinks in 16-ounce cans and our Java Monster line of non-carbonated dairy based coffee drinks, effective January 1, 2008. We estimate that gross sales for the year ended December 31, 2008 were reduced by approximately 2% as a result of purchases made by our customers in advance of such price increases. Promotional and other allowances were $149.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, an increase of $27.8 million, or 22.9% higher than promotional and other allowances of $121.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. Promotional and other allowances as a percentage of gross sales increased to 12.6% from 11.8% for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. As a result, the percentage increase in gross sales for the year ended December 31, 2008 was higher than the percentage increase in net sales. *Gross sales see definition above. Net Sales. Net sales were $1,033.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, an increase of approximately $129.3 million, or 14.3% higher than net sales of $904.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in net sales was primarily attributable to increased sales by volume and increased sales price per case for certain of our Monster Energy brand energy drinks and our Java Monster line of non-carbonated dairy based coffee drinks, as well as sales of certain new products such as Monster Hitman Energy Shooter , Monster Energy MIXXD energy drinks and Monster Energy Heavy Metal energy drinks. To a lesser extent, the increase in 42 net sales was attributable to increased sales by volume of apple juice, aseptic juices and sales of Vidration vitamin enhanced water . In addition, the increase in net sales was partially attributable to the recognition of $11.6 million of revenue related to the acceleration of the deferred revenue balance associated with certain of our prior distributors terminated in the fourth quarter of 2008. The increase in net sales was partially offset by decreased sales by volume of Lost Energy brand energy drinks, juice blends, iced teas, Unbound Energy brand energy drinks, Hansen energy drinks and Rumba brand energy juice. Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2008 were impacted by a price increase announced during the fourth quarter of 2007 for our Monster Energy brand energy drinks in 16-ounce cans and our Java Monster line of non-carbonated dairy based coffee drinks, effective January 1, 2008. We estimate that net sales for the year ended December 31, 2008 were reduced by approximately 2% as a result of purchases made by our customers in advance of such price increases. Case sales, in 192-ounce case equivalents, were 102.7 million cases for the year ended December 31, 2008, an increase of 4.2 million cases or 4.3% higher than case sales of 98.5 million cases for the year ended December 31, 2007. The overall average net sales price per case increased to $10.07 for the year ended December 31, 2008 or 9.6% higher than the average net sales price per case of $9.19 for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in the average net sales prices per case was attributable to an increase in the proportion of case sales derived from higher priced products as well as the price increases for our Monster Energy brand energy drinks in 16-ounce cans effective January 1, 2008, price increases for our Monster Energy brand energy drinks in 24-ounce cans effective July 1, 2007 and price increases in our Java Monster line of non-carbonated dairy based coffee drinks, effective January 1, 2008. In addition, the increase in the average net sales price per case was partially attributable to the recognition of $11.6 million of revenue related to the acceleration of the deferred revenue balance associated with certain of our prior distributors who were terminated in the fourth quarter of 2008. Net sales for the DSD segment were $937.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, an increase of approximately $128.1 million, or 15.8% higher than net sales of $809.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in net sales was primarily attributable to increased sales by volume and increased sales price per case for certain of our Monster Energy brand energy drinks and our Java Monster line of non-carbonated dairy based coffee drinks, as well as sales of certain new products such as Monster Hitman Energy Shooter , Monster Energy MIXXD energy drinks, Monster Energy Heavy Metal energy drinks and Vidration vitamin enhanced water. In addition, the increase in net sales for the DSD segment was partially attributable to the recognition of $11.6 million of revenue related to the acceleration of the deferred revenue balance associated with certain of our prior distributors terminated in the fourth quarter of 2008. The increase in net sales was partially offset by decreased sales by volume of Lost Energy brand energy drinks, Unbound Energy brand energy drinks and Rumba brand energy juice. Net sales for the Warehouse segment were $95.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, an increase of approximately $1.2 million, or 1.3% higher than net sales of $94.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in net sales was primarily attributable to increased sales by volume of apple juice and aseptic juices. The increase in net sales was partially offset by decreased sales by volume of juice blends, iced teas and Hansen energy drinks. Changes in pricing within the Warehouse segment did not have a material impact on net sales for the year ended December 31, 2008. Gross Profit.** * Gross profit was $538.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, an increase of approximately $70.8 million, or 15.1% higher than the gross profit of $468.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased slightly to 52.1% for the year ended December 31, 2008 from 51.7% for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in net sales contributed to the increase in gross profit dollars. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was partially attributable to the recognition of $11.6 million of revenue related to the acceleration of the deferred revenue balance associated with certain of our prior distributors terminated 43 in the fourth quarter of 2008. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was also attributable to increased sales of DSD segment products which have higher gross profit margins than those in the Warehouse segment. Such increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was partially offset by an increase in the percentage of sales within the DSD segment of the Java Monster line of non-carbonated dairy based coffee drinks that have lower gross profit margins than our Monster Energy brand energy drinks and to an increase in the cost of certain raw materials including certain sweeteners, certain containers and packaging materials and certain juice concentrates, particularly apple juice concentrate as well as increased trade marketing agreement costs. ***Gross profit may not be comparable to that of other entities since some entities include all costs associated with their distribution process in cost of sales, whereas others exclude certain costs and instead include such costs within another line item such as operating expenses. Operating Expenses . Total operating expenses were $375.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, an increase of approximately $138.2 million, or 58.3% higher than total operating expenses of $237.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. Total operating expenses as a percentage of net sales was 36.3% for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to 26.2% for year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in operating expenses in dollars was primarily due to increased expenditures of $102.9 million relating to the costs associated with terminating existing distributors. To a lesser extent, the increase in operating expenses was attributable to increased out-bound freight and warehouse costs of $5.9 million primarily due to increased volume of shipments and increased freight rates, increased expenditures of $17.9 million for sponsorships and endorsements, increased expenditures of $4.1 million for sampling programs, increased expenditures of $3.1 million for commissions and royalties, increased expenditures of $1.5 million for in-store demos and increased payroll expenses of $7.3 million (including a $3.7 million increase in stock-based compensation). The increase in operating expenses in dollars was partially offset by decreased expenditures of $6.3 million for professional services costs, including legal and accounting fees and decreased expenditures of $3.8 million for merchandise displays. The individual increases above include costs of $10.7 million, or 1.0% of net sales, relating to the launch of the Monster Energy brand in Europe for the year ended December 31, 2008. Included in legal and accounting fees are professional service fees, net of insurance proceeds, of ($0.2) million and $9.8 million, for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, in connection with our special investigation of stock option grants and granting practices, related litigation and other related matters. Total operating expenses, exclusive of expenditures of: (i) $118.1 million and $15.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, attributable to the costs associated with terminating existing distributors; and (ii) exclusive of professional service fees, net of insurance proceeds, of ($0.2) million and $9.8 million, for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively in connection with our special investigation of stock option grants and granting practices, related litigation and other related matters, as a percentage of net sales, were 24.9% and 23.4% for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Contribution Margin. Contribution margin for the DSD segment was $216.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, a decrease of approximately $65.5 million, or 23.3% lower than contribution margin of $281.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The decrease in the contribution margin for the DSD segment was primarily due to increased expenditures of $102.9 million relating to the costs associated with terminating existing distributors. The decrease in the contribution margin for the DSD segment was offset by increased sales of our Java Monster line of non-carbonated dairy based coffee drinks, the increase in net sales of Monster Energy brand energy drinks as well as sales of certain new products such as the Monster Hitman Energy Shooter , Monster MIXXD energy drinks and Monster Heavy Metal energy drinks. Contribution margin for the Warehouse segment was $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, approximately $3.4 million lower than contribution margin of $3.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The decrease in the contribution margin for the Warehouse segment was primarily attributable to a reduction in gross margin as a result of increases in the costs of certain raw materials, particularly apple juice concentrate, as well as a change 44 from high fructose corn syrup to higher priced sugar, which additionally increased in price, for our soda lines. The decrease in the contribution margin for the Warehouse segment was partially offset by a reduction in sales rebates within our juice product line as a result of the termination of our exclusive contracts with the State of California Department of Health Services, Women, Infant and Children ( WIC ) Supplemental Nutrition Branch in April 2008. The WIC program continues on a non-exclusive basis in which we participate with our apple, grape, white grape and pineapple 64-ounce juice products. Juice blends are not eligible under the new program. Operating Income. Operating income was $163.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, a decrease of approximately $67.4 million, or 29.2% lower than operating income of $231.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. Operating income as a percentage of net sales decreased to 15.8% for the year ended December 31, 2008 from 25.5% for the year ended December 31, 2007. The decrease in operating income and operating income as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to an increase in operating expenses of $138.2 million. Operating income exclusive of: (i) recognition of deferred revenue of $14.3 million and $1.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, attributable to new and/or amended distribution agreements entered into with certain distributors; (ii) exclusive of expenditures of $118.1 million and $15.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, attributable to the costs associated with terminating existing distributors; and (iii) exclusive of professional service fees, net of insurance proceeds, in connection with our special investigation of stock option grants and granting practices, related litigation and other related matters, of ($0.2) million and $9.8 million, for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, as a percentage of net sales, was 25.8% and 28.1% for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Interest and Other Income, net . Net interest and other income was $9.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, an increase of $1.1 million from $8.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. This increase was primarily attributable to increased interest revenue earned on our cash balances and short- and long-term investments, which have increased significantly over the prior year. This increase was partially offset by foreign currency transaction losses. Provision for Income Taxes . Provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $65.4 million, as compared to $90.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The effective combined federal and state tax rate was 37.7% for both the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007. Net Income . Net income was $108.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, a decrease of $41.4 million or 27.7% lower than net income of $149.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The decrease in net income was primarily attributable to an increase in operating expenses of $138.2 million due to the items identified above. This was partially offset by an increase in gross profit of $70.8 million and a decrease in provision for income taxes of $24.9 million. Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2007 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2006 Gross Sales.* Gross sales were $1,025.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, an increase of approximately $329.5 million or 47.3% higher than gross sales of $696.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in gross sales was primarily attributable to increased sales by volume of our Monster Energy brand energy drinks, which include Monster Energy drinks (introduced in April 2002), lo-carb Monster Energy drinks (introduced in August 2003), Monster Energy Assault energy drinks (introduced in September 2004) and Monster Energy Khaos TM energy drinks (introduced in August 2005), as well as sales of certain new products such as the Java Monster line of non-carbonated dairy based coffee drinks (introduced in April 2007), Monster Energy M-80 TM energy drinks (introduced in March 2007), Monster Energy MIXXD energy drinks (introduced in December 2007) and Monster Energy Heavy Metal energy drinks (introduced in November 2007). 45 To a lesser extent, the increase in gross sales was attributable to increased sales by volume of apple juice and juice blends, aseptic juices, Unbound Energy energy drinks (introduced in October 2006) and Junior Juice aseptic juices. The increase in gross sales was partially offset by decreased sales by volume of Lost Energy drinks (introduced in January 2004), iced teas, Joker Mad Energy drinks (introduced in January 2005) and Hansen fruit juice smoothies. Changes in pricing did not have a material impact on the increase in gross sales for the year ended December 31, 2007. However, during the fourth quarter of 2007, we announced a price increase for our Monster Energy brand energy drinks and our Java Monster line of non-carbonated dairy based coffee drinks, effective January 1, 2008. We estimate that approximately 7% to 8% of our gross sales for the fourth quarter of 2007 were attributable to purchases made by our customers in advance of such price increases. Promotional and other allowances were $121.3 million for 2007, an increase of $30.8 million or 34.0% higher than promotional and other allowances of $90.5 million for 2006. Promotional and other allowances as a percentage of gross sales decreased to 11.8% in 2007 from 13.0% in 2006. As a result, the percentage increase in gross sales in 2007 was lower than the percentage increase in net sales. *Gross sales see definition above. Net Sales. Net sales were $904.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, an increase of approximately $298.7 million or 49.3% higher than net sales of $605.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in net sales was primarily attributable to increased sales by volume of our Monster Energy brand energy drinks, which include Monster Energy drinks, lo-carb Monster Energy drinks, Monster Energy Assault energy drinks and Monster Energy Khaos TM energy drinks, as well as sales of certain new products such as the Java Monster line of non-carbonated dairy based coffee drinks, Monster Energy M-80 TM energy drinks, Monster Energy MIXXD energy drinks and Monster Energy Heavy Metal energy drinks . To a lesser extent, the increase in net sales was attributable to increased sales by volume of apple juice and juice blends, aseptic juices, sodas and Junior Juice aseptic juices. The increase in net sales was partially offset by decreased sales by volume of Lost Energy drinks, iced teas, Joker Mad Energy drinks, smoothies in cans and Hansen energy drinks. Changes in pricing did not have a material impact on the increase in net sales for the year ended December 31, 2007. However, during the fourth quarter of 2007, we announced a price increase to our Monster Energy brand energy drinks and our Java Monster line of non-carbonated dairy based coffee drinks, effective January 1, 2008. We estimate that approximately 7% to 8% of our net sales for the fourth quarter of 2007 were attributable to purchases made by our customers in advance of such price increases. Case sales, in 192-ounce case equivalents, were 98.5 million cases for the year ended December 31, 2007, an increase of 25.7 million cases or 35.3% higher than case sales of 72.7 million cases for the year ended December 31, 2006. The overall average net sales price per case increased to $9.19 for 2007 or 10.3% higher than the average net sales price per case of $8.33 for 2006. The increase in the average net sales prices per case was attributable to an increase in the proportion of case sales derived from higher priced products. Net sales for the DSD segment were $809.8 million for year ended December 31, 2007, an increase of approximately $295.5 million or 57.5% higher than net sales of $514.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in net sales was primarily attributable to increased sales by volume of our Monster Energy brand energy drinks, which include Monster Energy drinks, lo-carb Monster Energy drinks, Monster Energy Assault energy drinks and Monster Energy Khaos TM energy drinks, as well as sales of certain new products such as the Java Monster line of non-carbonated dairy based coffee drinks and Monster Energy M-80 TM energy drinks. The increase in net sales was partially offset by decreased sales by volume of Lost Energy drinks and Joker Mad Energy drinks. Changes in pricing within the DSD segment did not have a material impact on the increase in net sales for the year ended December 31, 2007. However, during the fourth quarter of 2007, we announced a price increase to our Monster Energy brand energy drinks and our Java Monster line of non-carbonated dairy based coffee drinks, effective January 1, 2008. We estimate that approximately 7% to 46 8% of our net sales for the fourth quarter of 2007 were attributable to purchases made by our customers in advance of such price increases. Net sales for the Warehouse segment were $94.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, an increase of approximately $3.2 million or 3.5% higher than net sales of $91.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in net sales was primarily attributable to increased sales by volume of apple juice and juice blends, aseptic juices, sodas and Junior Juice aseptic juices. The increase in net sales was partially offset by decreased sales by volume primarily of iced teas, smoothies in cans and Hansen energy drinks. Changes in pricing within the Warehouse segment did not have a material impact on the increase in net sales for the year ended December 31, 2007. Gross Profit.** * Gross profit was $468.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, an increase of approximately $151.4 million or 47.8% higher than the gross profit of $316.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 51.7% for 2007 as compared to 52.3% for 2006. Increases in sales volumes contributed to the increase in gross profit dollars. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to an increase in the percentage of sales within the DSD segment of certain packages that have lower gross profit margins. To a lesser extent, the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was also attributable to an increase in the cost of certain raw materials including certain sweeteners, certain containers and packaging materials and certain juice concentrates and increased reserves for slow moving and obsolete inventory. Such decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was partially offset by increased sales of DSD segment products which have higher gross profit margins than those in the Warehouse segment, a decrease in promotional and other allowances as a percentage of gross sales. ***Gross profit may not be comparable to that of other entities since some entities include all costs associated with their distribution process in cost of sales, whereas others exclude certain costs and instead include such costs within another line item such as operating expenses. Operating Expenses . Total operating expenses were $237.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, an increase of approximately $79.0 million or 50.0% higher than total operating expenses of $158.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. Total operating expenses as a percentage of net sales was 26.2% for 2007, slightly higher than 26.1% for 2006. The increase in operating expenses in dollars was partially attributable to increased out-bound freight and warehouse costs of $8.7 million primarily due to increased volume of shipments, increased expenditures of $18.4 million for sponsorships and endorsements, increased expenditures of $10.3 million for commissions and royalties, increased expenditures of $4.9 million for sampling programs, increased payroll expenses of $12.1 million, increased expenditures of $8.6 million for professional services costs, including legal and accounting fees, and increased expenditures of $2.5 million relating to the costs associated with terminating existing distributors. Included in legal and accounting fees are costs of $9.8 million (net of $2.5 million insurance reimbursements) in connection with our special investigation of stock option grants and granting practices, related litigation and other related matters. Total operating expenses, exclusive of expenditures of $15.3 million and $12.7 million for 2007 and 2006, respectively, attributable to the costs associated with terminating existing distributors and exclusive of expenditures of $9.8 million (net of $2.5 million in insurance reimbursements) and $3.8 million for 2007 and 2006, respectively in connection with our special investigation of stock option grants and granting practices, related litigation and other related matters, as a percentage of net sales, were 23.4% for both 2007 and 2006. Contribution Margin. Contribution margin for the DSD segment was $281.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, an increase of approximately $93.8 million or 49.9% higher than contribution margin of $187.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in contribution margin for the DSD segment was primarily attributable to the increase in net sales of Monster Energy brand energy drinks as well as sales of certain new products such as the Java Monster line of non-carbonated 47 dairy based coffee drinks and Monster M-80 TM energy drinks. Contribution margin for the Warehouse segment was $3.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, a decrease of approximately $2.2 million or 36.3% lower than contribution margin of $6.1 million for year ended December 31, 2006. The decrease in the contribution margin for the Warehouse segment was primarily attributable to a reduction in gross margin as a result of increased costs of raw materials and production. Operating Income. Operating income was $231.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, an increase of approximately $72.4 million or 45.7% higher than operating income of $158.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. Operating income as a percentage of net sales decreased to 25.5% for 2007 from 26.2% for 2006. The increase in operating income was primarily due to an increase in gross profit of $151.4 million. The decrease in operating income as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to increased cost of sales as a percentage of net sales. Operating income, exclusive of recognition of deferred revenue of $1.9 million and $0.4 million for 2007 and 2006, respectively, attributable to the AB Distribution agreements entered into with newly appointed AB Distributors, exclusive of expenditures of $15.3 million and $12.7 million for 2007 and 2006, respectively, attributable to the costs associated with terminating existing distributors and exclusive of expenditures of $9.8 million (net of $2.5 million insurance reimbursements) and $3.8 for 2007 and 2006, respectively, in connection with our special investigation of stock option grants and granting practices, related litigation and other related matters, as a percentage of net sales, was 28.2% for 2007 as compared to 28.9% for 2006. Interest and Other Income, net . Net interest and other income was $8.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, an increase of $5.1 million from net interest and other income of $3.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in net interest and other income was primarily attributable to increased interest revenue earned on our cash balances and short- and long-term investments, which have increased significantly over the prior year. Provision for Income Taxes . Provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $90.3 million, as compared to provision for income taxes of $64.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The effective combined federal and state tax rate for 2007 was 37.7%, which was lower than the effective tax rate of 39.6% for 2006. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to certain interest income earned on securities that is exempt from federal income taxes and a reduction in federal taxes attributable to the domestic production tax deduction. This decrease was partially offset by stock-based compensation relating to incentive stock options that is not deducted for federal or state income tax purposes. Net Income . Net income was $149.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, an increase of $51.5 million or 52.5% higher than net income of $97.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in net income was primarily attributable to an increase in gross profit of $151.4 million and, to a lesser extent, an increase in net interest and other income of approximately $5.1 million. This was partially offset by an increase in operating expenses of $79.0 million and an increase in provision for income taxes of $26.1 million. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash flows provided by operating activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $199.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to $135.5 million in the comparable period in 2007. For the year ended December 31, 2008, cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to net income earned of $108.0 million and adjustments for certain non-cash expenses consisting of $13.9 million of stock-based compensation and $3.4 million of depreciation and other amortization. For the year ended December 31, 2008, cash provided by operations also increased due to a $98.6 million increase in deferred revenue, a $98.1 million increase in accrued distributor terminations, a $30.6 million decrease in trade accounts receivable, a $7.5 million increase in accounts 48 payable, a $3.3 million increase in accrued liabilities and a $1.0 million increase in accrued compensation. For the year ended December 31, 2008, cash provided by operating activities was reduced due to an $85.3 million increase in distributor receivables, a $19.7 million increase in inventories, a $4.7 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets and a $4.3 million increase in tax benefit from exercise of stock options. The increase in accounts payable is primarily due to increased inventory levels. Cash flows provided by (used in) investing activities Net cash provided by investing activities was $144.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to $194.7 million used in investing activities in the comparable period in 2007. For the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, cash used in investing activities was primarily attributable to purchases of short- and long-term investments, particularly available-for-sale investments. Cash provided by investing activities was primarily attributable to sales and maturities of available-for-sale investments. For both periods, cash used in investing activities included the acquisitions of fixed assets consisting of vans and promotional vehicles and other equipment to support our marketing and promotional activities, production equipment, computer and office furniture and equipment used for sales and administrative activities, as well as certain leasehold improvements. Management expects that the Company will continue to use a portion of its cash in excess of its requirements for operations, for purchasing short- and long-term investments and for other corporate purposes. From time to time, management considers the acquisition of capital equipment, specifically items of production equipment required to produce certain of our products, storage racks, vans, trucks and promotional vehicles, coolers and other promotional equipment as well as the introduction of new product lines and businesses compatible with the image of our brands. At December 31, 2008, we had $256.8 million in cash and cash equivalents and $118.7 million in short- and long-term investments. We have historically invested these amounts in U.S. Treasury bills, government agencies and municipal securities (which may have an auction reset feature), corporate notes and bonds, commercial paper and money market funds meeting certain criteria. Certain of these investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks, which may be exacerbated by U.S. sub-prime mortgage defaults that have affected various sectors of the financial markets and caused credit and liquidity issues. These market risks associated with our investment portfolio may have a negative adverse effect on our future results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. (See Part I, Item IA Risk Factors Our investments in marketable securities are subject to risks which may cause losses and affect the liquidity of these investments ). Certain of our short-term investments and all of our long-term investments are comprised of auction rate securities. The majority of these notes carry an investment grade or better credit rating and are additionally backed by various federal agencies and/or monoline insurance companies. The applicable interest rate is reset at pre-determined intervals, usually every 7 to 35 days. Liquidity for these auction rate securities was typically provided by an auction process which allowed holders to sell their notes at periodic auctions. During the year ended December 31, 2008, a large portion of the auctions for these auction rate securities failed and there is no assurance that auctions on the remaining auction rate securities in our investment portfolio will succeed. The auction failures appear to have been attributable to inadequate buyers and/or buying demand and/or the lack of support from financial advisors and sponsors. In the event that there is a failed auction, the indenture governing the security in some cases requires the issuer to pay interest at a default rate that may be above market rates for similar instruments. The securities for which auctions have failed will continue to accrue and/or pay interest at their predetermined default rates and be auctioned every 7 to 35 days until their respective auction succeeds, the issuer calls the securities, they mature or we are able to sell the securities to third parties. As a result, our ability to liquidate and fully recover the carrying value of our auction rate securities in the near term may be limited. Consequently, certain of these securities have been classified as long-term investments in our consolidated financial statements. We anticipate that due to the default interest rates now payable on certain of these securities and for other reasons, certain issuers are likely to take steps to refinance their 49 notes to enable them to call and repay the securities and therefore avoid the default interest rates now payable on such securities. At December 31, 2008, we held auction rate securities with a face value of $112.5 million. Subsequent to December 31, 2008, $8.1 million of our auction rate securities were redeemed at par, which are included in short-term investments in our consolidated financial statements. A Level 3 valuation was performed on the remaining $104.5 million of our auction rate securities as of December 31, 2008, which indicated an impairment of $14.9 million, resulting in a fair value of $89.6 million which is included in long-term investments in our consolidated financial statements. This valuation utilized a mark to model approach which included estimates for interest rates, timing and amount of cash flows, credit and liquidity premiums, and expected holding periods for the auction rate securities. These assumptions are typically volatile and subject to change as the underlying data sources and market conditions evolve. In addition to our Level 3 valuation performed as of December 31, 2008, we also reviewed various factors in determining whether to record a temporary or other than temporary impairment charge related to the decline in fair value on our available-for sale securities, including length of time and extent to which the investment fair value has been less than the cost basis, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer and any guarantors if applicable, any specific events which may influence the operations of the issuer, and our intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery of fair value. Based on this analysis, we determined that of the $14.9 million impairment on our auction rate securities, $14.4 million was deemed temporary. This amount has been recorded, net of a tax benefit of $5.7 million, as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31, 2008. In addition, we determined that $0.5 million of impairment was other-than-temporary and recorded a charge to interest and other income, net, in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2008. Based on our ability to access cash and other short-term investments and based on our expected operating cash flows, we do not anticipate that the current lack of liquidity of these investments will have a material effect on our liquidity or working capital. If uncertainties in the credit and capital markets continue or there are ratings downgrades on the auction rate securities held by us, we may be required to recognize additional impairments on these investments. Cash flows (used in) provided by financing activities Net cash used in financing activities was $98.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $36.6 million for the comparable period in 2007. For the year ended December 31, 2008 cash used in financing activities was primarily due to the purchase by us of $103.5 million of our common stock. For the year ended December 31, 2008, cash provided by financing activities was primarily attributable to a $4.3 million tax benefit in connection with the exercise of certain stock options and proceeds of $2.3 million received from the issuance of common stock in connection with the exercise of certain stock options. Purchases of inventories, increases in accounts receivable and other assets, acquisition of property and equipment, acquisition of trademarks, payments of accounts payable, income taxes payable and purchases of our common stock are expected to remain our principal recurring use of cash. On April 25, 2008, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $200 million of our common stock. The Board of Directors also terminated the common stock repurchase program authorized in November 2005, under which we had purchased $27.7 million of common stock. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we purchased 3.9 million shares of common stock at an average purchase price of $26.77 per share, which we hold in treasury. 50 Debt and other obligations We entered into a credit facility with Comerica Bank ( Comerica ) consisting of a revolving line of credit, which was amended in May 2007. In accordance with the amended provisions of the credit facility, we increased our available borrowings under the revolving line of credit to $10.0 million of non-collateralized debt. The revolving line of credit is effective through June 1, 2010. Interest on borrowings under the line of credit is based on Comerica base (prime) rate minus up to 1.5%, or varying London Interbank Offered Rates ( LIBOR ) up to 180 days, plus an additional percentage of up to 1.75%, depending upon certain financial ratios maintained by us. We had no outstanding borrowings on this line of credit at December 31, 2008. Letters of credit issued on our behalf totaling $0.3 million under this credit facility were outstanding as of December 31, 2008. The terms of our line of credit contain certain financial covenants, including certain financial ratios, with which we were in compliance at December 31, 2008. If any event of default shall occur for any reason, whether voluntary or involuntary, Comerica may declare all or any portion outstanding on the line of credit immediately due and payable, exercise rights and remedies available to them, including instituting legal proceedings. We believe that cash available from operations, including cash resources and the revolving line of credit, will be sufficient for our working capital needs, including purchase commitments for raw materials and inventory, increases in accounts receivable, payments of tax liabilities, expansion and development needs, purchases of shares of our common stock, as well as any purchases of capital assets or equipment, through at least the next twelve months. Based on our current plans, at this time we estimate that capital expenditures are likely to be less than $20.0 million through December 2009. However, future business opportunities may cause a change in this estimate. The following represents a summary of the Company contractual obligations and related scheduled maturities as of December 31, 2008: Payments due by period (in thousands) Obligations Total Less than 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than 5 years Noncancelable Contracts $ 52,982 $ 37,159 $ 15,823 $ - $ - Capital Leases 959 959 - - - Operating Leases 20,264 3,156 7,243 4,606 5,259 Purchase Commitments 44,632 44,498 134 - - $ 118,837 $ 85,772 $ 23,200 $ 4,606 $ 5,259 Noncancelable contractual obligations include our obligations related to sponsorships and other commitments. (See Part II, Item 8 Note 11 Commitments & Contingencies ). Purchase commitments include obligations made by us and our subsidiaries to various suppliers for raw materials used in the manufacturing and packaging of our products. These obligations vary in terms. In addition to the above obligations, pursuant to a can supply agreement between the Company and Rexam Beverage Can Company ( Rexam ), dated as of January 1, 2006, we have undertaken to purchase a minimum volume of 24-ounce resealable aluminum beverage cans over the four-year period commencing from January 1, 2006 through December 31, 2009. Should we fail to purchase the minimum volume, we will be obligated to reimburse Rexam for certain capital reimbursements on a pro- 51 rated basis. Our maximum liability under this agreement as of December 31, 2008 is $4.0 million, subject to compliance by Rexam with a number of conditions under this agreement. In the fourth quarter of 2008, we finalized licensing agreements with SAP America, Inc. for our global enterprise resource planning ( ERP ) software initiative which will replace existing legacy software. Our decision to replace our legacy software solutions and move to SAP technologies was based upon our current domestic needs, global expansion, systems scalability, improved integration with trading partners and customers, improved reporting, and business process efficiency and productivity. We estimate the cost for both licensing and implementation of the initiative to be approximately $5.5 million. The project is scheduled to commence in the first quarter of 2009 with a targeted production live date in the first quarter of 2010. In September 2007, we relocated our corporate offices to newly leased offices in Corona, California. In October 2006, we also entered into a lease agreement pursuant to which we leased 346,495 square feet of warehouse and distribution space located in Corona, California. This lease commitment provides for minimum rental payments for 120 months, commencing March 2007, excluding renewal options. The monthly rental payments are $167,586 at the commencement of the lease and increase over the lease term by 7.5% at the end of each 30 month period. The new warehouse and distribution space replaced our previous warehouse and distribution space also located in Corona, California. In October 2006, we entered into an agreement to acquire 1.8 acres of vacant land for a purchase price of $1.4 million, which is currently in escrow. In August 2008, we completed the purchase of an additional 1.09 acres of adjacent land for a purchase price of $1.4 million. The properties are located adjacent to the newly leased warehouse and distribution space. We are reviewing the feasibility of constructing a new office building and parking lot on these combined parcels of land to replace our existing office space. We have sublet a small portion of our previous office, warehouse and distribution space on a month to month basis. In addition, we continue to utilize the remaining portion of this space as overflow for our main warehouse. This lease expires in October 2010. Accounting Policies and Pronouncements Critical Accounting Policies Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements, including various allowances and reserves for accounts receivable and inventories, the estimated lives of long-lived assets and trademarks, as well as claims and contingencies arising out of litigation or other transactions that occur in the normal course of business. The following summarizes our most significant accounting and reporting policies and practices: Investments Our investments in debt securities are classified in one of two categories, held-to-maturity or available-for-sale, in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard ( SFAS ) No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities ( SFAS No. 115 ). Held-to-maturity securities are those securities that the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold until maturity. All other securities not included in the held-to-maturity category are classified as available-for-sale. No securities are held for speculative or trading purposes. Held-to-maturity securities are recorded at amortized cost which approximates fair market value. Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recorded within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as a separate component of stockholders equity. A decline in the market value of any investment security below cost that is deemed other-than-temporary, results in a reduction in its carrying amount to fair value. The 52 impairment is charged to earnings and a new cost basis for the security is established. Premiums and discounts are amortized or accreted over the life of the related held-to-maturity security as an adjustment to yield using the effective-interest method. We evaluate whether the decline in fair value of our investments is other-than temporary at each quarter-end. This evaluation consists of a review by management, and includes market pricing information and maturity dates for the securities held, market and economic trends in the industry and information on the investee company financial condition and information on the guarantors financial condition. Factors considered in determining whether a loss is temporary include length of time and extent to which the investment fair value has been less than its cost basis, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer and guarantors, including any specific events which may influence the operations of the issuer and our intent and ability to retain the investment for a reasonable period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery of fair value. Accounts Receivable We evaluate the collectability of our trade accounts receivable based on a number of factors. In circumstances where we become aware of a specific customer inability to meet its financial obligations to us, a specific reserve for bad debts is estimated and recorded, which reduces the recognized receivable to the estimated amount we believe will ultimately be collected. In addition to specific customer identification of potential bad debts, bad debt charges are recorded based on our recent loss history and an overall assessment of past due trade accounts receivable outstanding. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost to purchase and/or manufacture the inventory or the current estimated market value of the inventory. We regularly review our inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand, production availability and/or our ability to sell the product(s) concerned. Demand for our products can fluctuate significantly. Factors that could affect demand for our products include unanticipated changes in consumer preferences, general market and economic conditions or other factors that may result in cancellations of advance orders or reductions in the rate of reorders placed by customers and/or continued weakening of economic conditions. Additionally, management estimates of future product demand may be inaccurate, which could result in an understated or overstated provision required for excess and obsolete inventory. Long-Lived Assets Management regularly reviews property and equipment and other long-lived assets, including certain identifiable intangibles, for possible impairment. This review occurs annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. If there is indication of impairment of property and equipment or amortizable intangible assets, then management prepares an estimate of future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. If these cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized to write down the asset to its estimated fair value. The fair value is estimated at the present value of the future cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with management estimates of the business risks. No impairments were identified as of December 31, 2008. Management believes that the accounting estimate related to impairment of its long lived assets, including its trademarks, is a critical accounting estimate because: (1) the estimate is highly susceptible to change from period to period because it requires company management to make assumptions about cash flows and discount rates; and (2) the impact that recognizing an impairment would have on the assets reported on our consolidated balance sheet, as well as net income, could be material. Management assumptions about cash flows and discount rates require significant judgment because actual revenues and expenses have fluctuated in the past and are expected to continue to do so. 53 Intangibles Intangibles are comprised primarily of trademarks that represent our exclusive ownership of the Hansen trademark in connection with the manufacture, sale and distribution of beverages, water, non-beverage products and the Monster Energy trademark in connection with the manufacture, sale and distribution of supplements and beverages. We also own in our own right, a number of other trademarks in the United States, as well as in a number of countries around the world. We also own the Blue Sky trademark, which was acquired in September 2000, and the Junior Juice trademark, which was acquired in May 2001. During 2002, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standard ( SFAS ) No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets . Under the provisions on SFAS No. 142, we discontinued amortization on indefinite-lived trademarks while continuing to amortize remaining trademarks over one to 25 years. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, we evaluate our trademarks annually for impairment or earlier if there is an indication of impairment. If there is an indication of impairment of identified intangible assets not subject to amortization, management compares the estimated fair value with the carrying amount of the asset. An impairment loss is recognized to write down the intangible asset to its fair value if it is less than the carrying amount. The fair value is calculated using the income approach. However, preparation of estimated expected future cash flows is inherently subjective and is based on management best estimate of assumptions concerning expected future conditions. Based on management impairment analysis performed for the year ended December 31, 2008, the estimated fair values of trademarks exceeded the carrying value. In estimating future revenues, we use internal budgets. Internal budgets are developed based on recent revenue data and future marketing plans for existing product lines and planned timing of future introductions of new products and their impact on our future cash flows. Foreign Currency Translation and Transactions The accounts of our foreign subsidiaries are translated in accordance with SFAS No. 52, Foreign Currency Translation . Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are recognized in interest and other income, net, at the time they occur. Net foreign currency exchange gains or losses resulting from the translation of assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar are recorded as a part of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders equity. Unrealized foreign currency exchange gains and losses on certain intercompany transactions that are of a long-term-investment nature (i.e., settlement is not planned or anticipated in the foreseeable future) are also recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders equity. Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. Generally, ownership of and title to our products pass to customers upon delivery of the products to customers. Certain of our distributors may also perform a separate function as a copacker on our behalf. In such cases, ownership of and title to our products that are copacked on our behalf by those copackers who are also distributors, passes to such distributors when we are notified by them that they have taken transfer or possession of the relevant portion of our finished goods. Net sales have been determined after deduction of promotional and other allowances in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force Issue ( EITF ) No. 01-09, Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer (Including a Reseller of the Vendor Products) . Management believes that adequate provision has been made for cash discounts, returns and spoilage based on our historical experience. 54 Cost of Sales Cost of sales consists of the costs of raw materials utilized in the manufacture of products, co-packing fees, repacking fees, in-bound freight charges, as well as certain internal transfer costs, warehouse expenses incurred prior to the manufacture of our finished products and certain quality control costs. Raw materials account for the largest portion of the cost of sales. Raw materials include cans, bottles, other containers, ingredients and packaging materials. Operating Expenses Operating expenses include selling expenses such as distribution expenses to transport products to customers and warehousing expenses after manufacture, as well as expenses for advertising, commissions, sampling and in-store demonstration costs, costs for merchandise displays, point-of-sale materials and premium items, sponsorship expenses, other marketing expenses and design expenses. Operating expenses also include payroll costs, travel costs, professional service fees including legal fees, termination payments made to certain of our prior distributors, entertainment, insurance, postage, depreciation and other general and administrative costs. Stock-Based Compensation We account for share-based compensation arrangements in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123R, Share-Based Payment which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards to employees and directors based on estimated fair values. We use the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing formula to estimate the fair value of our stock options at the date of grant. The Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing formula was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. Our employee stock options, however, have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options. For example, employee stock options are generally subject to vesting restrictions and are generally not transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price volatility, the expected life of an option and the number of awards ultimately expected to vest. Changes in subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimates of an option. Furthermore, the estimated fair value of an option does not necessarily represent the value that will ultimately be realized by an employee. We use historical data to estimate the expected price volatility, the expected option life and the expected forfeiture rate. The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for the estimated life of the option. If actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating the key assumptions, we may be required to increase or decrease compensation expense or income tax expense, which could be material to our results of operations. Income Taxes Current income tax expense is the amount of income taxes expected to be payable for the current year. A deferred income tax asset or liability is established for the expected future consequences of temporary differences in the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities. We consider future taxable income and ongoing, prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the value of our deferred tax assets. If we determine that it is more likely than not that these assets will not be realized, we will reduce the value of these assets to their expected realizable value, thereby decreasing net income. Evaluating the value of these assets is necessarily based on our judgment. If we subsequently determine that the deferred tax assets, which had been written down, would be realized in the future, the value of the deferred tax assets would be increased, thereby increasing net income in the period when that determination was made. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements On January 1, 2008, we adopted SFAS No. 157 for our financial assets and liabilities. Our adoption of SFAS No. 157 did not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity. In accordance with FASB Staff Position ( FSP ) No. FAS 157-2, Effective Date of FASB 55 Statement No. 157 ( FSP 157-2 ), we elected to defer until January 1, 2009 the adoption of SFAS No. 157 for all nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are not recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. The adoption of SFAS No. 157 for those assets and liabilities within the scope of FSP 157-2 is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity. In October 2008, the FASB issued FSP FAS No. 157-3, Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset When the Market for that Asset is Not Active ( FSP 157-3 ), that clarifies the application of SFAS No. 157 in a market that is not active and provides an example to illustrate key considerations in determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that financial asset is not active. FSP 157-3 is effective upon issuance, including prior periods for which the financial statements have not been issued. The adoption of FSP 157-3 did not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity. SFAS No. 157 provides a framework for measuring fair value and requires expanded disclosures regarding fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 defines fair value as the price that would be received for an asset or the exit price that would be paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. SFAS No. 157 also establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs, where available. The following summarizes the three levels of inputs required by the standard that we use to measure fair value. Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2: Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the related assets or liabilities. Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. SFAS No. 157 requires the use of observable market inputs (quoted market prices) when measuring fair value and requires a Level 1 quoted price to be used to measure fair value whenever possible. On January 1, 2008, we adopted SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Including an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 115 ( SFAS No. 159 ), which permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. We already record marketable securities at fair value in accordance with SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. The adoption of SFAS No. 159 did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements as management did not elect the fair value option for any other financial instruments. In May 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 162, The Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( SFAS No. 162 ). This standard is intended to improve financial reporting by identifying a consistent framework, or hierarchy, for selecting accounting principles to be used in preparing financial statements that are presented in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) for non-governmental entities. SFAS No. 162 is effective 60 days following the SEC approval of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ( PCAOB ) amendments to Interim Auditing Standards Section 411, The Meaning of Present Fairly in Conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 162 to have a material impact on of our consolidated financial statements. 56 In April 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS 142-3, Determination of Useful Life of Intangible Assets ( FSP 142-3 ). FSP 142-3 amends the factors that should be considered in developing the renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under SFAS No.142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. FSP 142-3 also requires expanded disclosure related to the determination of intangible asset useful lives. FSP 142-3 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. Earlier adoption is not permitted. We do not expect the adoption of FSP 142-3 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Sales The table set forth below discloses selected quarterly data regarding sales for the past five years. Data from any one or more quarters is not necessarily indicative of annual results or continuing trends. Sales of beverages are expressed in unit case volume. A unit case means a unit of measurement equal to 192 U.S. fluid ounces of finished beverage (24 eight-ounce servings) or concentrate sold that will yield 192 U.S. fluid ounces of finished beverage. The Company defines unit case volume as the number of unit cases (or unit case equivalents) of beverages directly or indirectly sold by us. Sales of food bars, which have been discontinued and are not material, are expressed in actual cases. Our quarterly results of operations reflect seasonal trends that are primarily the result of increased demand in the warmer months of the year. It has been our experience that beverage sales tend to be lower during the first and fourth quarters of each fiscal year. Because the primary historical market for our products is California, which has a year-long temperate climate, the effect of seasonal fluctuations on quarterly results may have been mitigated; however, such fluctuations may be more pronounced as the distribution of our products expands outside of California. Our experience with our energy drink products suggests they are less seasonal than traditional beverages. As the percentage of our sales that are represented by such products continues to increase, seasonal fluctuations will be further mitigated. Quarterly fluctuations may also be affected by other factors including the introduction of new products, the opening of new markets where temperature fluctuations are more pronounced, the addition of new bottlers and distributors, changes in the mix of the sales of its finished products and changes in and/or increased advertising and promotional expenses.

Average price per case exclusive of this recognition was $10.26 and $9.96 for the three-months and year ended December 31, 2008. Inflation We do not believe that inflation had a significant impact on our results of operations for the periods presented. Forward-Looking Statements The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the Act ) provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of the Company. Certain statements made in this report may constitute forward-looking statements (within the meaning of Section 27.A of the Securities Act 1933, as amended, and Section 21.E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) regarding the expectations of management with respect to revenues, profitability, adequacy of funds from operations and our existing credit facility, among other things.

The impact of the acquisition of AB by InBev; Lack of anticipated demand for our products in international markets; Unfavorable international regulations, including taxation requirements, tariffs or trade restrictions; Any proceedings which may be brought against us by the SEC or other governmental agencies; The outcome of the shareholder derivative actions and shareholders securities litigation filed against us and/or certain of our officers and directors, and the possibility of other private litigation; The outcome of future auctions of auction rate securities and/or our ability to recover payment thereunder; Our ability to address any significant deficiencies or material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting; Our ability to generate sufficient cash flows to support capital expansion plans and general operating activities; Decreased demand for our products resulting from changes in consumer preferences or from decreased consumer discretionary spending power; Changes in demand that are weather related, particularly in areas outside of California; Competitive products and pricing pressures and our ability to gain or maintain our share of sales in the marketplace as a result of actions by competitors; The introduction of new products; An inability to achieve volume growth through product and packaging initiatives; Our ability to sustain the current level of sales of our Monster Energy brand energy drinks and our Java Monster line of non-carbonated dairy based coffee drinks; Laws and regulations and/or any changes therein, including changes in accounting standards, taxation requirements (including tax rate changes, new tax laws and revised tax law interpretations) and environmental laws, as well as the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act, and regulations made thereunder or in connection therewith, as well as changes in any other food and drug laws, especially those that may affect the way in which our products are marketed, and/or labeled, and/or sold, including the contents thereof, as well as laws and regulations or rules made or enforced by the Food and Drug Administration, and/or the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and Explosives, and/or the Federal Trade Commission and/or certain state regulatory agencies and/or any other countries in which we decide to sell our products; Changes in the cost and availability of containers, packaging materials, raw materials and juice concentrates, and the ability to maintain favorable supply arrangements and relationships and procure timely and/or adequate production of all or any of our products; Our ability to achieve earnings forecasts, which may be based on projected volumes and sales of many product types and/or new products, certain of which are more profitable than others; there can be no assurance that we will achieve projected levels or mixes of product sales; Our ability to penetrate new markets; The marketing efforts of distributors of our products, most of which distribute products that are competitive with our products; Unilateral decisions by distributors, convenience chains, grocery chains, specialty chain stores, club stores and other customers to discontinue carrying all or any of our products that they are carrying at any time; The terms and/or availability of our credit facility and the actions of our creditors; The effectiveness of our advertising, marketing and promotional programs; Changes in product category consumption; 59 Unforeseen economic and political changes; Possible recalls of our products; Our ability to make suitable arrangements for the co-packing of any of our products; Inability to protect and/or the loss of our intellectual property rights; Failure to retain the full-time services of our senior management and inability to immediately find suitable replacements; Volatility of stock prices which may restrict stock sales or other opportunities; Provisions in our organizational documents and/or control by insiders which may prevent changes in control even if such changes would be beneficial to other stockholders; The ability of our bottlers and contract packers to manufacture our products; Exposure to significant liabilities due to litigation or legal proceedings; Higher than expected implementation costs of the SAP system; conversion problems related to the SAP system that could disrupt the Company business and negatively impact customer relationships; the Company inability to complete the SAP implementation in the expected timeframe, which could negatively impact the Company operations and abilities to operate efficiently and measure performance. The foregoing list of important factors and other risks detailed from time to time in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission is not exhaustive. See Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors, for a more complete discussion of these risks and uncertainties and for other risks and uncertainties. Those factors and the other risk factors described therein are not necessarily all of the important factors that could cause actual results or developments to differ materially from those expressed in any of our forward-looking statements. Other unknown or unpredictable factors also could harm our results. Consequently, our actual results could be materially different from the results described or anticipated by our forward-looking statements due to the inherent uncertainty of estimates, forecasts and projections and may be better or worse than anticipated. Given these uncertainties, you should not rely on forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements represent our estimates and assumptions only as of the date that they were made. We expressly disclaim any duty to provide updates to forward-looking statements, and the estimates and assumptions associated with them, after the date of this report, in order to reflect changes in circumstances or expectations or the occurrence of unanticipated events except to the extent required by applicable securities laws.
