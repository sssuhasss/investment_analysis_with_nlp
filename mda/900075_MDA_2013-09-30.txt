Overview We are a leading provider of online auctions and vehicle remarketing services in the United States (U.S.), Canada, the United Kingdom (U.K.), and Brazil. We also provide vehicle remarketing service in the United Arab Emirates (U.A.E.), Germany and Spain. We provide vehicle sellers with a full range of services to process and sell vehicles primarily over the Internet through our Virtual Bidding Second Generation Internet auction-style sales technology, which we refer to as VB 2 . Vehicle sellers consist primarily of insurance companies but also include banks and financial institutions, charities, car dealerships, fleet operators and vehicle rental companies. We sell the vehicles principally to licensed vehicle dismantlers, rebuilders, repair licensees, used vehicle dealers and exporters and, at certain locations, to the general public. The majority of the vehicles sold on behalf of insurance companies are either damaged vehicles deemed a total loss or not economically repairable by the insurance companies or are recovered stolen vehicles for which an insurance settlement with the vehicle owner has already been made. We offer vehicle sellers a full range of services that expedite each stage of the vehicle sales process, minimize administrative and processing costs and maximize the ultimate sales price. In the U.S. and Canada (North America), the U.A.E. and Brazil we sell vehicles primarily as an agent and derive revenue primarily from fees paid by vehicle sellers and vehicle buyers as well as related fees for services such as towing and storage. In the U.K., we operate both on a principal basis, purchasing the salvage vehicles outright from the insurance companies and reselling the vehicles for our own account, and as an agent. In Germany and Spain, we derive revenue from sales listing fees for listing vehicles on behalf of many insurance companies. Our revenues consist of sales transaction fees charged to vehicle sellers and vehicle buyers, transportation revenue, purchased vehicle revenues, and other remarketing services. Revenues from sellers are generally generated either on a fixed fee contract basis where we collect a fixed amount for selling each vehicle 30 regardless of the selling price of the vehicle or, under our Percentage Incentive Program, or PIP, where our fees are generally based on a predetermined percentage of the vehicle sales price. Under the consignment, or fixed fee, program, we generally charge an additional fee for title processing and special preparation. Although sometimes included in the consignment fee, we may also charge additional fees for the cost of transporting the vehicle to our facility, storage of the vehicle, and other incidental costs. Under the consignment programs, only the fees associated with vehicle processing are recorded in revenue, not the actual sales price (gross proceeds). Sales transaction fees also include fees charged to vehicle buyers for purchasing vehicles, storage, loading and annual registration. Transportation revenue includes charges to sellers for towing vehicles under certain contracts and towing charges assessed to buyers for delivering vehicles. Purchased vehicle revenue includes the gross sales price of the vehicle which we have purchased or are otherwise considered to own and is primarily generated in the U.K. Operating costs consist primarily of operating personnel (which includes yard management, clerical and yard employees), rent, contract vehicle towing, insurance, fuel, equipment maintenance and repair, and costs of vehicles sold under purchase contracts. Costs associated with general and administrative expenses consist primarily of executive management, accounting, data processing, sales personnel, human resources, professional fees, research and development and marketing expenses. Acquisitions and New Operations We have experienced significant growth in facilities as we have acquired 55 facilities and established four new facilities since the beginning of fiscal 2011 through July 31, 2013. All of these acquisitions have been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. As part of our overall expansion strategy of offering integrated services to vehicle sellers, we anticipate acquiring and developing facilities in new regions, as well as the regions currently served by our facilities. We believe that these acquisitions and openings strengthen our coverage as we have facilities located in North America, the U.K., the U.A.E., Germany, Spain, and Brazil, and are able to provide national coverage for our sellers. The following table sets forth facilities that we have acquired or opened from August 1, 2010 through July 31, 2013: Locations Acquisition or Greenfield Date Geographic Service Area Homestead, Florida Greenfield September 2010 United States Hartford City, Indiana Acquisition March 2011 United States Atlanta, Georgia Greenfield August 2011 United States Burlington, North Carolina Greenfield July 2012 United States Webster, New Hampshire Greenfield September 2012 United States Gainesville, Georgia Acquisition May 2013 United States Davison, Michigan Acquisition May 2013 United States Ionia, Michigan Acquisition May 2013 United States Kincheloe, Michigan Acquisition May 2013 United States Salvage Parent, Inc.* Acquisition May 2013 United States Birmingham, England Acquisition March 2011 United Kingdom Edmonton, Canada Acquisition May 2012 Canada Calgary, Canada Acquisition May 2012 Canada Dubai, U.A.E. . Acquisition August 2012 United Arab Emirates Embu, Brazil Acquisition November 2012 Brazil Pirapora, Brazil Acquisition November 2012 Brazil Osasco, Brazil Acquisition November 2012 Brazil Castelo Branco, Brazil Acquisition November 2012 Brazil 31 Locations Acquisition or Greenfield Date Geographic Service Area Vila Jaguara, Brazil Acquisition November 2012 Brazil Ettlingen, Germany Acquisition November 2012 Germany Cordoba, Spain Acquisition June 2013 Spain * Salvage Parent, Inc. conducts business primarily as Quad City Salvage Auction, Crashed Toys, and Desert View Auto Auctions. Combined, these businesses operate at 39 locations in 14 states. The period-to-period comparability of our consolidated operating results and financial position is affected by business acquisitions, new openings, weather and product introductions during such periods. In particular, we have certain contracts inherited through our U.K. acquisitions that require us to act as a principal, purchasing vehicles from the insurance companies and reselling them for our own account. It is our intention, where possible, to migrate these contracts to the agency model in future periods. Changes in the amount of revenue derived in a period from principal transactions relative to total revenue will impact revenue growth and margin percentages. In addition to growth through business acquisitions, we seek to increase revenues and profitability by, among other things, (i) acquiring and developing additional vehicle storage facilities in key markets; (ii) pursuing national and regional vehicle seller agreements; (iii) expanding our service offerings to sellers and members; and (iv) expanding the application of VB 2 into new markets. In addition, we implement our pricing structure and auction procedures and attempt to introduce cost efficiencies at each of our acquired facilities by implementing our operational procedures, integrating our management information systems and redeploying personnel, when necessary. Results of Operations Fiscal 2013 Compared to Fiscal 2012 Revenues The following table sets forth information on revenue by class (in thousands, except percentages): 2013 Percentage of Revenue 2012 Percentage of Revenue Service revenues $ 849,667 81 % $ 757,272 82 % Vehicle sales 196,719 19 % 166,919 18 % $ 1,046,386 100 % $ 924,191 100 % Service Revenues. Service revenues were $849.7 million during fiscal 2013 compared to $757.3 million for fiscal 2012, an increase of $92.4 million, or 12.2%, above fiscal 2012. The growth came from (i) our international expansion during the year into Germany, Spain, the United Arab Emirates and Brazil which represented $10.1 million; (ii) the acquisition of Salvage Parent, Inc. which closed on May 30, 2013 and represents $8.0 million; (iii) growth in the U.K. of $2.9 million driven by increased revenue per car; and, (iv) growth in North America of $71.4 million. The growth in North America was driven primarily by increased volume as revenue per car remained relatively flat. The increase in volume came from (i) Hurricane Sandy, as the major storm produced an extraordinary volume of flood damaged vehicles; (ii) market share gains as we saw the full year impact of the exclusive provider contract entered into with a major insurance company at the end of fiscal 2012; and, (iii) what we believe to be a general increase in the overall salvage market as we believe there has been an increase in salvage frequency. Salvage frequency is the percentage of cars involved in accidents which the insurance companies salvage rather than repair. Trends in salvage frequency are driven by the relationship between repairs costs, used car values and auction returns. The increase in salvage frequency was driven, we believe, by the decline in used cars values relative to repair costs. Used car values are determined by many factors including the used car supply, which is tied directly to new car sales, and the 32 average age of cars on the road. New cars sales grew on a year over year basis increasing the supply of used cars and the average age of a car on the road continued to grow. These factors, among others, lead to a decline in used car values on a year over year basis. During the same period the average cost to repair a car increased. The factors that influence repair costs, used car pricing and auction returns are many and varied and we cannot predict their movements. Accordingly, we cannot predict future trends in salvage frequency. Vehicle Sales. We have certain contracts with insurance companies in which we act as a principal, purchasing vehicles and reselling them for our own account. We also purchase vehicles in the open market, primarily from individuals and resell them for our own account. Vehicle sales revenues were $196.7 million during fiscal 2013 compared to $166.9 million for fiscal 2012, an increase of $29.8 million, or 17.9%, above fiscal 2012. The increase came from (i) our international expansion during the year into Germany, Spain, the United Arab Emirates and Brazil which represented $1.1 million; (ii) the acquisition of Salvage Parent, Inc. which represented $3.2 million; (iii) growth in the U.K. of $13.6 million and driven primarily by increased volume from insurance sellers in the U.K. and increased open market purchase activity from the general public; and (iv) growth in North America of $11.9 million driven primarily by increased open market purchase activity. Yard Operation Expenses. Yard operation expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization and impairment, were $417.5 million during fiscal 2013 compared to $344.6 million for fiscal 2012, an increase of $72.9 million, or 21.2%, above fiscal 2012. The growth came from (i) our international expansion during the year into Germany, Spain, the United Arab Emirates and Brazil which represented $5.4 million; (ii) the acquisition of Salvage Parent, Inc. which represented $6.4 million; (iii) growth in the U.K. of $1.6 million driven by increased volume associated with general salvage market growth; and (iv) growth in North America of $59.5 million. The growth in North America was driven by increases in both the costs to process each car and in volume $31.7 million and $27.8 million, respectively. The increase in volume came from (i) Hurricane Sandy, as the major storm produced an extraordinary volume of flood damaged vehicles; (ii) market share gains as we saw the full year impact of the exclusive provider contract entered into with a major insurance company at the end of fiscal 2012; and, (iii) what we believe to be a general increase the in overall salvage market as we believe there has been an increase in salvage frequency, which is the percentage of cars involved in accidents that the insurance companies salvage rather than repair. The increase in the cost to process each car was driven primarily by the abnormal costs for temporary storage facilities, premiums for subhaulers, labor costs incurred from overtime, travel and lodging, and equipment associated with Hurricane Sandy. There was also an increase in the normal cost to process each car driven by growth in normal subhaul, labor, equipment and titling costs. Included in yard operation costs were depreciation and amortization expenses which were $40.8 million and $33.0 million for the fiscal years ended July 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The increase in yard operation depreciation and amortization expense is due primarily to accelerated depreciation from the shorter useful lives of our data center assets. Cost of Vehicle Sales. The cost of vehicles sold was $167.2 million during fiscal 2013 compared to $137.0 million for fiscal 2012, an increase of $30.2 million, or 22.0%. The increase came from (i) our international expansion during the year into Germany, Spain, the United Arab Emirates and Brazil which represented $1.1 million; (ii) the acquisition of Salvage Parent, Inc. which represented $2.9 million; and (iii) growth in the U.K. and North America of $26.2 million and driven primarily by increased volume from insurance sellers in the U.K. and increased open market purchase activity from the general public in both the U.K. and in North America. General and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization and impairment, were $122.0 million for fiscal 2013 compared to $99.4 million for fiscal 2012, an increase of $22.6 million, or 22.7%. The growth came from (i) our international expansion during the year into Germany, Spain, the United Arab Emirates and Brazil representing $5.3 million; (ii) the acquisition of Salvage Parent, Inc. which closed on May 30, 2013 and represents $2.8 million; (iii) relocation costs of $1.7 million; and (iv) growth in North America of $12.8 million. The growth in North America was driven 33 primarily by increased costs associated with new product development, the rollout of a new worldwide ERP operating platform and the transition costs associated with the outsourcing of our IT infrastructure and support which totaled $10.8 million; as well as an overall growth in labor costs, professional services and facilities costs associated with domestic and international expansion. Included in general and administrative costs were depreciation and amortization expenses which were $16.0 million and $15.1 million for the fiscal years ended July 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Other (Expense) Income. Total other expense was $6.1 million during fiscal 2013 compared to $8.3 million during fiscal 2012, a decrease of $2.2 million, or 26.5%. Interest expense decreased $1.1 million as a result of principal payments of long-term debt, which is further described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 9. Long-Term Debt , which is incorporated herein by reference. Other income, net, increased $0.8 million due primarily to the gain on sale of assets. Income Taxes. Our effective income tax rates for fiscal 2013 and 2012 were 35.0% and 34.5%, respectively. The change in the overall tax rate was driven by fluctuations in the U.S. state taxes and the geographical allocation of our taxable income. Fiscal 2012 Compared to Fiscal 2011 Revenues The following table sets forth information on revenue by class (in thousands, except percentages): 2012 Percentage of Revenue 2011 Percentage of Revenue Service revenues $ 757,272 82 % $ 713,093 82 % Vehicle sales 166,919 18 % 159,153 18 % $ 924,191 100 % $ 872,246 100 % Service Revenues. Service revenues were $757.3 million during fiscal 2012 compared to $713.1 million for fiscal 2011, an increase of $44.2 million, or 6.2%, above fiscal 2011. Growth in unit volume generated $33.5 million in additional service revenue relative to last year and was driven primarily by growth in the number of units sold on behalf of franchise and independent car dealerships, new and expanded contracts with insurance companies and the migration from the principal model to the agency model in the U.K. Growth in the average revenue per car sold generated $11.5 million in additional revenue over last year and was driven by an increase in the average vehicle auction selling price as over 50% of our service revenue is tied in some manner to the ultimate selling price of the vehicle. We believe the increase in the average vehicle auction selling price was driven primarily by: (i) the year over year increase in commodity pricing as we believe that commodity pricing, particularly the per ton price for crushed car bodies, has an impact on the ultimate selling price of vehicles sold for scrap and vehicles sold for dismantling; (ii) the general increase in used car pricing, which we believe has an impact on the average selling price of vehicles which are repaired and retailed or purchased by the end user; (iii) the mix of cars sold as the insurance company cars, which on average command a lower average selling price than non-insurance cars, represented a lower portion of all cars sold; and (iv) in the U.K., the beneficial impact of VB 2 which we introduced in 2008 and which expands our buyer base by opening vehicle sales to buyers worldwide. We cannot determine the impact of the movement of these influences as we cannot determine which vehicles are sold to the end user or for scrap, dismantling, retailing or export. Nor can we predict their future movement. Accordingly, we cannot quantify the specific impact that commodity pricing, used car pricing, product sales mix, and the introduction of VB 2 in the U.K. had on the selling price of vehicles and ultimately on service revenue. The average dollar to pound exchange rate was 1.58 dollars to the pound and 1.60 dollars to the pound for fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011, respectively, and led to a decrease in service revenue of $0.8 million. Vehicle Sales. We have assumed certain contracts through our U.K. acquisitions that require us to act as a principal, purchasing vehicles from the insurance companies and reselling them for our own account. 34 Vehicle sales revenues were $166.9 million during fiscal 2012 compared to $159.2 million for fiscal 2011, an increase of $7.7 million, or 4.8%, above fiscal 2011. The increase in vehicle sales revenue was due to the growth in the average selling price of vehicles which resulted in increased revenue of $20.2 million. The growth in the average selling price per unit was primarily due to: (i) the increase in commodity pricing, particularly the per ton price for crushed car bodies, which has an impact on the ultimate selling price of vehicles sold for scrap and vehicles sold for dismantling and (ii) in the U.K., the continuing beneficial impact of VB 2 which we introduced to the U.K. in 2008 and which expands our buyer base by opening vehicle sales to buyers worldwide. We cannot determine which vehicles are sold directly to the end user or for scrap, dismantling, retailing, or export and, accordingly, cannot quantify the specific impact of commodity pricing nor can we isolate the impact that VB 2 had on the ultimate selling price of vehicles sold in the U.K. The decline in volume resulted primarily from the migration of certain contracts in the U.K. from the principal model to the agency model and resulted in a reduction in vehicle sales revenue of $11.1 million. The detrimental impact on recorded vehicle sales revenue due to the change in the British pound to U.S. dollar exchange rate was $1.4 million. Yard Operation Expenses. Yard operation expenses excluding depreciation and amortization and impairment, were $344.6 million during fiscal 2012 compared to $337.1 million for fiscal 2011, an increase of $7.5 million, or 2.2%, above fiscal 2011. The increase was driven by volume, which led to an increase of $13.5 million as we processed more vehicles in fiscal 2012 than in fiscal 2011. This increase was offset by a reduction in operating costs of $5.5 million driven by the decline in the cost to process each car. There was a detrimental impact on yard operating expenses due to the change in the British pound to U.S. dollar exchange rate of $0.5 million. Included in yard operation costs were depreciation and amortization expenses which were $33.0 million and $37.0 million for the fiscal years ended July 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Cost of Vehicle Sales. The cost of vehicles sold was $137.0 million during fiscal 2012 compared to $125.2 million for fiscal 2011, an increase of $11.8 million, or 9.4%. The increase in the cost per unit sold represented a $15.1 million increase relative to last year. Unit volume decrease led to a decrease of $2.3 million. The beneficial impact on the cost of sales due to the change in the British pound to U.S. dollar exchange rate was $1.0 million. General and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization, were $99.4 million for fiscal 2012 compared to $98.9 million for fiscal 2011, an increase of less than $0.5 million, or 0.5%. The beneficial impact on general and administrative expenses due to the change in the British pound to U.S. dollar exchange rate was $0.1 million. Included in general and administrative costs were depreciation and amortization expenses which were $15.1 million and $8.7 million for the fiscal years ended July 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Impairment . During the year ended July 31, 2012, we recorded an impairment of $8.8 million associated with the write-down to fair market value of certain assets, primarily real estate, computer hardware and our fleet of private aircraft which have been removed from operations and, if not disposed of, are reflected in assets held for sale on the balance sheet. Other (Expense) Income. Total other expense was $8.3 million during fiscal 2012 compared to $1.4 million during fiscal 2011, an increase of $6.9 million, or 492.9%. Interest expense increased $7.3 million as a result of increased borrowing under the new credit facility, which is further described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 9. Long-Term Debt , which is incorporated herein by reference. Other income, net, increased $0.5 million due primarily to the gain on sale of assets. Income Taxes. Our effective income tax rates for fiscal 2012 and 2011 were 34.5% and 36.9%, respectively. The change in tax rates was primarily driven by the geographical allocation of income and the application of new elective tax law starting in fiscal 2012. 35 Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary source of working capital is net income. Accordingly, factors affecting net income are the principal factors affecting the generation of working capital. Those primary factors: (i) seasonality; (ii) market wins and losses; (iii) supplier mix; (iv) accident frequency; (v) salvage frequency; (vi) change in market share of our existing suppliers; (vii) commodity pricing; (viii) used car pricing; (ix) foreign currency exchange rates; (x) product mix; and (xi) contract mix to the extent appropriate, are discussed in the Results of Operations and Risk Factors sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Potential internal sources of additional working capital are the sale of assets or the issuance of equity through option exercises and shares issued under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan. A potential external source of additional working capital is the issuance of debt and equity. However, with respect to the issuance of equity or debt, we cannot predict if these sources will be available in the future and, if available, if they can be issued under terms commercially acceptable to us. Historically, we have financed our growth through cash generated from operations, public offerings of common stock, the equity issued in conjunction with certain acquisitions and debt financing. Our primary source of cash generated by operations is from the collection of sellers fees, members fees and reimbursable advances from the proceeds of vehicle sales. Our business is seasonal as inclement weather during the winter months increases the frequency of accidents and, consequently, the number of cars deemed as totaled by the insurance companies. During the winter months, most of our facilities process 10% to 30% more vehicles than at other times of the year. This increased volume requires the increased use of our cash to pay out advances and handling costs of the additional business. As of July 31, 2013, we had working capital of $67.9 million, including cash and cash equivalents of $63.6 million. Cash equivalents consisted of bank deposits and funds invested in money market accounts, which bear interest at a variable rate. Cash and cash equivalents decreased by $76.5 million from fiscal 2012 to fiscal 2013. The decrease in cash was due primarily to the $214.3 million for capital expenditures and acquisitions and $96.7 million in payments on outstanding debt, which were offset by a reduction in share repurchase activity, proceeds from stock option exercises and increased accounts payable balances. We believe that our currently available cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our operating and working capital requirements for at least the next 12 months. However, if we experience significant growth in the future, we may be required to raise additional cash through the issuance of new debt or additional equity. As of July 31, 2013, $35.5 million of the $63.6 million of cash and cash equivalents was held by our foreign subsidiaries. If these funds are needed for our operations in the U.S., we would be required to accrue and pay U.S. taxes to repatriate these funds. However, our intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the U.S. and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to fund our U.S. operations. Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $30.4 million to $199.3 million during fiscal 2013 when compared to fiscal 2012. The decrease was driven in part by increases in prepaid and other assets of $28.8 million, increased accounts receivable of $15.2 million, and increased income taxes receivable of $7.8 million offset by increases in accounts payable of $18.6 million. The remaining decrease of $2.8 million is due to the timing of routine changes in working capital items. Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $13.3 million to $229.7 million during fiscal 2012 when compared to fiscal 2011. The decrease was driven in part by increased deferred income taxes of $15.5 million, a $12.1 million increase in vehicle pooling costs as a result of the adoption of ASU 2009-13 in fiscal 2011 offset by an increase in net income of $15.7 million. The remaining decrease of $1.4 million is due to the timing of routine changes in working capital items. 36 Investing Activities Capital expenditures (excluding those associated with fixed assets attributable to acquisitions) were $130.3 million, $54.8 million and $70.2 million for fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Our capital expenditures are primarily related to lease buyouts of certain facilities, opening and improving facilities, software development, and acquiring yard equipment. We continue to expand and invest in new and existing facilities and standardize the appearance of existing locations. Acquisition related capital expenditures for the year ended July 31, 2013 were $84.0 million primarily for the acquisition of Salvage Parent, Inc. and acquisitions for international expansion. We have no material commitments for future capital expenditures as of July 31, 2013. Included in capital expenditures for the year ended July 31, 2013 are capitalized software development costs for new software for internal use and major software enhancements to existing software. The capitalized costs were $19.3 million, $8.2 million, and $23.9 million for the years ended July 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. If, at any time, it is determined that capitalized software provides a reduced economic benefit, the unamortized portion of the capitalized development costs will be impaired. During the fiscal year ended July 31, 2011, we used $34.9 million in cash primarily for the purchases of Hewitt and Barodge Auto Pool. During fiscal 2011, we sold our corporate headquarters building in Fairfield, California for $16.5 million and entered into a twenty-one month lease term. During fiscal 2013, we terminated this lease. Financing Activities In fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011, we generated $21.4 million, $13.7 million and $7.1 million, respectively, through the exercise of stock options. In fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011, we generated $2.0 million, $2.0 million and $2.0 million, respectively, through the issuance of shares under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan. In fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011, we used $15.0 million, $203.3 million and $739.6 million, respectively, for the repurchase of common stock. On September 22, 2011, our Board of Directors approved a 40 million share increase in the stock repurchase program that was originally implemented in 2003, bringing the total current authorization to 98 million shares. The repurchases may be effected through solicited or unsolicited transactions in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. No time limit has been placed on the duration of the stock repurchase program. Subject to applicable securities laws, such repurchases will be made at such times and in such amounts as we deem appropriate and may be discontinued at any time. For the fiscal year ended July 31, 2013, we repurchased 500,000 shares of our common stock at a weighted average price of $27.77. For the fiscal year ended July 31, 2012, we repurchased 8,880,708 shares of our common stock at a weighted average price of $22.51. For the fiscal year ended July 31, 2011, we repurchased 13,364,634 shares of our common stock at a weighted average price of $20.42. As of July 31, 2013, the total number of shares repurchased under the program was 50,286,782 and 47,713,218 shares were available for repurchase under our program. Additionally, on January 14, 2011, we completed a tender offer to purchase up to 21,052,630 shares of our common stock at a price of $19.00 per share. Our directors and executive officers were expressly prohibited from participating in the tender offer by our board of directors under our Insider Trading Policy. In connection with the tender offer, we accepted for purchase 24,344,176 shares of our common stock. The shares accepted for purchase are comprised of the 21,052,630 shares we offered to purchase and an additional 3,291,546 shares purchased pursuant to our right to purchase additional shares up to 2% of our outstanding shares. The shares purchased as a result of the tender offer are not part of our repurchase program. The purchase of the shares of common stock was funded by the proceeds relating to the issuance of long term debt. The dilutive earnings per share impact of all repurchased shares on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the year ended July 31, 2013 is less than $0.01. 37 In the second, third and fourth quarters of fiscal year 2011 certain executive officers exercised stock options through cashless exercises. In the first, second and third quarters of fiscal year 2012 and the second quarter of fiscal year 2013 certain executive officers exercised stock options through cashless exercises. A portion of the options exercised were net settled in satisfaction of the exercise price and federal and state minimum statutory tax withholding requirements. We remitted $0.6 million, $2.6 million and $4.2 million, in fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, to the proper taxing authorities in satisfaction of the employees minimum statutory withholding requirements. The exercises are summarized in the following table: Period Options Exercised Exercise Price Shares Net Settled for Exercise Shares Withheld for Taxes(1) Net Shares to Employee Share Price for Withholding Tax Withholding (in 000 s) FY 2011 Q2 177,500 $ 8.47 76,050 37,834 63,616 $ 19.76 $ 748 FY 2011 Q3 548,334 $ 11.02 295,496 118,032 134,806 $ 20.40 $ 2,408 FY 2011 Q4 180,000 $ 9.48 76,396 48,366 55,238 $ 22.33 $ 1,080 FY 2012 Q1 40,000 $ 9.00 16,082 8,974 14,944 $ 22.39 $ 201 FY 2012 Q2 20,000 $ 9.00 7,506 4,584 7,910 $ 23.98 $ 110 FY 2012 Q3 322,520 $ 10.74 131,299 85,683 105,538 $ 26.38 $ 2,260 FY 2013 Q2 73,228 $ 8.89 18,127 17,461 37,640 $ 35.91 $ 627 (1) Shares withheld for taxes are treated as a repurchase of shares for accounting purposes but do not count against our stock repurchase program. Contractual Obligations We lease certain domestic and foreign facilities, and certain equipment under non-cancelable operating leases. In addition to the minimum future lease commitments presented, the leases generally require the company to pay property taxes, insurance, maintenance and repair costs which are not included in the table because we have determined these items are not material. The following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of July 31, 2013 (in thousands): Payments Due By Period Contractual Obligations Total Less than 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years More than 5 Years Other Long-term debt including current portion $ 368,750 $ 75,000 $ 293,750 $ $ $ Interest payments on long-term debt including current portion 15,073 7,603 7,470 Operating leases(1) 131,179 23,162 33,836 26,121 48,060 Capital leases(1) 297 229 68 Tax liabilities(2) 23,091 23,091 Total contractual obligations $ 538,390 $ 105,994 $ 335,124 $ 26,121 $ 48,060 $ 23,091 Amount of Commitment Expiration Per Period Commercial Commitments(3) Total Less than 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years More than 5 Years Other Letters of credit $ 18,776 $ 18,776 $ $ $ $ (1) Contractual obligations consist of future non-cancelable minimum lease payments under capital and operating leases, used in the normal course of business. (2) Tax liabilities include the long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet for unrecognized tax positions. At this time we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years beyond 12 months due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes. (3) Commercial commitments consist primarily of letters of credit provided for insurance programs and certain business transactions. 38 Credit Facilities On December 14, 2010, we entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Facility Agreement (Credit Facility), which supersedes our previously disclosed credit agreement with Bank of America, N.A. (Bank of America). The Credit Facility is an unsecured credit agreement providing for (i) a $100.0 million Revolving Credit Facility, including a $100.0 million alternative currency borrowing sublimit and a $50.0 million letter of credit sublimit (Revolving Credit) and (ii) a term loan facility of $400.0 million (Term Loan). On January 14, 2011 the full $400.0 million provided under the Term Loan was borrowed. On September 29, 2011, we amended the credit agreement increasing the amount of the term loan facility from $400.0 million to $500.0 million. On March 1, 2013, we amended the credit agreement to increase the net leverage ratio at which restrictive spending covenants are introduced from 1:1 to 1.5:1. The Term Loan, which at July 31, 2013 had $368.8 million outstanding, amortizes $18.8 million each quarter beginning December 31, 2011 with all outstanding borrowings due on December 14, 2015. All amounts borrowed under the Term Loan may be prepaid without premium or penalty. During the year ended July 31, 2013, we made principal repayments of $75.0 million. We currently have $1.2 million deferred financing costs in other assets as of July 31, 2013. Amounts borrowed under the Credit Facility bear interest, subject to certain restrictions, at a fluctuating rate based on (i) the Eurocurrency Rate; (ii) the Federal Funds Rate; or (iii) the Prime Rate as described in the Credit Facility. We have entered into two interest rate swaps (see Note 10. Derivatives and Hedging ) to exchange our variable interest rate payments commitment for fixed interest rate payments on the Term Loan balance, which at July 31, 2013, totaled $368.8 million. A default interest rate applies on all obligations during an event of default under the credit facility, at a rate per annum equal to 2.0% above the otherwise applicable interest rate. At July 31, 2013, our interest rate is the 0.20% Eurocurrency Rate plus the 1.5% Applicable Rate. The Applicable Rate can fluctuate between 1.5% and 2.0% depending on our consolidated net leverage ratio (as defined in the Credit Facility). The Credit Facility is guaranteed by our material domestic subsidiaries. The carrying amount of the Credit Facility is comprised of borrowing under which interest accrues under a fluctuating interest rate structure. Accordingly, the carrying value approximates fair value at July 31, 2013 and is classified within Level II of the fair value hierarchy. Amounts borrowed under the Revolving Credit may be repaid and reborrowed until the maturity date, which is December 14, 2015. The Credit Facility requires us to pay a commitment fee on the unused portion of the Revolving Credit. The commitment fee ranges from 0.075% to 0.125% per annum depending on our leverage ratio. We had no outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit at the end of the period. The Credit Facility contains customary representations and warranties and may place certain business operating restrictions on us relating to, among other things, indebtedness, liens and other encumbrances, investments, mergers and acquisitions, asset sales, dividends and distributions and redemptions of capital stock. In addition, the Credit Facility provides for the following financial covenants: (i) earnings before income tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA); (ii) leverage ratio; (iii) interest coverage ratio; and (iv) limitations on capital expenditures. The Credit Facility contains events of default that include, among others, non-payment of principal, interest or fees, violation of covenants, inaccuracy of representations and warranties, cross-defaults to certain other indebtedness, bankruptcy and insolvency defaults, material judgments, invalidity of the loan documents and events constituting a change of control. We are in compliance with all covenants as of July 31, 2013. Please refer to the tables under the caption Contractual Obligations above in the Long-term debt including current portion section for the payment schedule. Restructuring We relocated our corporate headquarters to Dallas, Texas in 2012. Certain functions currently performed at the Fairfield, California location may transition to the corporate headquarters over the next few years. We may incur additional expenses in future fiscal years. 39 The restructuring-related costs are as follows (in thousands): Years Ended July 31, 2013 2012 2011 General and Administrative Severance $ 1,423 $ 1,675 $ 1,190 Relocation 314 534 Total general and administrative $ 1,737 $ 2,209 $ 1,190 Yard Operations Severance $ $ $ Relocation 189 745 183 Impairment 1,123 Total yard operations $ 189 $ 1,868 $ 183 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of July 31, 2013, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4) of Regulation S-K promulgated under the Exchange Act. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to vehicle pooling costs, self-insured reserves, allowance for doubtful accounts, income taxes, revenue recognition, stock-based compensation, long-lived asset impairment calculations and contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Management has discussed the selection of critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors and the Audit Committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to critical accounting policies and estimates in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies . The following is a summary of the more significant judgments and estimates included in our critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. We discuss, where appropriate, sensitivity to change based on other outcomes reasonably likely to occur. Revenue Recognition We provide a portfolio of services to our sellers and buyers that facilitate the sale and delivery of a vehicle from seller to buyer. These services include the ability to use our Internet sales technology and vehicle delivery, loading, title processing, preparation and storage. We evaluate multiple-element arrangements relative to our member and seller agreements. The services we provide to the seller of a vehicle involve disposing of a vehicle on the seller behalf and, under most of our current North American contracts, collecting the proceeds from the member. Pre-sale services, including towing, title processing, preparation and storage, as well as sale fees and other enhancement service fees meet the criteria for separate units of accounting. The revenue associated with each service is recognized upon completion of the respective service, net of applicable rebates or allowances. For certain sellers who are charged a proportionate fee based on high bid of the vehicle, the revenue associated with the pre-sale services are recognized upon completion of the sale when the total arrangement is fixed and 40 determinable. The selling price of each service is determined based on management best estimate and allotted based on the relative selling price method. Vehicle sales, where vehicles are purchased and remarketed on our own behalf, are recognized on the sale date, which is typically the point of high bid acceptance. Upon high bid acceptance, a legal binding contract is formed with the member, and we record the gross sales price as revenue. We also provide a number of services to the buyer of the vehicle, charging a separate fee for each service. Each of these services has been assessed to determine whether we have met the requirements to separate them into units of accounting within a multiple-element arrangement. We have concluded that the sale and the post-sale services are separate units of accounting. The fees for sale services are recognized upon completion of the sale, and the fees for the post-sale services are recognized upon successful completion of those services using the relative selling price method. We also charge members an annual registration fee for the right to participate in our vehicle sales program, which is recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement, and relist and late-payment fees, which are recognized upon receipt of payment by the member. No provision for returns has been established, as all sales are final with no right of return, although we provide for bad debt expense in the case of non-performance by our members or sellers. In October 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) amended the accounting standards for multiple deliverable revenue arrangements to: (i) provide updated guidance on whether multiple deliverables exist, how the deliverables in an arrangement should be separated, and how the arrangement consideration should be allocated; (ii) require an entity to allocate consideration in an arrangement using its best estimate of selling prices (BSP) of deliverables if a vendor does not have vendor-specific objective evidence of selling price (VSOE) or third-party evidence of selling price (TPE); and (iii) eliminate the use of the residual method and require an entity to allocate arrangement consideration using the relative selling price method. We allocate arrangement consideration based on the relative estimated selling prices of the separate units of accounting containing multiple deliverables. Estimated selling prices are determined using management best estimate. Significant inputs in our estimates of the selling price of separate units of accounting include market and pricing trends, pricing customization and practices, and profit objectives for the services. Prior to the adoption of ASU 2009-13, we used the residual method to allocate the arrangement consideration when the fair value of delivered items had not been established and deferred all arrangement consideration when fair value was not available for undelivered items. Fair Value of Financial Instruments We record our financial assets and liabilities at fair value in accordance with the framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles. In accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures , as amended by Accounting Standards Update 2011-04, we consider fair value as an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants under current market conditions. This framework establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value: Level I Observable inputs that reflect unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities traded in active markets. Level II Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level I that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Interest rate hedges are valued at exit prices obtained from the counter-party. 41 Level III Inputs that are generally unobservable. These inputs may be used with internally developed methodologies that result in management best estimate The amounts recorded for financial instruments in our consolidated financial statements, which included cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their fair values as of July 31, 2013 and July 31, 2012, due to the short-term nature of those instruments, and are classified within Level II of the fair value hierarchy. Cash equivalents are classified within Level II of the fair value hierarchy because they are valued using quoted market prices of the underlying investments. See Note 9. Long-Term Debt for fair value disclosures related to our long-term debt. Vehicle Pooling Costs We defer in vehicle pooling costs certain yard operation expenses associated with vehicles consigned to and received by us, but not sold as of the balance sheet date. We quantify the deferred costs using a calculation that includes the number of vehicles at our facilities at the beginning and end of the period, the number of vehicles sold during the period and an allocation of certain yard operation expenses of the period. The primary expenses allocated and deferred are certain facility costs, labor, and vehicle processing. If our allocation factors change, then yard operation expenses could increase or decrease correspondingly in the future. These costs are expensed as vehicles are sold in subsequent periods on an average cost basis. Given the fixed cost nature of our business there is not a direct correlation in an increase in expenses or units processed on vehicle pooling costs. We apply the provisions of accounting guidance for subsequent measurement of inventory to our vehicle pooling costs. The provision requires that items such as idle facility expense, double freight and re-handling costs be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criteria of abnormal as provided in the guidance. In addition, the guidance requires that the allocation of fixed production overhead to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of production facilities. In early November 2012, Hurricane Sandy hit the northeastern coast of the United States. As a result of the extensive flooding that it caused, we expended additional costs for (i) temporary storage facilities; (ii) premiums for subhaulers as they were reassigned from other regions; and (iii) labor costs incurred for overtime, travel and lodging due to the reassignment of employees to the affected region. These costs, which are characterized as abnormal under ASC 330, Inventory , were expensed as incurred and not included in inventory. As of July 31, 2013, the incremental salvage vehicles received as a result of Hurricane Sandy have been sold. Derivatives and Hedging We have entered into two interest rate swaps to eliminate interest rate risk on our variable rate Term Loan, and the swaps are designated as effective cash flow hedges under ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging (see Note 10. Derivatives and Hedging ). Each quarter, we measure hedge effectiveness using the hypothetical derivative method and record in earnings any hedge ineffectiveness with the effective portion of the hedges change in fair value recorded in other comprehensive income or loss. Capitalized Software Costs We capitalize system development costs and website development costs related to our enterprise computing services during the application development stage. Costs related to preliminary project activities and post implementation activities are expensed as incurred. Internal-use software is amortized on a straight line basis over its estimated useful life, generally three years. Management evaluates the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis and tests for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets. Total gross capitalized software as of July 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 was $74.3 million, $55.0 million, and $46.8 million, respectively. Accumulated amortization expense 42 related to software for July 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 was $28.6 million, $19.1 million, and $10.2 million, respectively. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts in order to provide for estimated losses resulting from disputed amounts billed to sellers or members and the inability of our sellers or members to make required payments. If billing disputes exceed expectations and/or if the financial condition of our sellers or members were to deteriorate, additional allowances may be required. The allowance is calculated by taking both seller and buyer accounts receivables written off during the previous 12 month period as a percentage of the total accounts receivable balance, i.e. total write-offs/total accounts receivable (write-off percentage). We note that a one percentage point deviation in the write-off percentage would have resulted in an increase or decrease to the allowance for doubtful accounts balance of $1.5 million. Valuation of Goodwill We evaluate the impairment of goodwill for our operating segments annually (or on an interim basis if certain indicators are present) by comparing the fair value of the operating segment to its carrying value. Future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of the operating segments could result in an inability to recover the carrying value of the investment, thereby requiring impairment charges in the future. Income Taxes and Deferred Tax Assets We account for income tax exposures as required under ASC 740, Income Taxes . We are subject to income taxes in the U.S., Canada, the U.K., Brazil, Germany and Spain. In arriving at a provision of income taxes, we first calculate taxes payable in accordance with the prevailing tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate; we then analyze the timing differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of our assets and liabilities, such as various accruals, depreciation and amortization. The tax effects of the timing difference are presented as deferred tax assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet. We assess the probability that the deferred tax assets will be realized based on our ability to generate future taxable income. In the event that it is more likely than not the full benefit would not be realized from the deferred tax assets we carry on our consolidated balance sheet, we record a valuation allowance to reduce the carrying value of the deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. As of July 31, 2013, we have $1.6 million of valuation allowance arising from both of our U.S. and foreign operations. To the extent we establish a valuation allowance or change the amount of valuation allowance in a period, we reflect the change with a corresponding increase or decrease in our income tax provision in the consolidated statements of income. Historically, our income tax provision has been sufficient to cover our actual income tax liabilities among the jurisdictions in which we operate. Nonetheless, our future effective tax rate could still be adversely affected by several factors, including (i) the geographical allocation of our future earnings, (ii) the change in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws, (iii) the changes in governing regulations and accounting principles, (iv) the changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities and (v) the outcome of the income tax examinations. As a result, we routinely assess the possibilities of material changes resulting from the aforementioned factors to determine the adequacy of our income tax provision. Based on our results for the twelve months ended July 31, 2013, a one percentage point change in our provision for income taxes as a percentage of income before taxes would have resulted in an increase or decrease in the provision of $2.8 million. We apply the provision of ASC 740, which contains a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on 43 audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. Although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made. The provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate, as well as the related net interest settlement of any particular position, could require the use of cash. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by various taxing authorities, including the Internal Revenue Service and U.S. states. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. Long-lived Asset Valuation, Including Intangible Assets We evaluate long-lived assets, including property and equipment and certain identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the use of the asset. If the estimated undiscounted cash flows change in the future, we may be required to reduce the carrying amount of an asset. Stock-based Compensation We account for our stock-based awards to employees and non-employees using the fair value method. Compensation cost related to stock-based payment transactions are recognized based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued. Determining the fair value of options using the Black-Scholes Merton option pricing model, or other currently accepted option valuation models, requires highly subjective assumptions, including future stock price volatility and expected time until exercise, which greatly affect the calculated fair value on the measurement date. If actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating the key assumptions, we may be required to record additional compensation or income tax expense, which could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial position. Retained Insurance Liabilities We are partially self-insured for certain losses related to medical, general liability, workers compensation and auto liability. Our insurance policies are subject to a $250,000 deductible per claim, with the exception of our medical policy which is $225,000 per claim. In addition, each of our policies contains an aggregate stop loss which limits our ultimate exposure. Our liability represents an estimate of the ultimate cost of claims incurred as of the balance sheet date. The estimated liability is not discounted and is established based upon analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates. The primary estimates used in the actuarial analysis include total payroll and revenue. Our estimates have not materially fluctuated from actual results. While we believe these estimates are reasonable based on the information currently available, if actual trends, including the severity of claims and medical cost inflation, differ from our estimates, our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows could be impacted. The process of determining our insurance reserves requires estimates with various assumptions, each of which can positively or negatively impact those balances. The total amount reserved for all policies is $6.1 million as of July 31, 2013. If the total number of participants in the medical plan changed by 10% we estimate that our medical expense would change by $1.0 million and our medical accrual would change by $0.4 million. If our total payroll changed by 10% we estimate that our workers compensation expense would change by less than $0.1 million and our accrual for workers 44 compensation expenses would change by less than $0.1 million. A 10% change in revenue would change our insurance premium for the general liability and umbrella policy by less than $0.1 million. Segment Reporting Our North American and U.K. regions are considered two separate operating segments, which have been aggregated into one reportable segment because they share similar economic characteristics. Recently Issued Accounting Standards For a description of the new accounting standards that affect us, refer to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.
