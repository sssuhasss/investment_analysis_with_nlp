ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview We are a diversified, global chemical company providing innovative solutions and applications to a wide variety of end markets. We operate in three business segments: Agricultural Products, Specialty Chemicals and Industrial Chemicals. Agricultural Products principal focus is on insecticides, which are used to enhance crop yield and quality by controlling a wide spectrum of pests, and on herbicides, which are used to reduce the need for manual or mechanical weeding by inhibiting or preventing weed growth. Specialty Chemicals consists of our BioPolymer and lithium businesses and focuses on food ingredients that are used to enhance texture, structure and physical stability, pharmaceutical additives for binding and disintegrant use and lithium specialties for pharmaceutical synthesis, specialty polymers and energy storage. Our Industrial Chemicals segment manufactures a wide range of inorganic materials, including soda ash, peroxygens and phosphorus chemicals. 2005 Highlights 2005 was a year during which we experienced continued sales growth in all of our business segments. We also had significant growth in income from continuing operations before income tax. Our liquidity position also continued to improve due to cash received in the amount of $56.1 million related to the sale of a portion of the San Jose, California property and $99.4 million received as a result of the Astaris asset sale in November 2005. Additionally, we have continued to reduce our debt levels and refinanced our credit agreements. Consolidated revenue of $2,150.2 million was up 5 percent from the prior year. Agricultural Products, Specialty Chemicals and Industrial Chemicals had revenue increases of 3%, 4% and 7%, respectively. In Agricultural Products, our focused strategy combined with growth in Asia and continued strong performance in Europe and Brazil, led to an increase in revenue. Specialty Chemical increases were driven by strong global demand and higher pricing in Lithium. Industrial Chemicals continued to benefit from price increases, particularly in soda ash. Income from continuing operations before income tax of $193.3 million was up significantly from the prior year. This was driven primarily by a gain in connection with Astaris sale of substantially all of its assets. Also contributing to the increase was a 5%, 12% and 46% increase in operating profit in Agricultural Products, Specialty Chemicals and Industrial Chemicals, respectively, and lower interest expense levels. Interest expense of $62.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 decreased 23% from the prior year primarily as a result of reduced debt levels. Offsetting these increases were higher restructuring and other charges and losses on extinguishment of debt. 2006 Outlook In 2006, we expect continued growth in our earnings. This increase is expected to be driven by higher selling prices in Industrial Chemicals, lower interest expense and modest growth in Agricultural Products and Specialty Chemicals. We expect higher raw material and energy prices will partially offset these increases. We expect that cash flow generation from our business segments to remain strong. Critical Accounting Policies Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of asset, liabilities, revenues and expenses. We have described our accounting policies in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K. We have reviewed these accounting policies, identifying those that we believe to be critical to the preparation and understanding of our consolidated 28 Table of Contents financial statements. We have reviewed with the Audit Committee those accounting policies that we have deemed critical. These policies are central to our presentation of results of operations and financial condition and require management to make estimates and judgments on certain matters. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience, current conditions and other reasonable factors. Environmental obligation. We provide for environmental-related obligations when they are probable and amounts can be reasonably estimated. Where the available information is sufficient to estimate the amount of liability, that estimate has been used. Where the information is only sufficient to establish a range of probable liability and no point within the range is more likely than any other, the lower end of the range has been used. Estimated obligations to remediate sites that involve oversight by the EPA, or similar government agencies, are generally accrued no later than when a ROD, or equivalent, is issued, or upon completion of a RI/FS that is submitted by us to the appropriate government agency or agencies. Estimates are reviewed quarterly by our environmental remediation management, as well as by financial and legal management and, if necessary, adjusted as additional information becomes available. The estimates can change substantially as additional information becomes available regarding the nature or extent of site contamination, required remediation methods, and other actions by or against governmental agencies or private parties. Our environmental liabilities for continuing and discontinued operations are principally for costs associated with the remediation and/or study of sites at which we are alleged to have disposed of hazardous substances. Such costs principally include, among other items, RI/FS, site remediation, costs of operation and maintenance of the remediation plan, fees to outside law firms and consultants for work related to the environmental effort, and future monitoring costs. Estimated site liabilities are determined based upon existing remediation laws and technologies, specific site consultants engineering studies or by extrapolating experience with environmental issues at comparable sites. We believe that it is reasonably possible that loss contingencies may exceed amounts accrued by as much as $85.0 million at December 31, 2005. Included in the environmental reserve balance and reasonably possible loss contingencies for 2005 are liabilities that are potentially recoverable from third party insurance policies. These amounts have not been recognized as offsetting recoveries in 2005, but are expected to be recognized in future years as applicable criteria are met. Provisions for environmental costs are reflected in income, net of probable and estimable recoveries from named PRPs or other third parties. Such provisions incorporate inflation and are not discounted to their present values. In calculating and evaluating the adequacy of our environmental reserves, we have taken into account the joint and several liability imposed by CERCLA and the analogous state laws on all PRPs and have considered the identity and financial condition of each of the other PRPs at each site to the extent possible. We have also considered the identity and financial condition of other third parties from whom recovery is anticipated, as well as the status of our claims against such parties. Although we are unable to forecast the ultimate contributions of PRPs and other third parties with absolute certainty, the degree of uncertainty with respect to each party is taken into account when determining the environmental reserve by adjusting the reserve to reflect the facts and circumstances on a site-by-site basis. Our liability includes our best estimate of the costs expected to be paid before the consideration of any potential recoveries from third parties. We believe that any recorded recoveries related to PRPs are realizable in all material respects. Recoveries are recorded in Environmental liabilities, continuing and discontinued. Impairments and valuation of long-lived assets Our long-lived assets include property, plant and equipment and long-term investments, goodwill and intangible assets. We test for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the net book value of 29 Table of Contents these assets may not be recoverable from the estimated undiscounted expected future cash flows expected to result from their use and eventual disposition. In cases where the estimated undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than net book value, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the net book value exceeds the estimated fair value of assets, which is based on discounted cash flows at the lowest level determinable. The estimated cash flows reflect our assumptions about selling prices, volumes, costs and market conditions over a reasonable period of time. We prepare an annual impairment test of goodwill. The assumptions used to estimate fair value include our best estimate of future growth rates, discount rates and market conditions over a reasonable period. We performed this test in 2005 and determined that no impairment charge was required. Pensions and other postretirement benefits We provide qualified and nonqualified defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans, as well as postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans to our employees. The costs (benefits) and obligations related to these benefits reflect key assumptions related to general economic conditions, including interest (discount) rates, healthcare cost trend rates, expected rates of return on plan assets and the rates of compensation increases for employees. The costs (benefits) and obligations for these benefit programs are also affected by other assumptions, such as average retirement age, mortality, employee turnover, and plan participation. To the extent our plans actual experience, as influenced by changing economic and financial market conditions or by changes to our own plans demographics, differs from these assumptions, the costs and obligations for providing these benefits, as well as the plans funding requirements, could increase or decrease. When actual results differ from our assumptions, the difference is typically recognized over future periods. In addition, the unrealized gains and losses related to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations may also affect periodic benefit costs (benefits) in future periods. We use certain calculated values of assets under methods both to estimate the expected rate of return on assets component of pension cost and to calculate our plans funding requirements. The expected rate of return on plan assets is based on a market-related value of assets that recognizes investment gains and losses over a five-year period. We use an actuarial value of assets to determine our plans funding requirements. The actuarial value of assets must be within a certain range, high or low, of the actual market value of assets, and is adjusted accordingly. We recorded $10.6 million, $9.2 million and $7.7 million of net annual pension and other postretirement benefit cost in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, $70.8 million and $85.9 million, respectively, was recorded for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations. The recorded amounts for pension benefit obligations include additional minimum pension liabilities of $63.3 million and $53.1 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, which were recorded in the accumulated other comprehensive income section in stockholders equity. We made voluntary cash contributions to our U.S. qualified pension plan of $15.0 million and $8.0 million, respectively, for 2005 and 2004. In addition, we paid nonqualified pension benefits from company assets of $2.5 million and $4.8 million, for 2005 and 2004, respectively. We paid other postretirement benefits, net of participant contributions, of $7.0 million and $7.2 million for 2005 and 2004, respectively. Our estimated cash contributions for 2006 include approximately $3 million in nonqualified pension benefits, approximately $6 million in other postretirement benefits, and we plan to make voluntary cash contributions to our U.S. qualified pension plan of approximately $30 million. We select the discount rate used to calculate pension and other postretirement obligations based on a review of available yields on high-quality corporate bonds, including Moody Investors Service, Inc. ( Moody ) Aa-rated Corporate and Industrial bond indices. In selecting the discount rate for 2005, we placed particular emphasis on a yield-curve approach designed by our actuary to derive an appropriate discount rate for computing the present value of the future cash flows associated with our pension and other postretirement obligations taking into consideration both the timing and amount of the cash flows. The specific interest rates supporting the yield 30 Table of Contents curve were derived from calculated returns (yields) from a portfolio of high-quality (Aa-graded or higher) bond investments constructed by our actuary. In developing the expected long-term rate of return on asset assumption for our plan, we take into consideration the technical analysis performed by our outside actuaries, including historical market returns, information on long-term real return expectations by asset class, inflation assumptions, and expectations for standard deviation related to these best estimates. We also consider the historical performance of our own plan trust, which has earned a compound annual rate of return of approximately 12 percent over the last 10 years (which is in excess of comparable market indices for the same period) as well as other factors. The current asset allocation for our plan is approximately 74 percent equities (U.S. and non-U.S.), 22 percent fixed-income and 4 percent cash and other short-term investments. Given an actively managed investment portfolio, the expected annual rates of return by asset class for our portfolio, using geometric averaging, and after being adjusted for an estimated inflation rate of approximately 3 percent, is between 9 percent and 11 percent for both U.S. and non-U.S. equities, and between 5 percent and 7 percent for fixed-income investments, which generates a total expected portfolio return that is in line with our rate of return assumption. We continually monitor the appropriateness of this rate in light of current market conditions. For the sensitivity of our pension costs to incremental changes in assumptions see our discussion below. Sensitivity analysis related to key pension and postretirement benefit assumptions. A one-half percent increase in the assumed discount rate would have decreased pension and other postretirement benefit obligations by $50.8 million at December 31, 2005 and $51.0 million at December 31, 2004, and decreased pension and other postretirement benefit costs by $3.0 million, $2.5 million and $0.9 million for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. A one-half percent decrease in the assumed discount rate would have increased pension and other postretirement benefit obligations by $56.0 million at December 31, 2005 and $54.1 million at December 31, 2004, and increased pension and other postretirement benefit net periodic benefit cost by $5.6 million, $5.0 million and $4.0 million for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. A one-half percent increase in the assumed expected long-term rate of return on plan assets would have decreased pension costs by $3.4 million, $3.2 million and $3.2 million for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. A one-half percent decrease in the assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets would have increased pension costs by $3.4 million, $3.2 million and $3.2 million for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively Further details on our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and net periodic benefit costs (benefits) are found in Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements. Income taxes We have recorded a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized. In assessing the need for this allowance, we have considered a number of factors including future income, the jurisdictions in which such income is earned and our ongoing tax planning strategies. In the event that we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made. Similarly, should we conclude that we would be able to realize certain deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, the valuation allowance was $72.6 million and $55.0 million, respectively. On October 22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act (the AJCA ) was signed into law. The AJCA provides for the deduction for U.S. federal income tax purposes of 85 percent of certain foreign earnings that are repatriated, as defined in the AJCA. During the year ended December 31, 2005, we repatriated $528 million of earnings and capital of which approximately $480 million were qualifying dividends under the AJCA. We recorded an income tax charge in 2005 of $31.9 million associated with our total AJCA dividends. The charge includes $18.8 million on the repatriation of the qualifying dividends subject to the 85 percent AJCA provision. 31 Table of Contents Results of Operations 2005, 2004 and 2003 Overview Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Per Share (Diluted) Per Share (Diluted) Per Share (Diluted) (In Millions, Except Per Share Data) Consolidated Revenue $ 2,150.2 $ 2,051.2 $ 1,921.4 Net income $ 116.6 $ 2.97 $ 160.2 $ 4.28 $ 26.5 $ 0.75 Net income included the following after-tax charges (gains): Restructuring and other charges (gains) $ 26.1 $ 0.67 $ 2.2 $ 0.06 $ (4.8 ) $ (0.13 ) Astaris restructuring (1) (0.2 ) (0.01 ) 7.0 0.18 32.5 0.91 Investment gains (2) (24.1 ) (0.61 ) Loss on extinguishment of debt 37.4 0.96 6.0 0.16 Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 0.5 0.01 Discontinued operations (6.1 ) (0.15 ) 15.4 0.42 13.3 0.37 Tax adjustments 21.7 0.55 (71.0 ) (1.90 ) After-tax income from continuing operations excluding restructuring and other income and charges (3) $ 171.9 $ 4.39 $ 119.8 $ 3.20 $ 67.5 $ 1.90 (1) Our share of charges recorded by Astaris, the phosphorous joint venture prior to the sale of substantially all of its assets is included in Equity in (earnings) loss of affiliates in the consolidated statements of income. Income for the year ended December 31, 2005 represents adjustments to liabilities related to restructuring and other charges recorded by Astaris prior to the sale of substantially all of its assets. (2) Investment gains include a gain in connection with Astaris sale of substantially all of its assets. This gain is included in equity in (earnings) loss of affiliates in the consolidated statements of income. (3) We believe that the Non-GAAP financial measure After-tax income from continuing operations, excluding restructuring and other income and charges, and its presentation on a per-share basis, provides useful information about our operating results to investors and securities analysts. We also believe that excluding the effect of restructuring and other income and charges from operating results allows management and investors to compare more easily the financial performance of our underlying businesses from period to period. This measure should not be considered as a substitute for net income (loss) or other measures of performance or liquidity reported in accordance with GAAP. The after-tax charges (gains) included in net income presented in the chart above can be found in the results of operations discussions below for 2005 compared to 2004 and for 2004 compared to 2003. See Segment Results for a detailed discussion of events affecting our results for 2005, 2004 and 2003. Results of Operations 2005 compared to 2004 In the following discussion, year refers to the year ending December 31, 2005 and prior year refers to the year ending December 31, 2004. Additionally, in the discussion below, please refer to our consolidated statements of income included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K as well as the after-tax charges included in net income in the above table. All comparisons are between the periods unless otherwise noted. Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $2,150.2 million, an increase of 5 percent compared to the $2,051.2 million recorded in the prior year period. This increase was driven by higher sales in all of our segments, which are discussed separately below. Restructuring and other charges were $40.4 million ($26.1 million after-tax) in 2005 compared to $3.5 million ($2.2 million after-tax) in 2004. 32 Table of Contents Charges for the year ended December 31, 2005 primarily include the following: $17.0 million related to our decision on April 26, 2005 to close our Copenhagen, Denmark carrageenan plant and Bezons, France blending facility in our Specialty Chemicals segment. This amount consisted of (i) plant and equipment impairment charges of $13.8 million, (ii) severance and employee benefits of $2.4 million and (iii) other costs of $0.8 million. The plant and equipment impairment charge of $13.8 million represents an adjustment to value this plant and equipment at estimated fair value less costs to sell. We have reported the plant and equipment assets related to the Copenhagen as assets held for sale. The assets held for sale in the amount of $9.0 million are included in other current assets on our December 31, 2005 consolidated balance sheet. We expect to complete the sale of these assets sometime in the first quarter of 2006. Impairment and shutdown charges of $7.5 million on our Spring Hill, West Virginia peroxygen plant. During the fourth quarter of 2005, we completed an analysis of our idled Spring Hill, West Virginia facility in our Industrial Chemicals segment. As a result, we committed to the abandonment of the majority of the assets at this facility before the end of their previously estimated useful life. As a result we recorded an impairment charge of $4.5 million associated with these assets and $3.0 million of charges related to the asset retirement obligations associated with this site which were triggered as a result of our abandonment plans. The majority of these obligations relate to one of the Spring Hill plants we plan to demolish. Additional restructuring and other charges for the year ended December 31, 2005 totaled $15.9 million. This amount primarily related to charges of $6.1 million at our Pocatello site to increase reserves for demolition and other shutdown costs as well as charges of $5.4 million for the abandonment of assets in our Agricultural Products segment and severance charges which were recorded in our Specialty Chemicals ($1.6 million) and Agricultural Products ($1.8 million) segments. The severance charges relate to approximately 20 and 60 people, respectively, most of whom have either separated from us as of December 31, 2005 or will separate from us in the first quarter of 2006. The severance costs are expected to result in improved cost efficiencies. The charges of $3.5 million that we recorded in 2004 were primarily a result of severance costs that are expected for result in improved cost efficiencies. Agricultural Products and Specialty Chemicals recorded $3.3 million and $0.3 million, respectively, of these severance costs. Severance costs in 2004 related to approximately 80 people most of whom separated from us in 2004. We also recorded $1.1 million of charges related to continuing environmental sites. These charges were partially offset by non-cash gains totaling $1.1 million in Industrial Chemicals and $0.1 million in Corporate. Equity in (earnings) loss of affiliates Equity in (earnings) loss of affiliates was $70.6 million of earnings in 2005 versus a loss of $2.1 million in the prior year. The significant increase was primarily a result of $57.7 million ($21.7 million after-tax) of earnings recorded in 2005 as a result of a gain in connection with Astaris sale of substantially all of its assets. The increase was also a result of income at Astaris up to the date of the asset sale versus a loss at Astaris in the prior period. The prior period loss included our portion of the Astaris 2004 restructuring charges of $11.5 million ($7.0 million after-tax). Investment gains for the year ended December 31, 2005 was due to the sale of our 50% equity method investment in Sibelco. We recorded a gain of $9.3 million ($2.4 million after-tax) in conjunction with this sale in our consolidated statement of income. Interest expense, net decreased to $58.1 million compared to $78.4 million in 2004. The decrease primarily reflects lower interest costs and debt levels in the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to the prior year. The decreases were due to our debt refinancing in October 2004 and June 2005 and the redemption of the 10.25 percent Senior Notes in July 2005. Loss on extinguishment of debt was $60.5 million ($37.4 million after-tax) for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to $9.9 million ($6.0 million after-tax) in the prior period. In 2005, in connection with our 33 Table of Contents Industrial Revenue Bond refinancing, we incurred an approximate $2.1 million loss and in connection with entering into the 2005 Credit Agreement, we wrote off approximately $1.2 million of deferred financing fees associated with the previous agreement and $0.6 million of fees associated with the new agreement. Additionally, in 2005, we incurred a loss of $56.6 million associated with the redemption of the 10.25 percent Senior Notes. The 2004 loss represents the unamortized fees from our 2002 credit agreement that were written off when we refinanced it in October 2004. Provision (benefit) for income taxes was an expense of $82.3 million in 2005 compared with a benefit of $44.5 million in 2004 reflecting effective tax rates of 43% and (34%), respectively. The change was primarily due to tax adjustments in 2005 which include income taxes associated with the repatriations under the American Jobs Creation Act (AJCA). Excluding the effect of these tax adjustments, which are discussed below, the change from 2004 to 2005 is primarily a result of the mix of domestic income compared to income earned outside of the U.S., dividends received from foreign operations and valuation allowance adjustments. 2005 tax adjustments of $21.7 million primarily includes charges of $31.9 million associated with repatriations, net tax benefits of $19.2 million primarily related to agreement on certain prior year tax matters previously reserved and charges of $9.5 million associated with adjustments to deferred tax liabilities. 2004 tax adjustments of $71.0 million of benefits primarily includes a tax benefit of $38.6 million from an adjustment to income tax liabilities due to a December 2004 pronouncement from the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ), a tax benefit of $31.1 million primarily related to valuation allowance adjustments and a tax benefit of $1.3 million resulting from a refund received from the IRS. Discontinued operations, net of income tax totaled a gain of $6.1 million in 2005 versus expense of $15.4 million in 2004. 2005 net gain includes income of $29.2 million related to completion of sale to the city of San Jose, California of approximately 52 acres of land used by our former Defense Systems operations. Primarily offsetting this income in 2005 was net environmental and legal charges of $23.4 million. Discontinued environmental and legal charges include environmental remediation costs at sites of discontinued businesses for which we are responsible for environmental compliance. The charges in 2005 were primarily related to our Front Royal and Middleport sites and in recognition of our share of liabilities related to a consent order between the EPA and the primary responsible parties at the Anniston site. 2004 charges primarily include amounts totaling $11.4 million to increase our reserves for environmental issues at two sites in New Jersey and at our Middleport, New York site. Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle , net of income tax . On December 31, 2005, we adopted FASB Interpretation No. 47 Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations . The cumulative effect of adoption was a charge of $0.5 million (see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements). Net Income decreased to $116.6 million in 2005 compared with $160.2 million in 2004 primarily as a result of changes in the after-tax items included in net income described above. The change in these items was the primary driver behind the decrease in net income from 2004 to 2005. Partially offsetting the decrease in net income in 2005 was higher earnings from our Agricultural Products, Specialty Chemicals and Industrial Chemicals segments and a decrease in interest expense. Other Financial Data Corporate Expenses increased 12 percent to $45.1 million in 2005 from $40.3 million in the prior year, mostly due to higher legal expense and higher employee costs. Other income and expense, net is comprised primarily of LIFO inventory adjustments, pension expense and realized foreign currency gains and losses. Other income, net increased to $13.9 million from $4.6 million in the prior year due to the impact of the LIFO adjustment and gain related to the settlement of certain energy contracts in the first half of 2005. 34 Table of Contents Segment Results 2005 compared to 2004 Information about how each of these items relates to our businesses at the segment level and results by segment are discussed below and in Note 18 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K. Agricultural Products Year Ended December 31, Increase/ (Decrease) 2005 2004 $ % (in Millions) Revenue $ 724.5 $ 703.5 $ 21.0 3 % Operating Profit 124.8 118.4 6.4 5 Revenue increased 3 percent versus the prior year, driven by stronger insecticide and herbicide sales in South America, Asia and Europe. Revenues in North America were lower compared with the prior year primarily due to the impact of generic bifenthrin competition. Segment earnings were $124.8 million, an increase of 5 percent from the year earlier, as a result of the higher sales in South America, Asia and Europe and the favorable impact of manufacturing productivity initiatives, which more than offset the impact of generic bifenthrin competition in North America and higher raw material and energy costs. In 2006, full-year revenue is expected to be relatively flat, as benefits of new products and label expansion are partially offset by the impact of lower North American bifenthrin selling prices due to continued generic competition. Full-year expected segment earnings growth of 5 to 10 percent for 2006 reflects favorable sales mix and manufacturing productivity improvement partially offset by higher raw material costs. A combination of lower commodity prices and a strengthening Brazilian Real is pressuring the cash flow of our Brazilian customers who sell into U.S. dollar priced export markets. This has resulted in slower payments from these customers and an increase in our allowance for doubtful accounts. Specialty Chemicals Year Ended December 31, Increase/ (Decrease) 2005 2004 $ % (in Millions) Revenue $ 558.5 $ 538.0 $ 20.5 4 % Operating Profit 108.1 96.1 12.0 12 Revenue increased by 4 percent versus the prior year, driven by strong global demand and higher pricing in pharmaceutical, polymer and energy storage markets for lithium. Sales in BioPolymer were essentially level to a year ago as the timing of demand in the pharmaceutical and personal care markets offset increased demand in food ingredients. Segment earnings increased 12 percent versus the prior year. The strong lithium performance, improved results in the BioPolymer food ingredients business and the benefits of BioPolymer restructuring initiatives were partially offset by higher raw material and energy costs. In 2006, we expect low to mid-single digit revenue growth in Specialty Chemicals, driven by improved BioPolymer pharmaceutical sales and higher selling prices in lithium and BioPolymer. Full-year segment earnings are expected to grow by mid-single digits as a result of the higher sales and continued productivity improvements. 35 Table of Contents Industrial Chemicals Year Ended December 31, Increase/ (Decrease) 2005 2004 $ % (in Millions) Revenue $ 870.4 $ 813.7 $ 56.7 7 % Operating Profit 83.9 57.3 26.6 46 Revenue in Industrial Chemicals was $870.4 million, an increase of 7 percent versus the prior year. Higher soda ash sales accounted for the majority of the increase due to significant improvements in both domestic and export soda ash selling prices. North American hydrogen peroxide and Foret also benefited from higher selling prices during 2005. Segment earnings of $83.9 million increased 46 percent versus the prior year, driven by higher selling prices across the group and improved earnings from Astaris, offset in part by the Granger soda ash plant startup expenses and higher raw material, energy and transportation costs. Prior to its divestiture in November, Astaris contributed approximately $11 million of income in 2005, reflecting improved pricing, lower costs and the full-year benefit of the restructuring completed in 2004. For 2006, we expect full-year revenue growth in the mid-teens, driven by higher selling prices across most businesses, particularly in soda ash. We also expect full-year segment earnings growth of 30-35 percent, driven by higher selling prices, partially offset by higher energy, raw material and transportation costs and the absence of Astaris earnings. Results of Operations 2004 compared to 2003 Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2004 was $2,051.2 million, an increase of 7 percent compared to the $1,921.4 million recorded in the prior year period. This increase was driven by higher sales in all our segments, which are discussed separately below. Restructuring and other charges (gains) totaled a loss of $3.5 million ($2.2 million after-tax) in 2004 compared to a gain of $(5.1) million ($(4.8) million after-tax) in 2003. The before-tax loss of $3.5 million that we recorded in 2004 was primarily a result of severance costs that are expected to result in improved cost efficiencies. Agricultural Products and Specialty Chemicals recorded $3.3 million and $0.3 million, respectively, of these severance costs. Severance costs in 2004 related to approximately 80 people, most of whom separated from us in 2004. We also recorded $1.1 million of charges related to continuing environmental sites. These charges were partially offset by non-cash gains totaling $1.1 million in Industrial Chemicals and $0.1 million in Corporate. The before-tax gain of $5.1 million in 2003 was primarily a result of the gain on the sale of an office building in Foret, our Spanish subsidiary, offset by charges related to severance costs, asset abandonments and environmental costs. Equity in loss (earnings) of affiliates . Equity in loss of affiliates was $2.1 million versus $68.6 million in the prior year. In 2003, Astaris began a restructuring plan to improve its financial performance. The restructuring, which included the exit of the commodity sodium tripolyphosphate ( STPP ) market, reduced fixed costs through facility and selective product rationalizations and resulted in improvement in the venture position in food and technical phosphates. The restructuring was completed in 2004 and included four facility closures and the consolidation of operations into the remaining three Astaris sites. Our portion of Astaris 2004 and 2003 restructuring charges, which totaled $11.5 million ($7.0 million, after-tax) and $53.3 million ($32.5 million, after-tax), respectively, were recorded in Equity in loss (earnings) of affiliates. Astaris earnings improved during 2004 compared to the prior year due to the benefits of this restructuring. 36 Table of Contents Interest expense, net decreased to $78.4 million compared to $92.2 million in 2003. The decrease primarily reflects lower interest costs from the December 2003 and June 2004 term loan repricings, lower debt levels in 2004 compared to the prior year and the effect of our debt refinancing in October 2004. Loss on extinguishment of debt in 2004 represents the unamortized fees from our 2002 financing that were written off when we refinanced our debt in October 2004. Provision (benefit) for income taxes was a benefit of $44.5 million in 2004 compared with a benefit of $1.8 million for 2003 reflecting effective tax rates of (34%) and (5%), respectively. The change from 2003 to 2004 was due to tax adjustments recorded in 2004, the mix of domestic income compared to income earned outside of the U.S., dividends received from foreign operations and valuation allowance adjustments. The detail of the 2004 tax adjustments are explained further in our results of operations analysis 2005 compared to 2004. Discontinued operations, net of income tax. We recorded charges of $15.4 million in 2004 versus $13.3 million in 2003. 2004 charges include environmental remediation costs at sites of discontinued businesses for which we are responsible for environmental compliance and legal reserves offset by gains related to tax adjustments for previously discontinued operations. Our environmental charges included amounts totaling $11.4 million to increase our reserves for environmental issues at two sites in New Jersey and at our Middleport, New York Site. 2003 charges are primarily for environmental remediation costs at sites of discontinued businesses for which we are responsible for environmental compliance. Net Income increased to $160.2 million in 2004 compared with $26.5 million in 2003 reflecting higher earnings from our Agricultural Products and Industrial Chemicals segments and decreased interest expense somewhat offset by lower earnings in our Specialty Chemicals segment. In addition, net income for 2004 and 2003 included certain after-tax charges and gains which are separately described above. Reclassifications and Adjustments See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion on reclassifications and adjustments that impacted results for the year ended December 31, 2004. Other Financial Data Corporate Expenses increased 8 percent to $40.3 million in 2004 from $37.3 million in the prior year due entirely to higher spending related to Sarbanes-Oxley Section 404 compliance. Other income and expense, net increased to $4.6 million from $3.9 million in the prior year due to the impact of the LIFO adjustment and other non-operating items, partially offset by an adjustment in pension expense. Segment Results 2004 compared to 2003 Information about how each of these items relates to our businesses at the segment level and results by segment are discussed below and in Note 18 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K. Agricultural Products Year Ended December 31, Increase/ (Decrease) 2004 2003 $ % (in Millions) Revenue $ 703.5 $ 640.1 $ 63.4 10 % Operating Profit 118.4 82.0 36.4 44 37 Table of Contents Higher insecticide sales in 2004 accounted for over half of the revenue increase compared to 2003. This increase was driven by strong performance in Latin America, particularly Brazil, due to an improved farm economy and heavy pest pressures, and to a lesser extent improved performance in Europe. Increased herbicide sales resulted from growth in Brazil, new labels in Europe, strong early season demand in North America and slightly improved conditions in Asia. Favorable foreign currency effects, primarily from the stronger euro and payments from third-party producers also contributed to revenue growth. The increase in segment operating profit in 2004 compared to 2003 was due to higher sales, lower production costs and improved product mix resulting from our focus on higher-value proprietary products. Specialty Chemicals Year Ended December 31, Increase/ (Decrease) 2004 2003 $ % (in Millions) Revenue $ 538.0 $ 515.8 $ 22.2 4 % Operating Profit 96.1 102.1 (6.0 ) (6 ) The BioPolymer business drove most of the revenue increase in 2004 with higher sales in the pharmaceutical and food ingredients markets as well as the favorable impact of foreign currency translation, primarily the euro. Revenue in the lithium business increased slightly in 2004 compared to 2003 as the benefits of increased sales into the battery market and favorable foreign currency translation were partially offset by lower sales into the pharmaceutical market. Segment operating profit was down 6 percent in 2004 versus 2003 due to the impact of higher raw material costs and spending on Biopolymer growth initiatives which were partially offset by favorable foreign currency. Industrial Chemicals Year Ended December 31, Increase/ (Decrease) 2004 2003 $ % (in Millions) Revenue $ 813.7 $ 770.6 $ 43.1 6 % Operating Profit 57.3 34.0 23.3 69 The Industrial Chemicals revenue increase in 2004 was driven by improved Foret sales, our European industrial chemicals business, which resulted from favorable foreign currency translation and higher selling prices in phosphates and peroxygens. Higher alkali sales in 2004 were driven by strong volume growth in export markets and improved domestic soda ash selling prices partially offset by lower net soda ash export prices in Asia and Latin America. Lower domestic peroxygen sales in 2004 resulted from an unfavorable product mix compared to 2003 and lower persulfate prices, partially offset by improved volumes. The increase in segment operating profit in 2004 compared to 2003 was due to higher sales, and improved earnings at Astaris. These benefits were slightly offset by higher energy prices, primarily natural gas and higher freight costs. Astaris earnings improved significantly in 2004 compared to 2003 as a result of its restructuring. Recently Adopted and Issued Accounting Pronouncements and Regulatory Items See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K 38 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Domestic Credit Agreement On June 21, 2005, we executed a new $850.0 million, five-year credit agreement (the Domestic Credit Agreement ), which provides for a $600.0 million revolving credit facility ($250.0 million of which is available for the issuance of letters of credit) and a $250.0 million term loan facility. The initial borrowings under the Domestic Credit Agreement, which is unsecured, were used to prepay all borrowings and terminate the previous $600.0 million senior secured credit agreement. The $250.0 million term loan under the Domestic Credit Agreement was prepaid on December 21, 2005 with proceeds from the European Credit Agreement, as described below. Obligations under the Domestic Credit Agreement bear interest at a floating rate, which is, at our option, either a base rate or a London InterBank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ) plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin is subject to adjustment based on the rating assigned to the revolving credit facility by each of Moody Investors Service, Inc. ( Moody ) and Standard & Poor Corporation ( S&P ). At December 31, 2005 the applicable margin on LIBOR-based loans was 0.75 percent. At December 31, 2005 if we had borrowings under our Domestic Credit agreement, the then applicable rate would have been 5.14 percent per annum. In connection with entering into the Domestic Credit Agreement, we wrote off $1.2 million of deferred financing fees associated with our previous credit agreement and $0.6 million of fees associated with the new agreement. In addition, with the prepayment in December 2005 of the term loan under the Domestic Credit Agreement, we wrote-off $0.1 million of fees associated with that facility. These fees were previously included as a component of other assets in our consolidated balance sheet and were recorded as loss on extinguishment of debt in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2005. European Credit Agreement On December 16, 2005, our Dutch finance subsidiary executed a new Credit Agreement (the European Credit Agreement ) which provides for an unsecured revolving credit facility in the amount of 220,000,000, equivalent to approximately US$260 million. Borrowings may be denominated in euros or U.S. dollars. FMC and our Dutch finance subsidiary direct parent provide guarantees of amounts due under the European Credit Agreement. Loans under the European Credit Agreement bear interest at a eurocurrency base rate, which for loans denominated in euros is the Euro Interbank Offered Rate, and for loans denominated in dollars is LIBOR in each case plus a margin. The applicable margin under our European Credit Agreement is subject to adjustment based on the rating assigned to the facility or, if the facility is not rated, to FMC by each of Moody and S&P. At December 31, 2005 the applicable margin was 0.40 percent. The applicable borrowing rate under the European Credit Agreement was 3.04 percent per annum. Among other restrictions, the Domestic Credit Agreement and the European Credit Agreement contain financial covenants applicable to FMC and its consolidated subsidiaries related to leverage (measured as the ratio of debt to adjusted earnings) and interest coverage (measured as the ratio of adjusted earnings to interest expense). We were in compliance with all covenants at December 31, 2005. 10.25 percent Senior Notes Redemption On July 21, 2005, using proceeds of borrowings under the Domestic Credit Agreement and cash on hand, we redeemed all of our 10.25 percent Senior Notes due 2009 outstanding in the aggregate principal amount of $355.0 million. Pursuant to the terms of the Senior Notes and the related indenture, we paid a redemption premium of $44.0 million. In connection with the redemption of our 10.25 percent Senior Notes, we wrote off $11.4 million of deferred financing fees. These amounts, along with the settlement of a related interest rate lock, resulted in a loss on the extinguishment of debt of $56.6 million in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2005. 39 Table of Contents Sweetwater County Industrial Revenue Bond Refunding On December 15, 2005, we refinanced $90.0 million aggregate principal amount of Sweetwater County, Wyoming industrial revenue bonds issued in 1994 through a new industrial revenue bond issue in the same principal amount. We reduced our average interest cost from 6.95 percent per annum to 5.60 percent per annum and extended the maturity date by 11 years. The 1994 bonds were legally defeased by deposit with the trustee of the proceeds of the new bond issue and other funds provided by FMC, and the bonds were subsequently redeemed with a 1 percent redemption premium on January 17, 2006. This refinancing resulted in a charge of $2.1 million that is also included in loss on extinguishment of debt for the year ended December 31, 2005. At December 31, 2005, the European Credit Agreement was fully drawn. We had no borrowings under our Domestic Credit Agreement. Letters of credit outstanding under the Domestic Credit Agreement totaled $147.4 million at December 31, 2005, resulting in availability of $452.6 million. At December 31, 2004, we had term loan facility borrowings of $100.0 million and no outstanding borrowings under our $400.0 million revolving credit facility. Letters of credit outstanding totaled $146.7 million, of which $47.9 million were issued under our $400.0 million revolving credit facility and $98.8 million were issued under our $100 million stand-alone letter of credit facility. Revolving credit facility availability was $352.1 million and stand-alone letter of credit availability was $1.2 million at December 31, 2004. Cash and cash equivalents, excluding restricted cash, at December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004 were $206.4 million and $212.4 million, respectively. We had total debt of $720.2 million and $929.6 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. This included $639.8 million and $822.2 million of long-term debt (excluding current portions of $0.9 million and $70.8 million) at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Short-term debt, which consists primarily of foreign borrowings, increased to $79.5 million at December 31, 2005 compared to $36.6 million at December 31, 2004. The $182.4 million decrease in total long-term debt at December 31, 2005 from December 31, 2004 was primarily due to the early redemption of our 10.25 percent Senior Notes and the repayment of our 6.75% medium term notes due May 2005. Statement of Cash Flows Cash provided by operating activities was $199.6 million for 2005 compared to $239.0 million for 2004 and $226.7 million for 2003. The reduction in cash provided by operating activities in 2005 compared to 2004 was due to our reduction in the use of vendor finance guarantees coupled with a decrease in accounts payable partially offset by higher earnings. During 2004, cash provided by operating activities reflected higher earnings, which were offset by increased environmental spending. Cash provided by operating activities of discontinued operations was $17.4 million in 2005 compared to cash required of $28.3 million and $26.1 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively. The improvement was primarily due to cash proceeds from the sale of a portion of our San Jose property which was offset by increases in environmental spending. The majority of the spending for our discontinued operations is for environmental remediation on discontinued sites. Discontinued environmental spending was $24.4 million in 2005 compared to $20.5 million in 2004 and $21.7 million in 2003. Cash required by investing activities was $6.4 million, $114.6 million and $161.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The improvement in 2005 was due to proceeds from the sale of our investment in Sibelco and our portion of proceeds from the Astaris asset sale. The decrease in 2004 compared to 2003 was due to lower Astaris keepwell payments. Cash contributions to Astaris were $35.5 million and $62.8 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively. No such cash contributions were made in 2005. Cash required by financing activities for 2005 was $215.3 million compared to cash provided of $46.1 million in 2004. In 2003, cash required by financing activities was $82.1 million. During 2005, we redeemed on 40 Table of Contents the stated maturity date all of our 6.75 percent medium-term notes due May 2005 and all of our 10.25 percent Senior Notes due November 2009. The redemption of our 10.25 percent Senior Notes included a redemption premium of $44.0 million. For the year ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, we contributed approximately 264,000 and 136,000 shares of treasury stock to our employee benefit plans having a cost of $14.9 and $3.6 million, respectively, which is considered a non-cash activity. Commitments and other potential liquidity needs Our cash needs for 2006 include operating cash requirements, capital expenditures, scheduled mandatory payments of long-term debt, environmental spending and restructuring. We plan to meet our liquidity needs through available cash, cash generated from operations and borrowings under our $600.0 million committed revolving credit facility. We continually evaluate our options for divesting real estate holdings and property, plant and equipment that are no longer integral to any of our core operating businesses. On February 17, 2005, we completed the sale to the city of San Jose, California of approximately 52 acres of land at our former Defense Systems site there. Gross proceeds from the sale were $56.1 million. We have an agreement with the city of San Jose for the sale of the remaining approximately 23 acres we own there. The city obligation to purchase the remaining land is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including a review by the California Department of Toxic Substances Control and is expected to close during 2006. Projected 2006 spending includes approximately $60 million of environmental remediation spending, of which approximately $7 million relates to Pocatello, approximately $16 million relates to the settlement of National Priorities List (NPL) sites in New Jersey, and approximately $37 million relates to other operating and discontinued business sites. This spending does not include expected spending of approximately $10 million and $6 million in 2006 and 2007, respectively, on capital projects relating to environmental control facilities. Also, we expect to spend in the range of approximately $21 million to $22 million annually in 2006 and in 2007 for environmental compliance costs, which are an operating cost of the company and are not covered by established reserves. On February 24, 2006, our Board of Directors approved initiation of a quarterly cash dividend and declared a dividend of $0.18 per share payable on April 20, 2006, to the shareholders of record as of March 31, 2006. Additionally, the Board authorized the repurchase of up to $150 million of our common stock. Shares may be purchased through open market or privately negotiated transactions at the discretion of management based on its evaluation of market conditions and other factors. Although the repurchase program does not include a specific timetable or price targets and may be suspended or terminated at any time, we expect that the program will be accomplished over the next two years. We agreed to guarantee the performance by Technologies of certain obligations under several contracts, debt instruments, and reimbursement agreements associated with letters of credit. (See Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K.) As of December 31, 2005, these guaranteed obligations totaled $3.2 million compared to $4.0 million at December 31, 2004. We guarantee repayment of some of the borrowings of certain foreign equity method investments. The other investment owners provided parallel agreements. We also guarantee the repayment of the borrowing of a minority partner in a foreign affiliate that we consolidate in our financial statements. As of December 31, 2005, these guarantees had maximum potential payments of $7.2 million. We provide guarantees to the financial institutions on behalf of certain Agricultural Product customers, principally in Brazil, for their seasonal borrowing. The total of these guarantees was $30.4 million and $70.1 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. These guarantees are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets for each date as guarantees of vendor financing. Short-term debt consisted primarily of foreign credit lines at December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004. We provide parent-company guarantees to lending institutions providing credit to our foreign subsidiaries. 41 Table of Contents Our total significant committed contracts that we believe will affect cash over the next four years and beyond are as follows: Contractual Commitments Expected Cash Payments by Year 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 & beyond Total (in Millions) Debt maturities (1) $ 80.4 $ 52.5 $ 77.8 $ 2.1 $ 508.0 $ 720.8 Contractual interest (2) 31.7 28.9 24.5 22.5 230.5 338.1 Lease obligations (3) 27.9 26.3 24.8 24.0 149.9 252.9 Forward energy and foreign exchange contracts 22.6 0.6 23.2 Purchase Obligations (4) 42.2 6.0 4.5 4.4 11.2 68.3 Total (5) $ 204.8 $ 114.3 $ 131.6 $ 53.0 $ 899.6 $ 1,403.3 (1) Excluding discounts. (2) Contractual interest is the interest we are contracted to pay on our long-term debt obligations. We had $382.9 million of long-term debt subject to variable interest rates at December 31, 2005. The rate assumed for the variable interest component of the contractual interest obligation was the rate in effect at December 31, 2005. Variable rates are market determined. (3) Before recoveries. (4) Purchase obligations consist of agreements to purchase goods and services that are enforceable and legally binding on us and specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, price provisions and timing of the transaction. We have entered into a number of purchase obligations for the sourcing of materials and energy where take-or-pay arrangements apply. Since the majority of the minimum obligations under these contracts are take-or pay commitments over the life of the contract as opposed to a year by year take-or-pay, the obligations in the table related to these types of contacts are presented in the earliest period in which the minimum obligation could be payable under these types of contracts. (5) In addition to the items noted above we have historically made voluntary pension payments and plan to make payments totaling approximately $30 million in 2006. We also have an executive severance plan that includes change of control arrangements which are described in our proxy statement. Contingencies When Technologies was split from us in 2001, we entered into a tax sharing agreement with them wherein each company is obligated for those taxes associated with their respective businesses, generally determined as if each company filed its own consolidated, combined or unitary tax returns for any period where Technologies is included in the consolidated, combined or unitary tax return of us or our subsidiaries. While the statute of limitations for 2001 does not close until June 30, 2006, because the IRS audit for 2000-2001 was concluded during 2005 and no questions regarding the spin-off were raised during the audit, it appears that any liability for taxes if the spin-off of Technologies were not tax free due to an action taken by Technologies, has been favorably resolved. The tax sharing agreement continues to be in force with respect to certain items, which we do not believe would have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. On June 30, 1999, we acquired the assets of Tg Soda Ash, Inc. from Arkema Inc. (formerly known as Elf Atochem North America, Inc.) for approximately $51.0 million in cash and a contingent payment due at year-end 2003 based on the financial performance of the combined soda ash operations between 2001 and 2003. On December 31, 2003, we made the required estimated payment in the amount of $32.4 million based upon contract requirements. This payment was subject to final adjustments based upon the audited financial statements of the business and was settled during the fourth quarter of 2005 resulting in a gain of $1.9 million. During 2004, we reached agreement in principle with the EPA and the U.S. Department of Justice to settle certain liabilities at two environmental remediation sites in New Jersey. These agreements will be final upon negotiation and entry of a final consent decree in 2006. 42 Table of Contents On October 14, 2003, Solutia, our joint venture partner in Astaris, filed a lawsuit against us with the Circuit Court of St. Louis County, Missouri claiming that, among other things, we had breached our joint venture agreement due to the alleged failure of the PPA technology we contributed to Astaris and also failed to disclose the information we had about the PPA technology. Solutia dismissed this Missouri lawsuit in February 2004, after it had filed a virtually identical lawsuit in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in the Southern District of New York. Solutia had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in that same court on December 17, 2003. Our motion to remove the lawsuit from Bankruptcy Court was granted on June 18, 2004, and the matter is now pending in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. On March 29, 2005, the court dismissed certain of the claims relating to the alleged failure of the PPA technology for lack of standing on the part of Solutia. The PPA technology was not included in the sale to ICL described in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K and will continue to be owned by Astaris. On January 28, 2005 we and our wholly owned subsidiary Foret received a Statement of Objections from the European Commission concerning alleged violations of competition law in the hydrogen peroxide business in Europe during the period 1994 to 2001. All of the significant European hydrogen peroxide producers also received the Statement of Objections. We and Foret responded to the Statement of Objections in April 2005 and a hearing on the matter was held at the end of June 2005. We also received a subpoena for documents from a grand jury sitting in the Northern District of California, which is investigating anticompetitive conduct in the hydrogen peroxide business in the United States during the period 1994 through 2003. At this time, we do not believe the investigations are related. In connection with these two matters, in February 2005 putative class action complaints were filed against all of the U.S. hydrogen peroxide producers in various federal courts alleging violations of antitrust laws. Federal Law provides that persons who have been injured by violations of federal anti-trust law may recover three times their actual damage plus attorney fees. Related cases were also filed in various state courts. All of the federal court cases were consolidated in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania (Philadelphia). Most of the state court cases have been dismissed, although some remain in California. In addition, putative class actions have been filed in provincial courts in Ontario, Quebec and British Columbia under the laws of Canada. We are also party to another anti-trust class action pending in Federal Court in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, as well as various related state court cases alleging violations of antitrust laws involving our microcrystalline cellulose product. In 2005, the plaintiffs dismissed their claims against our co-defendant Asahi Kasei Corporation for a payment of $25 million. We have certain other contingent liabilities arising from litigation, claims, performance guarantees and other commitments incident to the ordinary course of business. Based on information currently available and established reserves the ultimate resolution of our known contingencies, including the matters described in Note 17, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or liquidity. However, there can be no assurance that the outcome of these contingencies will be favorable, and adverse results in certain of these contingencies could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity. On October 1, 2005 a new three-year collective bargaining agreement was ratified for our Newark, Delaware facility, which replaced the agreement that expired on September 30, 2005. In addition, on June 30, 2005, a new collective bargaining agreement for our Green River, Wyoming facility was ratified. The new agreement expires on June 30, 2010 and replaced the agreement which expired on June 30, 2005. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. 43 Table of Contents Dividends On February 24, 2006, the Board of Directors approved initiation of a quarterly cash dividend and declared a dividend of $0.18 per share payable on April 20, 2006 to shareholders of record on March 31, 2006. We paid no cash dividends in 2005, 2004 or 2003.
