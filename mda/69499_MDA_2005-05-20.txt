Overview Mylan Laboratories Inc. and its subsidiaries ( the Company , Mylan or we ) develop, license, manufacture, market and distribute generic and brand pharmaceutical products. Fiscal year 2005 net revenues topped $1.0 billion for the fourth consecutive year at $1.25 billion. Our Generic Segment also achieved $1.0 billion in net revenues for the third consecutive year, realizing sales of $1.01 billion. Our Brand Segment recorded net revenues of $240.9 million. For fiscal 2004, total revenues were $1.37 billion, comprised of Generic Segment net revenues of $1.10 billion and Brand Segment revenues of $278.5 million. Year over year, this represents a decrease of 9% in total revenues, 8% in the Generic Segment and 14% in the Brand Segment. The decrease in revenues during fiscal 2005 is due in part to the absence of a significant new product launch until the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. In January 2005, Mylan launched its fentanyl transdermal system ( fentanyl ), the generic equivalent of Alza Corporation Duragesic . Conversely, in the prior year, omeprazole was launched in August 2003 and contributed significantly to revenue for the final eight months of fiscal 2004. In total, Mylan realized $134.6 million in revenue from products launched in fiscal 2004, compared to $87.3 million from products launched during fiscal 2005. Consolidated gross profit for fiscal 2005 was $623.5 million compared to $762.5 million in the prior year, a decrease of 18%, while gross margins decreased from 55.5% to 49.7%. Operating income decreased by 39% to $302.2 million in fiscal 2005, compared to $494.8 million in fiscal 2004. These decreases were realized by both the Generic and the Brand Segments. For the Generic Segment, gross profit decreased by 18% to $489.8 million and gross margins decreased from 54.8% to 48.4%. Generic Segment operating income decreased by 24% to $386.2 million. Brand Segment gross profit for fiscal 2005 was $133.8 million, a decrease of 18%, and gross margins decreased to 55.5% from 58.2%. Brand Segment operating income decreased by 24% to $35.4 million. Net earnings for fiscal 2005 were $203.6 million compared to $334.6 million in fiscal 2004, a decrease of 39%. Earnings per diluted share decreased from $1.21 in fiscal 2004 to $0.74 in fiscal 2005. A more thorough discussion of operating results by segment is provided under the heading Results of Operations . Other factors which impacted the results of fiscal 2005 were: Termination of King Acquisition On July 23, 2004, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger ( Agreement ) to acquire King Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ( King ) in a stock-for-stock transaction. On February 27, 2005, Mylan and King announced that the companies had mutually agreed to terminate the Agreement. Following the termination of the Agreement, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, Mylan recorded expenses in the amount of approximately $18.3 million for costs directly related to the terminated acquisition. An additional $4.6 million of expenses were incurred during fiscal 2005 consisting of consulting costs related to the planned integration of the two companies. In all, these expenses reduced diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2005 by approximately $0.06. 25 Table of Contents Competition on omeprazole subsequent to launch During the past year, additional generic competition has entered the omeprazole market. In general, additional generic competition usually results in lower pricing and volume. Competition caused significantly lower pricing on omeprazole sales compared to the prior year, during which the product was launched. However, we achieved higher volumes due primarily to expanding our customer base which helped to partially offset the impact of the unfavorable pricing. In addition to other generics, Mylan faced competition on omeprazole from an over-the-counter product and other competing branded products. Competition on carbidopa/levodopa For the past several years, Mylan had been the only generic market entrant for carbidopa/levodopa. During fiscal 2005, however, several additional generic competitors launched their bioequivalent version of carbidopa/levodopa. Similar to omeprazole, this additional competition has had negative implications on pricing as well as volume related to carbidopa/levodopa sales. Unexpected delay of fentanyl launch In the third quarter of fiscal 2004, Mylan received final approval from the Food & Drug Administration ( FDA ) for fentanyl. Mylan was, therefore, prepared to launch this product upon patent expiration in July 2004. However, the FDA in June 2004, rescinded Mylan final Abbreviated New Drug Application ( ANDA ) approval. The actions of the FDA prevented Mylan from launching fentanyl in July 2004, which was expected to contribute significantly to fiscal 2005 net revenues and net earnings. On January 28, 2005, the FDA granted Mylan final approval for fentanyl, following the denial of the pending citizen petitions. Mylan launched the product immediately after receiving this approval. However, the pre-marketing of fentanyl by certain competitors, who represented that they would be in the market at market formation, despite not having a tentative or final approval from the FDA, coupled with strategies used by the authorized generic, caused what the Company believes was irrational pricing of fentanyl at market formation, thereby significantly reducing the revenue and profit which Mylan believes it could have earned from sales of this product. Mylan believes that there could be further price erosion as additional competitors enter the fentanyl market. 26 Table of Contents Authorized generics In addition to the impact that authorized generics had on sales of fentanyl as discussed above, in late March 2004, Mylan launched nitrofurantoin monohydrate/macrocrystals capsules, the generic equivalent of Procter & Gamble Macrobid . As the first company to file a Paragraph IV certification, Mylan was entitled to a 180-day period of market exclusivity. However, Procter & Gamble entered into an agreement with another generic company to market Macrobid as an authorized generic which was launched immediately after the launch of Mylan product, effectively eliminating Mylan 180-day exclusivity period and significantly reducing the profit potential of this product to Mylan. Mylan has since filed a lawsuit against Procter & Gamble and its generic partner, on the grounds that this practice violates the law and undermines the Waxman-Hatch legislation which provides an incentive and various rights to a company that successfully challenges patents. Mylan also filed a citizen petition with the FDA with respect to this issue. Regulatory action surrounding launch of levothyroxine sodium Mylan submitted an ANDA for levothyroxine sodium as a bioequivalent generic product to Jones Pharma Inc. Levoxyl and believed it held first-to-file status which, upon approval, would have given Mylan a 6-month period of marketing exclusivity. In addition, Mylan was the only applicant to submit an ANDA to market a generic equivalent of Abbott Laboratories Synthroid . However, due to the approval of supplemental NDAs for other previously marketed levothyroxine sodium products demonstrating bioequivalence to Synthroid and Levoxyl, the FDA allowed competing companies to market their levothyroxine sodium products as generic equivalents to Synthroid and Levoxyl prior to Mylan approvals, effectively eliminating Mylan 6-month exclusivity period. We believe that this resulted in the loss of significant potential market share for Mylan product. Despite the negative impact of competition, including authorized generics, on certain products during fiscal 2005, as well as decisions of the FDA and the courts, fiscal 2005 did contain many significant positive developments. In addition to Mylan launch of fentanyl which, through mid-April 2005, had captured approximately 60% of the generic market, and over 40% of the total market for this product, the following occurred during the year: Acceptance for filing of nebivolol NDA During the second quarter of fiscal 2005, Mylan announced that the FDA accepted for filing its brand subsidiary New Drug Application ( NDA ) for nebivolol, for which the Company is seeking approval for use in the management of hypertension. Launch of Apokyn During the second quarter of fiscal 2005, Mylan launched Apokyn, which has been approved for the acute, intermittent treatment of hypomobility, off episodes associated with advanced Parkinson disease. Apokyn, which has orphan drug status, has been studied as an adjunct to other medications. EMSAM In December 2004, Somerset Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ( Somerset ), in which Mylan owns a 50% equity interest, entered into an agreement with Bristol-Myers Squibb for the commercialization and distribution of Somerset EMSAM (selegiline transdermal system). Somerset received an Approvable letter from the FDA for EMSAM in February 2004, and if approved by the FDA, EMSAM would be the first transdermal treatment for major depressive disorder. 27 Table of Contents Results of Operations The following table presents the results of operations for each of our business segments at March 31: Fiscal (in thousands) 2005 2004 2003 Consolidated: Total revenues $ 1,253,374 $ 1,374,617 $ 1,269,192 Gross profit 623,540 762,468 671,436 Research and development 87,881 100,813 86,748 Selling and marketing 79,838 74,625 65,625 General and administrative 179,640 126,987 107,445 Litigation settlements, net (25,990 ) (34,758 ) (2,370 ) Earnings from operations 302,171 494,801 413,988 Other income, net 10,076 17,807 12,525 Pretax earnings 312,247 512,608 426,513 Generic Segment: Total revenues 1,012,503 1,096,128 1,012,617 Gross profit 489,755 600,280 531,106 Research and development 68,858 59,066 44,562 Selling and marketing 12,353 11,707 11,160 General and administrative 22,345 18,686 21,341 Earnings from operations 386,199 510,821 454,043 Brand Segment: Total revenues 240,871 278,489 256,575 Gross profit 133,785 162,188 140,330 Research and development 19,023 41,747 42,186 Selling and marketing 67,485 62,918 54,465 General and administrative 11,898 11,002 10,997 Earnings from operations 35,379 46,521 32,682 Corporate/Other: General and administrative 145,397 97,299 75,107 Litigation settlements, net (25,990 ) (34,758 ) (2,370 ) Other income, net 10,076 17,807 12,525 Segment net revenues represent revenues from unrelated third parties. For the Generic and Brand Segments, earnings from operations represent segment gross profit less direct research and development, selling and marketing, and general and administrative expenses. Corporate/Other includes certain general and administrative expenses, such as legal expenditures, litigation settlements and non-operating income and expense. 28 Table of Contents Fiscal 2005 Compared to Fiscal 2004 Revenues and Gross Profit Revenues for fiscal 2005 were $1.25 billion compared to $1.37 billion for fiscal 2004, a decrease of $121.2 million or 9%. In arriving at net revenues, gross revenues are reduced by provisions for estimates, including discounts, customer performance and promotions, price adjustments, returns and chargebacks. See the section titled Application of Critical Accounting Policies in this Item 7, for a thorough discussion of our methodology with respect to such provisions. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005, the most significant amounts charged against gross revenues were for chargebacks in the amount of $892.6 million and customer performance and promotions in the amount of $195.1 million. For fiscal 2004, chargebacks of $797.1 million and customer performance and promotions of $163.8 million were charged against gross revenues. The increase in the amounts charged against gross revenues for chargebacks in the current year is primarily the result of pricing pressures on certain products in the Company portfolio, most notably omeprazole, carbidopa/levodopa and Amnesteem , as well as a shift in amounts purchased by customers that are entitled to chargeback credits. Customer performance and promotions include direct rebates as well as promotional programs. The increase in the amounts charged against gross revenues for customer performance and promotions is primarily due to increased gross revenues (from which direct rebates are calculated) and promotions offered to customers in connection with the launch of fentanyl. The decrease in revenues during fiscal 2005 was realized by both the Generic Segment and the Brand Segment. Generic Segment net revenues totaled $1.01 billion for fiscal 2005 compared to $1.10 billion in fiscal 2004, a decrease of $83.6 million or 8%. For the Brand Segment revenues decreased $37.6 million or 14% from $278.5 million in fiscal 2004 to $240.9 million in fiscal 2005. Within the Generic Segment, the decrease in revenues was primarily the result of continued pricing pressure, including the effect of additional competition, on the Company product portfolio. Omeprazole, which was launched during the second quarter of fiscal 2004, experienced significantly lower pricing as a direct result of additional generic competition. Increased competition also resulted in unfavorable pricing on carbidopa/levodopa, as well as loss of market share. As is the case in the generic industry, the entrance into the market of other generic competition generally has a negative impact on the volume and pricing of the affected products. In the near term, it is likely that unfavorable pricing will continue to impact certain products in the Company portfolio. Additionally, net revenues were impacted by certain customers who decreased their level of purchases in order to reduce the amount of Mylan inventory that they maintain on their shelves. Partially offsetting the impact of the items discussed above were increased overall volume and revenues from new products. Despite the additional competition experienced in the current year, omeprazole sales volume increased due primarily to expanding the customer base and capitalizing on a higher generic conversion rate. Also, Mylan was able to establish its position as market leader, based on omeprazole prescriptions dispensed. On an overall basis, Generic volume shipped for the year increased nearly 6% to 11.4 billion doses compared with the prior year. New products launched subsequent to March 31, 2004, contributed net revenues of $87.3 million in the current fiscal year, due largely to the launch of fentanyl in January 2005. Revenues for the Brand Segment were also significantly impacted by pricing pressures as a result of additional competition. During fiscal 2005, Amnesteem and Digitek were the two products most affected. Fiscal 2004 Brand Segment revenues include $13.9 million from the sale of the U.S. and Canadian rights for sertaconazole nitrate 2% cream ( sertaconazole ). Excluding the sertaconazole sale and revenue from new products, volume for the Brand Segment was consistent year over year. Consolidated gross profit for fiscal 2005 was $623.5 million, or 49.7% of revenues, compared to $762.5 million, or 55.5% of revenues in fiscal 2004. For the Generic Segment, gross profit for fiscal 2005 decreased by $110.5 million to $489.8 million from $600.3 million in fiscal 2004, and decreased as a percentage of revenues from 54.8% to 48.4%. The decrease in Generic Segment gross margin is primarily the result of price erosion brought about by additional generic competition on the Company portfolio, primarily omeprazole and carbidopa/levodopa. Brand Segment gross profit for fiscal 2005 decreased $28.4 million to $133.8 million from $162.2 million in fiscal 2004 and decreased as a percentage of revenues from 58.2% to 55.5%. Excluding the sertaconazole sale, Brand Segment margins were essentially unchanged. 29 Table of Contents Research and Development Research and development ( R&D ) expense for fiscal 2005 was $87.9 million compared to $100.8 million in fiscal 2004, which represents a decrease of $12.9 million or 13%. Brand Segment R&D expense decreased by $22.7 million or 54% to $19.0 million in fiscal 2005 from $41.7 million in fiscal 2004. This decrease was partially offset by an increase of $9.8 million or 17% to $68.9 million from $59.1 million in R&D expense in the Generic Segment. The decrease in Brand Segment R&D expense is due to the completion, in late fiscal 2004, of clinical studies related to nebivolol, a product for the treatment of hypertension. The NDA for nebivolol was submitted to the FDA on April 30, 2004, and accepted for filing by the FDA on June 29, 2004. As clinical development programs for other products and life cycle management studies are initiated, it is expected that Brand Segment R&D expenses will increase in future periods. The increase in Generic Segment R&D expense is due equally to an increase in payroll and payroll related costs and the cost of ongoing generic studies. The increase in generic studies is the result of both a higher number of subjects per study and an increase in the related raw material costs. The Company continued commitment to, and investment in, R&D activities has resulted in a robust ANDA pipeline, with 44 applications pending before the FDA, and 27 ANDA approvals in fiscal 2005, more than double the number from just two years ago. Selling and Marketing Selling and marketing expense for fiscal 2005 was $79.8 million compared to $74.6 million in fiscal 2004, an increase of $5.2 million or 7%. This increase was driven by the Brand Segment for which selling and marketing expense increased by $4.6 million or 7% to $67.5 million. This increase was primarily the result of costs incurred with respect to nebivolol and costs associated with the fiscal 2005 launch of Apokyn. General and Administrative General and administrative ( G&A ) expense was $179.6 million in fiscal 2005, an increase of $52.7 million or 41% from $127.0 million in fiscal 2004. The majority of the increase, or $48.1 million, is the result of higher Corporate expenses. The Generic Segment, which increased by $3.7 million from fiscal 2004, accounted for the remainder of the increase in G&A expense. Included in Corporate G&A expense for fiscal 2005 is approximately $18.3 million of costs directly related to the terminated King acquisition and an additional $4.6 million of consulting expenses related to the planned integration of the two companies. The remainder of the increase in G&A expense is due to numerous factors, the most significant of which is payroll and payroll related costs which increased by approximately $9.8 million. Additionally, consulting expenses increased as a result of the Company implementation of an enterprise resource planning ( ERP ) system, and legal expenses increased as a result of new and ongoing litigation related to patent challenges and other product related matters. Legal challenges continue to be an integral part of the Company strategy and its ability to continue to deliver new generic products to the market. Litigation Settlements Net gains of $26.0 million were recorded in fiscal 2005 with respect to the settlement of various lawsuits. In June 2004, Mylan received $37.5 million in settlement of certain patent litigation claims involving omeprazole. A portion of this settlement represented reimbursement of legal fees and expenses related to the litigation. Partially offsetting this gain, Mylan agreed, also in June 2004, to a $9.0 million settlement resolving all pending litigation with respect to paclitaxel. Net gains of $34.8 million, also from the settlement of various lawsuits, were recorded in fiscal 2004. Of this, $12.5 million was related to a favorable settlement reached with respect to the marketing and manufacturing of Zagam , and $10.2 million was related to a favorable settlement reached with respect to mirtazapine. The remainder of the settlement primarily relates to future payments to be made to Mylan totaling $10.0 million from Mylan co-defendants in the lorazepam and clorazepate litigation. Other Income, Net Other income, net of other expenses, was $10.1 million in fiscal 2005 compared to $17.8 million in fiscal 2004. This decrease of $7.7 million is primarily the result of lower realized gains on the sale of marketable securities in fiscal 2005 and 30 Table of Contents a $5.0 million gain on the sale of an office building recorded in fiscal 2004, partially offset by less of a loss recorded in fiscal 2005 on our investment in Somerset. We own a 50% equity interest in Somerset and account for this investment using the equity method of accounting. The recorded loss in Somerset for fiscal 2005 was $3.3 million compared to a loss of $7.1 million in fiscal 2004. The investment in Somerset was reduced to zero during fiscal 2005. As such, in accordance with Accounting Principles Board ( APB ) Opinion No. 18, The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock , the Company has temporarily ceased recording losses on this investment. Somerset is engaged in the manufacturing and marketing of Eldepryl (selegiline), its sole commercial product, which is used for the treatment of patients with late-stage Parkinson disease. During fiscal 2004, Somerset received an Approvable letter from the FDA with regard to EMSAM (selegiline transdermal system), the transdermal therapy for which it is seeking an indication for the treatment of major depressive disorder. As Somerset continues its research and development activities, including working with the FDA to obtain approval for EMSAM, its earnings may continue to be adversely affected. Income Taxes The effective tax rate for fiscal 2005 was 34.8% compared to 34.7% for fiscal 2004. Fiscal 2004 Compared to Fiscal 2003 Revenues and Gross Profit Revenues for fiscal 2004 were $1.37 billion compared to $1.27 billion for fiscal 2003, an increase of 8% or $105.4 million. Both the Generic Segment and the Brand Segment contributed to the overall increase in revenues. Revenues for the Generic Segment, which accounted for approximately 80% of consolidated revenues, increased $83.5 million or 8% over the prior year while Brand Segment revenues increased $21.9 million or 9% over the prior year. Generic Segment net revenues exceeded $1.0 billion for the second time in the Company history, reaching $1.10 billion compared to $1.01 billion in fiscal 2003. The increase in net revenues is primarily the result of new products launched in fiscal 2004, which contributed net revenues of $134.6 million, largely due to omeprazole. Relatively stable pricing on existing products also contributed to the increase in Generic Segment net revenues. These increases were partially offset by lower volume. Generic volume shipped was approximately 10.8 billion doses in fiscal 2004 compared to 11.6 billion doses in fiscal 2003. Our focus is to maximize gross margins within our product portfolio which may result in fluctuations in volume and changes to our product mix. Following the entrance into the market of generic competition, both price and volume erosion may occur in the pharmaceutical industry which could adversely affect products in our portfolio. Revenues for the Brand Segment benefited from a full year of Amnesteem sales. The Brand Segment generated revenues of $278.5 million, an increase of $21.9 million or 9% over fiscal 2003. Amnesteem, which was launched in the third quarter of fiscal 2003, contributed revenues of $75.9 million in fiscal 2004, an increase of 24% over the prior year. Also contributing to the increase in revenues is $13.9 million realized from the sertaconazole sale recorded under the caption Other Revenue . Product sales, as well as sales of the rights to pharmaceutical products, are included in revenues as such sales are a normal part of our operations. For Amnesteem, significant price erosion was experienced in fiscal 2004 due to the entrance into the market of other generic competitors. This was compensated for, however, by increased volume as Amnesteem held its position as market leader, maintaining an overall market share of approximately 43% into May of 2004. Increased competition resulted in price erosion and lower volume on Acticin , Digitek and Maxzide during fiscal 2004 while other products in the portfolio, primarily phenytoin and Phenytek , experienced both favorable pricing and increased volume. Consolidated gross profit for fiscal 2004 was $762.5 million, or 56% of revenues, compared to $671.4 million, or 53% of revenues in fiscal 2003. For the Generic Segment, gross profit for fiscal 2004 increased by $69.2 million to $600.3 million from $531.1 million in fiscal 2003 and increased as a percentage of revenues from 52% to 55%. The increase is primarily due to higher margins contributed by new products, primarily omeprazole. Additionally, a slight overall increase in gross margin was realized by the Generic Segment existing products as a result of favorable product mix. Brand Segment gross profit for fiscal 2004 increased $21.9 million to $162.2 million from $140.3 million in fiscal 2003 31 Table of Contents and increased as a percentage of revenues from 55% to 58%, primarily as a result of favorable pricing realized on several core products and the sertaconazole sale for which there were minimal associated costs in fiscal 2004. This increase was realized despite the fact that sales of Amnesteem contribute lower gross margins than the majority of the Brand Segment other core products due to royalties paid under a supply and distribution agreement. Research and Development R&D expense for fiscal 2004 was $100.8 million or approximately 7% of revenues compared to $86.7 million or 7% of revenues in fiscal 2003, which represents an increase of $14.1 million or 16%. The increase was primarily attributable to the Generic Segment, for which R&D expense increased $14.5 million or 33%, partially offset by a slight decrease in the Brand Segment of $0.4 million or 1%. The increase in the Generic Segment R&D expense is due equally to increased R&D headcount, as well as an increase in the amount and timing of current and future ANDA submissions, which resulted in increased study costs. The decrease in the Brand Segment R&D expense is due to the completion, during fiscal 2004, of clinical studies primarily related to nebivolol, a product for the treatment of hypertension. These studies had been fully enrolled in the prior year. Selling and Marketing Selling and marketing expense for fiscal 2004 was $74.6 million compared to $65.6 million in fiscal 2003. As a percentage of revenues, selling and marketing expense approximated 5% in both years. Generic Segment selling and marketing expense for fiscal 2004 increased $0.5 million or 5% to $11.7 million from $11.2 million. Brand Segment selling and marketing expense increased $8.5 million or 16% to $62.9 million in fiscal 2004 from $54.5 million in fiscal 2003. This increase was primarily the result of pre-marketing costs associated with the upcoming launch of Apokyn. General and Administrative G&A expense was $127.0 million in fiscal 2004, an increase of $19.5 million or 18% from $107.4 million in fiscal 2003. G&A expenses approximated 9% of revenues in both years. The increase in G&A expense is the result of increased Corporate expenses, partially offset by lower expenses in the Generic Segment. Generic Segment G&A expense decreased $2.7 million or 12% to $18.7 million in fiscal 2004. Brand Segment G&A expenses remained constant at $11.0 million for fiscal years 2004 and 2003. Corporate G&A expense for fiscal 2004 was $97.3 million compared to $75.1 million in fiscal 2003, an increase of $22.2 million or 30%. This increase is primarily due to increased legal expenses related to ongoing as well as recently settled litigation. Successful defense of patent infringement claims, including Paragraph IV challenges, is an integral part of our ability to continue to deliver pharmaceutical products to the market. Litigation Settlements Net gains of $34.8 million were recorded in fiscal 2004 with respect to the settlement of various lawsuits. Of this, $12.5 million was related to a settlement reached with respect to the marketing and manufacturing of Zagam, and $10.2 million was related to a settlement reached with respect to mirtazapine. The remainder of the settlement primarily relates to future payments to be made to Mylan totaling $10.0 million from Mylan co-defendants in the lorazepam and clorazepate litigation. This $10.0 million represents a partial reimbursement of the settlement funds paid by Mylan toward the settlement announced in fiscal 2003. These additional payments were agreed to by the co-defendants, and the settlement received final approval from the judge overseeing the litigation during fiscal 2004. Other Income, Net Other income, net of other expenses, was $17.8 million in fiscal 2004 compared to $12.5 million in fiscal 2003. This increase of $5.3 million is primarily the result of a $5.0 million gain on the sale of an office building recorded in fiscal 2004, partially offset by a greater loss recorded on our investment in Somerset. In addition, fiscal 2003 included a $5.7 million impairment charge recorded on an investment which Mylan held in a foreign entity. 32 Table of Contents We own a 50% equity interest in Somerset and account for this investment using the equity method of accounting. The recorded loss in Somerset for fiscal 2004 was $7.1 million compared to a loss of $4.6 million in fiscal 2003. Additionally in fiscal 2004, Mylan received dividends totaling $10.0 million. Income Taxes The effective tax rate for fiscal 2004 was 34.7% compared to 36.1% for fiscal 2003. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the benefit of expansion tax credits received from certain states and other economic incentives awarded by the government of Puerto Rico. Liquidity and Capital Resources The Company primary source of liquidity continues to be cash flows from operating activities, which were $203.7 million for fiscal 2005. Working capital as of March 31, 2005, was $1.28 billion, an increase of $138.9 million from the balance at March 31, 2004. The majority of this increase was the result of higher marketable securities, and an increase in net accounts receivable and net deferred tax assets, partially offset by lower inventories, higher accounts payable and income taxes payable and a decrease in other current assets. The increase in accounts receivable at March 31, 2005, is primarily the result of sales of fentanyl which was launched during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. The increase in estimated sales allowances netted against accounts receivable also increased primarily as a result of the launch of fentanyl. See Application of Critical Accounting Policies for further discussion of estimated sales allowances. Net deferred tax assets increased primarily as a result of future tax benefits related to the increase in provisions for estimated sales allowances. The decrease in inventory is the result of lower inventories carried with respect to certain products, such as omeprazole, and is reflective of the corresponding decrease in revenues from these products. This decrease is also reflective of the overall increase in volume shipped during fiscal 2005, due in part to new product launches, primarily fentanyl. In the prior year, inventory at March 31, 2004, increased from March 31, 2003, due to new product launches and planned production increases in order to meet forecasted demand. The increase in accounts payable is the result of the change in the amount of outstanding checks in excess of cash in our primary disbursement accounts. See discussion of financing activities below. Income taxes payable increased from March 31, 2004, to March 31, 2005, primarily as a result of the timing of estimated tax payments. Other current assets decreased primarily as a result of the receipt of $10.0 million from the fiscal 2004 sale of the Company investment in a foreign entity, and the receipt of $17.0 million related to lawsuits settled in prior periods. In addition to the receipt of the $17.0 million from lawsuits settled in prior periods, during the first quarter of fiscal 2005, Mylan received approximately $35.0 million related to the settlement of certain patent litigation claims involving omeprazole. In fiscal 2005, Mylan paid $9.0 million to resolve all pending litigation with respect to paclitaxel. In fiscal 2004 payments of $32.6 million were made related to two lawsuits which were settled during fiscal 2003. Cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2005 was $174.9 million. Of the Company $2.1 billion of total assets at March 31, 2005, $778.7 million was held in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Investments in marketable securities consists of a variety of high credit quality debt securities, including U.S. government, state and local government and corporate obligations. These investments are highly liquid and available for working capital needs. As these instruments mature, the funds are generally reinvested in instruments with similar characteristics. Capital expenditures during fiscal 2005 were $90.7 million. These expenditures were incurred primarily with respect to the Company planned expansions. Due to the timing of the completion of certain phases of the Company previously announced expansion and ERP implementation, certain capital expenditures which had originally been forecasted for fiscal 2005, will now be expended in fiscal 2006. Additionally, the Company expects the majority of the expenditures related to the ERP implementation to occur in fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2007. Including the effect of these items, capital expenditures for fiscal 2006 are expected to be approximately $120 million. Cash used in financing activities was $2.6 million for fiscal 2005. Included in financing activities in the prior year was $133.1 million used to purchase shares of the Company stock under a stock repurchase program. This program was 33 Table of Contents completed on November 18, 2003. Also included in financing activities in fiscal 2005 was a $19.6 million change in the amount of outstanding checks in excess of cash in our primary disbursement accounts. The Company utilizes a cash management system under which uncleared checks in excess of the cash balance in the bank account at the end of the reporting period are shown as a book cash overdraft. The Company transfers cash on an as-needed basis to fund clearing checks. The Company does not incur any financing charges with respect to this arrangement. In the third quarter of fiscal 2004, the Company's Board of Directors voted to increase the quarterly dividend 35% to 3.0 cents per share. Dividend payments totaled $32.3 million during fiscal 2005. The Company is involved in various legal proceedings that are considered normal to its business (see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of such proceedings, an adverse outcome in any of these proceedings could materially affect the Company financial position and results of operations. The Company is actively pursuing, and is currently involved in, joint projects related to the development, distribution and marketing of both generic and brand products. Many of these arrangements provide for payments by the Company upon the attainment of specified milestones. While these arrangements help to reduce the financial risk for unsuccessful projects, fulfillment of specified milestones or the occurrence of other obligations may result in fluctuations in cash flows from operating activities. In order to provide additional operating leverage, if necessary, the Company maintains a revolving line of credit with a commercial bank providing for borrowings of up to $50.0 million (see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). As of March 31, 2005, no funds have been advanced under this line of credit. Additionally, the Company is continuously evaluating initiatives as a strategic part of its future growth, which may include; stock repurchase programs, and the potential acquisition of products, as well as companies. Consequently, the Company may utilize current cash reserves or incur additional indebtedness to finance any such strategic initiatives, which could impact future liquidity. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our contractual obligations at March 31, 2005 and the effect that such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods: Less than One - Three Three - Five As of March 31, 2005 Total One Year Years Years Thereafter (in thousands) Operating leases $ 13,977 $ 5,644 $ 7,513 $ 604 $ 216 Long-term obligations 19,325 1,821 5,463 3,642 8,399 Line of credit Letter of credit 775 775 $ 34,077 $ 8,240 $ 12,976 $ 4,246 $ 8,615 We lease certain real property under various operating lease arrangements that expire generally over the next four years. These leases generally provide us with the option to renew the lease at the end of the lease term. We have also entered into agreements to lease vehicles, which are typically 24 to 36 months, for use by our sales force and key employees. Long-term obligations, primarily deferred compensation, consist of the discounted future payments under individually negotiated agreements with certain key employees and directors. We maintain a revolving line of credit with a commercial bank. This line of credit expires on July 31, 2005 and allows Mylan to borrow up to $50.0 million on an unsecured basis, at an alternative base rate. At the Company option, it may elect an interest rate based on the published daily London Interbank Offered Rate by giving written notice to the lender. The agreement does not contain any significant financial covenants. At March 31, 2005 and 2004, we had no outstanding borrowings under this line of credit. In addition to the above, the Company has entered into various product licensing and development agreements. In some of these arrangements, we provide funding for the development of the product or to obtain rights to the use of the patent, through milestone payments, in exchange for marketing and distribution rights to the product. Because milestones represent 34 Table of Contents the completion of specific contractual events and it is uncertain if and when these milestones will be achieved, such contingencies have not been recorded on the Company consolidated balance sheet. In the event that all projects are successful, milestone and development payments of approximately $9.3 million would be paid. The Company periodically enters into licensing agreements with other pharmaceutical companies for the manufacture, marketing and/or sale of pharmaceutical products. These agreements generally call for the Company to pay a percentage of amounts earned from the sale of the product as a royalty. The Company does not have material financial guarantees or other contractual commitments that are reasonably likely to adversely affect liquidity. The Company does not have any special purpose entities or off-balance sheet financing arrangements. We have entered into employment and other agreements with certain executives that provide for compensation and certain other benefits. These agreements provide for severance payments under certain circumstances. Application of Critical Accounting Policies Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, which were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Included within these policies are certain policies which contain critical accounting estimates and, therefore, have been deemed to be critical accounting policies. Critical accounting estimates are those which require management to make assumptions about matters that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made and for which the use of different estimates, which reasonably could have been used, or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, could have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition, changes in financial condition or results of operations. The Company has identified the following to be its critical accounting policies: the determination of revenue provisions; and the impact of existing legal matters. These critical accounting policies affect each of the operating segments. Revenue Provisions Revenue is recognized for product sales upon shipment when title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer and when provisions for estimates, including discounts, rebates, promotional adjustments, price adjustments, returns, chargebacks, and other potential adjustments are reasonably determinable. Accruals for these provisions are presented in the Consolidated Financial Statements as reductions to net revenues and accounts receivable and within other current liabilities. Accounts receivable are presented net of allowances relating to these provisions, which were $349.4 million and $264.2 million at March 31, 2005 and 2004. Other current liabilities include $51.8 million and $28.2 million at March 31, 2005 and 2004, for certain rebates and other adjustments that are paid to indirect customers. The following is a rollforward of the most significant provisions for estimated sales allowances during fiscal year ended March 31, 2005: Checks/Credits Provisions Balance Issued Recorded in Balance March 31, 2004 to Third Parties Current Period March 31, 2005 Chargebacks $ 133,784 $ (860,343 ) $ 892,625 $ 166,066 Customer performance and promotions $ 37,611 $ (162,939 ) $ 195,130 $ 69,802 Returns $ 45,311 $ (35,955 ) $ 37,188 $ 46,544 The accrual for chargebacks increased primarily as a result of chargebacks related to sales of fentanyl in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 and continued price erosion on the Company existing portfolio. This increase was partially offset by certain customers reducing the amount of inventory they have on their shelves at year end compared to the prior year. No material amounts included in the provision for chargebacks recorded in the current period relate to prior periods. Direct rebates from sales of fentanyl and promotions offered to customers with respect to the fentanyl launch also accounted for the majority of the increase in the accrual for customer performance and promotions. 35 Table of Contents Provisions for estimated discounts, rebates, promotional and other credits require a lower degree of subjectivity and are less complex in nature, yet combined represent a significant portion of the overall provisions. These provisions are estimated based on historical payment experience, historical relationship to revenues, estimated customer inventory levels and contract terms. Such provisions are determinable due to the limited number of assumptions and consistency of historical experience. Others, such as price adjustments, returns and chargebacks, require management to make more subjective judgments and evaluate current market conditions. These provisions are discussed in further detail below. Price Adjustments Price adjustments, which include shelf stock adjustments, are credits issued to reflect decreases in the selling prices of our products. Shelf stock adjustments are based upon the amount of product that our customers have remaining in their inventories at the time of the price reduction. Decreases in our selling prices are discretionary decisions made by us to reflect market conditions. Amounts recorded for estimated price adjustments are based upon specified terms with direct customers, estimated launch dates of competing products, estimated declines in market price, and in the case of shelf stock adjustments, estimates of inventory held by the customer. In most cases, data with respect to the level of inventory held by the customer is obtained directly from certain of our largest customers. Additionally, internal estimates are prepared based upon historical buying patterns and estimated end user demand. Such information allows us to assess the impact that a price adjustment will have given the quantity of inventory on hand. We regularly monitor these and other factors and evaluate our reserves and estimates as additional information becomes available. Returns Consistent with industry practice, we maintain a return policy that allows our customers to return product within a specified period prior to and subsequent to the expiration date. Our estimate of the provision for returns is based upon our historical experience with actual returns, which is applied to the level of sales for the period that corresponds to the period during which our customers may return product. This period is known by us based on the shelf lives of our products at the time of shipment. Additionally, we consider factors such as levels of inventory in the distribution channel, product dating and expiration period, size and maturity of the market prior to a product launch, entrance in the market of additional generic competition, changes in formularies or launch of over the counter products, to name a few, and make adjustments to the provision for returns in the event that it appears that actual product returns may differ from our established reserves. We obtain data with respect to the level of inventory in the channel directly from certain of our largest customers. Although the introduction of additional generic competition does not give our customers the right to return product outside of our established policy, we do recognize that such competition could ultimately lead to increased returns. We analyze this on a case by case basis, when significant, and make adjustments to increase our reserve for product returns as necessary. Chargebacks The provision for chargebacks is the most significant and complex estimate used in the recognition of revenue. The Company markets products directly to wholesalers, distributors, retail pharmacy chains, mail order pharmacies and group purchasing organizations. The Company also markets products indirectly to independent pharmacies, managed care organizations, hospitals, nursing homes and pharmacy benefit management companies, collectively referred to as indirect customers. Mylan enters into agreements with its indirect customers to establish contract pricing for certain products. The indirect customers then independently select a wholesaler from which to actually purchase the products at these contracted prices. Alternatively, certain wholesalers may enter into agreements with indirect customers which establish contract pricing for certain products which the wholesalers provide. Under either arrangement, Mylan will provide credit to the wholesaler for any difference between the contracted price with the indirect party and the wholesaler invoice price. Such credit is called a chargeback, while the difference between the contracted price and the wholesaler invoice price is referred to as the chargeback rate. The provision for chargebacks is based on expected sell-through levels by our wholesaler customers to indirect customers, as well as estimated wholesaler inventory levels. For the latter, in most cases, inventory levels are obtained directly from certain of our largest wholesalers. Additionally, internal estimates are prepared based upon historical buying patterns and estimated end user demand. Such information allows us to estimate the potential chargeback that we may ultimately owe to our customers given the quantity of inventory on hand. We continually monitor our provision for chargebacks and evaluate our reserve and estimates as additional information becomes available. Legal Matters The Company is involved in various legal proceedings, some of which involve claims for substantial amounts. An estimate is made to accrue for a loss contingency relating to any of these legal proceedings if it is probable that a liability was incurred as of the date of the financial statements and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Because of the subjective nature inherent in assessing the outcome of litigation and because of the potential that an adverse outcome in a legal proceeding could have a material impact on the Company financial position or results of operations, such estimates are considered to be critical accounting estimates. After review, it was determined at March 31, 2005 that for each of the various legal proceedings in which we are involved, the conditions mentioned above were not met. The Company will 36 Table of Contents continue to evaluate all legal matters as additional information becomes available. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ( SFAS ) No. 123(R), Share-Based Payment. SFAS 123(R) establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods and services. Under SFAS 123(R), companies will no longer be able to account for share-based compensation transactions using the intrinsic method in accordance with APB No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees . Instead, companies will be required to account for such transactions using a fair-value method and to recognize compensation expense over the period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award. In April 2005, the SEC delayed the effective date of SFAS 123(R) to fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. Management is currently assessing the impact that adoption of this Statement will have on the Company Consolidated Financial Statements.
