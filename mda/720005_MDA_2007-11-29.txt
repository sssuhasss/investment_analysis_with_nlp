ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview The following Management Discussion and Analysis is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and the financial condition of the Company. Management Discussion and Analysis is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, the Company consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements. The Company results continue to be highly correlated to the direction of the U.S. equity markets and are subject to volatility due to changes in interest rates, valuation of financial instruments, economic and political trends and industry competition. During 2007, the market was impacted by rising energy prices, a housing market slowdown, a subprime lending collapse, a growing economy, a weakening US dollar and stable interest rates. The Company Private Client Group recruiting and retention of Financial Advisors was positively impacted by industry consolidation. RJBank benefited from the widening interest rate spreads and the availability of attractive loan purchases as a result of the subprime lending crisis. 15 Results of Operations - Total Company The Company currently operates through the following eight business segments: Private Client Group; Capital Markets; Asset Management; RJBank; Emerging Markets; Stock Loan/Borrow; Proprietary Capital and certain corporate activities in the Other segment. The following table presents consolidated and segment financial information for the Company for the years indicated: Year Ended September 30, September 30, September 30, 2007 2006 2005 (in 000's) Total Company Revenues $ 3,109,579 $ 2,645,578 $ 2,168,196 Pre-tax Earnings 392,224 342,066 247,971 Private Client Group Revenues 1,938,154 1,679,813 1,397,578 Pre-tax Earnings 219,864 168,519 102,245 Capital Markets Revenues 506,498 487,419 455,151 Pre-tax Earnings 68,966 78,221 77,333 Asset Management Revenues 234,875 207,821 179,845 Pre-tax Earnings 60,517 48,749 40,442 RJBank Revenues 279,572 114,692 45,448 Pre-tax Earnings 27,005 16,003 14,204 Emerging Markets Revenues 59,083 55,263 38,768 Pre-tax Earnings 3,640 2,857 5,927 Stock Loan/Borrow Revenues 68,685 59,947 31,876 Pre-tax Earnings 5,003 8,001 5,962 Proprietary Capital Revenues 8,280 17,312 10,952 Pre-tax Earnings 3,577 8,468 4,182 Other Revenues 14,432 23,311 8,578 Pre-tax Earnings (Loss) 3,652 11,248 (2,324) 16 Year ended September 30, 2007 Compared with the Year ended September 30, 2006 - Total Company The Company had record annual revenues and earnings for the fourth consecutive year, with 2007 total revenues surpassing $3 billion and net income surpassing $250 million. Revenues exceeded the prior year by 18% while net income exceeded the prior year by 17%. Net revenues were $2.6 billion, or up 11% over the prior year, thus positive operating leverage was realized. Non-interest expenses also rose by 11%. Once again, results were driven by an increase in net interest earnings, which were up 31%. All of the Company four major segments had higher revenues and three of the four had higher pre-tax income than in the prior year. Year ended September 30, 2006 Compared with the Year ended September 30, 2005 - Total Company The Company had record annual revenues and earnings for the third consecutive year, with net revenues surpassing $2.3 billion. Non-interest expenses rose by 12%, contrasted to a 15% increase in net revenues. Net income exceeded $200 million for the first time in the Company's history, up 42% from the prior year. All of the Company four major segments had higher revenues and pre-tax income than in the prior year, driven by a 36% increase in net interest earnings (see table below) combined with solid increases in investment advisory fees (14%) and securities commissions and fees (10%), a modest (6%) increase in investment banking revenues and an increase in financial service fees (33%). Total firm net revenues increased 15%, while pre-tax profits after consideration of minority interest were up 38% over the prior year.

Average interest-earning assets at RJBank increased 131% over the prior year. Average bank loan balances have doubled from $1.6 billion to $3.2 billion. This increase was funded by a second bulk transfer of client cash deposits of $1.3 billion in March 2007 and growth in new client cash balances which are a result of the positive recruiting results. Average customer margin balances grew modestly during 2007, thus the increased client cash balances in the firm Client Interest Program led to a significant increase in assets segregated pursuant to regulations. Net interest on the stock loan/borrow business declined 24%, due to decreased interest spreads despite slightly higher balances. Other interest revenue and expense include earnings on corporate cash, inventory balances, interest on overnight borrowings and the mortgage on the headquarters facility.

RJA added a net 59 employee Financial Advisors and increased average production per Financial Advisor 22% to $493,000, resulting in a 31% increase in RJA PCG securities commissions and fees. Average assets under management per RJA Financial Advisor increased 24% to $72 million. RJA continues to benefit from the industry consolidation and the resultant unrest and Financial Advisor turnover. Securities commissions and fees increased 10% in RJFS despite a 6% decline in the number of Financial Advisors, most of which was by design in the strategic upgrading initiative. The increased commission and fee revenue is the result of a 16% increase in average production to $316,000 per Financial Advisor. RJ Ltd 4% increase in number of Financial Advisors generated a 6.5% increase in securities commissions and fees. Financial service fees in the prior year included a one-time adjustment of approximately $10 million related to the change in accounting for IRA fees. Excluding this adjustment, financial service fees increased modestly over the prior year. Other revenue increased $9 million, or 12% over the prior year, as a result of increased mutual fund networking and educational and marketing support fees from mutual fund companies. Commission expense within PCG was up 14%, relatively proportional to the increase in commission revenues and fees of 15%. Administrative compensation, occupancy and business development expenses increased proportionately to net revenues. These increases include expenses associated with new branches, sales support staff, home office visits and account transfer fees. Information processing expenses rose only 4% and reflect the benefit of operating leverage despite continued investment in systems upgrades. The decrease in other expense is the result of lower legal costs and settlements as the last of the outstanding large cases related to the 2000 2002 market decline were settled in the prior year. Overall PCG margins increased by 16% over the prior year, reaching 12.6%. Year ended September 30, 2006 Compared with the Year ended September 30, 2005 Private Client Group The Private Client Group's results include a $130 million increase in commission and fee revenues. While commission and fee revenues increased in the PCG segment of all three broker-dealers, the increases were far more significant in RJA and RJ Ltd. where there has been an increase in the number of Financial Advisors due to successful recruiting. RJA added a net 65 employee Financial Advisors and increased the average production from $379,000 in fiscal 2005 to $404,000 in fiscal 2006. In addition, average assets under management per RJA Financial Advisor has increased to an all time high of $58 million from $50 million at September 2005. RJA has successfully focused on recruiting high-producing Financial Advisors and continued to benefit from industry consolidation. RJA commissions and fees increased 23%. RJ Ltd. added 20 employee Financial Advisors and 13 independent contractor Financial Advisors. RJ Ltd. commissions and fees increased 27%. The modest 5.7% increase in RJFS commissions and fees is primarily attributable to a $65.7 million, or 15.6%, increase in fee based business and mutual fund trailing commissions. PCG net interest earnings increased 36% over the prior fiscal year, a combined result of increased client margin balances (up 9%) and increased customer cash balances, on which a spread is earned. Net interest represented 65% of the segment's pre-tax earnings, down from 78% in fiscal 2005. Financial service fees in the PCG segment increased $26.6 million, or 40% over the prior year. The increase included a one-time adjustment of approximately $10 million related to a change from cash to accrual accounting for IRA fees. The increase in other revenue of $17.2 million is predominantly made up of increased mutual fund networking fees and the newly introduced educational and marketing support fee from mutual fund companies. Commission expenses increased 2% more than commission revenue, the result of an increased number of independent contractors (who receive higher payouts) in RJ Ltd, the advances associated with recruiting at RJA and higher payout levels to more productive Financial Advisors. Administrative and incentive compensation increased due to the increase in the segment profits and an increased number of support staff related to the growing number of Financial Advisors in RJA and increased compliance staff in RJFS. Business development expense increased as it includes advertising costs and increased travel and other expenses related to recruiting. Other expenses declined as prior years' expense included historically high legal costs and settlements related to the 2000 2002 market decline. PCG margins increased by more than 3% over the prior year, reaching 10.9%. The prior year was negatively impacted by the historically high legal costs and settlements, and the expense of the early stages of the independent contractor business in the UK and at RJ Ltd. 19 Results of Operations Capital Markets The following table presents consolidated financial information for the Capital Markets segment for the years indicated: Year Ended September 30, % Incr.

Commission revenue was down slightly, the net of a decline in equity commissions related to the decline in commissions generated by underwriting transactions, and an increase in fixed income commissions, a result of the increased volatility. Commissions generated by underwriting transactions reached a record $41 million in the prior year and were only $22 million in the current year. The increase in underwriting fees included increases of $3 million at RJA, despite a decline in the number of deals from 97 to 78, and $3 million at RJ Ltd. on 30 deals versus 29 in the prior year. Merger and acquisition fees were up $15 million, reaching an all time record level of $60 million for the year. During fiscal 2007, RJA closed 15 individual merger and acquisition transactions with fees in excess of $1 million. Trading profits were down 58% from the prior year, reflecting a particularly difficult fixed income trading environment during the fourth quarter. As credit issues drove fixed income product values down there was a flight to quality and the firm economic hedges (short positions in US Treasuries) contributed additional losses. Meanwhile, there were also increased losses in equity customer facilitations and OTC market making. Raymond James Tax Credit Fund ( RJTCF ) revenues increased 11% as they invested $375 million for institutional investors versus $277 million in the prior year. Interest revenue increased related to higher average fixed income inventory levels. 20 Expenses were generally in line with revenue growth with two exceptions. Communications and information processing increased predominantly due to increased costs associated with market information systems and software development costs. Other expense reflects a shift to the use of electronic and other non-exchange clearing methods and includes transaction related underwriting expenses incurred by RJTCF. Year ended September 30, 2006 Compared with the Year ended September 30, 2005 Capital Markets The Capital Markets segment revenues and pre-tax profits increased just slightly from the prior year record results. Commission revenues in the segment were flat, as a 37% decline in fixed income commissions was offset by the 13% increase in institutional equity commissions, the latter continuing to be fueled by an active new issue market. RJA equity market conditions remained strong, allowing RJA to complete 97 managed or co-managed domestic underwritings, just one short of the record 98 underwritings completed in fiscal 2005. RJ Ltd. completed a record 29 managed or co-managed underwritings, up nine from fiscal 2005. Merger and acquisition fees increased modestly from the prior year's record level, offsetting the decline in private placement fees. Equity Capital Market's most active strategic business units in fiscal 2006 were Energy, Technology, Financial Services and Real Estate. The $16 million increase in interest income, predominantly on RJA's fixed income inventories, was offset by an equal increase in interest expense to finance these inventories. Higher interest income and expenses were primarily the result of higher interest rates. RJTCF's revenues were up 19%, to $31.7 million, as RJTCF invested over $277 million for institutional investors in 78 real estate transactions compared to $250 million in 93 deals in fiscal 2005. Non-interest expense increased 3% over the prior year, with the most significant increase in other expense. This increase was due to increases within the RJTCF variable interest entities ( VIEs ), of which 99% is eliminated through minority interest.

New Financial Advisors bring additional client assets, a portion of which is often directed into an asset management alternative. In addition, both Eagle and Heritage have been successful in their efforts to increase their presence on outside broker-dealer platforms. Eagle retail sales to outside broker-dealers were 33% of their total 2007 sales, while Heritage were 78% of their total sales. Revenues in this segment increased 13% on a 17% increase in assets under management, as there continues to be some fee compression. Expenses increased only 10%, generating a 24% increase in pre-tax earnings and a 26% margin as a result of operating leverage. Money market fund balances declined as a result of the transfer of $1.3 billion to RJBank in March 2007. Year ended September 30, 2006 Compared with the Year ended September 30, 2005 - Asset Management Investment Advisory fees increased over $20 million, or 14%, on a 16% increase in assets under management. Increases in assets under management were positively impacted by the recruiting of RJA Financial Advisors. New Financial Advisors brought significant assets into the Company's asset management programs, particularly Eagle and Raymond James Consulting Services ("RJCS"). New managed assets brought in by RJA Financial Advisors totaled $3.9 billion for fiscal 2006, a 70% increase over $2.3 billion added in fiscal 2005. Eagle's total retail assets increased 19% over the prior year. Of Eagle's retail asset total, 35% were introduced by Financial Advisors outside the Raymond James system. Account cancellations exceeded sales in Eagle's institutional accounts due to the loss of a few significant accounts and the closing of the Institutional Growth division in September. RJCS offers 40 independent investment advisors to the Company's clients. Assets managed within the program increased 20% over the prior year. The Company's managed mutual fund product (Freedom) continued to experience significant growth (105%) as this concept continues to be embraced by clients and Financial Advisors. Heritage Asset Management's non-money market funds increased 19% with 65% of the sales through broker-dealers outside of the Raymond James family. Heritage money market accounts increased 4% despite the movement of just over $1 billion to RJBank sweep option during the year. Expenses in this segment increased $19 million (14%) with $8 million of that increase in compensation. The Compensation increase included increased salary expense, costs associated with closing Eagle's institutional growth division, and increased incentive compensation related to the 21% increase in pre-tax profits. The other notable increase in expense was a $6.2 million (19%) increase in investment advisory fees related to the growth in assets in accounts managed by independent investment advisors. 22 Results of Operations - RJBank The following table presents consolidated financial information for RJBank for the years indicated: Year Ended September 30, % Incr.

This, combined with organic growth from the influx of new client assets, resulted in a $2.6 billion increase in average deposit balances. This increase in average deposit balances provided the funding for the $1.6 billion increase in average loan balances. This increase was 38% purchased residential mortgage pools and 62% corporate loans, 98% of which are purchased interests in corporate loan syndications with the remainder originated by RJBank. As a result of this growth, RJBank net interest income increased 108% to $84.5 million. Due to robust loan growth, the associated allowance for loan losses that are established upon recording a new loan and making new unfunded commitments required a provision of over $32 million in 2007. Accordingly, RJBank pre-tax income increased only 69%. During periods of growth when new loans are originated or purchased, an allowance for loan losses is established for potential losses inherent in those new loans. Accordingly, a robust period of growth generally results in charges to earnings in that period, while the benefits of higher interest earnings are realized in later periods. Year ended September 30, 2006 Compared with the Year ended September 30, 2005 - RJBank Assets at RJBank grew a substantial $1.8 billion during the year. The increase was driven by a $1.7 billion increase in deposits, $1.3 billion of which were redirected from the Company Heritage Cash Trust or customer brokerage accounts, representing the introduction of a new sweep program for certain brokerage accounts. This alternative offers clients a money market equivalent interest rate and FDIC insurance. The Company intends to expand this offering over the next several years, transferring an additional $2 to $4 billion. During the year, RJBank deployed $1.3 billion of the increased deposits into loans. Purchased residential loan pools increased $700 million and corporate loans increased $600 million. This growth, combined with increased rates, generated an increase in net interest income of nearly $18 million. Pre-tax income increased only $1.8 million, due to the $13.8 million provision for loan loss associated with the increase in loans outstanding. 23 The following table presents average balance data and operating interest income and expense data for the Company's banking operations, as well as the related interest yields and rates and interest spread for the years indicated: Year Ended September 30, 2007 September 30, 2006 September 30, 2005 Operating Average Operating Average Operating Average Average Interest Yield/ Average Interest Yield/ Average Interest Yield/ Balance Inc./Exp.

Unsettled floating rate loans recognized in the loan portfolio earn compensation from the loan seller for the delayed settlement at the net margin over LIBOR. The funded equivalent yield of Loans, Net of Unearned Income above would be 6.58% for 2007 if the unsettled loans had earned at the full loan rate. Additionally, nonaccrual loans are included in the average loan balances. Income on such nonaccrual loans is recognized on a cash basis. Fee income on loans included in interest income for the years ended September 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively was $8.1 million, $3.5 million, and $0.7 million. (2) Negotiable Order of Withdrawal ( NOW ) account. (3) The decline in interest spreads is due to the growth in the deposit balances from two bulk transfers of client deposits of $1.3 billion each to RJBank, which were then invested over time. This process left significant cash balances invested at low rates until the cash could be deployed and used to purchase loans, depressing overall interest spreads. (4) RJBank has gone through a period of rapid loan growth and accordingly established allowances for loan losses for potential losses inherent in the loan portfolios. These charges to earnings have a negative impact on returns during periods of loan growth. 25 Increases and decreases in operating interest income and operating interest expense result from changes in average balances (volume) of interest-earning banking assets and liabilities, as well as changes in average interest rates. The following table shows the effect that these factors had on the interest earned on RJBank's interest-earning assets and the interest incurred on its interest-bearing liabilities. The effect of changes in volume is determined by multiplying the change in volume by the previous year's average yield/cost. Similarly, the effect of rate changes is calculated by multiplying the change in average yield/cost by the previous year's volume. Changes applicable to both volume and rate have been allocated proportionately. 2007 Compared to 2006 2006 Compared to 2005 Increase (Decrease) Due To Increase (Decrease) Due To Volume Rate Total Volume Rate Total (in 000 s) Interest Revenue Interest-Earning Banking Assets: Loans, Net of Unearned Income $ 93,992 $ 15,601 $ 109,593 $ 37,190 $ 21,013 $ 58,203 Reverse Repurchase Agreements 40,189 (248) 39,941 6,497 - 6,497 Agency Mortgage Backed Securities 2,092 1,161 3,253 (735) 3,007 2,272 Non-agency Collateralized Mortgage Obligations 11,285 372 11,657 554 389 943 Other Government Agency Obligations (404) - (404) 404 - 404 Corporate Debt and Asset Backed Securities (499) - (499) 214 176 390 Money Market Funds, Cash and Cash Equivalents 723 203 926 (754) 583 (171) FHLB Stock (318) 34 (284) 309 201 510 Total Interest-Earning Banking Assets $ 147,060 $ 17,123 $ 164,183 $ 43,679 $ 25,369 $ 69,048 Interest Expense Interest-Bearing Banking Liabilities: Retail Deposits: Certificates Of Deposit $ (1,227) $ 1,377 150 $ 2,714 $ 1,581 $ 4,295 Money Market, Savings and NOW Accounts 103,372 25,055 128,427 10,272 29,000 39,272 FHLB Advances (8,577) 218 (8,359) 6,960 982 7,942 Total Interest-Bearing Banking Liabilities 93,568 26,650 120,218 19,946 31,563 51,509 Change in Net Operating Interest Income $ 53,492 $ (9,527) $ 43,965 $ 23,733 $ (6,194) $ 17,539 26 Results of Operations Emerging Markets Year Ended September 30, % Incr.

Securities commissions declined in Turkey, increased in Argentina, and the joint venture in India generated $2 million in commissions in fiscal 2006 whereas none were included in fiscal 2007 due to the Company sale of its interest in this joint venture early in 2007. Investment banking revenues were flat. Trading profits increased $3.5 million in Argentina, stemming from a large volume of ADR trades. Other income includes the $2.5 million gain on the sale of the Company interest in its joint venture in India. The $2 million increase in expense is predominantly related to the accrual of estimated tax liabilities in Turkey. Year ended September 30, 2006 Compared with the Year ended September 30, 2005 Emerging Markets This segment consists of the results of the Company joint ventures in India, Argentina, Uruguay and Turkey. Securities commissions increased $9 million or 31% over the prior year. The vast majority of this increase was in the Company joint venture in Turkey. Investment banking revenues were $2.7 million, primarily from a single large Latin American underwriting fee. Investment Advisory fees declined as the Company generated $1 million less in asset management fees in India. The $20 million increase in expense is made up predominantly of a $10 million increase in compensation related to increased revenues and increased other expense related to the accrual of an estimated tax liability in Turkey.

The Company stock loan balances are predominantly the result of a matched-book however, box loan/borrow balances are also carried. As the Company stock loan business is predominantly a matched-book business, stock borrow balances were similar. Average spreads decreased from 2.0% in fiscal 2006 to 0.5% in 2007, resulting in a 24% decrease in net interest income and a 37% decrease in pre-tax profits.

Statement of Financial Condition Analysis The Company statement of financial condition consists primarily of cash and cash equivalents (a large portion of which are segregated for the benefit of customers), receivables and payables. The items represented in the statement of financial condition are primarily liquid in nature, providing the Company with flexibility in financing its business. Total assets of $16.3 billion at September 30, 2007 were up approximately 41% over September 30, 2006. Most of this increase is due to the significant increases in reverse repurchase agreements, brokerage client cash deposits (leading to a similar increase in segregated cash balances on the asset side), and growth of RJBank, with the increased loan balances being largely funded by deposits. RJBank loan balances increased significantly as the Company continued to increase its use of a newly introduced bank sweep offering to brokerage customers. The Company initiated the first phase of this option in July 2006 and the second phase took place in March 2007. The Company plans to continue to expand use of this offering for the next several years, which will result in continued growth in RJBank balances. The other significant increase in assets was in Available For Sale Securities. Trade and Other Payables increased $311.9 million from the prior year primarily due to RJBank purchases of $300.6 million in syndicated loans which were not settled as of September 30, 2007. The broker-dealer gross assets and liabilities, including trading inventory, stock loan/borrow, receivables and payables from/to brokers, dealers and clearing organizations and clients fluctuate with the Company's business levels and overall market conditions. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash provided by operating activities during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2007 was approximately $436.6 million, primarily attributable to the increase in brokerage client deposits (directly correlated to the increase in segregated assets), an increase in payables associated with the Company stock loan/borrowed business, an increase in payables to broker-dealers and clearing organizations, an increase in securities sold under agreements to repurchase, and an increase in trading instruments sold but not yet purchased. This was partially offset by an increase in segregated assets, and an increase in receivables from brokerage clients. Investing activities used $2.9 billion, which is primarily due to activity at RJBank, including loans originated and purchased, purchases of securities under agreements to resell, and purchases of available for sale securities. This was partially offset by loan repayments at RJBank and maturations and repayments of available for sale securities. Financing activities provided $2.7 billion, the result of an increase in deposits at RJBank and cash provided from the exercise of stock options and employee stock purchases. This was partially offset by the payment of cash dividends and the repayments of borrowings. At September 30, 2007 and September 30, 2006, the Company had loans payable of $122.6 million and $141.6 million, respectively. The balance at September 30, 2007 is comprised of a $65 million loan for its home-office complex, $55 million in Federal Home Loan Bank advances (RJBank), and various short-term borrowings totaling $2.6 million (used to fund increased levels of trading instruments). 29 In addition, the Company and its subsidiaries have the following lines of credit: RJF has a committed $200 million line of credit, RJA has uncommitted bank lines of credit aggregating $1.035 billion with commercial banks, Raymond James Credit Corporation has a line of credit for $25 million, and RJ Ltd. has a CDN$40 million uncommitted line of credit (see Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the Company's lines of credit). There were no outstanding balances against these lines of credit at September 30, 2007. The Company committed $200 million line of credit is subject to a 0.125% per annum facility fee. RJBank has $55.0 million in FHLB advances outstanding at September 30, 2007, which are comprised of one short-term, fixed rate advance and several long-term, fixed rate advances. RJBank had $1.32 billion in credit available from the FHLB at September 30, 2007. During the three months ended June 30, 2007, RJA entered into a $500 million uncommitted tri-party repurchase agreement line of credit. Under this agreement, the Company pledges certain of its trading inventory as collateral against borrowings on this line. The required market value of the collateral is generally 102% of the cash borrowed. The rate is set each day at 25 basis points over the opening Fed Funds rate and this agreement can be terminated by any party on any business day. Under this agreement, there were secured short-term borrowings of $195,000,000 outstanding at September 30, 2007 which are included in Securities Sold Under Agreement to Repurchase. The Company joint ventures in Turkey and Argentina have multiple settlement lines of credit. The Company has guaranteed certain of these settlement lines of credit as follows: four in Turkey totaling $22.5 million and one in Argentina for $3 million. At September 30, 2007, there were no outstanding balances on the settlement lines in Argentina or Turkey. At September 30, 2007, the aggregate unsecured settlement lines of credit available were $76.5 million, and there were outstanding balances of $2.7 million on these lines. The Company has also from time to time authorized performance guarantees for the completion of trades with counterparties in Argentina and Turkey. At September 30, 2007, there were no outstanding performance guarantees in Argentina or Turkey. As of September 30, 2007, the Company's liabilities are comprised primarily of brokerage client payables of $5.7 billion at the broker-dealer subsidiaries and deposits of $5.6 billion at RJBank, as well as deposits held on stock loan transactions of $1.3 billion. The Company primarily acts as an intermediary in stock loan/borrow transactions. As a result, the liability associated with the stock loan transactions is related to the $1.3 billion receivable comprised of the Company's cash deposits for stock borrowed transactions. To meet its obligations to clients, the Company has approximately $4.8 billion in cash and segregated assets. The Company also has client brokerage receivables of $1.7 billion and $4.7 billion in loans at RJBank. The Company will continue its implementation of a new cash sweep option available to its clients from RJBank. This new cash sweep option will require substantial capital to be contributed to RJBank to meet regulatory requirements, and therefore may require the Company to infuse an additional $150 to $200 million over the next several years for this purpose. As of September 30, 2007, RJBank had not settled the purchases of $300.6 million in syndicated loans. These loans are expected to be settled during the three months ended December 31, 2007. The Company has committed a total of $46.6 million, in amounts ranging from $200,000 to $2 million, to 41 different independent venture capital or private equity partnerships. As of September 30, 2007, the Company has invested $30.4 million of that amount and has received $27 million in distributions. The Company expects to increase its net investment in external private equity funds up to $50 million. Additionally, the Company is the general partner in two internally sponsored private equity limited partnerships to which it has committed $14 million. Of that amount, the Company has invested $12.2 million and has received $8.6 million in distributions as of September 30, 2007. The Company Board of Directors approved the use of up to $200 million in mezzanine financing to facilitate investment banking transactions. As of September 30, 2007, the Company had not utilized this investment facility. During the first quarter of fiscal year 2008, the Company entered into a credit agreement and pursuant to this agreement, the Company funded a $37.5 million loan participation. The Board of Directors also approved the use of up to $50 million for investment in proprietary merchant banking opportunities. As of September 30, 2007, the Company has invested $13.1 million. Management has been authorized by the Board of Directors to repurchase its common stock at their discretion for general corporate purposes. There is no formal stock repurchase plan at this time. In May 2004 the Board authorized the repurchase of up to $75 million of shares. As of September 30, 2007 the unused portion of this authorization was $65.4 million. The Company has committed to lend to or guarantee obligations of its wholly owned subsidiary, RJTCF, of up to $100 million upon request, subject to certain limitations as well as annual review and renewal. RJTCF borrows in order to invest in partnerships which purchase and develop properties qualifying for tax credits. These investments in project partnerships are then sold to various tax credit funds, which have third party investors, and for which RJTCF serves as the managing member or general partner. RJTCF typically sells these investments within 90 days of their acquisition, and the proceeds from the sales are used to repay RJTCF borrowings. Additionally, RJTCF may make short-term loans or advances to project partnerships on behalf of the tax credit funds in which it serves as managing member or general partner. At September 30, 2007, cash funded to invest in either loans or investments in project partnerships was $38.7 million. In addition, at September 30, 2007, RJTCF is committed to additional future fundings of $6.1 million related to project partnerships that have not yet been sold to various tax credit funds. In September 2007, Sirchie Acquisition Company, LLC ( SAC ), a 100% owned indirect subsidiary of the Company, entered into two agreements. Under the Stock Purchase Agreement SAC will acquire 51% of the common stock of Law Enforcement Associates Corporation from two sellers. Under the Stock and Asset Purchase Agreement with several sellers, SAC will acquire substantially all of the business, assets, and properties of Sirchie Finger Print Laboratories, Inc., the assets or stock of several other companies and certain real estate. SAC and sellers negotiated a single purchase price for all of the items to be acquired under the two agreements. At closing, one of the sellers will become a member of SAC. The Company share of the purchase price obligation is approximately $50 million. The closing of the two agreements is expected to occur before January 31, 2008. 30 The Company believes its existing assets, which are highly liquid in nature, together with funds generated from operations, should provide adequate funds for continuing operations. The Company is the lessor in a leveraged commercial aircraft transaction with Continental Airlines, Inc. ( Continental ). The Company's ability to realize its expected return is dependent upon this airline ability to fulfill its lease obligation. In the event that this airline defaults on its lease commitment and the Trustee for the debt holders is unable to re-lease or sell the plane with adequate terms, the Company would suffer a loss of some or all of its investment. The value of the Company leveraged lease with Continental was approximately $9.9 million as of September 30, 2007. The Company's equity investment represented 20% of the aggregate purchase price; the remaining 80% was funded by public debt issued in the form of equipment trust certificates. The residual value of the aircraft at the end of the lease term of approximately 17 years is projected to be 15% of the original cost. This lease expires in May 2014. Although Continental remains current on its lease payments to the Company, the inability of Continental to make its lease payments, or the termination or modification of the lease through a bankruptcy proceeding, could result in the write-down of the Company's investment and the acceleration of certain income tax payments. The Company continues to monitor this lessee for specific events or circumstances that would increase the likelihood of a default on Continental obligations under this lease. The Company was also the lessor in a leveraged commercial aircraft transaction with Delta Air Lines, Inc. ( Delta ). Delta filed for bankruptcy protection on September 14, 2005. Accordingly, the Company recorded a $6.5 million pre-tax charge in 2005 to fully reserve the balance of its investment in the leveraged lease of an aircraft to Delta. The Company had taken a $4 million pre-tax charge in 2004 to partially reserve for this investment. No amount of these charges represented a cash expenditure. During the second quarter of fiscal 2007, the Company sold its interest in the Delta transaction for $2 million, which was recognized as a pre-tax gain within Other Revenue. Upon closing, certain income tax obligations of approximately $8.5 million were accelerated and paid during the quarter. These tax payments did not impact net earnings, as these amounts were previously recorded as deferred tax liabilities. The Company Turkish affiliate was assessed for the year 2001 approximately $7.6 million by the Turkish tax authorities. This affiliate is vigorously contesting most aspects of this assessment and has filed an appeal with the Turkish Counsel of State. A significant portion of the matters at issue involved the activities of an employee terminated in 2004. Audits of 2002 through 2004 are anticipated and their outcome is unknown in light of the change in methodology from the prior year audit and the pending litigation. As such, the potential tax liability combined for these subsequent years could range from a few hundred thousand dollars to $7.5 million. As of September 30, 2007, this affiliate had total capital of approximately $12.2 million, of which the Company owns approximately 73%. The Company's broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to requirements of the SEC and the IDA relating to liquidity and capital standards. The domestic broker-dealer subsidiaries of the Company are subject to the requirements of the Uniform Net Capital Rule (Rule 15c3-1) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. RJA, a member firm of FINRA, is also subject to the rules of FINRA, whose requirements are substantially the same. Rule 15c3-1 requires that aggregate indebtedness, as defined, not exceed 15 times net capital, as defined. Rule 15c3-1 also provides for an alternative net capital requirement , which RJA, RJFS, and HFD have elected. It requires that minimum net capital, as defined, be equal to the greater of $250,000 or two percent of Aggregate Debit Items arising from client transactions. FINRA may require a member firm to reduce its business if its net capital is less than four percent of Aggregate Debit Items and may prohibit a member firm from expanding its business and declaring cash dividends if its net capital is less than five percent of Aggregate Debit Items. RJA, RJFS, and HFD all had net capital in excess of minimum requirements as of September 30, 2007. RJ Ltd. is subject to the Minimum Capital Rule (By-Law No. 17 of the IDA) and the Early Warning System (By-Law No. 30 of the IDA). The Minimum Capital Rule requires that every member shall have and maintain at all times Risk Adjusted Capital greater than zero calculated in accordance with Form 1 (Joint Regulatory Financial Questionnaire and Report) and with such requirements as the Board of Directors of the IDA may from time to time prescribe. Insufficient Risk Adjusted Capital may result in suspension from membership in the stock exchanges or the IDA. The Early Warning System is designed to provide advance warning that a member firm is encountering financial difficulties. This system imposes certain sanctions on members who are designated in Early Warning Level 1 or Level 2 according to its capital, profitability, liquidity position, frequency of designation or at the discretion of the IDA. Restrictions on business activities and capital transactions, early filing requirements, and mandated corrective measures are sanctions that may be imposed as part of the Early Warning System. RJ Ltd. was not in Early Warning Level 1 or Level 2 during fiscal 2007 or 2006. RJBank is subject to various regulatory and capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory - and possibly additional discretionary - actions by regulators. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, RJBank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of RJBank's assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. RJBank's capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings, and other factors. Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require RJBank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of Total and Tier I Capital (as defined in the regulations) to risk-weighted assets (as defined). Management believes, as of September 30, 2007, that the Bank meets all capital adequacy requirements to which it is subject. Critical Accounting Policies The Company financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The following is a summary of the Company critical accounting policies. For a full description of these and other accounting policies, see Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company believes that of its significant accounting policies, those described below involve a high degree of judgment and complexity. These critical accounting policies require estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses reported in the consolidated financial statements. Due to their nature, estimates involve judgments based upon available information. Actual results or amounts could differ from estimates and the difference could have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. Therefore, understanding these policies is important in understanding the reported results of operations and the financial position of the Company. 31 Valuation of Securities and Other Assets Trading instruments and Available for sale securities are reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value. In accordance with SFAS 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities , unrealized gains and losses related to these financial instruments are reflected in net income or other comprehensive income, depending on the underlying purpose of the instrument. The following table presents the Company trading instruments and available for sale securities segregated into trading securities (i.e., non-derivative), derivative contracts, and available for sale securities: September 30, 2007 Financial Instruments Owned at Fair Value Financial Instruments Sold but not yet Purchased at Fair Value (in 000 s) Trading Securities $ 437,158 $ 141,284 Derivative Contracts 30,603 8,445 Available for Sale Securities 569,952 - Total $ 1,037,713 $ 149,729 Trading Securities, Available for Sale Securities and Derivative Contracts When available, the Company uses prices from independent sources such as listed market prices, or broker or dealer price quotations to derive the fair value of the instruments. For investments in illiquid, privately held or other securities that do not have readily determinable fair values, the Company uses estimated fair values as determined by management. Fair values for derivative contracts are obtained from pricing models that consider current market and contractual prices for the underlying financial instruments, as well as time value and yield curve or volatility factors underlying the positions. The following table presents the carrying value of trading securities, available for sale securities, and derivative contracts for which fair value is measured based on quoted prices or other independent sources versus those for which fair value is determined by management: September 30, 2007 Financial Instruments Owned at Fair Value Financial Instruments Sold but not yet Purchased at Fair Value (in 000 s) Fair Value Based on Quoted Prices and Independent Sources $ 1,003,543 $ 141,284 Fair Value Determined by Management 34,170 8,445 Total $ 1,037,713 $ 149,729 Investment in Leveraged Leases The Company is the lessor in a leveraged commercial aircraft transaction with Continental. The Company's ability to realize its expected return is dependent upon this airline ability to fulfill its lease obligation. In the event that this airline defaults on its lease commitment and the Trustee for the debt holders is unable to re-lease or sell the plane with adequate terms, the Company would suffer a loss of some or all of its investment. The value of the Company leveraged lease with Continental was approximately $9.9 million as of September 30, 2007. The Company's equity investment represented 20% of the aggregate purchase price; the remaining 80% was funded by public debt issued in the form of equipment trust certificates. The residual value of the aircraft at the end of the lease term of approximately 17 years is projected to be 15% of the original cost. This lease expires in May 2014. Although Continental remains current on its lease payments to the Company, the inability of Continental to make its lease payments, or the termination or modification of the lease through a bankruptcy proceeding, could result in the write-down of the Company's investment and the acceleration of certain income tax payments. The Company continues to monitor this lessee for specific events or circumstances that would increase the likelihood of a default on Continental obligations under this lease. The Company was also the lessor in a leveraged commercial aircraft transaction with Delta. Delta filed for bankruptcy protection on September 14, 2005. Accordingly, the Company recorded a $6.5 million pre-tax charge in 2005 to fully reserve the balance of its investment in the leveraged lease of an aircraft to Delta. The Company had taken a $4 million pre-tax charge in 2004 to partially reserve for this investment. No amount of these charges represented a cash expenditure. During the second quarter of fiscal 2007, the Company sold its interest in the Delta transaction for $2 million, which was recognized as a pre-tax gain within Other Revenue. Upon closing, certain income tax obligations of approximately $8.5 million were accelerated and paid during the quarter. These tax payments did not impact net earnings, as these amounts were previously recorded as deferred tax liabilities. 32 Goodwill Goodwill is related to the acquisitions of Roney & Co. (now part of RJA) and Goepel McDermid, Inc. (now called Raymond James Ltd.). This goodwill, totaling $63 million, was allocated to the reporting units within the Private Client Group and Capital Markets segments pursuant to SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets . Goodwill represents the excess cost of a business acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired. In accordance with this pronouncement, indefinite-life intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. Rather, they are subject to impairment testing on an annual basis, or more often if events or circumstances indicate there may be impairment. This test involves assigning tangible assets and liabilities, identified intangible assets and goodwill to reporting units and comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount. If the fair value is less than the carrying amount, a further test is required to measure the amount of the impairment. When available, the Company uses recent, comparable transactions to estimate the fair value of the respective reporting units. The Company calculates an estimated fair value based on multiples of revenues, earnings, and book value of comparable transactions. However, when such comparable transactions are not available or have become outdated, the Company uses discounted cash flow scenarios to estimate the fair value of the reporting units. As of September 30, 2007, goodwill had been allocated to the Private Client Group of RJA, and both the Private Client Group and Capital Markets segments of Raymond James Limited ( RJ Ltd. ). As of the most recent impairment test, the Company determined that the carrying value of the goodwill for each reporting unit had not been impaired. However, changes in current circumstances or business conditions could result in an impairment of goodwill. As required, the Company will continue to perform impairment testing on an annual basis or when an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. Reserves The Company recognizes liabilities for contingencies when there is an exposure that, when fully analyzed, indicates it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. When a range of probable loss can be estimated, the Company accrues the most likely amount; if not determinable, the Company accrues at least the minimum of the range of probable loss. The Company records reserves related to legal proceedings in Trade and Other Payables. Such reserves are established and maintained in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard ("SFAS") No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies", and Financial Interpretation No. 14, Reasonable Estimation of the Amount of a Loss . The determination of these reserve amounts requires significant judgment on the part of management. Management considers many factors including, but not limited to: the amount of the claim; the amount of the loss in the client's account; the basis and validity of the claim; the possibility of wrongdoing on the part of an employee of the Company; previous results in similar cases; and legal precedents and case law. Each legal proceeding is reviewed with counsel in each accounting period and the reserve is adjusted as deemed appropriate by management. Lastly, each case is reviewed to determine if it is probable that insurance coverage will apply, in which case the reserve is reduced accordingly. Any change in the reserve amount is recorded in the consolidated financial statements and is recognized as a charge/credit to earnings in that period. The Company also records reserves or allowances for doubtful accounts related to client receivables and loans. Client receivables at the broker-dealers are generally collateralized by securities owned by the brokerage clients. Therefore, when a receivable is considered to be impaired, the amount of the impairment is generally measured based on the fair value of the securities acting as collateral, which is measured based on current prices from independent sources such as listed market prices or broker-dealer price quotations. Client loans at RJBank are generally collateralized by real estate or other property. RJBank provides for both an allowance for losses in accordance with SFAS No. 5 and a reserve for individually impaired loans in accordance with SFAS No. 114, Accounting by a Creditor for Impairment of a Loan . The calculation of the SFAS No. 5 allowance is subjective as management segregates the loan portfolio into different homogeneous classes and assigns each class an allowance percentage based on the perceived risk associated with that class of loans. During the fiscal year, RJBank re-evaluated and implemented changes to the loan loss reserve methodology in conjunction with a revision to the corporate loan grading process. The new loan grading process was revised and expanded to provide more specific and detailed risk measurement across the corporate loan portfolio. The factors taken into consideration when assigning the reserve percentage to each reserve category include estimates of borrower default probabilities and collateral values; trends in delinquencies; volume and terms; changes in geographic distribution, lending policies, local, regional, and national economic conditions; concentrations of credit risk and past loss history. In addition, the Company provides for potential losses inherent in RJBank unfunded lending commitments using the criteria above, further adjusted for an estimated probability of funding. For individual loans identified as impaired, RJBank measures impairment based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate, the loan's observable market price, or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. At September 30, 2007, the amortized cost of all RJBank loans was $4.7 billion and an allowance for loan losses of $47 million was recorded against that balance. The total allowance for loan losses, including $6.8 million in reserves for off-balance sheet exposures maintained in Trade and Other Payables, is equal to 1.15% of the amortized cost of the loan portfolio. 33 The following table allocates RJBank allowance for loan losses by loan category: September 30, 2007 September 30, 2006 September 30, 2005 September 24, 2004 September 26, 2003 ($ in 000 s) Commercial Loans: Allowance $ 4,471 $ 3,663 $ 1,574 $ 1,372 $ 1,172 Total Commercial Loans as a % of Loans Receivable 7% 12% 14% 18% 17% Real Estate Construction Loans: Allowance $ 2,121 $ 548 $ 567 $ 383 $ 102 Total Real Estate Construction Loans as a % of Loans Receivable 3% 2% 3% 5% 2% Commercial Real Estate Loans: Allowance $ 35,766 $ 10,603 $ 2,878 $ 826 $ 602 Total Commercial Real Estate Loans as a % of Loans Receivable 49% 28% 14% 11% 12% Residential Mortgage Loans: Allowance $ 4,659 $ 3,878 $ 2,537 $ 5,044 $ 4,006 Total Residential Mortgage Loans as a % of Loans Receivable 41% 58% 69% 66% 69% Consumer Loans: Allowance $ 5 $ 2 $ 37 $ 17 $ 28 Total Consumer Loans as a % of Loans Receivable 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% Total: Allowance $ 47,022 $ 18,694 $ 7,593 $ 7,642 $ 5,910 % of Total Loans Receivable 100% 100% 100% 100% 100% The Company also makes loans or pays advances to Financial Advisors, primarily for recruiting and retention purposes. The Company provides for an allowance for doubtful accounts based on an evaluation of the Company ability to collect such receivables. The Company ongoing evaluation includes the review of specific accounts of Financial Advisors no longer associated with the Company and the Company historical collection experience. At September 30, 2007 the receivable from Financial Advisors was $115.1 million, which is net of an allowance of $3.8 million for estimated uncollectibility. Income Taxes SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes , establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes. The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Company financial statements or tax returns. Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Company financial statements or tax returns. Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact the Company financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. Effects of recently issued accounting standards, not yet adopted In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes ( FIN 48 ), which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109. FIN 48 establishes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. This interpretation uses a two-step process to determine the amount of a tax benefit to record for a tax position if it is more likely than not to be sustained. The amount of the benefit is then measured to be the highest tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. This interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. The Company will be required to adopt FIN No. 48 as of October 1, 2007. The Company does not expect this interpretation to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2008. 34 In July 2006, the FASB issued Staff Position ( FSP ) No. FAS 13-2, Accounting for a Change or Projected Change in the Timing of Cash Flows Relating to Income Taxes Generated by a Leveraged Lease Transaction ( FSP FAS 13-2 ). This FSP addresses how a change in the timing of cash flows relating to income taxes generated by a leveraged lease transaction affects the accounting by a lessor for that lease. FSP FAS 13-2 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006 (October 1, 2007 for the Company). The Company does not expect this FSP to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2008. In September 2006, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in the Current Year Financial Statements ( SAB 108 ). SAB 108 addresses how the effects of prior year uncorrected misstatements should be considered when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements. SAB 108 requires an entity to quantify misstatements using a balance sheet and income statement approach and to evaluate whether either approach results in quantifying an error that is material in light of relevant quantitative and qualitative factors. The guidance is effective for annual financial statements covering the first fiscal year ending after November 15, 2006. This guidance did not have an impact on the Company consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2007. In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, Fair Value Measurements ( SFAS 157 ). SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair-value measurements required under other accounting pronouncements but does not change existing guidance as to whether or not an instrument is carried at fair value. SFAS 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 (October 1, 2008 for the Company), and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company does not expect SFAS 157 to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Company. In February 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities ( SFAS 159 ). SFAS 159 allows companies to elect to follow fair value accounting for certain financial assets and liabilities on an instrument by instrument basis. SFAS 159 is applicable only to certain financial instruments and is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 (October 1, 2008 for the Company). The Company has not yet completed its assessment of what impact, if any, SFAS 159 will have on its consolidated financial statements. In April 2007, the FASB issued Staff Position FIN No. 39-1, "Amendment of FASB Interpretation No. 39." FSP FIN No. 39-1 defines "right of setoff" and specifies what conditions must be met for a derivative contract to qualify for this right of setoff. FSP FIN No. 39-1 also addresses the applicability of a right of setoff to derivative instruments and clarifies the circumstances in which it is appropriate to offset amounts recognized for those instruments in the statement of financial position. In addition, this FSP permits offsetting of fair value amounts recognized for multiple derivative instruments executed with the same counterparty under a master netting arrangement and fair value amounts recognized for the right to reclaim cash collateral (a receivable) or the obligation to return cash collateral (a payable) arising from the same master netting arrangement as the derivative instruments. This interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 (October 1, 2008 for the Company), with early application permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of FSP FIN No. 39-1 will have on its consolidated financial statements. In May 2007, the FASB issued FSP FIN No. 46R-7, "Application of FASB Interpretation No. 46(R) to Investment Companies." FSP FIN No. 46R-7 amends the scope of the exception to FIN 46R to state that investments accounted for at fair value in accordance with the specialized accounting guidance in the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants ("AICPA") Audit and Accounting Guide, Investment Companies, are not subject to consolidation under FIN 46R. This interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2007 (October 1, 2008 for the Company). The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of FSP FIN No. 46R-7 will have on its consolidated financial statements. In June 2007, the Accounting Standards Executive Committee of the AICPA issued Statement of Position ("SOP") 07-1, "Clarification of the Scope of the Audit and Accounting Guide Investment Companies and Accounting by Parent Companies and Equity Method Investors for Investments in Investment Companies." This SOP provides guidance for determining whether an entity is within the scope of the AICPA Audit and Accounting Guide Investment Companies (the "Guide"). Additionally, it provides guidance as to whether a parent company or an equity method investor can apply the specialized industry accounting principles of the Guide (referred to as investment company accounting). This SOP is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2007 (October 1, 2008 for the Company), with early application encouraged. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of SOP 07-1 will have on its consolidated financial statements. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Information concerning the Company's off balance sheet arrangements are included in Note 20 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Such information is hereby incorporated by reference. 35 Contractual Obligations The Company has contractual obligations to make future payments in connection with its short and long-term debt, non-cancelable lease agreements, partnership investments, commitments to extend credit, loans purchased but not settled, underwriting commitments and a naming rights agreement (see Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the Company's commitments). The following table sets forth these contractual obligations by fiscal year: Total 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter (in 000 s) Long-Term Debt $ 119,955 $ 7,731 $ 2,891 $ 8,060 $48,239 $ 3,429 $ 49,605 Variable Interest Entities Loans Payable (1) 116,479 13,839 13,267 12,720 12,748 13,036 50,869 Short-Term Debt 2,685 2,685 - - - - - Operating Leases 100,453 28,711 22,249 19,327 12,498 8,811 8,857 Investments Private Equity Partnerships (2) 21,400 21,400 - - - - - Certificates of Deposit 239,534 128,032 51,703 30,323 21,960 7,516 - Commitments to Extend Credit - RJBank (3) 1,757,541 1,757,541 - - - - - RJBank Loans Purchased, Not Yet Settled 300,644 300,644 - - - - - Commitments to Real Estate Partnerships (4) 11,200 11,200 - - - - - Underwriting Commitments 11,794 11,794 - - - - - Naming Rights for Raymond James Stadium 30,089 3,152 3,278 3,409 3,545 3,687 13,018 Total $2,711,774 $2,286,729 $93,388 $73,839 $98,990 $36,479 $122,349 (1) Loans which are non-recourse to the Company. See Notes 6 and 10 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. (2) The Company has committed a total of $46.6 million, in amounts ranging from $200,000 to $2 million, to 41 different independent venture capital or private equity partnerships. As of September 30, 2007, the Company has invested $30.4 million of that amount and has received $27 million in distributions. Additionally, the Company is the general partner in two internally sponsored private equity limited partnerships to which it has committed $14 million. Of that amount, the Company has invested $12.2 million and has received $8.6 million in distributions as of September 30, 2007. Although the combined remaining balance of $21.4 million has been included in fiscal year 2008 above, the contributions to the partnerships may occur after that time and are dependent upon the timing of the capital calls by the general partners. (3) Because many commitments expire without being funded in whole or part, the contract amounts are not estimates of future cash flows. (4) RJTCF is committed to additional future fundings related to real estate partnerships. Effects of Inflation The Company's assets are primarily liquid in nature and are not significantly affected by inflation. However, the rate of inflation affects the Company's expenses, including employee compensation, communications and occupancy, which may not be readily recoverable through charges for services provided by the Company. 36 Table of Contents
