Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition. Management's discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes. Descriptions of all documents incorporated by reference herein or included as exhibits hereto are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of such documents so incorporated or included. References to "Viacom," "Company," "we," "us" and "our" refer to Viacom Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries through which its various businesses are conducted, unless the context requires otherwise. Certain amounts have been reclassified to conform to the 2005 presentation. Overview The Separation On December 31, 2005, we became a stand-alone public company in connection with our separation from the former Viacom Inc. (the "Former Viacom"). Prior to the separation, we were a wholly-owned subsidiary of Former Viacom known as "New Viacom Corp." and acquired all of our initial businesses from the Former Viacom. Such businesses include MTV Networks ("MTVN") (including, among other networks, MTV Music Television, MTV 2, VH1, Nickelodeon, Nick at Nite, Comedy Central, CMT: Country Music Television, Spike TV and TV Land), BET, Paramount Pictures, Paramount Home Entertainment and Famous Music. The separation was effected through a merger, pursuant to which Viacom Merger Sub Inc. was merged with Former Viacom, with Former Viacom continuing as the surviving entity and being renamed CBS Corporation, and New Viacom Corp. being renamed Viacom Inc. On December 31, 2005, in connection with the merger and the separation, each share of Former Viacom Class A common stock was converted into the right to receive 0.5 of a share of Viacom Class A common stock and 0.5 of a share of CBS Corporation Class A common stock. Similarly, each share of Former Viacom Class B common stock was converted into the right to receive 0.5 of a share of Viacom Class B common stock and 0.5 of a share of CBS Corporation Class B common stock. Holders of Viacom Class A and B common stock received cash in lieu of fractional shares. In accordance with the terms of the Separation Agreement, on December 29, 2005 the Company paid a preliminary special dividend to the Former Viacom of $5.4 billion. The dividend reduced the Company's Stockholders' Equity in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2005 and was funded by borrowings under the Company's term loan facility, which is more fully described in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section. Pursuant to the provisions of the Separation Agreement, the preliminary special dividend is subject to adjustments for, among other items, actual Former Viacom debt as of the date of the separation and actual CBS Corporation cash flow for the full year 2005, compared to estimates used to calculate the preliminary dividend paid on December 29, 2005. On March 14, 2006, we received from CBS Corporation an initial statement that the dividend should be increased by a net amount of approximately $460 million. We have begun our assessment of the amount and underlying components of the proposed increase. Pursuant to the Separation Agreement, the parties have up to 65 days to settle on the adjustment before any disputed amounts would become subject to a dispute resolution process. Any additional amount due will be reflected as a direct charge to Stockholders' Equity in the period in which the adjustment amount is determined. The Separation Agreement further provided that the Company is responsible for the first $195.0 million in costs directly related to the separation. Amounts incurred in excess of $195.0 million will be funded equally between the Company and CBS Corporation. Included as a component in selling, general and administrative expenses in the Company's Consolidated Income Statement for the year ended December 31, 2005 is $163.5 million of transaction costs reflected as period expenses. Such amounts principally included investment banking and other professional fees. II-3 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts) In connection with the separation, Viacom and CBS Corporation also entered into certain other agreements in order to govern certain of the ongoing relationships between Viacom and CBS Corporation after the separation. These agreements include a Transition Services Agreement and a Tax Matters Agreement. Related party arrangements are more fully described below and in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Recent Developments On January 31, 2006, we completed our acquisition of DreamWorks LLC ("DreamWorks"), a leading producer of live-action motion pictures, television programming and home entertainment products, for approximately $1.6 billion consisting of cash and the assumption of debt. We also entered into exclusive seven-year agreements for worldwide distribution rights and fulfillment services to films produced by DreamWorks Animation SKG, Inc. We are well along in our discussions regarding the sale of most of the DreamWorks live-action film library. In connection with the sale, we expect to retain the distribution rights to these films for at least a five-year period. In connection with the DreamWorks acquisition, we borrowed approximately $1.1 billion in the aggregate under our $3.25 billion five-year credit agreement with the lenders named therein, JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, Citibank, N.A., as syndication agent, and Bank of America, N.A., Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. and The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, Ltd., New York Branch, as co-documentation agents, and Tranche B of our $6.0 billion term loan credit agreement with the lenders named therein, Citibank, N.A., as administrative agent, JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., as syndication agent, and Bank of America, N.A., Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. and The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, Ltd., New York Branch, as co-documentation agents (collectively, the "Credit Facilities"). The terms of the Credit Facilities are described in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements. During the first quarter of 2006, we entered into $2.35 billion notional amount of variable to fixed rate interest swaps. Basis of Presentation The accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Company are presented on a carve-out basis and reflect the consolidated historical results of operations, financial position and cash flows of the Company, with operations in two segments: (i) Cable Networks and (ii) Entertainment. The assets and liabilities of Viacom have been accounted for at the historical book values carried by Former Viacom prior to the separation and were assigned to Viacom pursuant to the terms of the Separation Agreement. The indebtedness of Former Viacom, other than certain capital lease obligations, was not transferred to Viacom and remains as indebtedness of CBS Corporation. Prior to the separation, Former Viacom centrally managed the cash flows generated from the Company's various businesses. The Invested Capital balance included as a component of Stockholders' Equity in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet through the date of separation includes accumulated earnings of the Company as well as receivables/payables due to/from CBS Corporation resulting from cash transfers and intercompany activity. Interest was not charged or credited on amounts due to/from Viacom. The Consolidated Income Statements include allocations of Former Viacom corporate expenses and Paramount Pictures corporate overhead including accounting, treasury, tax, legal, human resources, information systems and other services as well as depreciation and amortization on allocated costs, to reflect the utilization of such shared services and assets by the Company. Total corporate costs allocated to the Company, excluding separations costs, were approximately $162.0 million, $136.2 million, and $112.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, II-4 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts) and were primarily included in Selling, General and Administrative expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Income Statements. Management believes the methodologies used to allocate charges for the services described above are reasonable. The consolidated financial statements may not necessarily reflect Viacom's results of operations, financial position and cash flows in the future or what Viacom's results of operations, financial position and cash flows would have been had the Company been a separate, stand-alone company during the periods presented. As described above, none of the indebtedness of Former Viacom other than capital lease obligations was assumed by the Company and remains as indebtedness of CBS Corporation. Accordingly, debt service cost is not reflected in the Company's Consolidated Income Statements. Famous Players and Blockbuster Inc. have been reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Famous Players was sold on July 22, 2005 and Blockbuster was split-off from Former Viacom in 2004. Segments We are a leading worldwide multiplatform, pure play content company with operations in the following segments: Cable Networks: The Cable Networks segment consists of the businesses of MTV Networks, including MTV: Music Television , MTV2 , Nickelodeon , Nick at Nite , Noggin , The N , Nicktoons Network , Turbo Nick , VH1 , TV Land , Spike TV , CMT : Country Music Television , Logo , Comedy Central , Comedy Central's MotherLoad , MTV Desi , MTV Chi , MTV Espa ol , mtvU , mtvU Uber , MTV Hits , MTV Jams , TEMPO , MTV Overdrive , MHD , VH1 Classic , VHUno , VH1 Soul , VH1 Country , VH1's Vspot , Game One , VIVA , TMF , The Box , Paramount Comedy , Neopets , GameTrailers.com and IFILM ; and the businesses of BET Networks, which includes BET (Black Entertainment Television) and BET J ; and other program services, including online programming services such as websites, broadband channels and wireless applications. Entertainment: The Entertainment segment includes Paramount Pictures , which produces and distributes feature motion pictures, Famous Music , which engages in the music publishing business, and interests in 20 movie theaters. Our revenues from the Cable Networks Segment accounted for 70%, 71% and 65% of our revenues for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, our revenues from the Entertainment Segment accounted for 31%, 31% and 36% of our revenues for those periods, and elimination of intercompany revenues accounted for (1)%, (2)% and (1)% of our revenues for those periods. Revenues We have one of the largest collections of cable programming assets in the world, with leading global brands that are attractive advertiser vehicles. Our leading program services reach more than 165 territories through over 120 worldwide cable networks presented in over 25 different languages and reach over 440 million subscriber households worldwide. In the United States, our leading networks program approximately 1,780 hours per week and, according to Nielsen Media Research, reached approximately 150 million television viewers each week in the period from October 2005 to December 2005. Many of our brands, such as MTV, Nickelodeon and VH1, are known worldwide. Interbrand Corp., an international brand consultancy, has regularly cited MTV as one of the world's most valuable brands, including in 2005. Nickelodeon, which as of December 31, 2005 was available in over 300 million television households worldwide, is one of the world's most widely distributed II-5 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts) children's television brands and has been the top-rated cable network for children in the United States for the past ten years. Our Cable Networks segment revenues depend on the strength of our brands, which significantly affect our ability to attract and retain advertisers and affiliates. Our revenues depend, in part on our success in developing brands that appeal to a wide range of targeted niche audiences and represent demographics sought after by advertisers and affiliates. In addition, the extent of our distribution to specialized audiences and our focus on forging strong connections with our audiences determine whether our networks are an attractive venue for advertisers and affiliates. Revenues from the Cable Networks segment are generated principally from advertising sales and affiliate fees. The sale of advertising time is affected by the desirability of viewer demographics, viewer ratings and economic conditions in the marketplace that could alter advertisers' spending habits. Affiliate fees consist of subscription fees from cable television operators, DTH satellite operators and other distributors who carry our networks. Our agreements with our distributors generally are long-term, have staggered expiration dates and provide for built-in rate increases and protected distribution. Other Cable Networks revenues consist of revenues from home entertainment sales of our original cable programming, the licensing and merchandising of our cable and consumer products worldwide and the syndication of cable programming. These revenues are driven primarily by the popularity of our programming airing on our cable networks. Cable Network's revenue growth depends on the continued increases in advertising revenues and affiliate fees from our distributors, through the continued production of compelling content. Growth also depends on our ability to successfully expand onto new distribution platforms such as wireless and the Internet as these platforms become increasingly attractive to advertisers. We believe media fragmentation plays to our strengths, and our intent is to take advantage of emerging technological and consumer trends by extending our brands and distributing our content into new forms of integrated digital distribution, such as broadband, wireless, online community, video-on-demand, high-definition programming and other businesses. We aim to achieve this through a combination of organic growth, investment in our existing and complementary businesses, strategic relationships, and focused acquisitions that fit with our current brands and core competencies. Revenues from our Entertainment Segment are primarily generated from feature film exploitation, which includes the exploitation of motion pictures in theatrical release, home entertainment, and other means, including network, pay television, syndication and basic cable revenues. Other Entertainment revenues principally relate to music publishing. Entertainment's results of operations substantially depend on the public response to our theatrical and DVD releases, our ability to obtain creative talent and story properties, and our films' distribution and marketing success. Therefore, the results of the Entertainment Segment can be volatile. Our strategies for growing Entertainment revenues include implementing a multi-label model capitalizing on MTVN, BET, and DreamWorks brands; owning and increasing our control over international distribution; significantly expanding our home entertainment capabilities; and broadening our portfolio of films with an increased focus on specialty films. Developing synergies across our brands permits us to leverage our core MTVN and BET audiences that open and drive movies. Using our creative and marketing advantages in our common research, talent connections and global marketing activities will also benefit Entertainment. II-6 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Operating Expenses Operating expenses represented approximately 65% of our total expenses in 2005, 67% in 2004 and 69% in 2003 and consist of the following: Production and program expenses . In the Cable Networks segment, these expenses reflect amortization cost of all original and acquired programming exhibited on our cable networks. Production and program expenses are generally variable and depend primarily on the cost of on- and off-screen talent, whether or not scripted and whether animated or live. In the Entertainment segment, production and program expenses relate primarily to the amortization of feature film production costs, and development projects, production overhead and acquisition costs. Distribution expenses . These expenses include advertising and other distribution costs incurred primarily with respect to Entertainment product in theatrical or home entertainment release. Other operating expenses. These expenses primarily include the cost of home entertainment product as well as licensing and merchandising of Cable Networks product. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Our selling, general and administrative expenses primarily include expenses incurred for selling and marketing, occupancy, insurance, administrative support activities and public company expenses and, in 2005, separation-related costs of $163.5 million. Depreciation and Amortization Our depreciation and amortization primarily relates to owned buildings, leasehold improvements, equipment and transponders, and intangible assets. Acquisitions and Dispositions On October 12, 2005, MTV Networks acquired IFILM Corp., which owns IFILM.com, a video-entertainment website, for $49.0 million. On August 2, 2005, Famous Music acquired The Extreme Music Library Limited and Director's Cuts Production Music Limited for $45.1 million. On June 20, 2005, MTV Networks acquired Neopets for approximately $160.0 million. Neopets is the owner and operator of Neopets.com, a leading online destination and community for kids and young adults, whose members, among other things, create and care for virtual pets. During 2004, MTV Networks acquired 97.8% of VIVA, a youth entertainment media company based in Germany, for a total purchase price of $393.6 million and acquired the remainder in 2005 for $8.4 million. During 2003, MTV Networks acquired the remaining 50% interest in Comedy Central that it did not previously own for $1.2 billion. On July 22, 2005, Former Viacom sold Famous Players, its Canadian-based theater chain for approximately $400.0 million. In October 2004, Former Viacom completed the split-off of Blockbuster by exchanging the 72 million shares of Blockbuster Class A common stock and 72 million shares of Blockbuster Class B common stock that it owned for 27,961,165 shares of Former Viacom Class A and Class B common stock. Consolidated Results of Operations 2005 vs. 2004 and 2004 vs. 2003 The accompanying consolidated financial statements are presented on a carve-out basis and reflect the consolidated historical results of operations, financial position and cash flows of the Company, with operations in two segments: (i) Cable Networks which includes MTV Networks and BET Networks and (ii) Entertainment which includes Paramount Pictures, Famous Music publishing operations and II-7 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts) interests in 20 movie theaters. The consolidated financial statements also reflect results from the discontinued operations of Blockbuster Inc. and Famous Players (See Note 4). The historical financial statements include allocations of Former Viacom corporate expenses and Paramount Pictures corporate overhead, including accounting, treasury, tax, legal, human resources, information systems and other transactions with Former Viacom. Former Viacom debt, other than capital lease obligations, has not been allocated and the related interest expense is not reflected in results of operations. Management believes the assumptions underlying the consolidated financial statements are reasonable. However, the consolidated financial statements included herein do not necessarily reflect what Viacom's results of operations, financial position and cash flows in the future or what its results of operations, financial position and cash flows would have been if Viacom had been a stand-alone company during the periods presented. Transactions between Viacom and Former Viacom and between Viacom and CBS Corporation have been identified as transactions between related parties. The following table sets forth our results of operations: Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Revenues $ 9,609.6 $ 8,132.2 $ 7,304.4 Expenses: Operating 4,737.4 3,908.0 3,672.6 Selling, general and administrative 2,246.8 1,689.8 1,432.1 Depreciation and amortization 259.0 251.6 197.9 Total expenses 7,243.2 5,849.4 5,302.6 Operating income 2,366.4 2,282.8 2,001.8 Interest expense (23.0 ) (24.2 ) (23.2 ) Interest income 3.9 3.3 2.2 Other items, net (29.0 ) (17.7 ) (24.6 ) Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes, equity in earnings (loss) of affiliated companies and minority interest 2,318.3 2,244.2 1,956.2 Provision for income taxes (1,020.0 ) (808.2 ) (787.6 ) Equity in earnings (loss) of affiliated companies, net of tax 9.4 (40.0 ) (18.2 ) Minority interest, net of tax (3.8 ) (3.1 ) (3.0 ) Net earnings from continuing operations 1,303.9 1,392.9 1,147.4 Discontinued operations (a): Loss from discontinued operations, net of minority interest (99.6 ) (1,196.5 ) (719.4 ) Income tax benefit (provision) 52.6 97.3 (83.4 ) Net loss from discontinued operations (47.0 ) (1,099.2 ) (802.8 ) Net earnings before cumulative effect of accounting change 1,256.9 293.7 344.6 Cumulative effect of accounting change, net of taxes (6.1 ) Net earnings $ 1,256.9 $ 293.7 $ 338.5 (a) On July 22, 2005, Former Viacom sold Famous Players, its Canadian-based theater chain, to Cineplex Galaxy L.P., and as a result Famous Players is presented as a discontinued operation.

All prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to this presentation. II-8 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Revenues Our revenues for 2005 of $9.61 billion increased $1.48 billion, or 18%, from $8.13 billion for 2004, reflecting 18% growth in Cable Networks and 19% growth in Entertainment. Our revenues for 2004 of $8.13 billion increased $827.8 million, or 11%, from $7.30 billion for 2003, driven by a 20% increase in Cable Networks, partially offset by a decline in Entertainment of 5%. For 2005, acquisitions, including IFILM, Extreme Music and Neopets, and VIVA, which was acquired in 2004, contributed incremental revenues of $104.2 million, or 1%, to our revenue growth. In 2004, acquisitions, including VIVA and Comedy Central, which was acquired in 2003, contributed incremental revenues of $306.1 million, or 4%, to our revenue growth. The tables below present our revenues by type, net of intercompany eliminations, for each of the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003. Revenues by Type 2005 2004 2005 vs. 2004 2003 2004 vs. 2003 Advertising sales $ 3,963.4 $ 3,349.6 18 % $ 2,769.0 21 % Feature film exploitation 2,873.4 2,394.5 20 % 2,561.7 (7 )% Affiliate fees 1,824.8 1,640.3 11 % 1,448.4 13 % Other 948.0 747.8 27 % 525.3 42 % Total Revenues $ 9,609.6 $ 8,132.2 18 % $ 7,304.4 11 % Year Ended December 31, Percentage of Revenues by Type 2005 2004 2003 Advertising sales 41 % 41 % 38 % Feature film exploitation 30 % 30 % 35 % Affiliate fees 19 % 20 % 20 % Other 10 % 9 % 7 % Total 100 % 100 % 100 % We generated approximately 22% of our total revenues from international regions in 2005 and 21% in 2004 and 2003. Year Ended December 31, 2005 Percentage of Total 2004 Percentage of Total 2003 Percentage of Total United Kingdom $477.5 22 % $450.2 26 % $450.5 30 % Other Europe 881.7 41 % 717.8 42 % 514.1 34 % Canada 214.7 10 % 125.6 7 % 134.4 9 % All other 569.0 27 % 420.6 25 % 414.5 27 % Total International Revenues $ 2,142.9 100 % $ 1,714.2 100 % $ 1,513.5 100 % Operating Expenses For 2005, operating expenses of $4.74 billion increased $829.4 million, or 21%, from $3.91 billion in 2004. For 2004, operating expenses increased $235.4 million, or 6%, from $3.67 billion in 2003. The II-9 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts) table below presents our operating expenses by type for each of the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003: Operating Expenses by Type 2005 2004 2005 vs. 2004 2003 2004 vs. 2003 Production and program $ 3,168.9 $ 2,426.0 31 % $ 2,193.7 11 % Distribution 1,179.0 1,172.2 1 % 1,258.2 (7 )% Other 389.5 309.8 26 % 220.7 40 % Total Operating Expenses $ 4,737.4 $ 3,908.0 21 % $ 3,672.6 6 % The major changes in operating expenses were as follows: Production and program expenses of $3.17 billion in 2005 increased $742.9 million, or 31%, from $2.43 billion in 2004. Cable Networks expenses grew 19% in line with revenue growth. Entertainment expenses grew 49%, or $421.9 million, driven primarily by two productions War of the Worlds and The Longest Yard . Also contributing to the growth in Entertainment expenses were write-offs of $31.6 million related to management's decision to abandon certain development projects and increases of $20 million in development costs associated with the transition to new leadership at Paramount. For 2004, production and program expenses increased $232.3 million, or 11%, from $2.19 billion in 2003 with an increase in Cable Networks of 23% in line with revenue growth, partially offset by a decrease in Entertainment of 4%, driven by a 19% reduction in development costs and a 3% decline in film amortization, participation and residual expense. Distribution expenses of $1.18 billion in 2005 increased $6.8 million, or 1%, from $1.17 billion in 2004. Distribution expenses for 2004 decreased $86.0 million, or 7%, from $1.26 billion in 2003 principally reflecting lower distribution costs for home entertainment releases of feature films. Other operating expenses of $389.5 million in 2005 increased $79.7 million or 26% from $309.8 million in 2004 due to higher costs associated with home entertainment sales and licensing, which grew by 29% in Cable Networks. Other operating expenses increased $89.1 million, or 40%, to $309.8 million in 2004 from 2003 principally due to 37% growth in Cable Networks reflecting higher costs associated with home entertainment sales and licensing and additional costs from Comedy Central, acquired in May 2003. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses of $2.25 billion in 2005 increased $557.0 million, or 33%, reflecting separation related charges of $163.5 million, $70.5 million in operating segment severance charges and an increase of $217.9 million, or 16%, in Cable Networks in line with 18% revenue growth. Selling, general and administrative expenses of $1.69 billion in 2004 increased $257.7 million, or 18%, primarily reflecting higher employee-related expenses, severance charges of $28.1 million, as well as twelve months of expenses for Comedy Central, versus seven months in 2003. Depreciation and Amortization For 2005, depreciation and amortization increased $7.4 million, or 3%, from $251.6 million principally driven by higher intangible asset amortization resulting from acquisitions. For 2004, depreciation and amortization increased $53.7 million, or 27%, from $197.9 million in 2003, primarily reflecting capital expenditures increases related to leasehold improvements, equipment and transponders. II-10 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Interest Expense Interest expense is primarily attributable to capitalized lease obligations. For 2005, interest expense decreased by $1.2 million from $24.2 million. For 2004, interest expense increased by $1.0 million to $24.2 million from $23.2 million in 2003. Interest expense was not materially impacted by the debt incurred by the Company in connection with the payment of the special dividend due to the short period of time the debt was outstanding in 2005. Interest expense will increase substantially in 2006 as our debt is expected to be outstanding for the entire year. See the Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Income Statement. Interest Income For 2005, interest income increased by $.6 million to $3.9 million and for 2004, interest income increased by $1.1 million to $3.3 million versus $2.2 million in 2003. Other Items, Net Other items, net reflected a net loss of $29.0 million for 2005, $17.7 million for 2004 and $24.6 million for 2003, principally consisting of costs associated with securitizing trade receivables of $15.9 million, $7.7 million and $5.7 million, respectively, and foreign exchange losses of $14.3 million, $9.3 million, and $18.9 million, respectively. Provision for Income Taxes The provision for income taxes relates to federal, state, local and foreign income taxes on earnings before income taxes. Our annual effective tax rate was 44.0% in 2005 versus 36.0% in 2004 and 40.3% before the cumulative effect of accounting changes in 2003. Our higher effective rate for 2005 principally reflects the effect of non-deductible separation related expenses of $102.0 million which are included in the total separation costs of $163.5 million. Included in the 2004 rate was the recognition of $77.0 million in tax benefits from the resolution of certain income tax audits in 2004. Former Viacom managed its tax position for the benefit of its entire portfolio of businesses, and its tax strategies are not necessarily reflective of the tax strategies that the Company would have followed or will follow as a stand-alone company. Equity in Earnings (Loss) of Affiliated Companies, Net of Tax Equity in earnings (loss) of affiliated companies, net of tax reflected earnings of $9.4 million for 2005 and losses of $40.0 million for 2004 and $18.2 million for 2003. For 2005, earnings primarily include positive results from MTV Networks international affiliates. For 2004, the loss principally reflected losses from the sale of international theater ventures, partially offset by positive results from other international ventures. For 2003, results principally reflected operating losses from international ventures, partially offset by the positive results of Comedy Central prior to acquisition in May 2003. Minority Interest, Net of Tax Minority interest primarily represented the minority ownership of certain international pay television companies. Net Loss from Discontinued Operations Net loss from discontinued operations reflects the operating results of Blockbuster and Famous Players through their respective dates of disposition. Discontinued operations reflected losses of $47.0 million, $1.1 billion and $802.8 million for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Former Viacom recognized a net loss of $47.0 million in 2005 in connection with the sale of Famous Players. The loss from discontinued operations in 2004 included a non-cash charge of $1.5 billion ($1.2 billion net of minority interest and tax) for the impairment of Blockbuster goodwill and other long-lived assets in II-11 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts) accordance with SFAS 142 "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" and SFAS No. 144 "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets." In 2003, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge related to Blockbuster of approximately $1.3 billion ($1.0 billion, net of minority interest and tax) in accordance with SFAS 142. In completing our analysis of the fair value of the video business, several events led to the conclusion that the business had incremental risks that were required to be included in our evaluation of goodwill. Additionally, Blockbuster's review of long-lived assets in conjunction with SFAS 144 resulted in an impairment charge of approximately $18.5 million to reduce the carrying value of certain fixed assets in four international markets. Cumulative Effect of Accounting Change, Net of Tax For 2003, the cumulative effect of accounting change, net of tax, of $6.1 million, resulted from the adoption of SFAS No. 143 "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations." Net Earnings For 2005, we reported consolidated net earnings of $1.26 billion versus $293.7 million in 2004 and $338.5 million in 2003. The increase in net earnings in 2005 was largely attributable to the decline in net loss from discontinued operations and increased revenues of 18%, partially offset by higher operating expenses. The decrease in net earnings in 2004 was driven by the increase in net loss from discontinued operations partially offset by revenue growth primarily from advertising. Segment Results of Operations For the Years Ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 The tables below present our revenues, operating income, and depreciation and amortization by segment for each of the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003. Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Revenues: Cable Networks $ 6,757.8 $ 5,745.5 $ 4,775.3 Entertainment 2,995.3 2,513.7 2,655.8 Eliminations (143.5 ) (127.0 ) (126.7 ) Total Revenues $ 9,609.6 $ 8,132.2 $ 7,304.4 Operating Income: Cable Networks $ 2,610.1 $ 2,265.0 $ 1,928.9 Entertainment 70.1 154.2 189.7 Segment Total 2,680.2 2,419.2 2,118.6 Corporate expenses (308.5 ) (128.1 ) (103.8 ) Eliminations (5.3 ) (8.3 ) (13.0 ) Total Operating Income $ 2,366.4 $ 2,282.8 $ 2,001.8 Depreciation and Amortization: Cable Networks $ 230.8 $ 223.2 $ 171.4 Entertainment 23.0 19.0 16.8 Corporate 5.2 9.4 9.7 Total Depreciation and Amortization $ 259.0 $ 251.6 $ 197.9 (a) Eliminations principally reflect intercompany transactions related to the sale of advertising time to Paramount Pictures and the sale of feature films to cable networks. II-12 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Cable Networks Cable Networks contributed 70% of consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2005, 71% for the year ended December 31, 2004 and 65% for the year ended December 31, 2003. The table below presents Cable Networks' revenues by type for each of the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003. Revenues by Type 2005 2004 2005 vs 2004 2003 2004 vs. 2003 Advertising sales $ 4,035.3 $ 3,410.2 18 % $ 2,819.0 21 % Affiliate fees 1,824.8 1,640.3 11 % 1,448.4 13 % Other 897.7 695.0 29 % 507.9 37 % Total Revenues $ 6,757.8 $ 5,745.5 18 % $ 4,775.3 20 % 2005 vs. 2004 For 2005, Cable Networks revenues increased $1.01 billion, or 18%, to $6.76 billion principally driven by a $625.1 million, or 18%, increase in advertising revenues, a $184.5 million or 11%, increase in affiliate revenues, and a $202.7 million, or 29%, increase in other revenues. Advertising sales, which represented 60% of total revenues in 2005 and 59% in 2004, reflected double-digit gains across all MTV Networks domestic channels and BET, as well as 26% growth in international markets. Affiliate fees, which represented 27% of Cable Networks revenues in 2005, were up 11% reflecting subscriber and rate increases at MTV Networks from new and existing domestic networks and across international geographies as well as subscriber and rate increases at BET. Other revenues, which represented approximately 13% of Cable Networks revenues in 2005, were up 29%, primarily reflecting higher home video revenues as well as higher syndicated fees for Comedy Central and for VIVA. Acquisitions, including VIVA, IFILM and Neopets, contributed $99 million in incremental revenues in 2005. For 2005, Cable Networks operating income increased $345.1 million, or 15%, to $2.61 billion reflecting higher revenues, partially offset by 21% and 20% increases in operating expenses and SG&A, respectively. The increase in operating expenses reflected a $64.1 million increase in original series programming costs at MTV Networks as well as higher amortization expenses associated with new acquired programming, such as CSI: Crime Scene Investigation for Spike, and higher music publishing and license fees. SG&A expenses increased principally due to higher domestic and international marketing expenses of $92.4 million, increased rent and maintenance costs, as well as severance expense of $47.9 million at MTV Networks. Total expenses for 2005 also included the full year impact of VIVA, which was acquired in 2004 and the inclusion of IFILM and Neopets. 2004 vs. 2003 For 2004, Cable Networks revenues increased $970.2 million, or 20%, to $5.75 billion principally driven by a $591.2 million, or 21%, increase in advertising sales and a $191.9 million, or 13%, increase in affiliate fees and 37% in other. Approximately 13% of Cable Networks revenues were generated from international regions, of which approximately 71% came from Europe. Total international revenue growth was 35%, led by Europe, and domestic revenues grew 19%. Advertising sales, which represented 59% of total revenues in 2004 and 2003, grew as a result of an increase in the number of units sold and higher average rates. MTV Networks' advertising sales grew 22%, led by growth at Comedy Central, Nickelodeon and MTV, as well as the inclusion of VIVA. Advertising revenues at BET grew 11%. The growth in affiliate fees, which represented 29% and 30% of total revenues in 2004 and 2003, respectively, was principally driven by rate increases and subscriber II-13 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts) growth at domestic channels. Other revenues, increased $187.1 million, or 37%, benefiting from increases in Nickelodeon merchandising and licensing and higher home entertainment revenues led by Chappelle's Show DVD sales and higher international syndication sales. For 2004, Cable Networks operating income increased $336.1 million, or 17%, to $2.27 billion reflecting higher revenues, partially offset by a 22% increase in total expenses. The increase in total expenses for the year included an increase in operating expenses of $376.3 million, or 24%, which was driven by higher costs for original and acquired programming, particularly at MTV, VH1, Spike, TV Land and BET. Selling, general and administrative expenses for 2004 increased $205.8 million, or 18%, primarily due to higher sales and marketing-related costs at MTV Networks and increased employee-related expenses. Total expenses also included the full year impact of Comedy Central and the inclusion of VIVA. VIVA's results are included as part of MTV Networks, contributed $63.0 million of revenues to Cable Networks for 2004 from the date of acquisition, and contributed 1% to the total revenue increase. Comedy Central, which was acquired in May 2003, contributed 5% to Cable Networks revenue growth for 2004. Entertainment Entertainment contributed 31% of consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, and 36% for the year ended December 31, 2003. The table below presents Entertainment's revenues by type for each of the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003. Revenues by Type 2005 2004 2005 vs 2004 2003 2004 vs. 2003 Feature film exploitation $ 2,898.7 $ 2,425.4 20 % $ 2,576.7 (6 )% Other 96.6 88.3 9 % 79.1 12 % Total Revenues $ 2,995.3 $ 2,513.7 19 % $ 2,655.8 (5 )% 2005 vs. 2004 For 2005, Entertainment revenues increased $481.6 million, or 19%, to $3.00 billion, driven by War of the Worlds, The Longest Yard, Coach Carter, Sahara and Four Brothers . Including home entertainment sales, those 5 films more than doubled the performance of comparable 2004 titles including Mean Girls, The Manchurian Candidate, The Stepford Wives, Collateral and Twisted . 2005 also benefited from the carryover impact of the 2004 slate which contributed over $100 million more to 2005 than the 2003 titles contributed to 2004; however, those gains were partially offset by lower sales from older titles and the carryover impact of the 2003 DVD release of The Adventures of Indiana Jones titles in 2004. Approximately 40% of Entertainment's revenues were partially generated from international regions in 2005, principally Europe and Canada. For 2005, Entertainment operating income decreased $84.1 million, or 55%, to $70.1 million primarily due to a $31.6 million charge related to the abandonment of development projects started by prior management, severance costs of $22.6 million incurred to adjust Paramount's overhead structure, and incremental development costs of approximately $20 million. 2004 vs. 2003 For 2004, Entertainment revenues decreased $142.1 million, or 5%, to $2.51 billion principally reflecting lower feature film exploitation revenues, partially offset by higher other revenues from music II-14 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts) publishing. Approximately 39% of Entertainment's revenues were generated from international regions in 2004, principally Europe and Canada. For 2004, feature film exploitation revenues decreased $151.3 million, or 6%, principally reflecting 11% lower worldwide home entertainment revenues as contributions from 2004 titles, including Mean Girls, School of Rock, The Manchurian Candidate, The Stepford Wives and Paycheck , did not match the success of the prior year's titles led by The Adventures of Indiana Jones the Complete DVD Movie Collection, How To Lose A Guy In 10 Days and The Italian Job . Worldwide theatrical revenues decreased 3% with releases including Mean Girls , Collateral , Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events, The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie and The Manchurian Candidate . Other revenues, primarily from music publishing, increased $9.2 million, or 12% to $88.3 million in 2004. For 2004, Entertainment operating income decreased $35.5 million, or 19%, to $154.2 million primarily due to the revenue decreases noted above, partially offset by a $106.6 million, or 4%, decrease in total expenses primarily from operating expenses. The decrease in operating expenses principally reflected lower film distribution costs, film amortization and participation and residual expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 13% due in part to a severance charge of $10.4 million recorded in the second quarter of 2004 related to a management change. License fees for television exhibition of completed motion pictures are recorded as revenue in the period that the products are available for such exhibition, which, among other reasons, may cause substantial fluctuation in operating results. Unrecognized revenues attributable to television licensing agreements were approximately $1.1 billion as of December 31, 2005 and $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2004 and 2003 including intercompany revenues of $61.3, $65.9 million and $68.9 million, respectively. Financial Position December 31, 2005 vs. December 31, 2004 Current assets increased by $886.5 million to $3.51 billion at December 31, 2005 from $2.63 billion at December 31, 2004, primarily due to increases in other assets of $256.9 million relating to production distribution advances, accounts receivable of $152.9 million primarily related to higher revenues in 2005, and cash and cash equivalents of $212.2 million. Net property and equipment increased to $1.18 billion at December 31, 2005 from $1.10 billion at December 31, 2004, due to capital expenditures of $193.0 million which primarily consists of approximately $75.7 million for information systems and approximately $22.6 million for improvements to Paramount's studio assets. Goodwill increased $94.5 million to $10.36 billion at December 31, 2005 from $10.27 billion at December 31, 2004, primarily due to the acquisition of Neopets, Inc. Current liabilities increased $483.0 million to $3.27 billion at December 31, 2005 from $2.79 billion at December 31, 2004 primarily due to incremental severance accruals of $67.5 million, transaction cost related accruals of $119.0 million, and higher accounts payable of $197.8 million. II-15 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Cash Flows Cash and cash equivalents increased by $211.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The change in cash and cash equivalents was as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Cash provided by operating activities $ 1,627.4 $ 1,989.9 $ 1,911.0 Cash used for investing activities (165.1 ) (288.6 ) (1,594.6 ) Cash used for financing activities (1,251.2 ) (1,844.4 ) (220.3 ) Increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 211.1 $ (143.1 ) $ 96.1 Operating Activities Cash provided by operating activities of $1.63 billion for the year ended December 31, 2005 decreased $362.5 million versus 2004. The decrease was principally due to a decrease in cash flows attributable to discontinued operations of $285.8 million, lower net earnings from continuing operations and higher cash taxes paid in 2005. In 2004, cash provided by operating activities increased $78.9 million to $1.99 billion from $1.91 billion for the same prior year period. The increase primarily reflected higher earnings from continuing operations in 2004 and higher receivable collections in 2004, partially offset by a decrease in cash flow provided by discontinued operations in 2004 and the timing of the split-off of Blockbuster which occurred in October 2004. In 2003, cash provided by operating activities increased $310.2 million to $1.9 billion principally due to higher earnings from continuing operations in 2003 and higher cash flow provided by discontinued operations. Investing Activities Cash used for net investing activities of $165.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 principally reflected acquisitions of $356.1 million, consisting primarily of the acquisition of Neopets, IFILM and Extreme Music, and capital expenditures of $193.0 million, partially offset by proceeds from dispositions of $404.2 million, primarily from the sale of Famous Players. Capital expenditures of $193.0 million increased $52.5 million, or 37%, principally reflecting increased investment in information systems in part related to the separation from the Former Viacom and leasehold improvements. Capital expenditures for Cable Networks were $142.5 million, $86.9 million and $81.7 million for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The 64% incremental spending in 2005 is largely attributable to investments in technology and information systems. Entertainment capital expenditures were $46.7 million, $29.2 million and $27.6 million for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The 60% incremental spending in 2005 primarily relates to information systems and improvements to Paramount's studio assets. In 2004, cash used for investing activities of $288.6 million reflected acquisitions of $363.7 million, primarily consisting of the acquisition of VIVA, capital expenditures of $140.5 million and cash flow attributable to discontinued operations of $433.3 million partially offset by the $738.1 million special distribution paid by Blockbuster in the third quarter of 2004. Capital expenditures increased $26.2 million, or 23%, to $140.5 million in 2004. Net cash expenditures for investing activities of $1.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2003 principally reflected acquisitions of $1.3 billion and capital expenditures of $114.3 million. Acquisitions in 2003 included the acquisition of the remaining 50% interest in Comedy Central for $1.2 billion. Investing activities also included additional investments in affiliated companies which totaled $74.3 million in 2004 and $23.2 million in 2003. II-16 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Financing Activities Cash used for financing activities principally reflected the net contribution to Former Viacom. Since the businesses of Viacom were held directly or indirectly by Former Viacom, daily cash needs of Viacom were funded by Former Viacom and cash generated by the operations of Viacom was swept daily to Former Viacom for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions and stock repurchases. In accordance with the terms of the Separation Agreement, on December 29, 2005 the Company paid a preliminary special dividend to the Former Viacom of $5.4 billion. The dividend reduced the Company's Stockholders' Equity in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2005 and was funded by borrowings under the Company's term loan facility, which is more fully described in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section. Pursuant to the provisions of the Separation Agreement, the preliminary special dividend is subject to adjustments for, among other items, actual Former Viacom debt as of the date of the separation and actual CBS Corporation cash flow for the full year 2005, compared to estimates used to calculate the preliminary dividend paid on December 29, 2005. On March 14, 2006, we received from CBS Corporation an initial statement that the dividend should be increased by a net amount of approximately $460 million. We have begun our assessment of the amount and underlying components of the proposed increase. Pursuant to the Separation Agreement, the parties have up to 65 days to settle on the adjustment before any disputed amounts would become subject to a dispute resolution process. Any additional amount due will be reflected as a direct charge to Stockholders' Equity in the period in which the adjustment amount is determined. In 2004, cash flow used for financing activities of $1.8 billion principally reflected the net contribution to Former Viacom of $1.7 billion. In 2003, cash flow uses for financing activities of $220.3 million primarily reflected $361.9 million used by discontinued operations partially offset by $189.1 million of funding from Former Viacom. The funding in 2003 was due to the $1.2 billion acquisition of Comedy Central, partially offset by operating cash flow contributed to Former Viacom. Stock Repurchase Program The Company has a $3.0 billion share repurchase program which was approved by the Former Viacom Board on December 8, 2005 and ratified by our Board on January 26, 2006. As of March 10, 2006, 17.3 million shares had been repurchased in the open market under the program for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $724 million, and an additional 2.0 million shares had been purchased under the NAIRI Agreement for an aggregate purchase price of $83.8 million. See "Transactions Among Companies Owned by or Affiliated with NAI" beginning on page II-29. Liquidity and Capital Resources Capital Structure Viacom Credit Agreement As of December 31, 2005, we had credit facilities totaling $9.25 billion, comprised of a $3.25 billion revolving facility due December 2010, and a $6.0 billion term facility with portions due in March 2007 and June 2007 (collectively, the "Credit Facilities"). The $3.25 billion revolving facility was entered into on December 8, 2005, and became effective on December 31, 2005. As of December 31, 2005, no amounts had been drawn against the facility (see Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements). The primary purpose of this facility is to fund short term liquidity needs and to support future commercial paper borrowings. The $6.0 billion term facility was also entered into on December 8, 2005, and became effective on December 29, 2005. As of II-17 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts) December 31, 2005, we had outstanding borrowings of $5.4 billion under the term facility which were used to pay the preliminary special dividend to Former Viacom. Borrowing rates under the Credit Facilities are determined at our option at the time of each borrowing and are based generally on the prime rate in the United States or the London Interbank Offer Rate plus a margin based on our senior unsecured credit rating. We also pay a facility fee based on the total amount of the commitments under the $3.25 billion facility and a portion of the $6.0 billion facility. At our option, we may borrow in certain foreign currencies up to specified limits under the $3.25 billion facility. The Credit Facilities contain covenants, which, among other things, require that we maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio. At December 31, 2005, we were in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Facilities. Pursuant to the Credit Facilities, we are not precluded from paying dividends. At December 31, 2005 2004 Notes payable to banks $ 5,405.0 $ Obligations under capital leases 352.9 345.1 Total debt 5,757.9 345.1 Less current portion 55.8 53.4 Total long-term debt from continuing operations, net of current portion $ 5,702.1 $ 291.7 The Company's scheduled maturities of long-term debt, excluding capital leases, outstanding at December 31, 2005 were as follows: 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 and thereafter Long-term debt $ $ 5,405.0 $ $ $ $ We believe that our operating cash flows, cash and cash equivalents, borrowing capacity under committed bank facilities and future access to capital markets will be sufficient to fund our operating needs, including commitments, contingencies, capital and investing commitments, and our financing requirements. The funding for commitments to purchase programming rights, film operations, and talent contracts will come primarily from cash flow from operations. We project anticipated cash requirements, which include capital expenditures, share purchases, acquisitions, and payments on our indebtedness, as well as cash flows generated from operating activities available to meet these needs. Any future net cash funding requirements are expected to be financed with short term borrowings and long-term debt. The Company anticipates that future debt maturities will be funded with cash and cash equivalents, cash flows generated from operating activities and future access to capital markets. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to access capital markets on terms and conditions that will be acceptable to it. There are no provisions in any of the Company's material financing agreements that would cause an acceleration of the obligation in the event of a downgrade in the Company's debt ratings. II-18 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts) As of December 31, 2005, our significant contractual obligations, including payments due by period, were as follows: Payments Due by Period Total 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 and thereafter Programming and talent commitments (1) $ 1,064.3 $ 318.0 $ 180.8 $ 167.9 $ 88.9 $ 68.8 $ 239.9 Operating leases (2) $ 859.7 $ 137.7 $ 127.9 $ 114.7 $ 105.4 $ 73.5 $ 300.5 Purchase obligations (3) $ 95.1 $ 82.3 $ 9.1 $ 1.7 $ 1.3 $ .7 $ Capital lease obligations (including interest) (4) $ 444.9 $ 76.8 $ 75.2 68.2 $ 64.7 $ 47.1 $ 112.9 Long-term debt $ 5,405.0 $ $ 5,405.0 $ $ $ $ Other long-term liabilities (5) $ 989.0 $ $ 539.9 $ 234.8 $ 100.7 $ 52.5 $ 61.1 (1) Programming and talent commitments primarily include $824.9 million relating to cable programming and feature film production and acquisitions and $234.4 million for talent contracts. (2) Includes long-term non-cancelable operating lease commitments for retail and office space and equipment, transponders, studio facilities and vehicles. (3) Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including open purchase orders. (4) Includes capital leases for satellite transponders. (5) Long-term contractual obligations primarily consist of participations due to producers and residuals and cable program liabilities. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Our off-balance sheet arrangements primarily consist of an accounts receivable securitization program and guarantees. Accounts Receivable Securitization Program As of December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, we had a total of $450.0 million outstanding under a revolving receivable securitization program. The program resulted in the sale of receivables on a non-recourse basis to unrelated third parties on a one-year renewable basis, thereby reducing accounts receivable and debt on our balance sheets. We enter into this arrangement because it provides an additional source of liquidity. The terms of the revolving securitization arrangement require that the receivable pools subject to the program meet certain performance ratios. We are in compliance with the required ratios under the receivable securitization program for all periods presented. Guarantees We follow the recognition provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 45, "Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others," which we refer to herein as "FIN 45," for guarantees, including indemnities, issued or modified after December 31, 2002. FIN 45 requires a guarantor to recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value of an obligation assumed by issuing a guarantee. FIN 45 also requires additional disclosures for certain guarantees. The adoption of FIN 45 did not have a significant impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. II-19 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts) In connection with the separation, we agreed to indemnify Former Viacom with respect to obligations as guarantor on certain Blockbuster store leases. Blockbuster's obligations under these store leases aggregated approximately $353.0 million at December 31, 2005. Certain leases contain renewal options that can extend the primary lease term and remain covered by the guarantees. Blockbuster's indemnification obligations are secured by a $150.0 million letter of credit. The estimated fair value of our indemnification obligation of approximately $53.1 million is reflected in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2005. Blockbuster has agreed to indemnify Former Viacom with respect to any amount paid under these guarantees. In the third quarter of 2005, Former Viacom sold Famous Players, an operator of movie theaters in Canada. Former Viacom may incur liabilities associated with Famous Players theater leases. Famous Players obligations under these theater leases aggregated approximately $1.02 billion at December 31, 2005. We agreed to indemnify CBS Corporation with respect to any liability under these theater leases. The estimated fair value of these indemnification obligations of approximately $179.9 million is reflected in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2005. In the fourth quarter of 2004, Former Viacom sold substantially all of its 50% equity interest in UCI, which operates movie theaters in Europe, Latin America and Asia. In connection with the separation, we agreed to indemnify CBS Corporation with respect to the obligations of Former Viacom as guarantor on certain UCI theater leases. These guarantees totaled approximately $152.4 million at December 31, 2005 and $177.0 million at December 31, 2004 and are secured by bank guarantees provided by the buyer. Former Viacom had guaranteed UCI's debt obligations under a revolving credit facility which was repaid during the fourth quarter of 2004, and contributed $29.1 million toward the repayment of UCI's debt obligation under the terms of this guarantee. We also own a 50% interest in WF Cinema Holdings, L.P. and a 35% interest in Grauman's Theaters LLC. Viacom has guaranteed certain of these theater leases. These guarantees totaled approximately $10.0 million at December 31, 2005 and $13.3 million at December 31, 2004. The lease guarantees would only be triggered upon non-payment by the respective primary obligors. These guarantees are not recorded on the balance sheet as of December 31, 2005 as they were provided by the Company prior to the adoption of FIN 45. We agreed to indemnify CBS Corporation with respect to any obligations of Viacom under these guarantees. Additionally, we have indemnification obligations with respect to letters of credit and surety bonds primarily used as security against non-performance in the normal course of business. The outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds approximated $29.8 million at December 31, 2005 and $24.8 million at December 31, 2004 and are not recorded on the balance sheet as of December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004. Legal Matters In July 2002, judgment was entered in favor of Former Viacom, Blockbuster, Paramount Home Entertainment and other major motion picture studios and their home video subsidiaries with respect to a complaint filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas. The complaint included federal antitrust and California state law claims. In August 2003, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed the federal court judgment. The U.S. Supreme Court refused plaintiffs' petition for writ of certiorari in March 2004. In February 2003, a similar complaint that had been filed in a Los Angeles County Superior Court was also dismissed with prejudice. The plaintiffs appealed the California state court dismissal, as well as a prior denial of class certification. On November 22, 2005, the California Court of Appeal affirmed the trial court's dismissal of the antitrust II-20 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts) and conspiracy claims. The court reversed the dismissal of California Unfair Practices Act and Unfair Competition Act claims and remanded those claims to the trial court, except with regard to transactions between Paramount and Blockbuster as to which the trial court dismissal was affirmed. Blockbuster remains a defendant in the case with respect to our transactions with studios other than Paramount. As the result of the split-off of Blockbuster from Former Viacom in 2004, any judgment in this matter adverse to Former Viacom, Blockbuster and/or Paramount Home Entertainment may be allocated 33.33% to Blockbuster and 66.67% to Former Viacom. Pursuant to the Separation Agreement, we have assumed and will indemnify CBS Corporation for Former Viacom's responsibility for losses in this matter. On July 13, 2005, two identical shareholder derivative lawsuits were filed against Former Viacom. The suits, consolidated as In re Viacom Shareholders Derivative Litigation , relate to the compensation of Sumner Redstone, Tom Freston and Leslie Moonves, each of whom were executive officers of Former Viacom. Mr. Redstone is currently our Executive Chairman of the Board and Founder and Mr. Freston is our President and Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Moonves is the President and Chief Executive Officer of CBS Corporation. The plaintiffs claim that the compensation of these officers was excessive and unwarranted and not entirely fair to Former Viacom and its shareholders. Plaintiffs seek disgorgement of compensation paid to the named officers in 2004, unspecified damages from members of Former Viacom's Board of Directors for alleged breach of fiduciary duty, and other relief. Prior to the separation, Former Viacom moved to dismiss the case on both procedural and substantive grounds. No decision has been rendered on the motion. Former Viacom also was served with several shareholder demands for business records under Delaware law in connection with the shareholders' purported investigations of similar claims. Under the Separation Agreement, liabilities in connection with executive compensation claims relating to officers of Former Viacom are shared equally by Viacom and CBS Corporation. In late 2005 and early 2006, Former Viacom was named as a defendant in three lawsuits in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas and one lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, each relating to the 2004 split-off of Blockbuster from Former Viacom. Each of the lawsuits names as defendants NAI, Former Viacom and Blockbuster, and certain of their respective present and former officers and directors, including some individuals who are officers and directors of New Viacom. The Texas lawsuits are purported class actions which allege violations of the federal securities laws. The New York case is a purported class action which alleges that the defendants breached fiduciary obligations to the Blockbuster Investment Plan in violation of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act by continuing to offer to plan participants Blockbuster stock from and after November 2003 and by offering to plan participants the opportunity to exchange their shares of Former Viacom common stock for the shares of Blockbuster common stock that were owned by Former Viacom in connection with the 2004 split-off transaction. Plaintiffs in each of the lawsuits allege that the defendants made untrue statements of material facts and concealed and failed to disclose material facts with respect to Blockbuster's business prospects. The lawsuits seek damages in unspecified amounts and other relief. In connection with the split-off, Blockbuster agreed to indemnify Former Viacom and its employees, officers and directors with respect to liabilities arising out of any material untrue statements and omissions in those portions of the 2004 Prospectus-Offer to Exchange relating to the split-off that were provided by Blockbuster. Pursuant to the Separation Agreement we will indemnify CBS Corporation for any losses arising from these lawsuits. We believe that the plaintiffs' positions in these litigations are without merit and intend to vigorously defend ourselves in the litigations. Litigation is inherently uncertain and always difficult to II-21 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts) predict. However, based on our understanding and evaluation of the relevant facts and circumstances, we believe that the above-described legal matters and other litigation to which it is a party are not likely, in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Market Risk We are exposed to market risk related to foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. We use or expect to use derivative financial instruments to modify exposure to risks from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. In accordance with our policy, we do not use derivative instruments unless there is an underlying exposure and therefore, we do not hold or enter into financial instruments for speculative trading purposes. Foreign Exchange Risk We conduct business in various countries outside the United States, resulting in exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates when translating from the foreign local currency to the U.S. dollar. In order to hedge anticipated cash flows and foreign currency balances in such currencies as the British Pound, the Australian Dollar, the Japanese Yen, the Canadian Dollar, the Singapore Dollar and the Euro, foreign currency forward and option contracts are used. Additionally, we designate forward contracts used to hedge future production costs as cash flow hedges, and designate certain forward contracts as a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation. The change in fair value of the non-designated contracts is included in current period earnings as part of "Other items, net." We manage the use of foreign exchange derivatives centrally. At December 31, 2005, the notional value of all foreign exchange contracts was $109.1 million, of which $33.6 million related to the hedging of future production costs. The remaining $75.5 million represents hedges of underlying foreign currency balances and expected foreign currency net cash flows. At December 31, 2004, the notional value of all foreign exchange contracts was $174.8 million, of which $74.6 million related to the hedging of future production costs. The remaining $100.2 million represents hedges of underlying foreign currency balances and expected foreign currency net cash flows. At December 31, 2003, the notional value of all foreign exchange contracts of $79.5 million represented hedges of underlying foreign currency balances and expected foreign currency net cash flows. Interest Rate Risk Our interest expense is exposed to movements in short-term rates. Swap agreements may be used to modify this exposure. As of December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, there were no interest rate swaps outstanding. We have variable-rate debt that had an outstanding balance of $5.4 billion as of December 31, 2005. Based on our variable-rate obligations outstanding at December 31, 2005, a 1% increase or decrease in the level of interest rates would, respectively, increase or decrease our annual interest expense and related cash payments by approximately $54.0 million. Such potential increases or decreases are based on certain simplifying assumptions, including a constant level of variable-rate debt for all maturities and an immediate, across-the-board increase or decrease in the level of interest rates with no other subsequent changes for the remainder of the period. Conversely, since almost all of our cash balance of approximately $361.1 million is invested in variable-rate interest earning assets, we would also earn more (less) interest income due to such an increase (decrease) in interest rates. Credit Risk We continually monitor our positions with, and credit quality of, the financial institutions which are counterparties to our financial instruments. We are exposed to credit loss in the event of II-22 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts) nonperformance by the counterparties to the agreements. However, we do not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties. Related Parties NAI, through NAIRI, Inc., is the controlling stockholder of both Viacom and CBS Corporation. Sumner M. Redstone, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and controlling shareholder of NAI, is the Executive Chairman of the Board and Founder of Viacom and CBS Corporation. Viacom and CBS Corporation Related Party Transactions Through our normal course of business, we are involved in transactions with companies owned by or affiliated with CBS Corporation. Through Paramount Pictures, we license motion picture products to CBS Corporation. Paramount Pictures also distributes certain television products on behalf of CBS television in the home entertainment market. MTV Networks and BET recognize advertising revenues for media spending placed by various subsidiaries of CBS Corporation. In addition, we are also involved in transactions with Simon & Schuster and Paramount Parks, wholly owned subsidiaries of CBS Corporation. Total revenues from these transactions were $154.9 million, $157.4 million, and $221.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Through MTV Networks and BET, we purchase television programming from CBS Corporation. The cost of these purchases is initially recorded as program rights inventory and amortized over the life of the contract. In addition, we place advertisements with various subsidiaries of CBS Corporation. The total related party purchases were $173.6 million, of which $78.8 million was for purchases of advertising, $378.2 million, of which $214.1 million was for purchases of programming, and $186.8 million, of which $112.0 million was for purchases of programming, for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Transactions with CBS Corporation through the normal course of business, are settled in cash. The following table presents the amounts due from or due to CBS Corporation as reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets: At December 31, 2005 At December 31, 2004 Amounts Due from CBS Corporation Receivables $ 75.0 $ 66.8 Other assets 67.3 88.4 Total Due from CBS Corporation $ 142.3 $ 155.2 Amounts Due to CBS Corporation Accounts payable $ 12.4 $ 13.2 Participants' share, residuals and royalties payable 40.6 9.8 Program rights, current 182.8 177.3 Deferred income, current 13.0 15.0 Other liabilities (program rights, non-current) 238.2 383.4 Total Due to CBS Corporation $ 487.0 $ 598.7 In connection with the separation, we entered into a Separation Agreement with CBS Corporation that identified assets to be transferred, liabilities to be assumed and obligations of each company following the separation, including indemnification obligations for such liabilities. In addition, we II-23 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts) entered into a Transition Services Agreement and a Tax Matters Agreement with CBS Corporation. Such arrangements are further described below and in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Through the normal course of our business, we are involved in transactions with other affiliated companies that have not been material in any of the periods presented. Separation Agreement The following description of the principal provisions of the Separation Agreement between Former Viacom and us is qualified by reference to the text of the Separation Agreement, which is filed as an exhibit to this annual report. Overview The Separation Agreement contains the key provisions required to effect the separation of Former Viacom into Viacom and CBS Corporation. The Separation Agreement identified assets transferred, liabilities assumed and contracts assigned to us by CBS Corporation and to CBS Corporation by us in the separation, and described when and how these transfers, assumptions and assignments were to occur. The Separation Agreement also set forth certain agreements between us and CBS Corporation with respect to the period following the separation date. Former Viacom and Viacom executed the Separation Agreement December 19, 2005. Transfer of Assets and Assumption of Liabilities The Separation Agreement provided that, subject to the terms and conditions contained in the Separation Agreement, among other matters: All of the assets of Former Viacom primarily related to the Viacom business, as well as certain other specific assets, were retained by or transferred to Viacom or one of Viacom's subsidiaries; Liabilities of Former Viacom were allocated to and assumed by Viacom to the extent they are related to Viacom's business, as well as certain other specified liabilities; Liabilities and assets of Former Viacom not retained by or transferred to us will be liabilities and assets of CBS Corporation; Specified liabilities related to Blockbuster, Famous Players and UCI were assumed by Viacom; and Viacom assumed 50% of any liabilities (i) under applicable law, including U.S. federal or state securities laws, arising from or relating to any documents filed with any governmental authorities, including the SEC, at or prior to the date of the separation in connection with the separation, (ii) arising from or relating to any action commenced with respect to the separation against Former Viacom, us or CBS Corporation and (iii) except to the extent otherwise allocated to Viacom or CBS Corporation, arising from, relating to or involving a general corporate matter of Former Viacom, including any claim under U.S. federal or state securities laws or for breach of fiduciary duty, that relates to events that took place prior to the date of the separation. Special Cash Dividend to Former Viacom In accordance with the terms of the Separation Agreement, on December 29, 2005 the Company paid a preliminary special dividend to the Former Viacom of $5.4 billion, which amount is subject to adjustment as more fully described above and in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. Expenses Under the Separation Agreement, Viacom is responsible for transaction costs up to $195.0 million and Viacom and CBS Corporation are equally responsible for any amounts over $195.0 million. We recorded $163.5 million in 2005 in separation costs principally for professional services fees. II-24 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Indemnification Obligations Pursuant to the Separation Agreement, each company indemnified the other company and the other company's officers, directors and employees for any losses arising out of its failure to perform or discharge any of the liabilities it assumed pursuant to the Separation Agreement, its businesses as conducted as of the date of the separation and its breaches of shared contracts. Legal Matters In general, under the Separation Agreement, Viacom assumed the liability for, and control of, all pending and threatened legal matters related to its own business or assumed liabilities and will indemnify the other party for any liability arising out of or resulting from such assumed legal matters. Liability for, and control of, future litigation claims against Viacom for events that took place prior to, on or after the date of the separation generally will be assumed by the company operating the business to which the claim relates or, in the case of businesses which were sold or discontinued prior to the date of the separation, or for other matters agreed to be indemnified, the company which has assumed the liabilities. Viacom agreed to cooperate in defending any claims against both of Viacom and CBS Corporation for events that took place prior to, on, or after the date of the separation. Employee Matters The Separation Agreement allocated liabilities and responsibilities relating to employee compensation and benefit plans and programs and other related matters in connection with the separation, including the treatment of certain outstanding annual and long-term incentive awards, existing deferred compensation obligations and certain retirement and welfare benefit obligations. In general, the Separation Agreement provides that, following the separation, Viacom is responsible for all employment and benefit-related obligations and liabilities related to current employees who work for Viacom immediately following the separation, former Former Viacom employees who most recently worked for other businesses and operations that became part of Viacom immediately following the separation, former Former Viacom employees who most recently worked for certain other businesses and operations that were sold or discontinued prior to the separation, and certain other former employees of Former Viacom as set forth in the Separation Agreement (and, in each case, their dependents and beneficiaries). Liability for benefit-related obligations and liabilities of former employees of Former Viacom who most recently worked for the Former Viacom corporate office or the Paramount Pictures corporate office (other than those who accepted a post-separation position with CBS Corporation or Viacom) and certain Former Viacom corporate office employees who will remain employed by CBS Corporation and provide transition services following the separation is shared equally by Viacom and CBS Corporation. Effective as of the separation, employees of Viacom, other than overlapping employees, do not participate in Former Viacom's employee benefit plans and Viacom established its own employee benefit plans that are substantially similar to the plans sponsored by Former Viacom prior to the separation. The Separation Agreement provided for the transfer of assets and liabilities, as applicable, relating to the pre-separation participation of Viacom employees and certain former Former Viacom employees (as set forth in the Separation Agreement) in various Former Viacom retirement, welfare, incentive compensation and employee benefit plans from such plans to the applicable new plans established by Viacom. Limitations on Certain Acquisitions Subject to limited exceptions, the Separation Agreement provides that none of Viacom, any subsidiary of Viacom or any person that is controlled by Viacom after the separation will own or acquire an interest in a radio or television broadcast station, television broadcast network or daily newspaper, if such ownership or acquisition would (i) cause CBS Corporation, any subsidiary of CBS Corporation or any entity controlled by CBS Corporation after the date of the separation to be in violation of U.S. federal laws limiting the ownership or control of radio broadcast II-25 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts) stations, television broadcast stations, television broadcast networks or (ii) limit in any manner at any time under such laws CBS Corporation's ability to acquire additional interests in a radio or television broadcast station and/or television broadcast network. These restrictions will terminate when none of Mr. Redstone, NAI, NAIRI or any of their successors, assigns or transferees are deemed to have interests in both CBS Corporation and Viacom that are attributable under applicable U.S. federal laws. The Separation Agreement also provides that neither Viacom, any subsidiary of Viacom or any person controlled by Viacom nor CBS Corporation, any subsidiary of CBS Corporation or any person controlled by CBS Corporation will acquire any asset, enter into any agreement or accept or agree to any condition that purports to bind, or subjects to a legal order, the other company, its subsidiaries or any person it controls without such other party's written consent. In addition, neither Viacom, any subsidiary of Viacom or any person controlled by Viacom nor CBS Corporation, or subsidiary of CBS Corporation or any person controlled by CBS Corporation will own or acquire an interest in a cable television operator if such ownership would subject the other company to any U.S. federal laws regulating contractual relationships between video programming vendors and video programming distributors to which it is not then subject. These restrictions will terminate for each company on the earliest of (1) the fourth anniversary of the separation, (2) the date on which none of Mr. Redstone, NAI, NAIRI or any of their successors, assigns or transferees are deemed to have interests in both CBS Corporation and Viacom that are attributable under applicable U.S. federal laws and (3) the date on which the other company ceases to own the video programming vendors that it owns as of the separation. Dispute Resolution The Separation Agreement provides that each company will use commercially reasonable efforts to resolve expeditiously any disputes between the parties on a mutually acceptable negotiated basis, which may include the escalation of any dispute to senior management of each company or, in certain cases, the appropriate strategic business unit or division at either company. If the companies are unable to resolve disputes in this manner, they will be referred to a committee consisting of one non-overlapping director from each company and, if still not resolved, such disputes will be resolved through arbitration. Tax Matters Agreement The following description of the principal provisions of the Tax Matters Agreement between Former Viacom and us is qualified by reference to the text of the Tax Matters Agreement, a form of which was filed as an exhibit to this annual report. The Tax Matters Agreement sets forth Viacom's responsibilities with respect to, among other things, liabilities for federal, state, local and foreign income taxes for periods before and including the merger, the preparation and filing of income tax returns for such periods, disputes with taxing authorities regarding income taxes for such periods and indemnification for income taxes that would become due if the merger were taxable. Viacom will generally be responsible for federal, state and local, and foreign income taxes for periods before the merger relating to Viacom's respective businesses. Income tax liabilities relating to discontinued operations and previously disposed businesses have been allocated in accordance with the principles applicable under the Separation Agreement for liabilities relating to those operations and businesses. Other income tax liabilities, including items that do not specifically relate to either business, will be shared equally. Viacom and CBS Corporation will generally be jointly responsible for managing any dispute relating to income taxes for which both parties may be responsible. The Tax Matters Agreement also provides that, depending on the event, Viacom may have to indemnify CBS Corporation, or CBS Corporation may have to indemnify Viacom, for some or all of the taxes resulting from the transactions related to the merger and the distribution of Viacom common stock if the merger and distribution do not qualify as tax-free under Sections 355 and 368 of the Code. II-26 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Transition Services Agreement Viacom and CBS Corporation entered into a Transition Services Agreement pursuant to which Viacom and CBS Corporation will provide certain specified services to each other on an interim basis following the separation, including the following services: general information systems and technology services, benefits and human resource information systems, uplinking facilities, payroll services, domain name administration, web hosting services and other limited services consistent with past practices for terms ranging from six months to three years. In connection with the Transition Services Agreement, the Company will provide CBS Corporation and CBS Corporation will provide the Company with various support services for certain of their respective businesses including data center, payroll and uplink services for various periods subsequent to the date of separation. No amounts have been reflected in the accompanying Consolidated Income Statements as the separation occurred on December 31, 2005. Transactions Among Companies Owned by or Affiliated with NAI NAI licenses films in the ordinary course of business for its motion picture theaters from all major studios including Paramount Pictures. During the year ended December 31, 2005 and for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, NAI made payments to Paramount Pictures in the aggregate amounts of approximately $14.6 million, $11.2 million and $9.6 million, respectively. NAI and Mr. Redstone owned in the aggregate approximately 88% of the common stock of Midway Games Inc. ("Midway") as of March 9, 2006. Midway places advertisements on several of Viacom's cable networks from time to time. During the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, transactions with Midway totaled approximately $5.9 million, $5.5 million and $1.4 million, respectively. We believe that these transactions were no more or less favorable to us than would have obtained from unrelated parties. We may continue to enter into similar business transactions with Midway in the future. On December 21, 2005, Viacom entered into an agreement with NAI and NAIRI (the "NAIRI Agreement") pursuant to which Viacom agreed to buy, and NAI and NAIRI agreed to sell, a number of shares of Viacom Class B common stock each month such that the ownership percentage of Viacom Class A common stock and Viacom Class B common stock (considered as a single class) held by NAI and/or NAIRI would not increase as a result of purchases by Viacom of shares of Viacom common stock under Viacom's $3.0 billion stock purchase program which was approved, along with the NAIRI Agreement, by the Former Viacom Board on December 8, 2005 and ratified by our Board on January 26, 2006. As of March 10, 2006, 2.0 million shares had been purchased under the NAIRI Agreement for an aggregate purchase price of $83.8 million. In September 2005, Cinemas International Corporation N.V., a joint venture between Former Viacom and Vivendi Universal, agreed to sell its Brazilian movie operations to NAI for approximately $27.5 million in a transaction that closed in October 2005. The sale was discussed with multiple potential purchasers and negotiated on terms we believe are no more or less favorable than those that might have been negotiated with an unaffiliated party. In the normal course of business, we are involved in other related party transactions that have not been material in any of the periods presented. II-27 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Critical Accounting Policies Financial Reporting Release No. 60, "Cautionary Advice Regarding Disclosure About Critical Accounting Policies," which we refer to herein as "FRR 60," suggests companies provide additional disclosure and commentary on those accounting policies considered most critical. FRR 60 considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to a company's financial condition and results of operations, and requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in their application. For a summary of our significant accounting policies, including the critical accounting policies discussed below, see the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements. The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, which are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The result of these evaluations forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amount of expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions. The following accounting policies require significant management judgments and estimates. Motion Picture Accounting Feature film exploitation revenues and related expenses are recognized in accordance with Statement of Position 00-2 "Accounting by Producers or Distributors of Films," which we refer to herein as "SOP 00-2." Revenues from theatrical distribution of motion pictures are recognized when motion pictures are exhibited. Revenues from home entertainment product sales, net of anticipated returns, are recognized upon shipment to our customers. Revenues from the licensing of feature films and television programming for exhibition in television markets are recognized upon or availability of the material for telecasting by the licensee and when certain other conditions are met. Sales Returns and Uncollectible Accounts At the time of sale of home entertainment product and consumer products, we record as a reduction of revenue the estimated impact of returns, rebates and other incentives. In determining the estimate of product sales that will be returned, management analyzes historical returns, current economics trends and changes in customer demand and acceptance of our product. Based on management's analysis of sales returns and allowances reserves totaling $401 million and $275 million have been established at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Management also continually evaluates accounts receivable and makes judgments as to their ultimate collectibility. Judgments and estimates are involved, including an analysis of specific risks on a customer-by-customer basis for larger accounts, and an analysis of receivables aging that determines the percentage that has historically been uncollected by aged category. Using this information management reserves an amount that is estimated to be uncollectible. Based on management's analysis of uncollectible accounts, reserves totaling $138.6 million and $124.1 million have been established at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. II-28 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Multiple-Element Transactions Multiple element transactions involve situations where judgment must be exercised in determining the fair value of the different elements in a bundled transaction. Multiple element transactions can involve: Contemporaneous purchases and sales. We sell a product, for example the sale of advertising time, to a customer and at the same time purchase goods or services from that customer. We account for each transaction negotiated contemporaneously based on the respective fair values of the goods or services purchased and the goods sold. In determining the fair value of the respective elements we refer to quoted market prices, historical transactions or comparable cash transactions. In addition, evidence of fair value for one element of a transaction may provide support for the fair value of the other element of a transaction. Sales of multiple products or services. We sell multiple products to a counterparty, for example we enter into an affiliation agreement with a cable system operator for the carriage of several of our cable networks. If we have objective fair value evidence for each deliverable in the transaction then we account for each deliverable separately, based on the relevant revenue recognition policies. Purchases of multiple products or services, or the settlement of an outstanding item contemporaneous with the purchase of a product or service. We purchase multiple products or services from a counterparty; for example one of our cable networks licenses a package of programming from a counterparty to air over a period of time. If we have objective fair value evidence for each product or service being purchased then we account for each item separately, based on the relevant cost recognition policies. Gross Versus Net Revenue Recognition In the normal course of business we act as or use an agent in the distribution activities of feature film and DVD exploitation. To the extent revenues are recorded on a gross basis, any commissions or other payments to third parties are recorded as expenses so that the net amount, gross revenues less distribution expenses, is reflected in Operating Income. To the extent we are acting as a principal in a transaction, we report revenue on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in a transaction, we report revenue on a net basis. In determining whether we are acting as principal or agent in a transaction we exercise judgment and base our evaluation pursuant to EITF 99-19 "Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent". Program Rights The Company acquires rights to programming and produces programming to exhibit on its cable networks. The costs incurred in acquiring and producing programs are capitalized and amortized over the license period or projected useful life of the programming. Program rights and the related costs are recorded when the license period has begun, and when the program is accepted and available for airing. Pension Pension benefit obligations and net periodic pension costs are calculated using many actuarial assumptions. Two key assumptions used in accounting for pension liabilities and expenses are the discount rate and expected rate of return on plan assets. The discount rate reflects the rate at which the pension benefit obligations could effectively be settled. The Company used investment grade corporate bond yields to support its discount rate assumption. The expected return on plan assets assumption was derived using the current and expected asset allocation as well as expected returns on various classes of the pension plan assets. For 2005, the II-29 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts) unrecognized actuarial loss for pension increased principally as a result of increasing the rate of compensation increase for the Company's major plans from 3.5% in 2004 to 4.0% in 2005 causing higher expected payouts in future periods. A decrease in the discount rate or a decrease in the expected rate of return on plan assets would increase pension expense. The estimated impact of a 25 basis point change in the discount rate would be a change of approximately $4.1 million on 2005 pension expense and would change the projected benefit obligation by approximately $22.2 million. The estimated impact of a 25 basis point change in the expected rate of return on plan assets is a change of approximately $.5 million. Taxes We estimate the effective tax rates and associated liabilities or assets for each legal entity in accordance with SFAS 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes". Our annual tax rate is based on our taxable earnings, statutory U.S. federal, state, and foreign tax rates as well as tax planning strategies implemented by us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgment is required in determining the annual tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions. An estimated effective tax rate for a year is applied to quarterly operating results. In the event there is a significant or unusual item recognized in the quarterly operating results, the tax attributable to that item is separately calculated and recorded at the same time as that item. We consider tax benefits from the resolution of prior year tax matters to be such items. Deferred income taxes and the significant items giving rise to the deferred assets and liabilities reflect management's assessment of actual future taxes to be paid on items reflected in the financial statements, giving consideration to both timing and the probability of realization. Actual income taxes could vary from these estimates due to future changes in income tax law. We also establish reserves when we believe that certain positions, while supportable, are probable to be challenged by the tax authorities. These reserves, along with any related interest, are adjusted, when facts and circumstances change, such as the progress of a tax audit. Goodwill, Intangible Assets, Long-Lived Assets and Investments We test goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment at least annually to ensure the fair value of our reporting units continue to exceed the related book value in accordance with SFAS 142. A reporting unit can be a reportable segment or a level below the reportable segment. A significant downward revision in the present value of estimated future cash flows for a reporting unit could result in an impairment of goodwill and a non-cash charge would be required. In accordance with SFAS 144, we record impairment charges on long-lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired, the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount of those assets and the net book value of the assets exceeds their estimated fair value. In making these determinations, we use certain assumptions, including, but not limited to: (i) estimated fair value of the assets; and (ii) estimated future cash flows expected to be generated by these assets, which are based on additional assumptions such as asset utilization, length of service and estimated salvage values. The determination of the cash flows in testing goodwill, intangibles and long-lived assets is based upon assumptions and forecasts that may not be representative of actual future performance. We did not record any impairment charges for continuing operations during the years presented. Recent Pronouncements In May 2005, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 154 "Accounting Changes and Error Corrections," which we refer to herein as "SFAS 154," a replacement of APB II-30 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Opinion No. 20, "Accounting Changes," and FASB Statement No. 3, "Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements," which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. SFAS 154 changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a voluntary change in accounting principle as well as the changes required by an accounting pronouncement which does not include specific transition provisions. Viacom does not expect the implementation of SFAS 154 to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," which we refer to herein as "SFAS 123," (revised 2004) "Share-Based Payment," which we refer to herein as "SFAS 123R." SFAS 123R revises SFAS 123 and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," which we refer to herein as "APB 25." SFAS 123R requires companies to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on grant-date fair value of the award. That cost will be recognized over the vesting period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award. On April 14, 2005, the SEC issued a ruling that amended the effective date for SFAS 123R. As a result, we adopted SFAS 123R effective January 1, 2006. The standard provides for a prospective application. Under this method, the Company will begin recognizing compensation cost for equity based compensation of all new or modified grants after the date of adoption. In addition, the Company will recognize the unvested portion of the grant date fair value of awards issued prior to the adoption based on the fair values previously calculated for disclosure purposes. At December 31, 2005, the aggregate value of unvested options as determined using a Black-Scholes option valuation model, was $64.4 million. Upon adoption of SFAS 123R, the majority of this amount will be recognized over the remaining vesting period of these options. 2005 Pro Forma Financial Information In order to provide readers with a more meaningful basis of comparison of our 2005 results with results in future periods, information relating to revenues, pro forma operating income, pro forma net earnings from continuing operations and net earnings from continuing operations per share has been provided in the following table. There are no pro forma adjustments to revenues. This pro forma financial information is presented as if the separation had occurred at the beginning of 2005. Management believes the assumptions and allocations are reasonable. However, the pro forma results do not necessarily represent what the actual results would have been had Viacom been a stand alone public company; nor are they necessarily indicative of future results. II-31 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts) The following supplemental financial data presented for the year ended December 31, 2005, are intended to facilitate analysis of our business and operating performance.

Diluted EPS is computed by dividing net earnings by the number of shares issued and outstanding at the date of separation adjusted to give effect to all potentially dilutive common shares weighted for the full year-ended December 31, 2005.
