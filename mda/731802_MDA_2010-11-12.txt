ITEM 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. INTRODUCTION This section provides management discussion of the financial condition, changes in financial condition and results of operations of Atmos Energy Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries with specific information on results of operations and liquidity and capital resources. It includes management interpretation of our financial results, the factors affecting these results, the major factors expected to affect future operating results and future investment and financing plans. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. Several factors exist that could influence our future financial performance, some of which are described in Item 1A above, Risk Factors . They should be considered in connection with evaluating forward-looking statements contained in this report or otherwise made by or on behalf of us since these factors could cause actual results and conditions to differ materially from those set out in such forward-looking statements. Cautionary Statement for the Purposes of the Safe Harbor under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 The statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. All statements other than statements of historical fact included in this Report are forward-looking statements made in good faith by us and are intended to qualify for the safe harbor from liability established by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. When used in this Report, or any other of our documents or oral presentations, the words anticipate , believe , estimate , expect , forecast , goal , intend , objective , plan , projection , seek , strategy or similar words are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the statements relating to our strategy, operations, markets, services, rates, recovery of costs, availability of gas supply and other factors. These risks and uncertainties include the following: our ability to continue to access the credit markets to satisfy our liquidity requirements; the impact of adverse economic conditions on our customers; increased costs of providing pension and postretirement health care benefits and increased funding requirements along with increased costs of health care benefits; market risks beyond our control affecting our risk management activities including market liquidity, commodity price volatility, increasing interest rates and counterparty creditworthiness; regulatory trends and decisions, including the impact of rate proceedings before various state regulatory commissions; possible increased federal, state and local regulation of the safety of our operations; increased federal regulatory oversight and potential penalties; the impact of environmental regulations on our business; the impact of possible future additional regulatory and financial risks associated with global warming and climate change on our business; the concentration of our distribution, pipeline and storage operations in Texas; adverse weather conditions; the effects of inflation and changes in the availability and price of natural gas; the capital-intensive nature of our gas distribution business; increased competition from energy suppliers and alternative forms of energy; the inherent hazards and risks involved in operating our gas distribution business, natural disasters, terrorist activities or other events, and other risks and uncertainties discussed herein, especially those discussed in Item 1A above, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control. Accordingly, while we believe these forward-looking statements to be reasonable, there can be no assurance that they will approximate actual experience or that the expectations derived from them will be realized. Further, we undertake no obligation to update or revise any of our forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Our consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We based our estimates on historical experience and various 35 Table of Contents other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to risk management and trading activities, fair value measurements, allowance for doubtful accounts, legal and environmental accruals, insurance accruals, pension and postretirement obligations, deferred income taxes and valuation of goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets. Our critical accounting policies are reviewed by the Audit Committee quarterly. Actual results may differ from estimates. Regulation Our natural gas distribution and regulated transmission and storage operations are subject to regulation with respect to rates, service, maintenance of accounting records and various other matters by the respective regulatory authorities in the states in which we operate. We meet the criteria established within accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of a cost-based, rate-regulated entity, which requires us to reflect the financial effects of the ratemaking and accounting practices and policies of the various regulatory commissions in our financial statements in accordance with applicable authoritative accounting standards. We apply the provisions of this standard to our regulated operations and record regulatory assets for costs that have been deferred for which future recovery through customer rates is considered probable and regulatory liabilities when it is probable that revenues will be reduced for amounts that will be credited to customers through the ratemaking process. As a result, certain costs that would normally be expensed under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States are permitted to be capitalized or deferred on the balance sheet because it is probable they can be recovered through rates. Discontinuing the application of this method of accounting for regulatory assets and liabilities could significantly increase our operating expenses as fewer costs would likely be capitalized or deferred on the balance sheet, which could reduce our net income. Further, regulation may impact the period in which revenues or expenses are recognized. The amounts to be recovered or recognized are based upon historical experience and our understanding of the regulations. The impact of regulation on our regulated operations may be affected by decisions of the regulatory authorities or the issuance of new regulations. Revenue recognition Sales of natural gas to our natural gas distribution customers are billed on a monthly basis; however, the billing cycle periods for certain classes of customers do not necessarily coincide with accounting periods used for financial reporting purposes. We follow the revenue accrual method of accounting for natural gas distribution segment revenues whereby revenues applicable to gas delivered to customers, but not yet billed under the cycle billing method, are estimated and accrued and the related costs are charged to expense. On occasion, we are permitted to implement new rates that have not been formally approved by our regulatory authorities, which are subject to refund. We recognize this revenue and establish a reserve for amounts that could be refunded based on our experience for the jurisdiction in which the rates were implemented. Rates established by regulatory authorities are adjusted for increases and decreases in our purchased gas costs through purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms. Purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms provide gas utility companies a method of recovering purchased gas costs on an ongoing basis without filing a rate case to address all of the utility company non-gas costs. These mechanisms are commonly utilized when regulatory authorities recognize a particular type of cost, such as purchased gas costs, that (i) is subject to significant price fluctuations compared to the utility company other costs, (ii) represents a large component of the utility company cost of service and (iii) is generally outside the control of the gas utility company. There is no gross profit generated through purchased gas cost adjustments, but they provide a dollar-for-dollar offset to increases or decreases in utility gas costs. Although substantially all natural gas distribution sales to our customers fluctuate with the cost of gas that we purchase, our gross profit is generally not affected by fluctuations in the cost of gas as a result of the purchased gas cost adjustment mechanism. The effects of these purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms are recorded as deferred gas costs on our balance sheet. Operating revenues for our regulated transmission and storage and pipeline, storage and other segments are recognized in the period in which actual volumes are transported and storage services are provided. Operating revenues for our natural gas marketing segment and the associated carrying value of natural gas inventory (inclusive of storage costs) are recognized when we sell the gas and physically deliver it to our 36 Table of Contents customers. Operating revenues include realized gains and losses arising from the settlement of financial instruments used in our natural gas marketing activities and unrealized gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of natural gas inventory designated as a hedged item in a fair value hedge and the associated financial instruments. Allowance for doubtful accounts Accounts receivable arise from natural gas sales to residential, commercial, industrial, municipal and other customers. For the majority of our receivables, we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts based on our collections experience. On certain other receivables where we are aware of a specific customer inability or reluctance to pay, we record an allowance for doubtful accounts against amounts due to reduce the net receivable balance to the amount we reasonably expect to collect. However, if circumstances change, our estimate of the recoverability of accounts receivable could be affected. Circumstances which could affect our estimates include, but are not limited to, customer credit issues, the level of natural gas prices, customer deposits and general economic conditions. Accounts are written off once they are deemed to be uncollectible. Financial instruments and hedging activities We currently use financial instruments to mitigate commodity price risk. Additionally, we periodically use financial instruments to manage interest rate risk. The objectives and strategies for using financial instruments have been tailored to meet the needs of our regulated and nonregulated businesses. We record all of our financial instruments on the balance sheet at fair value as required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States , with changes in fair value ultimately recorded in the income statement. The timing of when changes in fair value of our financial instruments are recorded in the income statement depends on whether the financial instrument has been designated and qualifies as a part of a hedging relationship or if regulatory rulings require a different accounting treatment. Changes in fair value for financial instruments that do not meet one of these criteria are recognized in the income statement as they occur. Financial Instruments Associated with Commodity Price Risk In our natural gas distribution segment, our customers are exposed to the effect of volatile natural gas prices. We manage this exposure through a combination of physical storage, fixed-price forward contracts and financial instruments, primarily over-the-counter swap and option contracts, in an effort to minimize the impact of natural gas price volatility on our customers during the winter heating season. The costs associated with and the gains and losses arising from the use of financial instruments to mitigate commodity price risk in this segment are included in our purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms in accordance with regulatory requirements. Therefore, changes in the fair value of these financial instruments are initially recorded as a component of deferred gas costs and recognized in the consolidated statement of income as a component of purchased gas cost when the related costs are recovered through our rates and recognized in revenue in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Accordingly, there is no earnings impact to our natural gas distribution segment as a result of the use of financial instruments. Our natural gas marketing segment aggregates and purchases gas supply, arranges transportation and/or storage logistics and ultimately delivers gas to our customers at competitive prices. We also perform asset optimization activities in both our natural gas marketing segment and pipeline, storage and other segment. As a result of these activities, our nonregulated operations are exposed to risks associated with changes in the market price of natural gas. We manage our exposure to the risk of natural gas price changes through a combination of physical storage and financial instruments, including futures, over-the-counter and exchange-traded options and swap contracts with counterparties. In our natural gas marketing and pipeline, storage and other segments, we have designated the natural gas inventory held by these operating segments as the hedged item in a fair-value hedge. This inventory is marked to market at the end of each month based on the Gas Daily index, with changes in fair value recognized as unrealized gains or losses in revenue in the period of change. The financial instruments associated with this natural gas inventory have been designated as fair-value hedges and are marked to market each month based upon the NYMEX price with changes in fair value recognized as unrealized gains or losses in revenue in the period of change. Changes in the spreads between the forward natural gas prices used to value the financial 37 Table of Contents instruments designated against our physical inventory (NYMEX) and the market (spot) prices used to value our physical storage (Gas Daily) result in unrealized margins until the underlying physical gas is withdrawn and the related financial instruments are settled. The difference in the spot price used to value our physical inventory and the forward price used to value the related financial instruments can result in volatility in our reported income as a component of unrealized margins. We have elected to exclude this spot/forward differential for purposes of assessing the effectiveness of these fair-value hedges. Once the gas is withdrawn and the financial instruments are settled, the previously unrealized margins associated with these net positions are realized. Over time, we expect gains and losses on the sale of storage gas inventory to be offset by gains and losses on the fair-value hedges, resulting in the realization of the economic gross profit margin we anticipated at the time we structured the original transaction. We have elected to treat fixed-price forward contracts used in our natural gas marketing segment to deliver gas as normal purchases and normal sales. As such, these deliveries are recorded on an accrual basis in accordance with our revenue recognition policy. Financial instruments used to mitigate the commodity price risk associated with these contracts have been designated as cash flow hedges of anticipated purchases and sales at indexed prices. Accordingly, unrealized gains and losses on open financial instruments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and are recognized in earnings as a component of revenue when the hedged volumes are sold. Hedge ineffectiveness, to the extent incurred, is reported as a component of revenue. We also use storage swaps and futures to capture additional storage arbitrage opportunities in our natural gas marketing segment that arise after the execution of the original fair value hedge associated with our physical natural gas inventory, basis swaps to insulate and protect the economic value of our fixed price and storage books and various over-the-counter and exchange-traded options. These financial instruments have not been designated as hedges. Financial Instruments Associated with Interest Rate Risk We periodically manage interest rate risk, typically when we issue new or refinance existing long-term debt with Treasury lock agreements to fix the Treasury yield component of the interest cost associated with anticipated financings. We designate these Treasury lock agreements as a cash flow hedge of an anticipated transaction at the time the agreements are executed. Accordingly, unrealized gains and losses associated with the Treasury lock agreements were recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The realized gain or loss recognized upon settlement of each Treasury lock agreement was initially recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and is recognized as a component of interest expense over the life of the related financing arrangement. Impairment assessments We perform impairment assessments of our goodwill, intangible assets subject to amortization and long-lived assets. As of September 30, 2010, we had no indefinite-lived intangible assets. We annually evaluate our goodwill balances for impairment during our second fiscal quarter or as impairment indicators arise. We use a present value technique based on discounted cash flows to estimate the fair value of our reporting units. We have determined our reporting units to be each of our natural gas distribution divisions and wholly-owned subsidiaries and goodwill is allocated to the reporting units responsible for the acquisition that gave rise to the goodwill. The discounted cash flow calculations used to assess goodwill impairment are dependent on several subjective factors including the timing of future cash flows, future growth rates and the discount rate. An impairment charge is recognized if the carrying value of a reporting unit goodwill exceeds its fair value. We annually assess whether the cost of our intangible assets subject to amortization or other long-lived assets is recoverable or that the remaining useful lives may warrant revision. We perform this assessment more frequently when specific events or circumstances have occurred that suggest the recoverability of the cost of the intangible and other long-lived assets is at risk. When such events or circumstances are present, we assess the recoverability of these assets by determining whether the carrying value will be recovered through expected future cash flows from the 38 Table of Contents operating division or subsidiary to which these assets relate. These cash flow projections consider various factors such as the timing of the future cash flows and the discount rate and are based upon the best information available at the time the estimate is made. Changes in these factors could materially affect the cash flow projections and result in the recognition of an impairment charge. An impairment charge is recognized as the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the related asset. Pension and other postretirement plans Pension and other postretirement plan costs and liabilities are determined on an actuarial basis and are affected by numerous assumptions and estimates including the market value of plan assets, estimates of the expected return on plan assets, assumed discount rates and current demographic and actuarial mortality data. Prior to fiscal 2009, we reviewed the estimates and assumptions underlying our pension and other postretirement plan costs and liabilities annually based upon a June 30 measurement date. Effective October 1, 2008, we changed our measurement date to September 30. The assumed discount rate and the expected return are the assumptions that generally have the most significant impact on our pension costs and liabilities. The assumed discount rate, the assumed health care cost trend rate and assumed rates of retirement generally have the most significant impact on our postretirement plan costs and liabilities. The discount rate is utilized principally in calculating the actuarial present value of our pension and postretirement obligations and net periodic pension and postretirement benefit plan costs. When establishing our discount rate, we consider high quality corporate bond rates based on bonds available in the marketplace that are suitable for settling the obligations, changes in those rates from the prior year and the implied discount rate that is derived from matching our projected benefit disbursements with currently available high quality corporate bonds. The expected long-term rate of return on assets is utilized in calculating the expected return on plan assets component of our annual pension and postretirement plan costs. We estimate the expected return on plan assets by evaluating expected bond returns, equity risk premiums, asset allocations, the effects of active plan management, the impact of periodic plan asset rebalancing and historical performance. We also consider the guidance from our investment advisors in making a final determination of our expected rate of return on assets. To the extent the actual rate of return on assets realized over the course of a year is greater than or less than the assumed rate, that year annual pension or postretirement plan costs are not affected. Rather, this gain or loss reduces or increases future pension or postretirement plan costs over a period of approximately ten to twelve years. The market-related value of our plan assets represents the fair market value of the plan assets, adjusted to smooth out short-term market fluctuations over a five-year period. The use of this calculation will delay the impact of current market fluctuations on the pension expense for the period. We estimate the assumed health care cost trend rate used in determining our postretirement net expense based upon our actual health care cost experience, the effects of recently enacted legislation and general economic conditions. Our assumed rate of retirement is estimated based upon our annual review of our participant census information as of the measurement date. Actual changes in the fair market value of plan assets and differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return on plan assets could have a material effect on the amount of pension costs ultimately recognized. A 0.25 percent change in our discount rate would impact our pension and postretirement costs by approximately $1.9 million. A 0.25 percent change in our expected rate of return would impact our pension and postretirement costs by approximately $0.9 million. Fair Value Measurements We report certain assets and liabilities at fair value, which is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price). We primarily use quoted market prices and other observable market pricing information in valuing our financial assets and liabilities and minimize the use of unobservable pricing inputs in our measurements. 39 Table of Contents Prices actively quoted on national exchanges are used to determine the fair value of most of our assets and liabilities recorded on our balance sheet at fair value. Within our nonregulated operations, we utilize a mid-market pricing convention (the mid-point between the bid and ask prices) as a practical expedient for determining fair value measurement, as permitted under current accounting standards. Values derived from these sources reflect the market in which transactions involving these financial instruments are executed. We utilize models and other valuation methods to determine fair value when external sources are not available. Values are adjusted to reflect the potential impact of an orderly liquidation of our positions over a reasonable period of time under then-current market conditions. We believe the market prices and models used to value these assets and liabilities represent the best information available with respect to closing exchange and over-the-counter quotations, time value and volatility factors underlying the assets and liabilities. Fair-value estimates also consider our own creditworthiness and the creditworthiness of the counterparties involved. Our counterparties consist primarily of financial institutions and major energy companies. This concentration of counterparties may materially impact our exposure to credit risk resulting from market, economic or regulatory conditions. Adverse developments in the global financial and credit markets in the last few years have made it more difficult and more expensive for companies to access the short-term capital markets, which may negatively impact the creditworthiness of our counterparties. A further tightening of the credit markets could cause more of our counterparties to fail to perform. We seek to minimize counterparty credit risk through an evaluation of their financial condition and credit ratings and the use of collateral requirements under certain circumstances. Amounts reported at fair value are subject to potentially significant volatility based upon changes in market prices, the valuation of the portfolio of our contracts, maturity and settlement of these contracts and newly originated transactions, each of which directly affect the estimated fair value of our financial instruments. We believe the market prices and models used to value these financial instruments represent the best information available with respect to closing exchange and over-the-counter quotations, time value and volatility factors underlying the contracts. Values are adjusted to reflect the potential impact of an orderly liquidation of our positions over a reasonable period of time under then current market conditions. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview Atmos Energy Corporation is involved in the distribution, marketing and transportation of natural gas. Accordingly, our results of operations are impacted by the demand for natural gas, particularly during the winter heating season, and the volatility of the natural gas markets. This generally results in higher operating revenues and net income during the period from October through March of each fiscal year and lower operating revenues and either lower net income or net losses during the period from April through September of each fiscal year. As a result of the seasonality of the natural gas industry, our second fiscal quarter has historically been our most critical earnings quarter with an average of approximately 61 percent of our consolidated net income having been earned in the second quarter during the three most recently completed fiscal years. Additionally, the seasonality of our business impacts our working capital differently at various times during the year. Typically, our accounts receivable, accounts payable and short-term debt balances peak by the end of January and then start to decline, as customers begin to pay their winter heating bills. Gas stored underground, particularly in our natural gas distribution segment, typically peaks in November and declines as we utilize storage gas to serve our customers. During the current year, colder-than-normal weather and recent improvements in rate designs in our natural gas distribution segment partially offset the decline in demand for natural gas, which contributed to a 19 percent year-over-year decrease in consolidated throughput in our regulated transmission and storage segment and a 5 percent year-over-year decrease in consolidated sales volumes in our natural gas marketing segment. 40 Table of Contents During the year, we continued to successfully access the capital markets and received updated debt ratings from three rating agencies. In December 2009 we renewed a $450 million 364-day committed credit facility for our nonregulated operations. In March 2010, Moody upgraded our rating outlook from stable to positive and affirmed the existing credit rating on our senior long-term debt and commercial paper while S&P affirmed our rating outlook as stable and our senior long-term debt credit rating. In June 2010, Fitch upgraded our rating outlook from stable to positive and affirmed the existing credit rating on our senior unsecured debt and commercial paper. In October 2010, we replaced our $200 million 364-day revolving credit agreement prior to its expiration with a $200 million 180-day revolving credit agreement. The new credit facilities should help ensure we have sufficient liquidity to fund our working capital needs, while our credit ratings should help us continue to obtain financing at a reasonable cost in the future. On July 1, 2010, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase program with Goldman Sachs & Co. as part of our ongoing efforts to improve shareholder value. The shares that will be repurchased under this program should offset the dilutive impact of stock grants made under our various employee and director incentive compensation plans. The impact of the shares repurchased under the program during fiscal 2010 increased diluted earnings per share by approximately $0.01. Consolidated Results The following table presents our consolidated financial highlights for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2010, 2009 and 2008. For the Fiscal Year Ended September 30 2010 2009 2008 (In thousands, except per share data) Operating revenues $ 4,789,690 $ 4,969,080 $ 7,221,305 Gross profit 1,364,941 1,346,702 1,321,326 Operating expenses 875,505 899,300 893,431 Operating income 489,436 447,402 427,895 Miscellaneous income (expense) (339 ) (3,303 ) 2,731 Interest charges 154,471 152,830 137,922 Income before income taxes 334,626 291,269 292,704 Income tax expense 128,787 100,291 112,373 Net income $ 205,839 $ 190,978 $ 180,331 Earnings per diluted share $ 2.20 $ 2.07 $ 1.99 Historically, our regulated operations arising from our natural gas distribution and regulated transmission and storage operations contributed 65 to 85 percent of our consolidated net income. Regulated operations contributed 81 percent, 83 percent and 74 percent to our consolidated net income for fiscal years 2010, 2009, and 2008. Our consolidated net income during the last three fiscal years was earned across our business segments as follows: For the Fiscal Year Ended September 30 2010 2009 2008 (In thousands) Natural gas distribution segment $ 125,949 $ 116,807 $ 92,648 Regulated transmission and storage segment 41,486 41,056 41,425 Natural gas marketing segment 27,729 20,194 29,989 Pipeline, storage and other segment 10,675 12,921 16,269 Net income $ 205,839 $ 190,978 $ 180,331 41 Table of Contents The following table segregates our consolidated net income and diluted earnings per share between our regulated and nonregulated operations: For the Fiscal Year Ended September 30 2010 2009 2008 (In thousands, except per share data) Regulated operations $ 167,435 $ 157,863 $ 134,073 Nonregulated operations 38,404 33,115 46,258 Consolidated net income $ 205,839 $ 190,978 $ 180,331 Diluted EPS from regulated operations $ 1.79 $ 1.71 $ 1.48 Diluted EPS from nonregulated operations 0.41 0.36 0.51 Consolidated diluted EPS $ 2.20 $ 2.07 $ 1.99 Net income during fiscal 2010 increased eight percent over fiscal 2009. Net income from our regulated operations increased six percent during fiscal 2010. The increase primarily reflects colder than normal weather in most of our service areas as well as the net favorable impact of various ratemaking activities in our natural gas distribution segment. Net income in our nonregulated operations increased $5.3 million during fiscal 2010 primarily due to the impact of unrealized margins. Non-cash, net unrealized margins totaled $4.3 million which reduced earnings per share by $0.05 per diluted share compared to the prior year, when net unrealized losses totaled $21.6 million, which reduced earnings per share by $0.23 per diluted share. Net income in both periods was impacted by nonrecurring items. The current year period includes the positive impact of a state sales tax refund of $4.6 million, or $0.05 per diluted share. Net income in the prior-year period included the net positive impact of several one-time items totaling $17.1 million, or $0.19 per diluted share related to the following pre-tax amounts: $11.3 million related to a favorable one-time tax benefit. $7.6 million related to the favorable impact of an update to the estimate for unbilled accounts. $7.0 million favorable impact of the reversal of estimated uncollectible gas costs. $5.4 million unfavorable impact of a non-cash impairment charge related to available-for-sale securities in our Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan. Net income during fiscal 2009 increased six percent over fiscal 2008, driven largely from an 18 percent increase in net income from regulated operations during fiscal 2009. The increase primarily reflects a $32.3 million increase in gross profit resulting from the net favorable impact of various ratemaking activities in our natural gas distribution segment, partially offset by higher depreciation expense, pipeline maintenance costs and interest expense. Net income in our nonregulated operations decreased $13.1 million primarily due to the impact of unrealized margins. Pre-tax unrealized margins totaled $35.9 million which reduced earnings per share by $0.23 per diluted share. The overall increase in consolidated net income was also favorably affected by non-recurring items totaling $17.1 million, or $0.19 per diluted share, related to the items noted above. See the following discussion regarding the results of operations for each of our business operating segments. Natural Gas Distribution Segment The primary factors that impact the results of our natural gas distribution operations are our ability to earn our authorized rates of return, the cost of natural gas, competitive factors in the energy industry and economic conditions in our service areas. Our ability to earn our authorized rates is based primarily on our ability to improve the rate design in our various ratemaking jurisdictions by reducing or eliminating regulatory lag and, ultimately, separating the recovery of our approved margins from customer usage patterns. Improving rate design is a long-term process 42 Table of Contents and is further complicated by the fact that we operate in multiple rate jurisdictions. The Ratemaking Activity section of this Form 10-K describes our current rate strategy, progress towards implementing that strategy and recent ratemaking initiatives in more detail. We are generally able to pass the cost of gas through to our customers without markup under purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms; therefore the cost of gas typically does not have an impact on our gross profit as increases in the cost of gas are offset by a corresponding increase in revenues. Accordingly, we believe gross profit is a better indicator of our financial performance than revenues. However, gross profit in our Texas and Mississippi service areas include franchise fees and gross receipts taxes, which are calculated as a percentage of revenue (inclusive of gas costs). Therefore, the amount of these taxes included in revenues is influenced by the cost of gas and the level of gas sales volumes. We record the tax expense as a component of taxes, other than income. Although changes in revenue-related taxes arising from changes in gas costs affect gross profit, over time the impact is offset within operating income. Prior to January 1, 2009, timing differences existed between the recognition of revenue for franchise fees collected from our customers and the recognition of expense of franchise taxes. These timing differences had a significant temporary effect on operating income in periods with volatile gas prices, particularly in our Mid-Tex Division. Beginning January 1, 2009, changes in our franchise fee agreements in our Mid-Tex Division became effective which have significantly reduced the impact of this timing difference. However, this timing difference is still present for gross receipts taxes. As discussed above, the cost of gas typically does not have a direct impact on our gross profit. However, higher gas costs may adversely impact our accounts receivable collections, resulting in higher bad debt expense, and may require us to increase borrowings under our credit facilities resulting in higher interest expense. In addition, higher gas costs, as well as competitive factors in the industry and general economic conditions may cause customers to conserve or, in the case of industrial consumers, to use alternative energy sources. However, gas cost risk has been mitigated in recent years through improvements in rate design that allow us to collect from our customers the gas cost portion of our bad debt expense on approximately 65 percent of our residential and commercial margins. 43 Table of Contents Review of Financial and Operating Results Financial and operational highlights for our natural gas distribution segment for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2010, 2009 and 2008 are presented below.

These increases were partially offset by: $7.6 million decrease due to a non-recurring adjustment recorded in the prior-year period to update the estimate for gas delivered to customers but not yet billed to reflect base rate changes. $7.0 million decrease related to a prior-year reversal of an accrual for estimated unrecoverable gas costs that did not recur in the current year. $1.6 million decrease in revenue-related taxes, primarily due to a decrease in revenues on which the tax is calculated. Operating expenses, which include operation and maintenance expense, provision for doubtful accounts, depreciation and amortization expense, taxes, other than income and asset impairments decreased $8.6 million, primarily due to the following: $5.4 million decrease due to a state sales tax reimbursement received in March 2010. $4.6 million decrease due to the absence of an impairment charge for available-for-sale securities recorded in the prior year. $4.4 million decrease in contract labor expenses. $4.4 million decrease in travel, legal and other administrative costs. These decreases were partially offset by: $7.4 million increase in employee-related expenses. $4.3 million increase in taxes, other than income. Miscellaneous income decreased $4.4 million due to lower interest income. Interest charges decreased $5.6 million primarily due to lower short-term debt balances and interest rates. Additionally, results for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2009, were favorably impacted by a one-time tax benefit of $10.5 million. During the second quarter of fiscal 2009, the Company completed a study of the calculations used to estimate its deferred tax rate, and concluded that revisions to these calculations to include more specific jurisdictional tax rates would result in a more accurate calculation of the tax rate at which deferred taxes would reverse in the future. Accordingly, the Company modified the tax rate used to calculate deferred taxes from 38 percent to an individual rate for each legal entity. These rates vary from 36-41 percent depending on the jurisdiction of the legal entity. Fiscal year ended September 30, 2009 compared with fiscal year ended September 30, 2008 The $18.6 million increase in natural gas distribution gross profit primarily reflects an increase in rates. The major components of the increase are as follows: $13.6 million net increase in rates in the Mid-Tex Division as a result of the implementation of its 2008 Rate Review Mechanism (RRM) filing with all incorporated cities in the division other than the City of Dallas and environs (the Settled Cities) and adjustments for customers in the City of Dallas. $16.0 million increase in other rate adjustments primarily in Georgia, Kansas, Louisiana and West Texas. $7.6 million increase attributable to a non-recurring update to our estimate for gas delivered to customers but not yet billed to reflect changes in base rates in several of our jurisdictions recorded in the fiscal first quarter. $7.0 million uncollectible gas cost accrual recorded in a prior year that was reversed in the current year period. 45 Table of Contents These increases were partially offset by: $17.9 million decrease as a result of a five percent decrease in consolidated distribution throughput primarily associated with lower residential, commercial and industrial consumption and warmer weather in our Colorado service area, which does not have weather-normalized rates. $10.8 million decrease due to lower revenue related taxes, partially offset by the associated franchise and state gross receipts tax expense recorded as a component of taxes other than income discussed below. Operating expenses, which include operation and maintenance expense, provision for doubtful accounts, depreciation and amortization expense, taxes, other than income and asset impairments decreased $9.3 million, primarily due to the following: $10.6 million decrease due to lower legal, fuel and other administrative costs. $9.2 million decrease in allowance for doubtful accounts due to the impact of recent rate design changes in certain jurisdictions that allow us to recover the gas cost portion of uncollectible accounts as well as a 23 percent year-over-year decline in the average cost of gas. $9.2 million decrease in taxes other than income primarily associated with lower franchise fees and state gross receipt taxes. These decreases were partially offset by: $15.1 million increase in depreciation and amortization, due primarily to additional assets placed in service during the current year. $4.6 million increase due to a noncash charge to impair certain available-for-sale investments as we believed the fair value of these investments would not recover within a reasonable period of time. As discussed above, the results for fiscal 2009 include a $10.5 million tax benefit in the natural gas distribution segment. In addition, results for fiscal 2008 included a $1.2 million gain on the sale of irrigation assets in our West Texas Division. Interest charges increased $6.1 million primarily due to the effect of the Company March 2009 issuance of $450 million 8.50% senior notes to repay $400 million 4.00% senior notes in April 2009. In addition, we experienced higher average short-term debt balances, interest rates and commitment fees during the current year compared to the prior year. Regulated Transmission and Storage Segment Our regulated transmission and storage segment consists of the regulated pipeline and storage operations of the Atmos Pipeline Texas Division. The Atmos Pipeline Texas Division transports natural gas to our Mid-Tex Division and third parties and manages five underground storage reservoirs in Texas. We also provide ancillary services customary in the pipeline industry including parking arrangements, lending and sales of excess gas. Similar to our natural gas distribution segment, our regulated transmission and storage segment is impacted by seasonal weather patterns, competitive factors in the energy industry and economic conditions in our service areas. Natural gas prices do not directly impact the results of this segment as revenues are derived from the transportation of natural gas. However, natural gas prices and demand for natural gas could influence the level of drilling activity in the markets that we serve, which may influence the level of throughput we may be able to transport on our pipeline. Further, natural gas price differences between the various hubs that we serve could influence customers to transport gas through our pipeline to capture arbitrage gains. The results of Atmos Pipeline Texas Division are also significantly impacted by the natural gas requirements of the Mid-Tex Division because it is the sole supplier of natural gas for our Mid-Tex Division. 46 Table of Contents Finally, as a regulated pipeline, the operations of the Atmos Pipeline Texas Division may be impacted by the timing of when costs and expenses are incurred and when these costs and expenses are recovered through its tariffs. Review of Financial and Operating Results Financial and operational highlights for our regulated transmission and storage segment for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2010, 2009, and 2008 are presented below.

These decreases were partially offset by the following: $9.3 million increase associated with our GRIP filings. $2.0 million increase of excess inventory sales in the current-year period. Operating expenses decreased $10.5 million primarily due to: $11.8 million decrease related to reduced contract labor. $2.0 million decrease due to a state sales tax reimbursement received in March 2010. 47 Table of Contents These decreases were partially offset by a $2.1 million increase in taxes, other than income due to higher ad valorem and payroll taxes. Miscellaneous income decreased $1.3 million due primarily to a decline in intercompany interest income. Fiscal year ended September 30, 2009 compared with fiscal year ended September 30, 2008 The $13.7 million increase in regulated transmission and storage gross profit was attributable primarily to the following factors: $13.0 million increase from higher demand-based fees. $5.6 million increase resulting from higher transportation fees on through-system deliveries due to market conditions. $5.4 million increase due to our GRIP filings. These increases were primarily offset by an $8.4 million decrease associated with a decrease in transportation volumes to our Mid-Tex Division due to warmer weather and a decrease in electrical generation, Barnett Shale and HUB deliveries. Operating expenses increased $10.3 million primarily due to higher levels of pipeline maintenance activities. Results for the current-year period also include a $1.7 million tax benefit associated with updating the rates used to determine our deferred taxes. Natural Gas Marketing Segment AEM primary business is to aggregate and purchase gas supply, arrange transportation and storage logistics and ultimately deliver gas to customers at competitive prices. In addition, AEM utilizes proprietary and customer-owned transportation and storage assets to provide various services our customers request, including furnishing natural gas supplies at fixed and market-based prices, contract negotiation and administration, load forecasting, gas storage acquisition and management services, transportation services, peaking sales and balancing services, capacity utilization strategies and gas price hedging through the use of financial instruments. As a result, AEM margins arise from the types of commercial transactions we have structured with our customers and our ability to identify the lowest cost alternative among the natural gas supplies, transportation and markets to which it has access to serve those customers. AEM seeks to enhance its gross profit margin from delivering gas by maximizing, through asset optimization activities, the economic value associated with the storage and transportation capacity we own or control in our natural gas distribution and natural gas marketing segments. We attempt to meet this objective by engaging in natural gas storage transactions in which we seek to find and profit through the arbitrage of pricing differences in various locations and by recognizing pricing differences that occur over time. This process involves purchasing physical natural gas, storing it in the storage and transportation assets to which AEM has access and selling financial instruments at advantageous prices to lock in a gross profit margin. AEM continually manages its net physical position to attempt to increase the future economic profit that was created when the original transaction was executed. Therefore, AEM may subsequently change its originally scheduled storage injection and withdrawal plans from one time period to another based on market conditions and recognize any associated gains or losses at that time. If AEM elects to accelerate the withdrawal of physical gas, it will execute new financial instruments to hedge the original financial instruments. If AEM elects to defer the withdrawal of gas, it will reset its positions by settling the original financial instruments and executing new financial instruments to correspond to the revised withdrawal schedule. We use financial instruments, designated as fair value hedges, to hedge our natural gas inventory used in our natural gas marketing storage activities. These financial instruments are marked to market each month based upon the NYMEX price with changes in fair value recognized as unrealized gains and losses in the 48 Table of Contents period of change. The hedged natural gas inventory is marked to market at the end of each month based on the Gas Daily index with changes in fair value recognized as unrealized gains and losses in the period of change. Changes in the spreads between the forward natural gas prices used to value the financial hedges designated against our physical inventory and the market (spot) prices used to value our physical storage result in unrealized margins until the underlying physical gas is withdrawn and the related financial instruments are settled. Once the gas is withdrawn and the financial instruments are settled, the previously unrealized margins associated with these net positions are realized. AEM also uses financial instruments to capture additional storage arbitrage opportunities that may arise after the original physical inventory hedge and to attempt to insulate and protect the economic value within its asset optimization activities. Changes in fair value associated with these financial instruments are recognized as a component of unrealized margins until they are settled. Due to the nature of these operations, natural gas prices, and differences in natural gas prices between the various markets that we serve (commonly referred to as basis differentials), have a significant impact on our natural gas marketing operations. Within our delivered gas activities, basis differentials impact our ability to create value from identifying the lowest cost alternative among the natural gas supplies, transportation and markets to which we have access. Further, higher natural gas prices may adversely impact our accounts receivable collections, resulting in higher bad debt expense, and may require us to increase borrowings under our credit facilities resulting in higher interest expense. Higher gas prices, as well as competitive factors in the industry and general economic conditions may also cause customers to conserve or use alternative energy sources. Within our asset optimization activities, higher gas prices could also lead to increased borrowings under our credit facilities resulting in higher interest expense. Volatility in natural gas prices also has a significant impact on our natural gas marketing segment. Increased price volatility often has a significant impact on the spreads between the market (spot) prices and forward natural gas prices, which creates opportunities to earn higher arbitrage spreads within our asset optimization activities. Volatility could also impact the basis differentials we capture in our delivered gas activities. However, increased volatility impacts the amounts of unrealized margins recorded in our gross profit and could impact the amount of cash required to collateralize our risk management liabilities. Review of Financial and Operating Results Financial and operational highlights for our natural gas marketing segment for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2010, 2009 and 2008 are presented below. Gross profit margin consists primarily of margins earned from the delivery of gas and related services requested by our customers and margins earned from asset optimization activities, which are derived from the utilization of our proprietary and managed third party storage and transportation assets to capture favorable arbitrage spreads through natural gas trading activities. Unrealized margins represent the unrealized gains or losses on our net physical position and the related financial instruments used to manage commodity price risk as described above. These margins fluctuate based upon changes in the spreads between the physical and forward natural gas prices. Generally, if the physical/financial spread narrows, we will record unrealized gains or lower unrealized losses. If the physical/financial spread widens, we will record unrealized losses or lower unrealized gains. The magnitude of the unrealized gains and losses is also dependent upon the levels of our net physical position at the end of the reporting period. 49 Table of Contents For the Fiscal Year Ended September 30 2010 2009 2008 2010 vs. 2009 2009 vs. 2008 (In thousands, unless otherwise noted) Realized margins Delivered gas $ 59,523 $ 75,341 $ 73,627 $ (15,818 ) $ 1,714 Asset optimization 37,214 37,670 (6,135 ) (456 ) 43,805 96,737 113,011 67,492 (16,274 ) 45,519 Unrealized margins (10,786 ) (28,399 ) 25,529 17,613 (53,928 ) Gross profit 85,951 84,612 93,021 1,339 (8,409 ) Operating expenses 31,699 38,208 36,629 (6,509 ) 1,579 Operating income 54,252 46,404 56,392 7,848 (9,988 ) Miscellaneous income 2,280 537 2,022 1,743 (1,485 ) Interest charges 9,280 12,911 9,036 (3,631 ) 3,875 Income before income taxes 47,252 34,030 49,378 13,222 (15,348 ) Income tax expense 19,523 13,836 19,389 5,687 (5,553 ) Net income $ 27,729 $ 20,194 $ 29,989 $ 7,535 $ (9,795 ) Gross natural gas marketing sales volumes MMcf 420,203 441,081 457,952 (20,878 ) (16,871 ) Consolidated natural gas marketing sales volumes MMcf 353,853 370,569 389,392 (16,716 ) (18,823 ) Net physical position (Bcf) 13.7 13.8 8.0 (0.1 ) 5.8 Fiscal year ended September 30, 2010 compared with fiscal year ended September 30, 2009 AEM delivered gas business contributed 62 percent of total realized margins during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2010 with asset optimization activities contributing the remaining 38 percent. The $16.3 million decrease in realized gross profit reflected the following: $15.8 million decrease in realized delivered gas margins due to lower per-unit margins as a result of narrowing basis spreads, combined with lower delivered sales volumes. Per-unit margins were $0.14/Mcf in the current-year period compared with $0.17/Mcf in the prior-year period, while delivered sales volumes were 5 percent lower in the current year when compared with the prior year. $0.5 million decrease in asset optimization margins primarily due to higher storage demand fees partially offset by higher realized storage and trading gains during the fiscal year. The decrease in realized gross profit was more than offset by a $17.6 million increase in unrealized margins due to the period-over-period timing of storage withdrawal gains and the associated reversal of unrealized gains into realized gains. Operating expenses, which include operation and maintenance expense, provision for doubtful accounts, depreciation and amortization expense, taxes, other than income taxes and asset impairments decreased $6.5 million primarily due to a decrease in employee and other administrative costs. Miscellaneous income increased $1.7 million due to proceeds received from a class-action legal settlement in the current year. Interest charges decreased $3.6 million primarily due to a decrease in intercompany borrowings. Asset Optimization Activities AEM monitors the impact of its asset optimization efforts by estimating the gross profit, before related fees, that it captured through the purchase and sale of physical natural gas and the execution of the associated 50 Table of Contents financial instruments. This economic value, combined with the effect of the future reversal of unrealized gains or losses currently recognized in the income statement and related fees is referred to as the potential gross profit. We define potential gross profit as the change in AEM gross profit in future periods if its optimization efforts are executed as planned. This amount does not include other operating expenses and associated income taxes that will be incurred to realize this amount. Therefore, it does not represent an estimated increase in future net income. There is no assurance that the economic value or the potential gross profit will be fully realized in the future. We consider this measure a non-GAAP financial measure as it is calculated using both forward-looking storage injection/withdrawal and hedge settlement estimates and historical financial information. This measure is presented because we believe it provides a more comprehensive view to investors of our asset optimization efforts and thus a better understanding of these activities than would be presented by GAAP measures alone. Because there is no assurance that the economic value or potential gross profit will be realized in the future, corresponding future GAAP amounts are not available. The following table presents AEM economic value and its potential gross profit (loss) at September 30, 2010 and 2009. September 30 2010 2009 (In millions, unless otherwise noted) Economic value $ (7.8 ) $ 28.6 Associated unrealized losses 12.6 11.0 Subtotal 4.8 39.6 Related fees (1) (9.6 ) (14.7 ) Potential gross profit (loss) $ (4.8 ) $ 24.9 Net physical position (Bcf) 13.7 13.8 (1) Related fees represent AEM contractual costs to acquire the storage capacity utilized in its asset optimization operations. The fees primarily consist of demand fees and contractual obligations to sell gas below market index in exchange for the right to manage and optimize third party storage assets for the positions AEM has entered into as of September 30, 2010 and 2009. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2010, AEM economic value decreased from $28.6 million, or $2.07/Mcf at September 30, 2009 to a negative economic value of $7.8 million, or $0.57/Mcf. Early in the first quarter of fiscal 2010, AEM withdrew gas and realized previously captured spread values. As current cash prices declined during the first fiscal quarter, AEM injected gas and rolled positions into the second fiscal quarter to increase economic value. These positions were settled in the second fiscal quarter and the associated economic value was realized. However, during the year, weak market fundamentals have caused cash prices to remain low and have contracted spot-to-forward spread values, which has limited opportunities to capture economic value. Therefore, during the fiscal third and fourth quarters, AEM elected to forego capturing these narrower spread values and maintained a short-term trading position. We anticipate spot-to-forward spread values will expand in the near term and we expect to be able to roll positions and capture greater economic value than what we can capture as of September 30, 2010. However, the short-dated nature of AEM trading positions combined with current short-term forward prices that are lower than the cost of gas that was injected into storage in prior periods resulted in negative economic value as of September 30, 2010. The economic value is based upon planned storage injection and withdrawal schedules and its realization is contingent upon the execution of this plan, weather and other execution factors. Since AEM actively manages and optimizes its portfolio to attempt to enhance the future profitability of its storage position, it may 51 Table of Contents change its scheduled storage injection and withdrawal plans from one time period to another based on market conditions. Therefore, we cannot ensure that the economic value or the potential gross profit or loss calculated as of September 30, 2010 will be fully realized in the future nor can we predict in what time periods such realization may occur. Further, if we experience operational or other issues which limit our ability to optimally manage our stored gas positions, our earnings could be adversely impacted. Fiscal year ended September 30, 2009 compared with fiscal year ended September 30, 2008 AEM delivered gas business contributed 67 percent to total realized margins during fiscal 2009 with asset optimization activities contributing the remaining 33 percent. In the prior year, delivered gas activities represented substantially all of AEM realized gross profit margin. The $45.5 million increase in realized gross profit reflected: A $43.8 million increase in asset optimization margins. AEM realized substantially all of its realized asset optimization margin in the fiscal 2009 first quarter when it realized substantially all of the economic value that it had captured as of September 30, 2008 from withdrawing gas and settling the associated financial instruments. Since that time, as a result of falling current cash prices, AEM has been deferring storage withdrawals and has been a net injector of gas into storage to increase the economic value it could realize in future periods from its asset optimization activities. In the prior year, AEM deferred storage withdrawals primarily into fiscal 2009 and recognized losses on the settlement of the associated financial instruments. A $1.7 million increase in realized delivered gas margins. AEM experienced a six percent increase in per-unit margins as a result of improved basis spreads in certain market areas where we were able to better optimize transportation assets and successful contract renewals. These margins improvements more than offset a four percent decrease in gross sales volumes primarily attributable to lower industrial demand as a result of the current economic climate. The increase in realized gross profit was more than offset by a $53.9 million decrease in unrealized margins attributable to the following: The realization of unrealized gains recorded during fiscal 2008. A modest widening of the physical/financial spreads, partially offset by favorable unrealized basis gains in certain markets. A 5.8 Bcf increase in AEM net physical position. Operating expenses, which include operation and maintenance expense, provision for doubtful accounts, depreciation and amortization expense, taxes, other than income taxes, and asset impairments increased $1.6 million primarily due the following factors: $4.0 million increase in legal and other administrative costs. $2.4 million decrease related to tax matters incurred in the prior year that did not recur in the current year. Pipeline, Storage and Other Segment Our pipeline, storage and other segment consists primarily of the operations of Atmos Pipeline and Storage, LLC (APS). APS is engaged in nonregulated transmission, storage and natural gas-gathering services. Its primary asset is a proprietary 21 mile pipeline located in New Orleans, Louisiana that is principally used to aggregate gas supply for our regulated natural gas distribution division in Louisiana, our natural gas marketing segment, and, on a more limited basis, for third parties. APS also owns or has an interest in underground storage fields in Kentucky and Louisiana that are used to reduce the need of our natural gas distribution divisions to contract for additional pipeline capacity to meet customer demand during peak periods. In addition, APS engages in asset optimization activities whereby it seeks to maximize the economic value associated with the storage and transportation capacity it owns or controls. Certain of these arrangements 52 Table of Contents are with regulated affiliates of the Company which have been approved by applicable state regulatory commissions. Generally, these asset management plans require APS to share with our regulated customers a portion of the profits earned from these arrangements. APS also seeks to maximize the economic value associated with the storage and transportation capacity it owns or controls by engaging in natural gas storage transactions in which it seeks to find and profit from the pricing differences that occur over time. Results for this segment are primarily impacted by seasonal weather patterns and, similar to our natural gas marketing segment, volatility in the natural gas markets. Additionally, this segment results include an unrealized component as APS hedges its risk associated with its asset optimization activities. Review of Financial and Operating Results Financial and operational highlights for our pipeline, storage and other segment for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2010, 2009 and 2008 are presented below. For the Fiscal Year Ended September 30 2010 2009 2008 2010 vs. 2009 2009 vs. 2008 (In thousands) Storage and transportation services $ 13,206 $ 12,784 $ 14,247 $ 422 $ (1,463 ) Asset optimization 10,286 21,474 5,178 (11,188 ) 16,296 Other 1,652 2,728 4,183 (1,076 ) (1,455 ) Unrealized margins 2,996 (7,490 ) 4,705 10,486 (12,195 ) Gross profit 28,140 29,496 28,313 (1,356 ) 1,183 Operating expenses 12,448 11,019 8,064 1,429 2,955 Operating income 15,692 18,477 20,249 (2,785 ) (1,772 ) Miscellaneous income 3,083 6,253 8,428 (3,170 ) (2,175 ) Interest charges 2,808 1,830 2,322 978 (492 ) Income before income taxes 15,967 22,900 26,355 (6,933 ) (3,455 ) Income tax expense 5,292 9,979 10,086 (4,687 ) (107 ) Net income $ 10,675 $ 12,921 $ 16,269 $ (2,246 ) $ (3,348 ) Fiscal year ended September 30, 2010 compared with fiscal year ended September 30, 2009 Gross profit from our pipeline, storage and other segment decreased $1.4 million primarily due to the following: $4.9 million decrease from lower margins earned on storage optimization activities. $3.9 million decrease in basis gains earned from utilizing leased capacity. $2.4 million decrease from lower margins earned on asset management plans. $10.5 million increase in unrealized margins associated with our asset optimization activities. Operating expenses increased $1.4 million primarily due to increased operating costs associated with APS gas gathering activities and administrative costs. Miscellaneous income decreased $3.2 million primarily due to lower intercompany interest income earned by this segment. 53 Table of Contents Fiscal year ended September 30, 2009 compared with fiscal year ended September 30, 2008 Gross profit from our pipeline, storage and other segment increased $1.2 million primarily due to the following: $16.3 million increase in asset optimization margins as a result of larger realized gains from the settlement of financial positions associated with storage and trading activities, basis gains earned from utilizing controlled pipeline capacity and higher margins earned under asset management plans. $12.2 million decrease in unrealized margins associated with our asset optimization activities due to a widening of the spreads between current cash prices and forward natural gas prices. Operating expenses increased $3.0 million primarily due to increased employee costs and higher depreciation expense which was largely attributable to additional assets placed in service during the year. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The liquidity required to fund our working capital, capital expenditures and other cash needs is provided from a variety of sources, including internally generated funds and borrowings under our commercial paper program and bank credit facilities. Additionally, we have various uncommitted trade credit lines with our gas suppliers that we utilize to purchase natural gas on a monthly basis. Finally, from time to time, we raise funds from the public debt and equity capital markets to fund our liquidity needs. We regularly evaluate our funding strategy and profile to ensure that we have sufficient liquidity for our short-term and long-term needs in a cost-effective manner. We also evaluate the levels of committed borrowing capacity that we require. In fiscal 2011, we anticipate consolidating our short-term facilities used for our regulated operations into a single line of credit. In October 2010, we replaced our $200 million 364-day revolving credit agreement with a $200 million 180-day revolving credit agreement. Additionally, we intend to replace AEM $450 million 364-day facility with a $200 million, three-year facility when it expires in December 2010. Our $350 million unsecured 7.375% Senior Notes will mature in May 2011. We intend to refinance this debt on a long-term basis through the issuance of 30-year unsecured senior notes in June 2011. Additionally, we plan to issue $250 million of 30-year unsecured senior notes in November 2011 to fund our capital expenditure program. On September 30, 2010, we entered into five Treasury lock agreements to fix the Treasury yield component of the interest cost of financing the anticipated issuances of senior notes. We designated all of the Treasury lock agreements as cash flow hedges of an anticipated transaction. Any realized gain or loss incurred when these agreements are settled will be recognized as a component of interest expense over the life of the related long-term debt. We believe the liquidity provided by our senior notes and committed credit facilities, combined with our operating cash flows, will be sufficient to fund our working capital needs and capital expenditure program for fiscal year 2011. Cash Flows Our internally generated funds may change in the future due to a number of factors, some of which we cannot control. These include regulatory changes, the price for our services, the demand for such products and services, margin requirements resulting from significant changes in commodity prices, operational risks and other factors. 54 Table of Contents Cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the years ended September 30, 2010, 2009 and 2008 are presented below. For the Fiscal Year Ended September 30 2010 2009 2008 2010 vs. 2009 2009 vs. 2008 (In thousands) Total cash provided by (used in) Operating activities $ 726,476 $ 919,233 $ 370,933 $ (192,757 ) $ 548,300 Investing activities (542,702 ) (517,201 ) (483,009 ) (25,501 ) (34,192 ) Financing activities (163,025 ) (337,546 ) 98,068 174,521 (435,614 ) Change in cash and cash equivalents 20,749 64,486 (14,008 ) (43,737 ) 78,494 Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of period 111,203 46,717 60,725 64,486 (14,008 ) Cash and cash equivalents at end of period $ 131,952 $ 111,203 $ 46,717 $ 20,749 $ 64,486 Cash flows from operating activities Year-over-year changes in our operating cash flows primarily are attributable to changes in net income, working capital changes, particularly within our natural gas distribution segment resulting from the price of natural gas and the timing of customer collections, payments for natural gas purchases and purchased gas cost recoveries. The significant factors impacting our operating cash flow for the last three fiscal years are summarized below. Fiscal Year ended September 30, 2010 compared with fiscal year ended September 30, 2009 For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2010, we generated operating cash flow of $726.5 million from operating activities compared with $919.2 million in the prior year, primarily due to the fluctuation in gas costs. Gas costs, which reached historically high levels during the 2008 injection season, declined sharply when the economy slipped into the recession and have remained relatively stable since that time. Operating cash flows for the fiscal 2010 period reflect the recovery of lower gas costs through purchased gas recovery mechanisms and sales. This is in contrast to the fiscal 2009 period, where operating cash flows were favorably influenced by the recovery of high gas costs during a period of falling prices. Fiscal Year ended September 30, 2009 compared with fiscal year ended September 30, 2008 Operating cash flows were $548.3 million higher in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008, primarily due to the following: $368.9 million increase attributable to the favorable impact on our working capital due to the decline in natural gas prices in the current year compared to the prior year. $56.8 million increase due to lower cash margin requirements related to our natural gas marketing financial instruments. These increases were partially offset by a $21.0 million decrease due to a contribution made to our pension plans in the current year. Cash flows from investing activities In recent fiscal years, a substantial portion of our cash resources has been used to fund acquisitions and growth projects, our ongoing construction program and improvements to information technology systems. Our ongoing construction program enables us to provide natural gas distribution services to our existing customer base, expand our natural gas distribution services into new markets, enhance the integrity of our pipelines and, more recently, expand our intrastate pipeline network. In executing our current rate strategy, we are focusing our capital spending in jurisdictions that permit us to earn an adequate return timely on our investment without 55 Table of Contents compromising the safety or reliability of our system. Currently, our Mid-Tex, Louisiana, Mississippi and West Texas natural gas distribution divisions and our Atmos Pipeline Texas Division have rate designs that provide the opportunity to include in their rate base approved capital costs on a periodic basis without being required to file a rate case. Since early 2010, we have been discussing the financial and operational details of an accelerated steel service line replacement program with representatives of 440 municipalities served by our Mid-Tex Division. Two coalitions of cities, representing the majority of the cities our Mid-Tex Division serves, have agreed to a program of installing 100,000 replacements during the next two years, with approved recovery of the associated return, depreciation and taxes. Under the terms of the agreement, the accelerated replacement program will commence in fiscal 2011 at a total projected capital cost of $80 $120 million, with completion expected in September 2012. As a result of this project and spending to replace our regulated customer service systems and our nonregulated energy trading risk management system, we anticipate capital expenditures will increase significantly during the next two fiscal years. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2010, we incurred $542.6 million for capital expenditures compared with $509.5 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2009 and $472.3 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2008. The $33.1 million increase in capital expenditures in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 primarily reflects spending for the relocation of our information technology data center to a new facility, the construction of two service centers and the steel service line replacement program in our Mid-Tex Division. The increase in capital expenditures in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 primarily reflects $32.6 million related to spending for a regulated transmission pipeline project completed in the fourth quarter of 2009. Cash flows from financing activities For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2010, our financing activities used $163.0 million in cash, while financing activities for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2009 used $337.5 million in cash compared with cash of $98.1 million provided for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2008. Our significant financing activities for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2010, 2009 and 2008 are summarized as follows: 2010 During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2010, we: Paid $124.3 million in cash dividends which reflected a payout ratio of 61 percent of net income. Paid $100.5 million for the repurchase of common stock under our accelerated share repurchase program. Borrowed a net $54.3 million under our short-term facilities due to the impact of seasonal natural gas purchases. Received $8.8 million net proceeds related to the issuance of 0.4 million shares of common stock, which is a 68 percent decrease compared to the prior year due primarily to the fact that in fiscal 2010 shares have begun to be purchased on the open market rather than being issued by us to the Direct Stock Purchase Plan and the Retirement Savings Plan. Paid $1.2 million to repurchase equity awards. 2009 During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2009, we: Paid $407.4 million to repay our $400 million 4.00% unsecured notes. Repaid a net $284.0 million short-term borrowings under our credit facilities. 56 Table of Contents Paid $121.5 million in cash dividends which reflected a payout ratio of 64 percent of net income. Received $445.6 million in net proceeds related to the March 2009 issuance of $450 million of 8.50% Senior Notes due 2019. The net proceeds were used to repay the $400 million 4.00% unsecured notes. Received $27.7 million net proceeds related to the issuance of 1.2 million shares of common stock. Received $1.9 million net proceeds related to the settlement of the Treasury lock agreement associated with the March 2009 issuance of the $450 million of 8.50% Senior Notes due 2019. 2008 During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2008, we: Borrowed a net $200.2 million under our short-term facilities due to the impact of seasonal natural gas purchases and the effect of higher natural gas prices. Repaid $10.3 million long-term debt in accordance with their normal maturity schedules. Received $25.5 million in net proceeds related to the issuance of 1.0 million shares of common stock. Paid $117.3 million in dividends, which reflected a payout ratio of 65 percent of net income. The following table shows the number of shares issued for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2010, 2009 and 2008: For the Fiscal Year Ended September 30 2010 2009 2008 Shares issued: Direct stock purchase plan 103,529 407,262 388,485 Retirement savings plan 79,722 640,639 558,014 1998 Long-term incentive plan 421,706 686,046 538,450 Outside directors stock-for-fee plan 3,382 3,079 3,197 Total shares issued 608,339 1,737,026 1,488,146 The year-over-year decrease in the number of shares issued primarily reflects the fact that in fiscal 2010, shares have begun to be purchased in the open market rather than by being issued by us to the Direct Stock Purchase Plan and the Retirement Savings Plan. In addition, we awarded fewer shares under our 1998 Long-Term Incentive Plan due to the Company achieving a lower level of performance relative to the target performance established under the Plan during fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008. Further, a higher average stock price during the second and third quarters of fiscal 2010 compared to the second and third quarters of 2009 enabled us to issue fewer shares during the current year. During the fiscal year, we repurchased 2,958,580 common shares as part of the accelerated share repurchase agreement that is described in further detail below. Additionally, we repurchased 37,365 shares attributable to equity awards during the year. The repurchased share activity is not included in the table above. Share Repurchase Agreement On, July 1, 2010, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement with Goldman Sachs & Co. under which we repurchased $100 million of our outstanding common stock in order to offset stock grants made under our various employee and director incentive compensation plans. We paid $100 million to Goldman Sachs & Co. on July 7, 2010 for shares of Atmos Energy common stock in a share forward transaction and received 2,958,580 shares. We will receive the balance of the shares at the conclusion of the term of the repurchase agreement. The specific number of shares we will ultimately repurchase in the transaction will be based generally on the average of the daily volume-weighted average share price of our common stock over the duration of the agreement. The agreement is scheduled to end in 57 Table of Contents March 2011, although the termination date may be accelerated at the option of Goldman Sachs & Co. As a result of this transaction, beginning in our fourth fiscal quarter, the number of outstanding shares used to calculate our earnings per share was reduced by the number of shares received and the $100 million purchase price was recorded as a reduction in shareholders equity. The number of shares used to calculate our earnings per share in fiscal 2011 will continue to be reduced by the shares we received in July 2010; however, the total impact to diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2011 will be dependent upon the average share price of our common stock over the remainder of the agreement. Credit Facilities Our short-term borrowing requirements are affected by the seasonal nature of the natural gas business. Changes in the price of natural gas and the amount of natural gas we need to supply to meet our customers needs could significantly affect our borrowing requirements. However, our short-term borrowings typically reach their highest levels in the winter months. As of September 30, 2010, we financed our short-term borrowing requirements through a combination of a $566.7 million commercial paper program and four committed credit facilities with third-party lenders that provide approximately $1.2 billion of working capital funding. As of September 30, 2010, the amount available to us under our credit facilities, net of outstanding letters of credit was $834.8 million. These facilities are described in further detail in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements. In October 2010, our $200 million 364-day facility expired and our five-year $566.7 million facility will expire in December 2011. We replaced the $200 million 364-day facility before its expiration with a $200 million 180-day credit facility that will expire in April 2011. We do not plan to replace this facility upon expiration. We expect to begin discussions in fiscal 2011 to replace the expiring five-year $566.7 million facility with a larger multi-year credit facility. We believe our existing five-year facility will provide adequate short-term borrowing capacity until we can successfully execute a new multi-year credit facility. Additionally, on December 9, 2010, AEM existing $450 million committed revolving credit facility will expire. In October 2010, we received regulatory approval to increase AEH intercompany demand credit facility with AEC from $200 million to $350 million, effective December 1, 2010 through December 31, 2011. As a result of this increase, we are in discussions with our third-party lenders to replace AEM $450 million committed revolving credit facility with a $200 million three-year committed revolving credit facility with an accordion feature that could increase AEM borrowing capacity to $500 million. As a result of consolidating and reducing the amounts available under our facilities, we expect to reduce our short-term financing costs. Shelf Registration On March 31, 2010, we filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to issue, from time to time, up to $1.3 billion in common stock and/or debt securities available for issuance. We had already received approvals from all requisite state regulatory commissions to issue a total of $1.3 billion in common stock and/or debt securities under the new shelf registration statement, including the carryforward of the $450 million of securities remaining available for issuance under our shelf registration statement filed with the SEC on March 23, 2009. Due to certain restrictions imposed by one state regulatory commission on our ability to issue securities under the new registration statement, we will be able to issue a total of $950 million in debt securities and $350 million in equity securities. Credit Ratings Our credit ratings directly affect our ability to obtain short-term and long-term financing, in addition to the cost of such financing. In determining our credit ratings, the rating agencies consider a number of quantitative factors, including debt to total capitalization, operating cash flow relative to outstanding debt, operating cash flow coverage of interest and pension liabilities and funding status. In addition, the rating agencies consider qualitative factors such as consistency of our earnings over time, the quality of our management and business strategy, the risks associated with our regulated and nonregulated businesses and the regulatory structures that govern our rates in the states where we operate. 58 Table of Contents Our debt is rated by three rating agencies: Standard & Poor Corporation (S&P), Moody Investors Service (Moody s) and Fitch Ratings, Ltd. (Fitch). In March 2010, Moody upgraded our rating outlook from stable to positive and affirmed the credit rating on our senior long-term debt at Baa2 and on our commercial paper at P-2. Moody stated that the key driver for the upgrade was successful rate case outcomes over the past year. In March 2010, S&P affirmed our senior long-term debt credit rating of BBB+ and our rating outlook as stable. In June 2010, Fitch reaffirmed our senior long-term debt rating of BBB+ and commercial paper ratings of F-2 and upgraded our rating outlook from stable to positive. Fitch cited our effective management of the regulatory process as well as our consistent financial and operational performance as the primary reasons for the upgrade. Our current debt ratings are all considered investment grade and are as follows: S&P Moody Fitch Unsecured senior long-term debt BBB+ Baa2 BBB+ Commercial paper A-2 P-2 F-2 A significant degradation in our operating performance or a significant reduction in our liquidity caused by more limited access to the private and public credit markets as a result of deteriorating global or national financial and credit conditions could trigger a negative change in our ratings outlook or even a reduction in our credit ratings by the three credit rating agencies. This would mean more limited access to the private and public credit markets and an increase in the costs of such borrowings. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities. The highest investment grade credit rating for is AAA for S&P, Aaa for Moody and AAA for Fitch. The lowest investment grade credit rating is BBB- for S&P, Baa3 for Moody and BBB- for Fitch. Our credit ratings may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the rating agencies, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. There can be no assurance that a rating will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered, or withdrawn entirely, by a rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances so warrant. Debt Covenants We were in compliance with all of our debt covenants as of September 30, 2010. Our debt covenants are described in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements. Capitalization The following table presents our capitalization as of September 30, 2010 and 2009: September 30 2010 2009 (In thousands, except percentages) Short-term debt $ 126,100 2.8 % $ 72,550 1.6 % Long-term debt 2,169,682 48.5 % 2,169,531 49.1 % Shareholders equity 2,178,348 48.7 % 2,176,761 49.3 % Total capitalization, including short-term debt $ 4,474,130 100.0 % $ 4,418,842 100.0 % Total debt as a percentage of total capitalization, including short-term debt, was 51.3 percent and 50.7 percent at September 30, 2010 and 2009. The increase in the debt to capitalization ratio primarily reflects an increase in short-term debt as of September 30, 2010 compared to the prior year. Our ratio of total debt to capitalization is typically greater during the winter heating season as we make additional short-term borrowings to fund natural gas purchases and meet our working capital requirements. We intend to maintain our debt to capitalization ratio in a target range of 50 to 55 percent. 59 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following table provides information about contractual obligations and commercial commitments at September 30, 2010. Payments Due by Period Less Than More Than Total 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years 5 Years (In thousands) Contractual Obligations Long-term debt (1) $ 2,172,696 $ 360,131 $ 252,565 $ 500,000 $ 1,060,000 Short-term debt (1) 126,100 126,100 Interest charges (2) 1,040,151 130,826 219,726 179,347 510,252 Gas purchase commitments (3) 346,186 264,525 79,758 1,903 Capital lease obligations (4) 1,380 186 372 372 450 Operating leases (4) 217,184 18,240 33,407 31,207 134,330 Demand fees for contracted storage (5) 26,305 13,332 10,243 2,730 Demand fees for contracted transportation (6) 32,422 8,678 15,744 7,759 241 Financial instrument obligations (7) 58,597 49,673 8,924 Postretirement benefit plan contributions (8) 154,511 13,006 24,584 29,882 87,039 Uncertain tax positions (including interest) (9) 6,731 6,731 Total contractual obligations $ 4,182,263 $ 984,697 $ 652,054 $ 753,200 $ 1,792,312 (1) See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements. (2) Interest charges were calculated using the stated rate for each debt issuance. (3) Gas purchase commitments were determined based upon contractually determined volumes at prices estimated based upon the index specified in the contract, adjusted for estimated basis differentials and contractual discounts as of September 30, 2010. (4) See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements. (5) Represents third party contractual demand fees for contracted storage in our natural gas marketing and pipeline, storage and other segments. Contractual demand fees for contracted storage for our natural gas distribution segment are excluded as these costs are fully recoverable through our purchase gas adjustment mechanisms. (6) Represents third party contractual demand fees for transportation in our natural gas marketing segment. (7) Represents liabilities for natural gas commodity financial instruments that were valued as of September 30, 2010. The ultimate settlement amounts of these remaining liabilities are unknown because they are subject to continuing market risk until the financial instruments are settled. (8) Represents expected contributions to our postretirement benefit plans. (9) Represents liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions claimed or expected to be claimed on tax returns. AEM has commitments to purchase physical quantities of natural gas under contracts indexed to the forward NYMEX strip or fixed price contracts. At September 30, 2010, AEM was committed to purchase 69.5 Bcf within one year, 28.4 Bcf within one to three years and 3.2 Bcf after three years under indexed contracts. AEM is committed to purchase 3.1 Bcf within one year and 0.3 Bcf within one to three years under fixed price contracts with prices ranging from $3.55 to $6.36 per Mcf. With the exception of our Mid-Tex Division, our natural gas distribution segment maintains supply contracts with several vendors that generally cover a period of up to one year. Commitments for estimated 60 Table of Contents base gas volumes are established under these contracts on a monthly basis at contractually negotiated prices. Commitments for incremental daily purchases are made as necessary during the month in accordance with the terms of the individual contract. Our Mid-Tex Division maintains long-term supply contracts to ensure a reliable source of gas for our customers in its service area which obligate it to purchase specified volumes at market prices. The estimated commitments under these contract terms as of September 30, 2010 are reflected in the table above. Risk Management Activities We use financial instruments to mitigate commodity price risk and, periodically, to manage interest rate risk. We conduct risk management activities through our natural gas distribution, natural gas marketing and pipeline, storage and other segments. In our natural gas distribution segment, we use a combination of physical storage, fixed physical contracts and fixed financial contracts to reduce our exposure to unusually large winter-period gas price increases. In our natural gas marketing and pipeline, storage and other segments, we manage our exposure to the risk of natural gas price changes and lock in our gross profit margin through a combination of storage and financial instruments, including futures, over-the-counter and exchange-traded options and swap contracts with counterparties. To the extent our inventory cost and actual sales and actual purchases do not correlate with the changes in the market indices we use in our hedges, we could experience ineffectiveness or the hedges may no longer meet the accounting requirements for hedge accounting, resulting in the financial instruments being treated as mark to market instruments through earnings. We use financial instruments, designated as cash flow hedges of anticipated purchases and sales at index prices, to mitigate the commodity price risk in our natural gas marketing segment associated with deliveries under fixed-priced forward contracts to deliver gas to customers, and we use financial instruments, designated as fair value hedges, to hedge our natural gas inventory used in our asset optimization activities in our natural gas marketing and pipeline, storage and other segments. Also, in our natural gas marketing segment, we use storage swaps and futures to capture additional storage arbitrage opportunities that arise subsequent to the execution of the original fair value hedge associated with our physical natural gas inventory, basis swaps to insulate and protect the economic value of our fixed price and storage books and various over-the-counter and exchange-traded options. These financial instruments have not been designated as hedges. We record our financial instruments as a component of risk management assets and liabilities, which are classified as current or noncurrent based upon the anticipated settlement date of the underlying financial instrument.

These programs include medical and dental insurance coverage and pension and postretirement programs. Medical and Dental Insurance We offer medical and dental insurance programs to substantially all of our employees, and we believe these programs are consistent with other programs in our industry. Since 2005, we have experienced medical and prescription inflation of approximately seven percent. In recent years, we have strived to actively manage our health care costs through the introduction of a wellness strategy that is focused on helping employees to identify health risks and to manage these risks through improved lifestyle choices. Net Periodic Pension and Postretirement Benefit Costs For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2010, our total net periodic pension and other benefits costs was $50.8 million, compared with $50.2 million and $47.9 million for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2009 62 Table of Contents and 2008. These costs relating to our natural gas distribution operations are recoverable through our gas distribution rates. A portion of these costs is capitalized into our gas distribution rate base, and the remaining costs are recorded as a component of operation and maintenance expense. The increase in total net periodic pension and other benefits costs during fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009 primarily reflects the decline in fair value of our plan assets. The discount rate used to compute the present value of a plan liabilities generally is based on rates of high-grade corporate bonds with maturities similar to the average period over which the benefits will be paid. At our September 30, 2009 measurement date, the interest rates were slightly lower than the interest rates at September 30, 2008, the measurement date used to determine our fiscal 2009 net periodic cost. Our expected return on our pension plan assets remained constant at 8.25%. The increase in total net periodic pension and other benefits costs during fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008 primarily reflects the change in assumptions we made during our annual pension plan valuation completed September 30, 2008. The discount rate used to compute the present value of a plan liabilities generally was based on rates of high-grade corporate bonds with maturities similar to the average period over which the benefits will be paid. At our September 30, 2008 measurement date, the interest rates were approximately 130 basis points higher than the interest rates at June 30, 2007, the measurement date used to determine our fiscal 2008 net periodic cost. The corresponding increase in the discount rate was the primary driver for the increase in our fiscal 2009 pension and benefit costs. Our expected return on our pension plan assets remained constant at 8.25%. Pension and Postretirement Plan Funding Generally, our funding policy is to contribute annually an amount that will at least equal the minimum amount required to comply with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. However, additional voluntary contributions are made from time to time as considered necessary. Contributions are intended to provide not only for benefits attributed to service to date but also for those expected to be earned in the future. During fiscal 2010, we did not contribute cash to our pension plans as the fair value of the plans assets recovered somewhat during the year from the unfavorable market conditions experienced in the latter half of calendar year 2008 and our plan assets were sufficient to achieve a desirable funding threshold as established by the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA). During fiscal 2009, we contributed $21.0 million to our pension plans to achieve the same desired level of funding as established by the PPA. During fiscal 2008, we voluntarily contributed $2.3 million to the Atmos Energy Corporation Retirement Plan for Mississippi Valley Gas Union Employees. This contribution achieved a desired level of funding for this plan for the 2007 plan year. We contributed $11.8 million, $10.1 million and $9.6 million to our postretirement benefits plans for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2010, 2009 and 2008. The contributions represent the portion of the postretirement costs we are responsible for under the terms of our plan and minimum funding required by state regulatory commissions. Outlook for Fiscal 2011 and Beyond As of September 30, 2010, interest and corporate bond rates utilized to determine our discount rates, which impacted our fiscal 2011 net periodic pension and postretirement costs, were lower than the interest and corporate bond rates as of September 30, 2009, the measurement date for our fiscal 2010 net periodic cost. As a result of the lower interest and corporate bond rates, we decreased the discount rate used to determine our fiscal 2011 pension and benefit costs to 5.39 percent. We maintained the expected return on our pension plan assets at 8.25 percent, despite the recent uncertainty in the financial markets as we believe this rate reflects the average rate of expected earnings on plan assets that will fund our projected benefit obligation. Although the fair value of our plan assets has declined as the financial markets have declined, the impact of this decline is partially mitigated by the fact that assets are smoothed for purposes of determining net periodic pension cost which results in asset gains and losses that are recognized over time as a component of net periodic pension and benefit costs for our Pension Account Plan, our largest funded plan. Due to the decline in the fair value of 63 Table of Contents our plan assets, we expect our fiscal 2011 pension and postretirement medical costs to increase compared to fiscal 2010. Based upon market conditions subsequent to September 30, 2010, the current funded position of the plans and the new funding requirements under the PPA, we believe it is reasonably possible that we will be required to contribute to the Plans in fiscal 2011. Further, we will consider whether an additional voluntary contribution is prudent to maintain certain PPA funding thresholds. However, we cannot anticipate with certainty whether such contributions will be made and the amount of such contributions. With respect to our postretirement medical plans, we anticipate contributing approximately $13.0 million during fiscal 2011. The projected pension liability, future funding requirements and the amount of pension expense or income recognized for the Plan are subject to change, depending upon the actuarial value of plan assets and the determination of future benefit obligations as of each subsequent actuarial calculation date. These amounts are impacted by actual investment returns, changes in interest rates and changes in the demographic composition of the participants in the plan. In August 2010, the Board of Directors of Atmos Energy approved a proposal to close the Pension Account Plan (PAP) to new participants, effective October 1, 2010. Employees participating in the PAP as of October 1, 2010 will be allowed to make a one-time election to migrate from the PAP into our defined contribution plan with enhanced features, effective January 1, 2011. Participants who choose to remain in the PAP will continue to earn benefits and interest allocations with no changes to their existing benefits. In March 2010, President Obama signed The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act into law (the Health Care Reform Act ). The Health Care Reform Act will be phased in over an eight-year period. Although we are still assessing the impact of the Health Care Reform Act on the health care benefits we provide to our employees, the design of our health care plans has already changed in order to comply with provisions of the Health Care Reform Act that have already gone into effect or will be going into effect in 2011. For example, lifetime maximums on benefits have been eliminated, coverage for dependent children has been extended to age 26 and all costs of preventive coverage must be paid for by the insurer. In 2014, health insurance exchanges will open in each state in order to provide a competitive marketplace for purchasing health insurance by individuals. Companies who offer health insurance to their employees could face a substantial increase in premiums at that time if they choose to continue to provide such coverage. However, companies who elect to cease providing health insurance to their employees will be faced with paying significant penalties to the federal government for each employee who receives coverage through an exchange. We will continue to monitor all developments on health care reform and continue to comply with all existing relevant laws and regulations. For fiscal 2011, we anticipate an approximate 10 percent medical and prescription drug inflation rate, primarily due to anticipated higher claims costs and the initial implementation of the Health Care Reform Act. RECENT ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS Recent accounting developments and their impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows are described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.
