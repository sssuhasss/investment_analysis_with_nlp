ITEM 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ORGANIZATION OF INFORMATION The following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD&A") was prepared to provide the reader with a view and perspective of our business through the eyes of management and should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes to those financial statements. Our MD&A is presented in the following sections: Executive Summary and Financial Highlights 2013 Outlook Results of Operations Restructuring and Other Charges Operating Segment Results Liquidity and Capital Resources Contractual Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments Application of Critical Accounting Estimates Recently Adopted and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements EXECUTIVE SUMMARY AND FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS We are a global power leader that designs, manufactures, distributes and services diesel and natural gas engines and engine-related component products, including filtration, aftertreatment, turbochargers, fuel systems, controls systems, air handling systems and electric power generation systems. We sell our products to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), distributors and other customers worldwide. We have long-standing relationships with many of the leading manufacturers in the markets we serve, including PACCAR Inc, Daimler Trucks North America, Chrysler Group, LLC, Volvo AB, Komatsu, Navistar International Corporation, Aggreko plc, Ford Motor Company and MAN Nutzfahrzeuge AG. We serve our customers through a network of approximately 600 company-owned and independent distributor locations and approximately 6,500 dealer locations in more than 190 countries and territories. Our reportable operating segments consist of the following: Engine, Components, Power Generation and Distribution. This reporting structure is organized according to the products and markets each segment serves and allows management to focus its efforts on providing enhanced service to a wide range of customers. The Engine segment produces engines and parts for sale to customers in on-highway and various industrial markets. Our engines are used in trucks of all sizes, buses and recreational vehicles, as well as in various industrial applications, including construction, mining, agriculture, marine, oil and gas, rail and military equipment. The Components segment sells filtration products, aftertreatment, turbochargers and fuel systems. The Power Generation segment is an integrated provider of power systems which sells engines, generator sets and alternators. The Distribution segment includes wholly-owned and partially-owned distributorships engaged in wholesaling engines, generator sets and service parts, as well as performing service and repair activities on our products and maintaining relationships with various OEMs throughout the world. Our financial performance depends, in large part, on varying conditions in the markets we serve, particularly the on-highway, construction and general industrial markets. Demand in these markets tends to fluctuate in response to overall economic conditions. Our sales may also be impacted by OEM inventory levels and production schedules and stoppages. Economic downturns in markets we serve 33 Table of Contents generally result in reductions in sales and pricing of our products. As a worldwide business, our operations are also affected by currency, political, economic and regulatory matters, including adoption and enforcement of environmental and emission standards, in the countries we serve. As part of our growth strategy, we invest in businesses in certain countries that carry high levels of these risks such as China, Brazil, India, Mexico, Russia and countries in the Middle East and Africa. At the same time, our geographic diversity and broad product and service offerings have helped limit the impact from a drop in demand in any one industry or customer or the economy of any single country on our consolidated results. The global economy continued to slow throughout 2012, although the impacts were partially offset by strong demand across several end markets in the U.S. and Canada (North America) in the first half of the year; however these markets weakened in the second half of the year, particularly the heavy-duty truck market. Economies in emerging markets, including China and Brazil experienced challenges throughout the year in most markets, especially the off-highway construction market in China and the medium-duty truck market in Brazil. Demand in India remained strong for power generation equipment; however, improved volumes were more than offset by unfavorable currency impacts. International (excludes the U.S. and Canada) off-highway construction markets have continued to deteriorate with engine shipments down 53 percent, including a 72 percent decline in China. The on-highway medium-duty truck market in Brazil declined as the result of the 2011 pre-buy ahead of the new 2012 emission requirements and one of our customers replacing our B6.7 engine with a proprietary engine in 2012 contributing to international medium-duty truck shipments being down 19 percent. North American demand for heavy-duty on-highway products increased 3 percent while medium-duty truck shipments increased 15 percent in 2012 compared to 2011; although demand in both of these markets declined in the second half of 2012. North American light-duty on-highway demand also improved with an increase in shipments to Chrysler of 37 percent in 2012 compared to 2011. Slow growth in the U.S. economy and uncertainty driven by unresolved federal tax and budget issues caused businesses to hold back on capital expenditures in 2012, thus impacting demand for truck and power generation equipment. The governments of China and India have controlled inflation through tight monetary policies in the form of rising interest rates and tightening access to credit, although both countries began easing these policies in response to reduced inflationary concerns in 2012. Brazil also began easing their monetary policies in the second half of 2012. Easing monetary policies could enhance our end markets; however, there likely will be a delay between when these policies are implemented and when our end markets respond. The European economy remains uncertain with continued volatility in the Euro countries. Although we do not have any significant direct exposure to European sovereign debt, we generated approximately 8 percent of our net sales from Euro zone countries in 2012. As a result of a number of markets unexpectedly slowing in mid-2012, continued weak economic data in a number of regions and increasing levels of uncertainty regarding the direction of the global economy, we implemented a number of cost reduction initiatives in the second half of 2012. In October 2012, we announced strategic actions necessary to respond to the current environment by cutting costs while maintaining investments in key growth programs. Actions include a number of measures to reduce costs including planned work week reductions, shutdowns at some manufacturing facilities and some targeted workforce reductions. We reduced our workforce by 1,300 people in the fourth quarter and incurred total restructuring charges of $52 million ($35 million after-tax), or $0.18 per diluted share. 34 Table of Contents The following table contains sales and EBIT results by operating segment for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011. Refer to the section titled "Operating Segment Results" for a more detailed discussion of net sales and EBIT by operating segment including the reconciliation of segment EBIT to income before taxes.

Net income attributable to Cummins Inc. for 2012 was $1,645 million, or $8.67 per diluted share, on sales of $17.3 billion, compared to 2011 net income attributable to Cummins Inc. of $1,848 million, or $9.55 per diluted share, on sales of $18.0 billion. The decrease in income and earnings per share was driven by higher operating expenses, lower gross margins and lower equity, royalty and interest income from investees, partially offset by a lower effective tax rate of 23.5 percent versus 27.1 percent in 2011. In addition, the significant gains we recorded in 2011 for the disposition of certain assets and liabilities of our exhaust business and light-duty filtration business and flood damage recoveries did not repeat in 2012. Diluted earnings per share for 2012 benefited $0.06 from lower shares primarily due to the stock repurchase program. In July 2012, we completed the acquisition of Hilite Germany GmbH (Hilite) in a cash transaction for $176 million. We also acquired an additional 45 percent interest in Cummins Central Power for consideration of approximately $20 million. We generated $1.5 billion of operating cash flows in 2012, compared to $2.1 billion in 2011. Refer to the section titled "Operating Activities" in the "Liquidity and Capital Resources" section for a discussion of items impacting cash flows. In February 2011, the Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program and authorized the acquisition of up to $1 billion of our common stock. We repurchased $256 million of common stock in 2012. In December 2012, the Board of Directors authorized the acquisition of up to $1 billion of our common stock upon completion of the 2011 repurchase program. In July 2012, the Board of Directors authorized a dividend increase of 25 percent from $0.40 to $0.50 per share on a quarterly basis effective in the third quarter. Our debt to capital ratio (capital is defined as debt plus equity) at December 31, 2012, was 10.0 percent, compared to 11.8 percent at December 31, 2011. As of the date of filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we had an 'A' credit rating with a stable outlook from Standard & Poor's Rating Services, an 'A' credit rating and a stable outlook from Fitch Ratings and a 'Baa1' credit rating with a positive outlook from Moody's Investors Service, Inc. In addition to our $1.6 billion in cash and marketable securities on hand, we have sufficient access to our credit facilities, if necessary, to meet currently anticipated investment and funding needs. 35 Table of Contents On November 9, 2012, we entered into a five-year revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of lenders. The credit agreement provides us with a $1.75 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility, the proceeds of which are to be used by us for working capital or other general corporate purposes. Our global pension plans, including our unfunded non-qualified plans, were 98 percent funded at year-end 2012. Our U.S. qualified plan, which represents approximately 60 percent of our worldwide pension obligation, was 106 percent funded and our United Kingdom (U.K.) plan was 104 percent funded. Asset returns in 2012 for the U.S. qualified plan were 14 percent while the year-end 2012 discount rate was 3.95 percent, down 0.85 percentage points from the 2011 discount rate of 4.80 percent. We expect to contribute $170 million of cash to our global pension plans in 2013. We do not have a required minimum pension contribution obligation for our U.S. plans in 2013. We expect pension and other postretirement benefit expense in 2013 to increase by approximately $35 million pre-tax, or $0.14 per diluted share, when compared to 2012. Refer to application of critical accounting estimates within MD&A and Note 12, "PENSION AND OTHER POST RETIREMENT BENEFITS," to the Consolidated Financial Statements , for additional information concerning our pension and other post-retirement benefit plans. 2013 OUTLOOK Near-Term The global economy continued to slow throughout 2012, although the impacts were partially offset by strong demand across several end markets in North America in the first half of the year; however these markets weakened in the second half of the year, particularly the heavy-duty truck market. Economies in emerging markets, including China and Brazil experienced challenges throughout the year in most markets, especially the off-highway construction market in China and the medium-duty truck market in Brazil. Demand in India remained strong for power generation equipment; however, improved volumes were more than offset by unfavorable currency impacts. We currently expect the following positive trends in 2013: The Brazilian economy is expected to experience stronger growth in 2013 which is anticipated to result in improving demand in both truck and industrial markets over 2012 levels. Demand in some of our markets is expected to improve in the second half of 2013 following a slower start in the first half of the year. The new heavy-duty supply agreement with Navistar International Corporation is expected to have a positive impact on our heavy-duty truck engine and component sales. We currently expect the following challenges to our business that may reduce our earnings potential in 2013: Political decisions in the U.S. regarding federal tax and budget issues could continue to create economic uncertainty that may limit capital investments and negatively impact the overall North American economy in the first half of 2013. We expect most of our markets to be weak in the first quarter of 2013 but should begin to improve in the second quarter, although remaining below 2012 levels in the first half of 2013. Demand in certain European markets could continue to decline due to economic uncertainty. Growth in international markets could be negatively impacted if emission regulations are not strictly enforced. Demand for our products in certain industrial markets in China could remain low due to high equipment inventory levels. 36 Table of Contents Currency volatility could continue to put pressure on earnings. North American oil and gas markets could continue to remain weak. Domestic and international mining markets could continue to deteriorate if commodity prices weaken. Long-Term We believe that, over the longer term, there will be economic improvements in most of our current markets and that our opportunities for long-term profitable growth will continue in the future as the result of the following four macroeconomic trends that will benefit our businesses: tightening emissions controls across the world; infrastructure needs in emerging markets; energy availability and cost issues and globalization of industries like ours.

Foreign currency fluctuations unfavorably impacted sales by 2 percent. Power Generation segment sales decreased by 7 percent due to lower demand in the generator technologies, power solutions and power systems businesses, which were partially offset by growing demand in the power product business, especially in North America. Components segment sales, excluding acquisitions, decreased by 2 percent due to $126 million of sales in 2011 related to assets sold in 2011 and lower demand in the turbo technologies, filtration and fuel systems businesses, which were partially offset by higher demand in the emission solutions business, primarily in North America and Brazil. The decreases above were partially offset as Distribution segment sales, excluding acquisitions, increased by 2 percent due to higher demand for parts and filtration products especially in North and Central America, increased power generation growth in East Asia, increased demand in the South Pacific and higher service demand from South Pacific mining customers, which were partially offset by lower engine product sales due to a slowdown in the North American oil and gas markets. A more detailed discussion of sales by segment is presented in the "OPERATING SEGMENT RESULTS" section. Sales to international markets were 49 percent of total net sales in 2012, compared with 56 percent of total net sales in 2011. Gross Margin Gross margin decreased by $81 million and as a percentage of sales increased by 0.6 percentage points. The increase in gross margin as a percentage of sales was primarily due to lower material costs, improved price realization, lower warranty costs and favorable product mix, which were partially offset by lower volumes, unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations and restructuring charges of $29 million. The provision for warranties issued as a percentage of sales was 2.1 percent in both 2012 and 2011. A more detailed discussion of margin by segment is presented in the "OPERATING SEGMENT RESULTS" section. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to higher consulting of $45 million, restructuring and other charges of $20 million and an increase of $19 million in compensation and related expenses, which were partially offset by reduced discretionary spending in the 38 Table of Contents second half of the year. Higher compensation expense was primarily due to increased headcount to support our strategic growth initiatives launched prior to a number of markets unexpectedly slowing in mid-2012. Compensation and related expenses include salaries, fringe benefits and variable compensation. Variable compensation related to 2012 performance decreased $87 million over variable compensation related to 2011 performance. In the third quarter of 2012, we implemented a number of cost reduction initiatives to align our cost structure with the slowdown in demand at several of our key markets in the second half of the year. Overall, selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of sales, increased to 11.0 percent in 2012 from 10.2 percent in 2011. Research, Development and Engineering Expenses Research, development and engineering expenses increased primarily due to an increase of $54 million in compensation and related expenses and increased consulting of $32 million. Higher compensation expense was primarily due to increased headcount to support our strategic growth initiatives. Compensation and related expenses include salaries, fringe benefits and variable compensation. Variable compensation related to 2012 performance decreased $25 million over variable compensation related to 2011 performance. Research, development and engineering expenses in 2012 also included restructuring and other charges of $3 million. Overall, research, development and engineering expenses, as a percentage of sales, increased to 4.2 percent in 2012 from 3.5 percent in 2011. Research activities continue to focus on development of new products to meet future emission standards around the world and improvements in fuel economy performance. Equity, Royalty and Interest Income From Investees Equity, royalty and interest income from investees decreased primarily due to the following: In millions 2012 vs. 2011 Increase/(Decrease) Dongfeng Cummins Engine Company, Ltd. (DCEC) $ (28 ) Chongqing Cummins Engine Company, Ltd. (CCEC) (7 ) Beijing Foton Cummins Engine Co., Ltd. (BFCEC) 12 North American distributors 13 All other (18 ) Cummins share of net income (28 ) Royalty and interest income (4 ) Equity, royalty and interest income from investees $ (32 ) The decreases above were primarily due to lower sales in China at DCEC and CCEC, which were partially offset by growth in North American distributors and higher sales at BFCEC. Gain on Sale of Businesses In the second quarter of 2011, we sold certain assets and liabilities of our exhaust business which manufactures exhaust products and select components for emission systems for a variety of applications not core to our other product offerings. This business was historically included in our Components segment. The sales price was $123 million. We recognized a gain on the sale of $68 million ($37 million after-tax), which included a goodwill allocation of $19 million. The gain was excluded from segment results as it was not considered in our evaluation of operating results for the year ended December 31, 2011. Sales for this business were $62 million and $171 million in 2011 (through closing) and 2010, respectively. Income before income taxes for this business were approximately $9 million and $22 million in 2011 (through closing) and 2010, respectively. 39 Table of Contents During the fourth quarter of 2011, we sold certain assets and liabilities of our light-duty filtration business which manufactures light-duty automotive and industrial filtration solutions. The sales price was $90 million and included a note receivable from the buyer of approximately $1 million. There are no earnouts or other contingencies associated with the sales price. We recognized a gain on the sale of $53 million ($33 million after-tax), which included a goodwill allocation of $6 million. The gain was excluded from segment results as it was not considered in our evaluation of operating results for the year ended December 31, 2011. Sales for this business were $64 million and $74 million in 2011 (through closing) and 2010, respectively. Income before income taxes for this business were approximately $13 million and $9 million in 2011 (through closing) and 2010, respectively. In the second quarter of 2012, we recorded an additional $6 million gain ($4 million after-tax) related to final purchase price adjustments for our 2011 divestitures. The gain was excluded from segment results as it was not considered in our evaluation of operating results for the year ended December 31, 2012. Other Operating Income (Expense), Net Other operating income (expense), net was as follows: Years ended December 31, In millions 2012 2011 Royalty income $ 18 $ 12 Flood damage gain 38 Loss on sale of fixed assets (2 ) (10 ) Royalty expense (3 ) (3 ) Amortization of intangible assets (8 ) (5 ) Legal matters (20 ) (5 ) Other, net (1 ) (6 ) Total other operating income (expense), net $ (16 ) $ 21 Interest Income Interest income decreased primarily due to lower average investment balances in 2012 compared to 2011. Interest Expense Interest expense decreased primarily due to lower capitalized interest in 2011 and the termination of a capital lease in September 2011. 40 Table of Contents Other Income (Expense), Net Other income (expense), net was as follows: Years ended December 31, In millions 2012 2011 Gain on sale of equity investment $ 13 $ Dividend income 7 7 Gain on fair value adjustment for consolidated investee(1) 7 Change in cash surrender value of corporate owned life insurance 5 12 Gain on marketable securities, net 3 Foreign currency losses, net (14 ) (14 ) Bank charges (15 ) (16 ) Other, net 18 11 Total other income (expense), net $ 24 $ (1) See Note 2, "ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES," to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details. Income Tax Expense Our income tax rates are generally less than the 35 percent U.S. statutory income tax rate primarily because of lower taxes on foreign earnings and research tax credits. Our effective tax rate for 2012 was 23.5 percent compared to 27.1 percent for 2011. Our 2012 income tax provision includes a one-time $134 million tax benefit resulting from transactions entered into and tax return elections made with respect to our U.K. operations. Our 2011 income tax provision includes a tax benefit of $48 million related to prior year refund claims filed for additional research tax credits, as well as additional foreign income and related foreign tax credits, net of related tax reserves. Our effective tax rate for 2011 also includes a tax benefit of $19 million related to the release of deferred U.S. tax liabilities on certain foreign earnings, as a result of restructuring our foreign operations. Also included in 2011 is a tax benefit of $16 million resulting from the reduction of our unrecognized tax benefits primarily due to settlements with taxing authorities. The 2011 income tax provision also includes other tax items totaling to a $2 million net tax charge, primarily relating to the enactment of state law changes in Indiana and changes in the U.K. as well as adjustments to our income tax accounts based on our 2010 tax return filings. On January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was enacted. This legislation retroactively extended the U.S. federal research credit for two years, from January 1, 2012, through December 31, 2013. We expect our 2013 effective tax rate, which will include an estimated 1 percent benefit for the 2013 research credit, to be 26 percent excluding any one-time items that may arise. Additionally, we anticipate that our first quarter 2013 results will include a one-time tax benefit of approximately $28 million representing the net benefit attributable to the 2012 research credit. Earnings of our China operations generated after December 31, 2011, are considered to be permanently reinvested and additional U.S. deferred tax is no longer being provided on these earnings generated after 2011. We have $702 million of retained earnings and related cumulative translation adjustments in our China operations generated prior to December 31, 2011 and have provided a U.S. deferred tax liability of $158 million relating to these earnings and related translation adjustments. We anticipate that these earnings will be distributed to the U.S. within the next five years. 41 Table of Contents Noncontrolling Interests Noncontrolling interests eliminate the income or loss attributable to non-Cummins ownership interests in our consolidated entities. Noncontrolling interests in income of consolidated subsidiaries decreased primarily due to a decline of $5 million at Wuxi Cummins Turbo Technologies Co. Ltd., $3 million at Cummins Western Canada LP. and $3 million at Power Systems India. The decreases were partially offset by an increase of $6 million at Cummins Power Solutions Ltd. and $2 million at Cummins Central Power LLC. Net Income Attributable to Cummins Inc. and Diluted Earnings Per Share Attributable to Cummins Inc. Net income and diluted earnings per share attributable to Cummins Inc. decreased primarily due to lower volumes, particularly in the international construction and medium-duty truck markets, higher research, development and engineering expenses, higher selling, general and administrative expenses and lower equity, royalty and interest income from investees. These decreases were partially offset by improved gross margin as a percentage of sales and a lower effective tax rate of 23.5 percent versus 27.1 percent in 2011. In addition, the significant gains we recorded in 2011 for the disposition of certain asset and liabilities of our exhaust business and light-duty filtration business and flood damage recoveries from the insurance settlement regarding a June 2008 flood in Southern Indiana did not repeat in 2012. Diluted earnings per share for 2012 also benefited $0.06 from lower shares primarily due to the stock repurchase program. 2011 vs. 2010 Net Sales Sales increased in all segments primarily due to increased demand from most markets including recovery of the North American on-highway markets. The primary drivers for the increase in sales were: Engine segment sales increased by 43 percent due to increased demand in all lines of business led by heavy-duty truck, industrial and medium-duty truck and bus businesses. Components segment sales increased by 33 percent due to increased demand in all lines of business led by emission solutions and turbo technologies businesses. Power Generation segment sales increased by 20 percent due to increased demand in all lines of business led by commercial products and generator technologies businesses and improved price realization. Distribution segment sales increased by 31 percent due to increased demand in all product lines and all geographic regions led by Asia Pacific, North and Central America, Europe and Middle East regions. A more detailed discussion of sales by segment is presented in the "OPERATING SEGMENT RESULTS" section. Sales to international markets were 56 percent of total net sales in 2011, compared with 60 percent of total net sales in 2010. Gross Margin Gross margin increased by $1,421 million and as a percentage of sales increased by 1.4 percentage points. The significant improvement was led by increases in volume, improved price realization, higher product content on certain products and favorable currency impacts, partially offset by higher material costs, higher commodity costs and higher base warranty costs due to increased volumes and increasing 42 Table of Contents mix of EPA 2010 products. Gross margin in 2010 also benefited from a one-time $32 million tax recovery in Brazil. See Note 14, "COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES," in our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. The provision for warranties issued as a percentage of sales in 2011 was 2.1 percent compared to 3.0 percent in 2010. Accrual rates for engines sold this year were generally lower than the rates charged in prior years as our warranty costs for EPA 2010 products have been lower than expected. A more detailed discussion of margin by segment is presented in the "OPERATING SEGMENT RESULTS" section. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to an increase of $174 million in compensation and related expenses including increased headcount to support our strategic growth initiatives, merit increases and increased discretionary spending. Compensation and related expenses include salaries, fringe benefits and variable compensation. Variable compensation related to 2011 performance increased $42 million over variable compensation related to 2010 performance. Overall, selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of sales, decreased from 11.2 percent in 2010 to 10.2 percent in 2011. Research, Development and Engineering Expenses Research, development and engineering expenses increased primarily due to an increase of $79 million in compensation and related expenses, an increase in the number of engineering programs with increased costs of $79 million and increased discretionary spending. Compensation and related expenses include salaries, fringe benefits and variable compensation. Variable compensation related to 2011 performance increased $8 million over variable compensation related to 2010 performance. Overall, research, development and engineering expenses, as a percentage of sales, increased to 3.5 percent in 2011 from 3.1 percent in 2010. Research activities continue to focus on development of new products to meet future emission standards around the world and improvements in fuel economy performance. Equity, Royalty and Interest Income From Investees Equity, royalty and interest income from investees increased primarily due to the following: In millions 2011 vs. 2010 Increase/(Decrease) North American distributors $ 33 Chongqing Cummins Engine Company, Ltd. 22 Beijing Foton Cummins Engine Co., Ltd. 9 Dongfeng Cummins Engine Company, Ltd. (19 ) All other 9 Cummins share of net income 54 Royalty and interest income 11 Equity, royalty and interest income from investees $ 65 These overall increases were primarily due to the economic recovery in North America, particularly in the oil and gas markets, and strong demand for power generation and mining products in China with CCEC, which was partially offset by lower sales at DCEC due to weaker demand in the on-highway truck market. 43 Table of Contents Gain on Sale of Businesses In the second quarter of 2011, we sold certain assets and liabilities of our exhaust business which manufactures exhaust products and select components for emission systems for a variety of applications not core to our other product offerings. This business was historically included in our Components segment. The sales price was $123 million. We recognized a gain on the sale of $68 million ($37 million after-tax), which included a goodwill allocation of $19 million. The gain was excluded from segment results as it was not considered in our evaluation of operating results for the year ended December 31, 2011. Sales for this business were $62 million, $171 million and $126 million in 2011 (through closing), 2010 and 2009, respectively. Income before income taxes for this business were approximately $9 million, $22 million and $11 million in 2011 (through closing), 2010 and 2009, respectively. During the fourth quarter of 2011, we sold certain assets and liabilities of our light-duty filtration business which manufactures light-duty automotive and industrial filtration solutions. The sales price was $90 million and included a note receivable from the buyer of approximately $1 million. There are no earnouts or other contingencies associated with the sales price. We recognized a gain on the sale of $53 million ($33 million after-tax), which included a goodwill allocation of $6 million. The gain was excluded from segment results as it was not considered in our evaluation of operating results for the year ended December 31, 2011. Sales for this business were $64 million, $74 million and $54 million in 2011 (through closing), 2010 and 2009, respectively. Income before income taxes for this business were approximately $13 million, $9 million and $2 million in 2011 (through closing), 2010 and 2009, respectively. We have entered into supply and other agreements with the operations that represent ongoing involvement and as such, the results of these operations have not been presented as discontinued operations. Other Operating Income (Expense), Net Other operating income (expense), net was as follows: Years ended December 31, In millions 2011 2010 Flood damage gain (loss) $ 38 $ (2 ) Royalty income 12 10 Royalty expense (3 ) (3 ) Amortization of intangible assets (5 ) (15 ) Legal matters (5 ) Loss on sale of fixed assets (10 ) (4 ) Other, net (6 ) (2 ) Total other operating income (expense), net $ 21 $ (16 ) In June 2008, four of our sites in Southern Indiana, including our Technical Center, experienced extensive flood damage. In October 2011, we received $40 million from our insurance carriers to settle all outstanding 2008 flood claims. As a result, we recognized a gain of approximately $38 million ($24 million after-tax), net of any remaining flood related expenses, in "Other operating income (expense), net" in our Consolidated Statements of Income . 44 Table of Contents Interest Income Interest income increased primarily due to higher average cash balances in addition to higher average interest rates. Interest Expense Interest expense increased primarily due to lower capitalized interest in 2011 and higher average debt, partially offset by lower interest rates. Other Income (Expense), Net Other income (expense) was as follows: Years ended December 31, In millions 2011 2010 Change in cash surrender value of corporate owned life insurance $ 12 $ 12 Dividend income 7 7 Gain on fair value adjustment for Cummins Western Canada 12 Life insurance proceeds 7 Foreign currency losses, net (14 ) (1 ) Bank charges (16 ) (15 ) Other, net 11 12 Total other income (expense), net $ $ 34 Income Tax Expense Our income tax rates are generally less than the 35 percent U.S. statutory income tax rate primarily because of lower taxes on foreign earnings and research tax credits. Our effective tax rate for 2011 was 27.1 percent compared to 29.5 percent for 2010. Our 2011 income tax provision includes a tax benefit of $48 million related to prior year refund claims filed for additional research tax credits, as well as additional foreign income and related foreign tax credits, net of related tax reserves. Our effective tax rate for 2011 also includes a tax benefit of $19 million related to the release of deferred U.S. tax liabilities on certain foreign earnings, as a result of restructuring our foreign operations. Also included in 2011 is a tax benefit of $16 million resulting from the reduction of our unrecognized tax benefits primarily due to settlements with taxing authorities. The 2011 income tax provision also includes other tax items totaling to a $2 million net tax charge, primarily relating to the enactment of state law changes in Indiana and changes in the U.K. as well as adjustments to our income tax accounts based on our 2010 tax return filings. Our 2010 income tax provision includes a $17 million reduction in the fourth quarter related to the legislative reinstatement of the U.S. research tax credit as well as a $3 million tax benefit related to the release of deferred U.S. tax liabilities on foreign earnings now considered to be permanently reinvested outside of the U.S. Noncontrolling Interests Noncontrolling interests in income of consolidated subsidiaries decreased primarily due to a decline of $9 million at Wuxi Cummins Turbo Technologies Co. Ltd. and $4 million at Cummins India Ltd., a publicly traded company on various exchanges in India. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of $6 million at Cummins Western Canada LP, $4 million at Cummins Power Systems LLC and $1 million at Cummins Northeast LLC. 45 Table of Contents Net Income Attributable to Cummins Inc. and Diluted Earnings Per Share Attributable to Cummins Inc. Net income and diluted earnings per share attributable to Cummins Inc. increased primarily due to higher volumes in most markets and geographic regions, including the recovery of the North American on-highway truck markets, significantly improved gross margins, the gain on disposition of certain assets and liabilities of our exhaust business and our light-duty filtration business, a lower effective tax rate, increased equity income and the gain related to flood damage recoveries from the insurance settlement regarding a June 2008 flood in Southern Indiana. These favorable drivers were partially offset by higher selling, general and administrative expenses and research, development and engineering expenses in 2011 as compared to 2010. Diluted earnings per share for 2011 also benefited $0.17 from lower shares primarily due to the stock repurchase program. RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER CHARGES We have executed restructuring actions primarily in the form of involuntary separation programs in the fourth quarter of 2012. These actions were in response to deterioration in our U.S. businesses and most key markets around the world in the second half of 2012, as well as a reduction in orders in most U.S. and global markets for 2013. We reduced our worldwide professional workforce by approximately 650 employees, or 3 percent. We also reduced our hourly workforce by approximately 650 employees. During 2012, we incurred a pre-tax charge related to the professional and hourly workforce reductions of approximately $49 million. Employee termination and severance costs were recorded based on approved plans developed by the businesses and corporate management which specified positions to be eliminated, benefits to be paid under existing severance plans or statutory requirements and the expected timetable for completion of the plan. Estimates of restructuring were made based on information available at the time charges were recorded. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved, actual amounts paid for such activities may differ from amounts initially recorded and we may need to revise previous estimates. We incurred a $1 million charge for lease terminations and a $2 million charge for asset impairments and other non-cash charges. During 2012, we recorded restructuring and other charges of $52 million ($35 million after-tax). These restructuring actions included: In millions Year ended December 31, 2012 Workforce reductions $ 49 Exit activities 1 Other 2 Restructuring and other charges $ 52 If the 2012 restructuring actions are successfully implemented, we expect the annualized savings from the professional actions to be approximately $39 million. Our charge related to the professional actions was approximately $32 million. Approximately 32 percent of the savings from the restructuring actions will be realized in cost of sales, 53 percent in selling, general and administrative expenses and 15 percent in research, development and engineering expenses. We expect the accrual to be paid in cash which will be funded with cash generated from operations. At December 31, 2012, of the approximately 1,300 employees to be affected by this plan, 1,130 had been terminated. 46 Table of Contents Restructuring and other charges were included in each segment in our operating results as follows: In millions Year ended December 31, 2012 Engine $ 20 Distribution 14 Power Generation 12 Components 6 Restructuring and other charges $ 52 The table below summarizes the activity and balance of accrued restructuring charges, which is included in "Other accrued expenses" in our Consolidated Balance Sheets for the year ended December 31, 2012.

In millions Year ended December 31, 2012 Cost of sales $ 29 Selling, general and administrative expenses 20 Research, development and engineering expenses 3 Restructuring and other charges $ 52 OPERATING SEGMENT RESULTS Our reportable operating segments consist of the following: Engine, Components, Power Generation and Distribution. This reporting structure is organized according to the products and markets each segment serves and allows management to focus its efforts on providing enhanced service to a wide range of customers. The Engine segment produces engines and parts for sale to customers in on-highway and various industrial markets. Our engines are used in trucks of all sizes, buses and recreational vehicles, as well as in various industrial applications, including construction, mining, agriculture, marine, oil and gas, rail and military equipment. The Components segment sells filtration products, aftertreatment, turbochargers and fuel systems. The Power Generation segment is an integrated provider of power systems which sells engines, generator sets and alternators. The Distribution segment includes wholly-owned and partially-owned distributorships engaged in wholesaling engines, generator sets and service parts, as well as performing service and repair activities on our products and maintaining relationships with various OEMs throughout the world. We use segment EBIT (defined as earnings before interest expense, taxes and noncontrolling interests) as a primary basis for the chief operating decision-maker to evaluate the performance of each of our operating segments. Segment amounts exclude certain expenses not specifically identifiable to segments. 47 Table of Contents The accounting policies of our operating segments are the same as those applied in our Consolidated Financial Statements . We prepared the financial results of our operating segments on a basis that is consistent with the manner in which we internally disaggregate financial information to assist in making internal operating decisions. We have allocated certain common costs and expenses, primarily corporate functions, among segments differently than we would for stand-alone financial information prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). These include certain costs and expenses of shared services, such as information technology, human resources, legal and finance. We also do not allocate debt-related items, actuarial gains or losses, prior service costs or credits, changes in cash surrender value of corporate owned life insurance, flood damage gains or losses, divestiture gains or losses or income taxes to individual segments. In 2012, non-segment items included a $20 million reserve ($12 million after-tax) related to legal matters and a $6 million gain related to adjustments from our 2011 divestitures, while 2011 included the gain on disposition of certain assets and liabilities of our exhaust business and our light-duty filtration business and 2010 included a Brazil revenue tax recovery. These gains were not allocated to the businesses as they were not considered in our evaluation of operating results for the year. Segment EBIT may not be consistent with measures used by other companies. Following is a discussion of operating results for each of our business segments. Engine Segment Results Financial data for the Engine segment was as follows: Favorable/(Unfavorable) Years ended December 31, 2012 vs. 2011 2011 vs. 2010 In millions 2012 2011 2010 Amount Percent Amount Percent External sales $ 9,101 $ 9,649 $ 6,594 $ (548 ) (6 )% $ 3,055 46 % Intersegment sales 1,632 1,658 1,294 (26 ) (2 )% 364 28 % Total sales 10,733 11,307 7,888 (574 ) (5 )% 3,419 43 % Depreciation and amortization 192 181 171 (11 ) (6 )% (10 ) (6 )% Research, development and engineering expenses 433 397 263 (36 ) (9 )% (134 ) (51 )% Equity, royalty and interest income from investees 127 166 161 (39 ) (23 )% 5 3 % Interest income 11 18 12 (7 ) (39 )% 6 50 % Segment EBIT 1,248 1,384 809 (136 ) (10 )% 575 71 % Percentage Points Percentage Points Segment EBIT as a percentage of total sales 11.6 % 12.2 % 10.3 % (0.6) 1.9 48 Table of Contents Engine segment sales by market were as follows: Favorable/(Unfavorable) Years ended December 31, 2012 vs. 2011 2011 vs. 2010 In millions 2012 2011 2010 Amount Percent Amount Percent Heavy-duty truck $ 2,964 $ 2,791 $ 1,503 $ 173 6 % $ 1,288 86 % Medium-duty truck and bus 2,091 2,320 1,435 (229 ) (10 )% 885 62 % Light-duty automotive and RV 1,279 1,176 1,022 103 9 % 154 15 % Total on-highway 6,334 6,287 3,960 47 1 % 2,327 59 % Industrial 3,233 3,850 2,889 (617 ) (16 )% 961 33 % Stationary power 1,166 1,170 1,039 (4 ) 131 13 % Total sales $ 10,733 $ 11,307 $ 7,888 $ (574 ) (5 )% $ 3,419 43 % Unit shipments by engine classification (including unit shipments to Power Generation) were as follows: Favorable/(Unfavorable) Years ended December 31, 2012 vs. 2011 2011 vs. 2010 2012 2011 2010 Amount Percent Amount Percent Mid-range 440,500 509,400 368,900 (68,900 ) (14 )% 140,500 38 % Heavy-duty 119,100 116,300 61,200 2,800 2 % 55,100 90 % High-horsepower 19,800 21,600 18,500 (1,800 ) (8 )% 3,100 17 % Total unit shipments 579,400 647,300 448,600 (67,900 ) (10 )% 198,700 44 % 2012 vs. 2011 Sales Engine segment sales decreased versus 2011 due to lower demand in the industrial and medium-duty truck and bus businesses, partially offset by growth in the heavy-duty truck and light-duty automotive and RV businesses. The following are the primary drivers by market: Industrial market sales decreased primarily due to a 53 percent decline in construction engine shipments in international markets, including a 72 percent decline in China, and a 44 percent decline in engine shipments to the North American oil and gas markets due to weakened natural gas prices, which were partially offset by a 4 percent increase in engine shipments in the North American construction market. Medium-duty truck and bus sales decreased primarily due to lower demand in the Brazilian truck market due to pre-buy activity in the second half of 2011 ahead of the implementation of Euro V emission regulations in the first quarter of 2012 and one of our customers replacing our B6.7 engine with a proprietary engine in 2012. The B6.7 engine replacement was partially offset by the 2012 launch of our ISF and 9 liter engines in new light-duty on-highway and medium-duty truck applications, respectively, with this same customer. The decrease was further offset by improved demand in North American markets. The decreases above were partially offset by the following: Heavy-duty truck engine sales increased due to growth in the North American on-highway markets in the first half of the year, primarily as a result of the replacement of aging fleets. Light-duty automotive and RV sales increased primarily due to a 37 percent improvement in units shipped to Chrysler. 49 Table of Contents Total on-highway-related sales for 2012 were 59 percent of total engine segment sales, compared to 56 percent in 2011. Segment EBIT Engine segment EBIT decreased versus 2011, primarily due to lower gross margin, lower equity, royalty and interest income from investees, higher research, development and engineering expenses and higher selling, general and administrative expenses. Engine segment EBIT for 2012 included restructuring and other charges of $20 million in the fourth quarter. Changes in Engine segment EBIT and EBIT as a percentage of sales were as follows: Year ended December 31, 2012 vs. 2011 Favorable/(Unfavorable) Change In millions Amount Percent Percentage point change as a percent of sales Gross margin $ (82 ) (3 )% 0.3 Selling, general and administrative expenses (8 ) (1 )% (0.4 ) Research, development and engineering expenses (36 ) (9 )% (0.5 ) Equity, royalty and interest income from investees (39 ) (23 )% (0.3 ) The decrease in gross margin versus 2011 was primarily due to lower volumes and restructuring and other charges, which was partially offset by improved price realization, lower material costs, favorable product mix and improved product coverage. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increased headcount to support our strategic growth initiatives launched prior to a number of markets unexpectedly slowing in mid-2012, partially offset by decreased variable compensation expense. The increase in research, development and engineering expenses was primarily due to new product development spending and increased headcount to support our strategic growth initiatives. The decrease in equity, royalty and interest income from investees was primarily due to weaker demand for on-highway products at DCEC. 2011 vs. 2010 Sales Engine segment sales increased in all businesses versus 2010, as demand improved in most markets including a significant rebound in North American on-highway markets, improvements in international construction markets, increased demand in global mining markets and significant increases in oil and gas markets. The following are the primary drivers by market: Heavy-duty truck engine sales increased due to recovery in North American on-highway markets as OEM customers replaced their aging fleets and the depletion of transition engine inventory purchased in 2009 in advance of the EPA's 2010 emission standard changes. Industrial market sales increased primarily due to a 26 percent improvement in international construction engine shipments driven by the economic recovery and infrastructure improvements in certain emerging markets, increased demand in advance of off-highway emission regulations in the U.S. and Europe, a 46 percent increase in units sold in the global mining engine markets due to increased coal and commodity demands and more than double the number of oil and gas engine shipments in North America. Medium-duty truck and bus sales increased primarily due to the recovery in North American on-highway markets, the depletion of transition engine inventory purchased in 2009 in advance of the EPA's 2010 emissions change and higher demand in the Brazilian truck engine market driven by a growing economy. 50 Table of Contents Total on-highway-related sales for 2011 were 56 percent of total engine segment sales, compared to 50 percent in 2010. Segment EBIT Engine segment EBIT increased significantly versus 2010, primarily due to higher gross margin, partially offset by increased selling, general and administrative expenses and research, development and engineering expenses. Changes in Engine segment EBIT and EBIT as a percentage of sales were as follows: Year ended December 31, 2011 vs. 2010 Favorable/(Unfavorable) Change In millions Amount Percent Percentage point change as a percent of sales Gross margin $ 864 55 % 1.7 Selling, general and administrative expenses (142 ) (22 )% 1.2 Research, development and engineering expenses (134 ) (51 )% (0.2 ) Equity, royalty and interest income from investees 5 3 % (0.5 ) The increase in gross margin versus 2010 was primarily due to higher volumes, improved price realization and favorable mix, partially offset by higher commodity costs and higher base warranty costs due to increased volumes and increasing mix of EPA 2010 products. Although our warranty costs increased, our warranty cost as a percentage of sales decreased as actual accrual rates for engines sold this year were generally lower than rates charged in prior years as our warranty costs for EPA 2010 engines have been lower than expected. The increases in selling, general and administrative expenses and research, development and engineering expenses were primarily due to new product development spending and increased headcount to support our strategic growth initiatives. The increase in equity, royalty and interest income from investees was primarily due to strong demand for power generation and mining products in China with CCEC and strong export sales to Russia and Brazil in the midrange on-highway market with Beijing Foton Cummins Engine Co., Ltd., which was partially offset by lower sales at DCEC due to weaker demand in the on-highway heavy-duty and medium-duty truck market in China.

Dosers are products that enable compliance with emission standards in certain aftertreatment systems and complement our current product offerings. The transaction was approved by German regulators in June and closed on July 18, 2012. The purchase price was $176 million. There was no contingent consideration associated with this transaction. During 2012 we expensed approximately $4 million of acquisition related costs. See Note 2, "ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES," to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details.

The following are the primary drivers: Turbo technologies business sales decreased primarily due to a decline in OEM sales in Europe and China, reduced aftermarket demand and unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations, which were partially offset by higher OEM demand in North America in the first half of the year. Foreign currency fluctuations unfavorably impacted sales results. 52 Table of Contents Filtration business sales decreased primarily as a result of the disposition of certain assets and liabilities of our light-duty filtration business and our exhaust business in 2011 and unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations. Disposition related sales were $71 million in 2011. The decreases were partially offset by increased aftermarket demand in the first half of the year. Fuel systems business sales decreased primarily due to lower European demand and reduced aftermarket demand, which were partially offset by improved demand in North American on-highway markets in the first half of the year. The decreases above were partially offset by the emission solutions business as sales increased primarily due to higher demand in the North American on-highway market in the first half of the year and new sales in the Brazilian on-highway market as the result of new emission requirements effective January 1, 2012, partially offset by lower sales due to the disposition of certain assets and liabilities of our exhaust business in the second quarter of 2011, lower price realization and unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations. Disposition related sales were $55 million in 2011. Segment EBIT Components segment EBIT decreased versus 2011, primarily due to higher research, development and engineering expenses. Components segment EBIT for 2012 included restructuring and other charges of $6 million in the fourth quarter. Changes in Components segment EBIT and EBIT as a percentage of sales were as follows: Year ended December 31, 2012 vs. 2011 Favorable/(Unfavorable) Change In millions Amount Percent Percentage point change as a percent of sales Including acquisition Gross margin $ (3 ) 0.2 Selling, general and administrative expenses (4 ) (1 )% (0.2 ) Research, development and engineering expenses (38 ) (22 )% (1.0 ) Equity, royalty and interest income from investees (2 ) (6 )% (0.1 ) Excluding acquisition Gross margin (3 ) 0.4 Selling, general and administrative expenses (1 ) (0.2 ) Research, development and engineering expenses (35 ) (20 )% (1.0 ) Segment EBIT Excluding Acquisition The decrease in gross margin versus 2011 was primarily due to lower price realization, unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations, the disposition of certain assets and liabilities of our exhaust business and our light-duty filtration business in 2011 and restructuring and other charges, partially offset by higher volumes, particularly in the emission solutions business, lower material costs and improved product coverage. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increased headcount to support our strategic growth initiatives launched prior to a number of markets unexpectedly slowing in mid-2012, partially offset by decreased variable compensation expense and lower discretionary spending in the second half of 2012. The increase in research, development and engineering expenses was primarily due to new product development spending and increased headcount to support our strategic growth initiatives. 53 Table of Contents 2011 vs. 2010 Sales Components segment sales increased in all businesses versus 2010. The following are the primary regional drivers by business: Emission solutions business sales increased due to the increased sales volume of North American EPA 2010 aftertreatment systems and increased demand for Euro V aftertreatment systems in Europe, which were partially offset by lower sales due to the sale of the exhaust business. Turbo technologies business sales increased due to higher OEM demand in North America, Europe, India and Brazil and improved aftermarket demand. Fuel systems business sales increased primarily due to improved demand in North American on-highway markets. Filtration business sales increased due to improved aftermarket demand, especially in Asia Pacific and Europe, higher OEM demand due to the recovery in North American on-highway markets and favorable foreign currency impacts which were partially offset by lower sales due to the disposition of certain assets and liabilities of our exhaust and light-duty filtration businesses. Segment EBIT Components segment EBIT increased versus 2010, primarily due to the improved gross margin which was partially offset by increased research, development and engineering expenses and higher selling, general and administrative expenses. Changes in Components segment EBIT and EBIT as a percentage of sales were as follows: Year ended December 31, 2011 vs. 2010 Favorable/(Unfavorable) Change In millions Amount Percent Percentage point change as a percent of sales Gross margin $ 295 51 % 2.5 Selling, general and administrative expenses (44 ) (19 )% 0.8 Research, development and engineering expenses (61 ) (54 )% (0.6 ) Equity, royalty and interest income from investees 8 35 % The increase in gross margin was primarily due to higher volumes for all businesses and increased product content on 2010 North American truck engines. The increases in research, development and engineering expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses were primarily due to new product development spending and increased headcount to support our strategic growth initiatives. The increase in equity, royalty and interest income from investees was driven by improved joint venture income from both the filtration business in China and India and the fuel systems business. In 2011, we sold certain assets and liabilities of our exhaust business and light-duty filtration business and recognized $68 million and $53 million, respectively, in pre-tax gain on the sales. The gains have been excluded from Components results as they were not considered in our evaluation of Components operating results for the year ended 2011.

The following are the primary drivers by business: Generator technologies sales decreased primarily due to demand reductions in Europe and Asia and unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations. Power solutions sales decreased primarily due to lower volumes in Europe, Africa, Russia and Asia. Power systems sales decreased primarily due to lower volumes in the Middle East, North America and Latin America and unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations, which were partially offset by stronger demand in Asia and improved price realization. The decreases above were partially offset by power products as sales increased primarily due to higher volumes in North America and Western Europe and improved price realization. These increases were partially offset by demand reductions in China, the U.K., Latin America and Eastern Europe and unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations. Segment EBIT Power Generation segment EBIT decreased versus 2011, primarily due to lower gross margin, higher research, development and engineering expenses, lower equity, royalty and interest income from investees and higher selling, general and administrative expenses. Power Generation segment EBIT for 2012 included restructuring and other charges of $12 million in the fourth quarter. Changes in Power Generation segment EBIT and EBIT as a percentage of sales were as follows: Year ended December 31, 2012 vs. 2011 Favorable/(Unfavorable) Change In millions Amount Percent Percentage point change as a percent of sales Gross margin $ (60 ) (9 )% (0.4 ) Selling, general and administrative expenses (6 ) (2 )% (0.8 ) Research, development and engineering expenses (22 ) (41 )% (0.8 ) Equity, royalty and interest income from investees (7 ) (15 )% (0.1 ) The decrease in gross margin versus 2011 was due to lower volumes, unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations, higher material costs, increased product coverage and restructuring and other charges, 56 Table of Contents which were partially offset by improved price realization. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increased headcount to support our strategic growth initiatives, partially offset by lower discretionary spending in the second half of 2012 to align with slowing demand in key markets. The increase in research, development and engineering expenses was primarily due to increased headcount to support our strategic growth initiatives and new product development spending. Equity, royalty and interest income from investees decreased primarily due to lower profitability at Cummins Olayan and CCEC. 2011 vs. 2010 Sales Power Generation segment sales increased in all businesses, versus 2010, primarily due to increased demand in the power systems, power products and generator technologies businesses. The following are the primary drivers by business: Power systems sales increased due to stronger demand in North America, the Middle East, China and Latin American markets and improved price realization. Power products sales increased due to stronger demand in most regions, particularly in Asia, North America, the Middle East and Latin America, improved price realization, new product introductions and favorable foreign currency impacts. Generator technologies sales increased due to improved price realization, stronger demand in most regions, especially Western Europe, Asia and the U.K., and favorable foreign currency impacts. Power solutions sales increased due to our largest customer expanding its gas genset rental fleet and overall general market growth in the power solutions business mainly in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Segment EBIT Power Generation segment EBIT increased versus 2010, primarily due to higher gross margins, partially offset by higher selling, general and administrative expenses and research, development and engineering expenses. Changes in Power Generation segment EBIT and EBIT as a percentage of sales were as follows: Year ended December 31, 2011 vs. 2010 Favorable/(Unfavorable) Change In millions Amount Percent Percentage point change as a percent of sales Gross margin $ 135 25 % 0.7 Selling, general and administrative expenses (56 ) (22 )% (0.2 ) Research, development and engineering expenses (18 ) (50 )% (0.3 ) Equity, royalty and interest income from investees 12 34 % 0.1 The increase in gross margin was due to higher volumes and improved price realization, which was partially offset by increased commodity and material costs. The increases in selling, general and administrative expenses and research, development and engineering expenses were primarily due to increased headcount to support our strategic growth initiatives. Equity, royalty and interest income from investees increased at CCEC primarily as a result of improved power generation markets in China. 57 Table of Contents Distribution Segment Results Financial data for the Distribution segment was as follows: Favorable/(Unfavorable) Years ended December 31, 2012 vs. 2011 2011 vs. 2010 In millions 2012 2011 2010 Amount Percent Amount Percent External sales $ 3,261 $ 3,021 $ 2,311 $ 240 8 % $ 710 31 % Intersegment sales 16 23 13 (7 ) (30 )% 10 77 % Total sales 3,277 3,044 2,324 233 8 % 720 31 % Depreciation and amortization 34 25 25 (9 ) (36 )% Research, development and engineering expenses 6 3 1 (3 ) (100 )% (2 ) NM Equity, royalty and interest income from investees 188 172 132 16 9 % 40 30 % Interest income 2 3 2 (1 ) (33 )% 1 50 % Segment EBIT(1) 369 386 297 (17 ) (4 )% 89 30 % Percentage Points Percentage Points Segment EBIT as a percentage of total sales 11.3 % 12.7 % 12.8 % (1.4) (0.1) (1) Segment EBIT for 2012 included a $7 million gain related to the remeasurement of our pre-existing 35 percent ownership in Cummins Central Power to fair value in accordance with GAAP, as explained in Note 2, "ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES," to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The following were the primary drivers by line of business: Parts and filtration product sales increased primarily due to higher demand in North and Central America and the Middle East. Power generation product sales increased primarily due to growth in East Asia and improved demand in the South Pacific, which were partially offset by a reduction in nonrecurring project-related sales in the Middle East. Service revenue increased primarily due to higher demand from mining customers in the South Pacific and higher volumes in East Asia and Europe. The increases above were partially offset by the following: Foreign currency fluctuations unfavorably impacted sales results. Engine product sales decreased primarily due to a significant slowdown in the North American oil and gas markets and lower demand in Europe as a result of pre-buy activity in the second half of 2011 ahead of the 2012 emissions change for certain construction engines, which were partially offset by growth in East Asia. Segment EBIT Distribution segment EBIT decreased versus 2011, primarily due to higher selling, general and administrative expenses and higher research, development and engineering expenses, which were partially offset by higher equity, royalty and interest income from investees and higher gross margin. Distribution segment EBIT for 2012 included restructuring and other charges of $14 million in the fourth quarter. Changes in Distribution segment EBIT and EBIT as a percentage of sales were as follows: Year ended December 31, 2012 vs. 2011 Favorable/(Unfavorable) Change In millions Amount Percent Percentage point change as a percent of sales Including acquisitions Gross margin $ 11 2 % (1.2 ) Selling, general and administrative expenses (46 ) (10 )% (0.3 ) Research, development and engineering expenses (3 ) (100 )% (0.1 ) Equity, royalty and interest income from investees 16 9 % Excluding acquisitions Gross margin (18 ) (3 )% (1.1 ) Selling, general and administrative expenses (23 ) (5 )% (0.4 ) Segment EBIT Excluding Acquisitions The decrease in gross margin versus 2011 was primarily due to unfavorable foreign currency impacts, unfavorable variations in geographic mix and restructuring and other charges, which were partially offset by higher volumes in most products. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increased headcount to support our strategic growth initiatives launched 60 Table of Contents prior to a number of markets unexpectedly slowing in mid-2012, partially offset by decreased variable compensation expense and lower discretionary spending in the second half of 2012. The increase in research, development and engineering expenses was mainly due to increased headcount to support our strategic growth initiatives. The increase in equity, royalty and interest income from investees was primarily due to increased income from North American distributors. 2011 vs. 2010 Sales Distribution segment sales increased for all product lines versus 2010. The following were the primary drivers by line of business: Engine product sales increased primarily due to growth in the oil and gas markets in North and Central America, improved demand in certain markets in Europe, partially driven by pre-buy activity ahead of the 2012 emissions change and higher demand in Africa. Power generation product sales increased primarily due to improved project-based business across North and Central America, South Pacific, Middle East and Europe, increased demand from Japan's earthquake recovery and the acquisition of a previously independent distributor in 2010. Parts and filtration product sales increased primarily due to higher demand in North and Central America, the acquisition of a previously independent distributor in 2010, higher demand from mining customers in the South Pacific, improved sales in East Asia as the result of overall market recovery and increasing engine populations and higher demand driven by economic recovery in Europe. Foreign currency fluctuations also favorably impacted sales. Segment EBIT Distribution segment EBIT increased versus 2010, primarily due to improved gross margin and equity, royalty and interest income from investees, which was partially offset by increased selling, general and administrative expenses. Segment EBIT was also unfavorably impacted by the absence of a one-time gain of $12 million from the acquisition of Cummins Western Canada in 2010. Changes in Distribution segment EBIT and EBIT as a percentage of sales were as follows: Year ended December 31, 2011 vs. 2010 Favorable/(Unfavorable) Change In millions Amount Percent Percentage point change as a percent of sales Gross margin $ 161 31 % 0.1 Selling, general and administrative expenses (108 ) (30 )% 0.1 Equity, royalty and interest income from investees 40 30 % The increase in gross margin versus 2010 was primarily due to higher volumes in most products, favorable foreign currency impacts and the acquisition of a previously independent distributor in 2010. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was mainly due to higher headcount to support our strategic growth initiatives and unfavorable foreign currency impacts. The increase in equity, royalty and interest income from investees was primarily due to higher income from North American distributors, especially in the oil and gas markets, and increased parts sales. 61 Table of Contents Reconciliation of Segment EBIT to Income Before Income Taxes The table below reconciles the segment information to the corresponding amounts in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Management's Assessment of Liquidity Our financial condition and liquidity remain strong. Our solid balance sheet and credit ratings enable us to have ready access to credit. We assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate adequate cash to fund our operating, investing and financing activities. We generate significant ongoing cash flow, which has been used, in part, to fund capital expenditures, pay dividends on our common stock, fund repurchases of common stock and make acquisitions. Cash provided by operations is our principal source of liquidity. As of December 31, 2012, other sources of liquidity included: cash and cash equivalents of $1.4 billion, of which approximately 24 percent was located in the U.S. and 76 percent was located primarily in the U.K., China, Singapore, India and Brazil, marketable securities of $247 million, which were located primarily in India and Brazil and the majority of which could be liquidated into cash within a few days, revolving credit facility with $1.7 billion available, net of outstanding letters of credit and international and other domestic short-term credit facilities with $301 million available. We believe our liquidity provides us with the financial flexibility needed to fund working capital, capital expenditures, projected pension obligations, dividend payments, common stock repurchases, acquisitions, restructuring actions and debt service obligations. 62 Table of Contents Our new revolving credit agreement, completed in the fourth quarter of 2012, provides us with a $1.75 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, the proceeds of which are to be used for our general corporate purposes. See Note 10, "DEBT" to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. The credit agreement includes one financial covenant: a leverage ratio. The required leverage ratio, which measures the sum of total debt plus securitization financing to consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) for the four fiscal quarters may not exceed 3.25 to 1.0. At December 31, 2012, our leverage ratio was 0.30 to 1.0. A significant portion of our cash flows is generated outside the U.S. As of December 31, 2012, the total of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries was $1.3 billion, the vast majority of which was located in the U.K., China, India, Singapore and Brazil. The geographic location of our cash and marketable securities aligns well with our business growth strategy. We manage our worldwide cash requirements considering available funds among the many subsidiaries through which we conduct our business and the cost effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed. As a result, we do not anticipate any local liquidity restrictions to preclude us from funding our targeted expansion or operating needs with local resources. If we distribute our foreign cash balances to the U.S. or to other foreign subsidiaries, we could be required to accrue and pay U.S. taxes. For example, we would be required to accrue and pay additional U.S. taxes if we repatriated cash from certain foreign subsidiaries whose earnings we have asserted are permanently reinvested outside of the U.S. Foreign earnings for which we assert permanent reinvestment outside the U.S. consist primarily of earnings of our U.K. domiciled subsidiaries. At present, we do not foresee a need to repatriate any earnings from these subsidiaries for which we have asserted permanent reinvestment. However, to help fund cash needs of the U.S. or other international subsidiaries as they arise, we repatriate available cash from certain foreign subsidiaries whose earnings are not permanently reinvested when it is cost effective to do so. Our 2012 and subsequent earnings from our China operations are considered permanently reinvested, while earnings generated prior to 2012, for which U.S. deferred tax liabilities have been recorded, are expected to be repatriated in future years. We continuously monitor our pension assets and believe that we have limited exposure to the European debt crisis. No sovereign debt instruments of crisis countries are held in the trusts, while any equities are held with large well-diversified multinational firms or are de minimis amounts in large index funds. Our pension plans have not experienced any significant impact on liquidity or counterparty exposure due to the volatility in the credit markets. The maturity schedule of our existing long-term debt does not require significant cash outflows in the intermediate term. Required annual principal payments range from $13 million to $72 million over each of the next five years. Working Capital Summary We fund our working capital with cash from operations and short-term borrowings when necessary. Various assets and liabilities, including short-term debt, can fluctuate significantly from month to month 63 Table of Contents depending on short-term liquidity needs. As a result, working capital is a prime focus of management attention.

Current liabilities decreased 14 percent primarily due to lower accounts payable as a result of reduced purchasing volumes, a decrease in accrued compensation, benefits and retirement costs due to lower variable compensation expense for 2012 and a decrease in taxes payable caused by lower earnings and higher estimated tax payments in 2012 compared to 2011. Days' sales in receivables increased five days compared to 2011. The increase was due to higher average receivable balances throughout 2012 on lower sales due to the decline in volume over the second half of the year. Inventory turnover decreased 0.6 turns compared to 2011. The decrease was due to higher average inventory balances throughout 2012 on lower sales due to the decline in volume over the second half of the year. 64 Table of Contents Cash Flows Cash and cash equivalents decreased $115 million during the year ended December 31, 2012, compared to an increase of $461 million during the comparable period in 2011. The change in cash and cash equivalents was as follows: Operating Activities Change Years ended December 31, 2012 vs. 2011 2011 vs. 2010 In millions 2012 2011 2010 Consolidated net income $ 1,738 $ 1,946 $ 1,140 $ (208 ) $ 806 Restructuring and other charges, net of cash payments 27 27 Depreciation and amortization 361 325 320 36 5 Gain on sale of businesses (6 ) (121 ) 115 (121 ) Gain on sale of equity investment (13 ) (13 ) Gain on fair value adjustment for consolidated investee (7 ) (12 ) (7 ) 12 Deferred income taxes 116 85 56 31 29 Equity in income of investees, net of dividends (15 ) (23 ) (147 ) 8 124 Pension contributions in excess of expense (68 ) (131 ) (151 ) 63 20 Other post-retirement benefits payments in excess of expense (21 ) (31 ) (35 ) 10 4 Stock-based compensation expense 36 42 22 (6 ) 20 Excess tax benefits on stock-based awards (14 ) (5 ) (10 ) (9 ) 5 Translation and hedging activities 4 13 (4 ) (9 ) Changes in: Accounts and notes receivable 87 (350 ) (195 ) 437 (155 ) Inventories (32 ) (225 ) (574 ) 193 349 Other current assets (60 ) (21 ) (54 ) (39 ) 33 Accounts payable (256 ) 208 345 (464 ) (137 ) Accrued expenses (514 ) 234 233 (748 ) 1 Changes in other liabilities and deferred revenue 214 139 133 75 6 Other, net (41 ) (3 ) (78 ) (38 ) 75 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,532 $ 2,073 $ 1,006 $ (541 ) $ 1,067 2012 vs. 2011 Net cash provided by operating activities decreased versus 2011 primarily due to unfavorable working capital fluctuations and lower consolidated net income, which were partially offset by a lower non-cash gain on disposition of certain assets and liabilities of our exhaust business and our light-duty filtration business in 2012. During 2012, the net increase in working capital resulted in a cash outflow of $775 million compared to a cash outflow of $154 million in 2011. This change of $621 million was primarily driven by lower accrued expenses and a decrease in accounts payable, as volumes dropped in the second half of the year, and higher cash tax payments of approximately $159 million. These were partially offset by a decrease in accounts and notes receivable and a smaller increase in inventory in 2012. 65 Table of Contents Pensions The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon a variety of variables and assumptions including return on invested assets, market interest rates and levels of voluntary contributions to the plans. In 2012, the return for our U.S. plan was 14 percent while our U.K. plan return exceeded 7 percent. Approximately 76 percent of our pension plan assets are held in highly liquid investments such as equity and fixed income securities. The remaining 24 percent of our plan assets are held in less liquid, but market valued investments, including real estate, private equity and insurance contracts. We made $132 million of pension contributions in 2012. Claims and premiums for other postretirement benefits approximated $41 million, net of reimbursements, in 2012. The $132 million of pension contributions in 2012 included voluntary contributions of $110 million. These contributions and payments include payments from our funds either to increase pension plan assets or to make direct payments to plan participants. We anticipate making total contributions of $170 million to our defined benefit pension plans in 2013. Expected contributions to our defined benefit pension plans in 2013 will meet or exceed the current funding requirements. 2011 vs. 2010 Net cash provided by operating activities increased versus 2010 primarily due to significantly higher consolidated net income, excluding the gain on the sale of certain assets and liabilities of our exhaust business and our light-duty filtration business, as a result of higher sales volumes, higher dividends from equity investees and favorable working capital fluctuations. During 2011, the net increase in working capital resulted in a cash outflow of $154 million compared to a cash outflow of $245 million in 2010. This decrease of $91 million was primarily driven by a smaller increase in inventory in 2011 as we significantly increased inventory levels in 2010 to meet anticipated post-recession demand.

Capital expenditures were $690 million in 2012 compared to $622 million in 2011. Despite the challenging economies around the world, we continue to invest in new product lines and targeted capacity expansions. We plan to spend approximately $850 million in 2013 as we continue with product launches and facility improvements and prepare for future emission standards. Over one-half of our capital expenditures will be invested outside of the U.S. in 2013. 2011 vs. 2010 Net cash used in investing activities decreased versus 2010 primarily due to proceeds received from the sale of certain assets and liabilities of our exhaust business and our light-duty filtration business (See Note 2, "ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES" to our Consolidated Financial Statements ), decreased acquisitions and increased liquidations of marketable securities, the acquisition of Cummins Western Canada in 2010 and decreased purchases of other investments. These drivers were partially offset by increased capital expenditures, additional investments in and advances to equity investees and lower proceeds from dispositions of property, plant and equipment.

Our total debt was $775 million as of December 31, 2012, compared with $783 million as of December 31, 2011. Total debt as a percent of our total capital, including total long-term debt, was 10.0 percent at December 31, 2012, compared with 11.8 percent at December 31, 2011. 2011 vs. 2010 Net cash used in financing activities increased versus 2010, primarily due to significantly higher repurchases of common stock, increased payments on borrowings and capital lease obligations, decreased proceeds from borrowings and higher dividend payments. 67 Table of Contents Our total debt was $783 million as of December 31, 2011, compared with $843 million as of December 31, 2010. Total debt as a percent of our total capital, including total long-term debt, was 11.8 percent at December 31, 2011, compared with 14.4 percent at December 31, 2010. Repurchase of Common Stock In December 2007, the Board of Directors authorized the acquisition of up to $500 million of our common stock, which was completed in February 2011. Repurchases under this plan by year were as follows: In millions (except per share amounts) Shares Purchased Average Cost Per Share Total Cost of Repurchases Remaining Authorized Capacity 2008 2.3 $ 55.49 $ 128 $ 372 2009 0.4 46.52 20 352 2010 3.5 68.57 241 111 2011 1.1 104.47 111 Total 7.3 $ 500 In February 2011, the Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase program and authorized the acquisition of up to $1 billion of our common stock upon completion of the $500 million program. In 2011, we repurchased $518 million of shares under this authorization. In 2012, we made the following quarterly purchases under this plan: In millions (except per share amounts) For each quarter ended 2012 Shares Purchased Average Cost Per Share Total Cost of Repurchases Remaining Authorized Capacity April 1 0.1 $ 114.97 $ 8 $ 474 July 1 1.8 104.00 188 286 September 30 0.4 84.95 35 251 December 31 0.3 87.83 25 226 Total 2.6 99.47 $ 256 In December 2012, the Board of Directors authorized the acquisition of up to $1 billion of our common stock upon completion of the 2011 repurchase program. Quarterly Dividends In July 2012, the Board of Directors authorized a 25 percent increase to our quarterly cash dividend on our common stock from $0.40 per share to $0.50 per share. In July 2011, the Board of Directors approved a 52 percent increase to our quarterly cash dividend on our common stock from $0.2625 per share to $0.40 per share. In July 2010, our Board of Directors approved a 50 percent 68 Table of Contents increase in our quarterly cash dividend on our common stock from $0.175 per share to $0.2625 per share. Cash dividends per share paid to common shareholders for the last three years were as follows: Quarterly Dividends 2012 2011 2010 First quarter $ 0.40 $ 0.2625 $ 0.175 Second quarter 0.40 0.2625 0.175 Third quarter 0.50 0.40 0.2625 Fourth quarter 0.50 0.40 0.2625 Total $ 1.80 $ 1.325 $ 0.875 Total dividends paid to common shareholders in 2012, 2011 and 2010 were $340 million, $255 million and $172 million, respectively. Declaration and payment of dividends in the future depends upon our income and liquidity position, among other factors, and is subject to declaration by our Board of Directors, who meet quarterly to consider our dividend payment. We expect to fund dividend payments with cash from operations. Credit Ratings A number of our contractual obligations and financing agreements, such as our revolving credit facility, have restrictive covenants and/or pricing modifications that may be triggered in the event of downward revisions to our corporate credit rating. There were no downgrades of our credit ratings in 2012 that have impacted these covenants or pricing modifications. In September 2011, Standard & Poor's Rating Services upgraded our rating to 'A' and changed our outlook to stable. In November 2011, Moody's Investors Service, Inc. raised our rating to 'Baa1' and changed our outlook to positive. In October 2012, Fitch Ratings upgraded our ratings to 'A' and changed our outlook to stable. Credit ratings are not recommendations to buy, are subject to change and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. In addition, we undertake no obligation to update disclosures concerning our credit ratings, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Our ratings and outlook from each of the credit rating agencies as of the date of filing are shown in the table below.

The contractual obligations reported above exclude our unrecognized tax benefits of $145 million as of December 31, 2012. We are not able to reasonably estimate the period in which cash outflows relating to uncertain tax contingencies could occur. See Note 4, "INCOME TAXES," to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.

Our Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP which often requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the reported amounts presented and disclosed in the financial statements. Management reviews these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience, changes in business conditions and other relevant factors they believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. In any given reporting period, our actual results may differ from the estimates and assumptions used in preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements. 70 Table of Contents Critical accounting estimates are defined as follows: the estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the estimate was made; different estimates reasonably could have been used; or if changes in the estimate are reasonably likely to occur from period to period and the change would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Our senior management has discussed the development and selection of our accounting policies, related accounting estimates and the disclosures set forth below with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. We believe our critical accounting estimates include those addressing the estimation of liabilities for warranty programs, recoverability of investment related to new products, accounting for income taxes and pension benefits. Warranty Programs We estimate and record a liability for base warranty programs at the time our products are sold. Our estimates are based on historical experience and reflect management's best estimates of expected costs at the time products are sold and subsequent adjustment to those expected costs when actual costs differ. As a result of the uncertainty surrounding the nature and frequency of product recall programs, the liability for such programs is recorded when we commit to a recall action or when a recall becomes probable and estimable, which generally occurs when it is announced. Our warranty liability is generally affected by component failure rates, repair costs and the point of failure within the product life cycle. Future events and circumstances related to these factors could materially change our estimates and require adjustments to our liability. New product launches require a greater use of judgment in developing estimates until historical experience becomes available. Product specific experience is typically available four or five quarters after product launch, with a clear experience trend evident eight quarters after launch. We generally record warranty expense for new products upon shipment using a preceding product's warranty history and a multiplicative factor based upon preceding similar product experience and new product assessment until sufficient new product data is available for warranty estimation. We then use a blend of actual new product experience and preceding product historical experience for several subsequent quarters, and new product specific experience thereafter. Note 11, "PRODUCT WARRANTY LIABILITY," to our Consolidated Financial Statements contains a summary of the activity in our warranty liability account for 2012 and 2011 including adjustments to pre-existing warranties. Recoverability of Investment Related to New Products At December 31, 2012, we have capitalized $233 million associated with the future launch of our new light-duty diesel engine product. Development of this product began in 2006. Market uncertainty related to the global recession that began in 2008 resulted in some customers delaying or cancelling their vehicle programs. At December 31, 2009, we reviewed our investment of $216 million for possible impairment. We used projections to assess whether future cash flows on an undiscounted basis related to the assets are likely to exceed the related carrying amount to determine if a write-down was appropriate. These projections required estimates about product volume and the size of the market for vehicles that are not yet developed. We used input from our customers in developing alternative cash flow scenarios. Our analysis indicated that the assets were recoverable. Customers that are expected to purchase sufficient quantities to recover our investment in the new light-duty diesel engine products remained active with the development of this product through 2012, and there were no significant changes to the assumptions used in 2009. If customer expectations or projected volumes deteriorate and we do not identify alternative customers and/or product applications, we could be required to write-down these assets to net realizable value. 71 Table of Contents Accounting for Income Taxes We determine our income tax expense using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Future tax benefits of tax loss and credit carryforwards are also recognized as deferred tax assets. We evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax assets each quarter by assessing the likelihood of future profitability and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize our net deferred tax assets. At December 31, 2012, we recorded net deferred tax assets of $396 million. These assets included $165 million for the value of tax loss and credit carryforwards. A valuation allowance of $95 million was recorded to reduce the tax assets to the net value management believed was more likely than not to be realized. In the event our operating performance deteriorates, future assessments could conclude that a larger valuation allowance will be needed to further reduce the deferred tax assets. In addition, we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to tax audits in these jurisdictions. These audits can involve complex issues, which may require an extended period of time to resolve. We reduce our net tax assets for the estimated additional tax and interest that may result from tax authorities disputing uncertain tax positions we have taken and we believe we have made adequate provision for income taxes for all years that are subject to audit based upon the latest information available. A more complete description of our income taxes and the future benefits of our tax loss and credit carryforwards is disclosed in Note 4, "INCOME TAXES," to our Consolidated Financial Statements . Pension Benefits We sponsor a number of pension plans primarily in the U.S. and the U.K. and to a lesser degree in various other countries. In the U.S. and the U.K. we have several major defined benefit plans that are separately funded. We account for our pension programs in accordance with employers' accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans under GAAP. GAAP requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined using an actuarial basis. As a result, our pension benefit programs are based on a number of statistical and judgmental assumptions that attempt to anticipate future events and are used in calculating the expense and liability related to our plans each year at December 31. These assumptions include discount rates used to value liabilities, assumed rates of return on plan assets, future compensation increases, employee turnover rates, actuarial assumptions relating to retirement age, mortality rates and participant withdrawals. The actuarial assumptions we use may differ significantly from actual results due to changing economic conditions, participant life span and withdrawal rates. These differences may result in a material impact to the amount of net periodic pension expense to be recorded in our Consolidated Financial Statements in the future. The expected long-term return on plan assets is used in calculating the net periodic pension expense. We considered several factors in developing our expected rate of return on plan assets. The long-term rate of return considers historical returns and expected returns on current and projected asset allocations and is generally applied to a five-year average market value of return. Projected returns are based primarily on broad, publicly traded equity and fixed income indices and forward-looking estimates of active portfolio and investment management. As of December 31, 2012, based upon our target asset allocations it is anticipated that our U.S. investment policy will generate an average annual return over the 10-year projection period equal to or in excess of 7.5 percent approximately 40 percent of the time while returns of 9.0 percent or greater are anticipated 25 percent of the time. We expect additional positive returns from active investment management. The 2012 one year return was 14 percent, combined with the very favorable returns in 2011 has eliminated the significant deterioration in pension assets experienced in 2008 as a result of the credit crisis and related market recession. Based on the historical returns and forward-looking return expectations, we believe an investment return assumption of 8.0 percent per year in 2013 for U.S. pension assets is reasonable. 72 Table of Contents The methodology used to determine the rate of return on pension plan assets in the U.K. was based on establishing an equity-risk premium over current long-term bond yields adjusted based on target asset allocations. As of December 31, 2012, based upon our target asset allocations, it is anticipated that our U.K. investment policy will generate an average annual return over the 20-year projection period equal to or in excess of 5.6 percent approximately 50 percent of the time while returns of 6.5 percent or greater are anticipated 25 percent of the time. We expect additional positive returns from active investment management. The one year return for our U.K. plan exceeded 7 percent for 2012 and similar to our U.S. plan, the 2008 market related deterioration in our plan assets has been eliminated. Our strategy with respect to our investments in pension plan assets is to be invested with a long-term outlook. Therefore, the risk and return balance of our asset portfolio should reflect a long-term horizon. Based on the historical returns and forward-looking return expectations, we believe an investment return assumption of 5.8 percent in 2013 for U.K. pension assets is reasonable. Our pension plan asset allocation at December 31, 2012 and 2011 and target allocation for 2013 are as follows: U.S. Plans U.K. Plans Percentage of Plan Assets at December 31, Percentage of Plan Assets at December 31, Target Allocation 2013 Target Allocation 2013 Investment description 2012 2011 2012 2011 Equity securities 40.0 % 40.1 % 44.2 % 40.0 % 43.0 % 45.0 % Fixed income 45.0 % 47.5 % 42.2 % 45.0 % 46.0 % 46.0 % Real estate/other 15.0 % 12.4 % 13.6 % 15.0 % 11.0 % 9.0 % Total 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % The differences between the actual return on plan assets and expected long-term return on plan assets are recognized in the asset value used to calculate net periodic expense over five years. The table below sets forth the expected return assumptions used to develop our pension expense for the period 2010-2012 and our expected rate of return for 2013. Long-Term Expected Return Assumptions 2013 2012 2011 2010 U.S. Plans 8.00 % 8.00 % 8.00 % 8.00 % U.K. Plans 5.80 % 6.50 % 7.00 % 7.25 % A lower expected rate of return will increase our net periodic pension expense and reduce profitability. GAAP for pensions offers various acceptable alternatives to account for the differences that eventually arise between the estimates used in the actuarial valuations and the actual results. It is acceptable to delay or immediately recognize these differences. Under the delayed recognition alternative, changes in pension obligation (including those resulting from plan amendments) and changes in the value of assets set aside to meet those obligations are not recognized in net periodic pension cost as they occur but are recognized initially in comprehensive income and subsequently amortized as components of net periodic pension cost systematically and gradually over future periods. In addition to this approach, GAAP also allows immediate recognition of actuarial gains or losses. Immediate recognition introduces volatility in financial results. We have chosen to delay recognition and amortize actuarial differences over future periods. If we adopted the immediate recognition approach, we would record a loss of $1,082 million ($724 million after-tax) for our U.S. and U.K. pension plans. The difference between the expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred from recognition in our results of operations and, under certain circumstances such as when the difference 73 Table of Contents exceeds 10 percent of the market value of plan assets or the projected benefit obligation (PBO), amortized over future years of service. This is also true of changes to actuarial assumptions. As of December 31, 2012, we had net pension actuarial losses of $734 million and $349 million for the U.S. and U.K. pension plans, respectively. Under GAAP, the actuarial gains and losses are recognized and recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss. Increases in actuarial losses decreased our shareholders' equity by $83 million (after-tax) in 2012. The increases were due to liability losses from reduced discount rates, partially offset by improved plan asset performance in 2012. As these amounts exceed 10 percent of our PBO, the excess is amortized over the average remaining service lives of participating employees. The table below sets forth the net periodic pension expense for the period 2010 through 2012 and our expected expense for 2013. Net Periodic Pension Expense In millions 2013 2012 2011 2010 Pension expense $ 97 $ 64 $ 68 $ 70 We expect 2013 pension expense to be increased significantly over 2012, due to the unfavorable impacts of higher service cost due to increased headcount, decreased discount rates and lower expected asset returns for our U.K. plan as we de-risk plan trust assets moving toward more conservative investments. The decrease in periodic pension expense in 2012 compared to 2011 was due to improved returns on assets and strong contributions in 2011. The decrease in periodic pension expense in 2011 compared to 2010 was due to improved returns on assets as the capital markets began to recover and strong contributions in 2010. Another key assumption used in the development of the net periodic pension expense is the discount rate. The weighted average discount rates used to develop our net periodic pension expense are set forth in the table below. Discount Rates 2013 2012 2011 2010 U.S. Plans 3.97 % 4.82 % 5.42 % 5.60 % U.K. Plans 4.70 % 5.20 % 5.80 % 5.80 % Changes in the discount rate assumptions will impact the interest cost component of the net periodic pension expense calculation. The discount rate enables us to state expected future cash payments for benefits as a present value on the measurement date. The guidelines for setting this rate are discussed in GAAP which suggests the use of a high-quality corporate bond rate. We used bond information provided by Moody's Investor Service Inc., Standard & Poor's Rating Services, Fitch Ratings and Dominion Bond Rating. All bonds used to develop our hypothetical portfolio in the U.S. and U.K. were high-quality, non-callable bonds (Aa or better) as of December 31, 2012, by at least two of the bond rating agencies. The average yield of this hypothetical bond portfolio was used as the benchmark for determining the discount rate to be used to value the obligations of the plans subject to GAAP for pensions and other postretirement benefits. Our model called for 80 years of benefit payments for the U.S. plans and 60 years of payments for the U.K. For both countries, our model matches the present value of the plan's projected benefit payments to the market value of the theoretical settlement bond portfolio. A single equivalent discount rate is determined to align the present value of the required cash flow with the value of the bond portfolio. The resulting discount rate is reflective of both the current interest rate environment and the plan's distinct liability characteristics. 74 Table of Contents The table below sets forth the estimated impact on our 2013 net periodic pension expense relative to a change in the discount rate and a change in the expected rate of return on plan assets. In millions Impact on Pension Expense Increase (Decrease) Discount rate used to value liabilities 0.25 percent increase $ (9 ) 0.25 percent decrease 9 Expected rate of return on assets One percent increase (34 ) One percent decrease 34 The above sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time. A higher discount rate decreases the plan obligations and decreases our net periodic pension expense. A lower discount rate increases the plan obligations and increases our net periodic pension expense. It should be noted that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear. Note 12, "PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS," to our Consolidated Financial Statements provides a summary of our pension benefit plan activity, the funded status of our plans and the amounts recognized in our Consolidated Financial Statements . RECENTLY ADOPTED AND RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted In June 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) amended its rules regarding the presentation of comprehensive income. The objective of this amendment was to improve the comparability, consistency and transparency of financial reporting and to increase the prominence of items reported in other comprehensive income. Specifically, this amendment requires that all non-owner changes in shareholders' equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. In addition, the standard also requires disclosure of the location of reclassification adjustments between other comprehensive income and net income on the face of the financial statements. The new rules became effective for us beginning January 1, 2012. In December 2011, the FASB deferred certain aspects of this standard beyond the current effective date, specifically the provisions dealing with reclassification adjustments. Because the standard only impacts the display of comprehensive income and does not impact what is included in comprehensive income, the standard did not have a significant impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements . In May 2011, the FASB amended its standards related to fair value measurements and disclosures. The objective of the amendment was to improve the comparability of fair value measurements presented and disclosed in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards. Primarily this amendment changed the wording used to describe many of the requirements in U.S. GAAP for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements in addition to clarifying the Board's intent about the application of existing fair value measurement requirements. The new standard also requires additional disclosures related to fair value measurements categorized within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy and requires disclosure of the categorization in the hierarchy for items which are not recorded at fair value but fair value is required to be disclosed. The new rules were effective for us beginning January 1, 2012. As of December 31, 2012, we had no fair value measurements categorized within Level 3 outside of our pension plans. The only impact for us is the disclosure of the categorization in the fair value hierarchy for those items where fair value is only disclosed (primarily our debt 75 Table of Contents obligations). Our disclosure related to the new standard is included in Note 6, "FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS," to the Consolidated Financial Statements . Accounting Pronouncements Issued But Not Yet Effective In December 2011, the FASB amended its standards related to offsetting assets and liabilities. This amendment requires entities to disclose both gross and net information about certain instruments and transactions eligible for offset in the statement of financial position and certain instruments and transactions subject to an agreement similar to a master netting agreement. This information will enable users of the financial statements to understand the effect of those arrangements on its financial position. The new rules will become effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013, and interim periods within those annual periods. It is also required that the new disclosures are applied for all comparative periods presented. In January 2013, the FASB further amended this standard to limit its scope to derivatives, repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements, securities borrowings and lending transactions. We do not believe this amendment will have a significant effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements . While we are still finalizing our analysis, due to the scope limitation we also do not expect any significant changes to our footnote disclosures. In February 2013, the FASB amended its standards on comprehensive income by requiring disclosure in the footnotes of information about amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component. Specifically, the amendment will require disclosure of the line items of net income in which the item was reclassified only if it is reclassified to net income in its entirety in the same reporting period. It will also require cross reference to other disclosures for amounts that are not reclassified in their entirety in the same reporting period. The new disclosures will be required for us prospectively only for annual periods beginning January 1, 2013 and interim periods within those annual periods.
