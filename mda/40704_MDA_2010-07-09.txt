ITEM 7 Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW We are a global consumer foods company. We develop distinctive value-added food products and market them under unique brand names. We work continuously to improve our established products and to create new products that meet consumers evolving needs and preferences. In addition, we build the equity of our brands over time with strong consumer-directed marketing and innovative merchandising. We believe our brand-building strategy is the key to winning and sustaining leading share positions in markets around the globe. Our fundamental business goal is to generate superior returns for our stockholders over the long term. We believe that increases in net sales, segment operating profit, earnings per share (EPS), and return on average total capital are the key measures of financial performance for our businesses. See the Non-GAAP Measures section below for a description of our discussion of total segment operating profit, diluted EPS excluding certain items affecting comparability and return on average total capital, which are not defined by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Our objectives are to consistently deliver: low single-digit annual growth in net sales; mid single-digit annual growth in total segment operating profit; high single-digit annual growth in EPS; and improvements in return on average total capital. We believe that this financial performance, coupled with an attractive dividend yield, should result in long-term value creation for stockholders. We also return a substantial amount of cash annually to stockholders through share repurchases. For the fiscal year ended May 30, 2010, our net sales grew 1 percent, total segment operating profit grew 8 percent, diluted EPS grew 18 percent, and our return on average total capital improved by 150 basis points. Diluted EPS growth excluding certain items affecting comparability, a non-GAAP measure used for management reporting and incentive compensation purposes, was 16 percent (see the Non-GAAP Measures section below for our use of this measure and our discussion of the items affecting comparability). Net cash provided by operations totaled $2.2 billion in fiscal 2010, enabling us to increase our annual dividend payments per share by 12 percent from fiscal 2009 and continue returning cash to stockholders through share repurchases, which totaled $692 million in fiscal 2010. We also made significant capital investments totaling $650 million in fiscal 2010. These results met or exceeded our long-term targets. We achieved each of our five key operating objectives for fiscal 2010: We generated broad-based growth in net sales across our businesses which enabled us to achieve a year-over-year increase, despite one less week in fiscal 2010. Contributions from volume were flat, including the loss of 2 points of growth from divested products and a 1 point loss from an additional week in fiscal 2009. We 18 Table of Contents generated 1 point of growth from net price realization and product mix. Foreign exchange was flat compared to fiscal 2009. We increased our gross margin as a percent of net sales 410 basis points driven by a decrease in input costs and a focus on our holistic margin management (HMM) programs, which include cost-savings initiatives, marketing spending efficiencies, and profitable sales mix strategies. We invested a significant amount in media and other brand-building marketing programs, which contributed to net sales growth on our consumer businesses. We grew our Bakeries and Foodservice segment operating profit, including a focus on higher-margin, branded product lines within our most attractive foodservice customer channels. We continued to develop our business in international markets. We focused on our core platforms of ready-to-eat cereal, super premium ice cream, convenient meal solutions, and healthy snacking by introducing new products and investing in consumer spending. Details of our financial results are provided in the Fiscal 2010 Consolidated Results of Operations section below. In fiscal 2011, we expect to deliver another year of quality growth. We are targeting low single-digit growth in net sales driven by volume gains. We have a strong line-up of consumer marketing, merchandising, and innovation planned to fuel growth for our leading brands. We will continue to build our four global platforms in markets around the world, accelerating our efforts in rapidly growing emerging markets. The environment remains challenging for the Bakeries and Foodservice segment, but we believe that our focus on higher-margin branded product lines within the most attractive foodservice channels will drive performance for this segment. We remain committed to using HMM to help manage our costs. We are targeting mid single-digit growth in segment operating profit, despite renewed input cost inflation and continued investment in advertising and media. Our businesses generate strong levels of cash flows. We use some of this cash to reinvest in our business, and our fiscal 2011 plans call for $700 million of expenditures for capital projects. We also prioritize returning cash to stockholders. Our plan for fiscal 2011 includes significant cash returned to stockholders through share repurchases and dividends. Our long-term objective is to reduce outstanding shares by a net 2 percent per year. We intend to continue repurchasing shares in fiscal 2011 in-line with our long-term objective. On June 28, 2010, our Board of Directors approved a dividend increase to an annual rate of $1.12 per share, a 17 percent increase from the rate paid in fiscal 2010. Our Board of Directors also approved and we announced an authorization for the repurchase of up to 100,000,000 shares of our common stock. This new authorization terminated and replaced a December 11, 2006 repurchase authorization. In May 2010, our Board of Directors approved a two-for-one stock split to be effected in the form of a 100 percent stock dividend to stockholders of record on May 28, 2010. The Company stockholders received one additional share of common stock for each share of common stock in their possession on that date. The additional shares were distributed on June 8, 2010. This did not change the proportionate interest that a stockholder maintained in the Company. All shares and per share amounts have been adjusted for the two-for-one stock split throughout this report. Certain terms used throughout this report are defined in a glossary in Item 8 of this report. FISCAL 2010 CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS In fiscal 2010, net earnings attributable to General Mills was $1,530 million, up 17 percent from $1,304 million in fiscal 2009, and we reported diluted EPS of $2.24 in fiscal 2010, up 18 percent from $1.90 in fiscal 2009. Fiscal 2010 and 2009 results include losses from the mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions and grain inventories. Fiscal 2010 results also include income tax expense related to the enactment of federal health care reform, and the fiscal 2009 results include a net divestiture gain, income from a settlement with an insurance carrier, and the impact of a court decision on an uncertain tax matter. Diluted EPS excluding these items affecting comparability, a non-GAAP measure used for management reporting and incentive compensation purposes, was 19 Table of Contents $2.30 in fiscal 2010, up 16 percent from $1.99 in fiscal 2009 (see the Non-GAAP Measures section below for our use of this measure and our discussion of the items affecting comparability). The components of net sales growth are shown in the following table: Components of Net Sales Growth Fiscal 2010 vs. 2009 Contributions from volume growth (a) Flat Net price realization and mix 1 pt Foreign currency exchange Flat Net sales growth 1 pt (a) Measured in tons based on the stated weight of our product shipments. Net sales grew 1 point in fiscal 2010, driven by 1 percentage point of growth from net price realization and mix. Contributions from volume were flat, including the loss of 2 points of growth from divested products and a 1 percentage point loss from an additional week in fiscal 2009. Foreign exchange did not affect sales growth in fiscal 2010. Cost of sales decreased $535 million in fiscal 2010 to $8,923 million. This decrease was mainly driven by favorable mix, HMM initiatives, and lower input costs. In fiscal 2010, we recorded a $7 million net increase in cost of sales related to mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions and grain inventories as described in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report, compared to a net increase of $119 million in fiscal 2009. In fiscal 2010, we recorded a charge of $48 million resulting from a change in the capitalization threshold for certain equipment parts, enabled by an upgrade to our parts management system. Gross margin grew 12 percent in fiscal 2010 versus fiscal 2009. Gross margin as a percent of net sales increased by 410 basis points from fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2010. These improvements were driven by favorable mix, HMM initiatives and lower input costs. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were up $284 million in fiscal 2010 versus fiscal 2009. SG&A expenses as a percent of net sales in fiscal 2010 increased by 2 percentage points compared to fiscal 2009. The increase in SG&A expenses was primarily driven by a 24 percent increase in advertising and media expense. In fiscal 2010, the Venezuelan government devalued the Bolivar exchange rate against the U.S. dollar. The effect of the devaluation was a $14 million foreign exchange loss. Also in fiscal 2010, we recorded a $13 million recovery against a corporate investment compared to write downs of $35 million related to various corporate investments in fiscal 2009. In fiscal 2009, we recorded a $41 million gain from a settlement with the insurance carrier covering the loss of our La Salte a pasta manufacturing facility in Argentina, which was destroyed by fire in fiscal 2008. There were no divestitures in fiscal 2010. In fiscal 2009, we recorded a net divestiture gain of $129 million related to the sale of our Pop Secret product line from our U.S. Retail segment for $192 million in cash. Also in fiscal 2009, we recorded a $38 million loss on the sale of a portion of the assets of our frozen unbaked bread dough product line in our Bakeries and Foodservice segment, including the discontinuation of our frozen dinner roll product line in our U.S. Retail segment that shared a divested facility. In addition, we recorded a $6 million loss in fiscal 2009 on the sale of our bread concentrates product line in our Bakeries and Foodservice segment. Interest, net for fiscal 2010 totaled $402 million, $19 million higher than fiscal 2009. Average interest-bearing instruments decreased $1.0 billion in fiscal 2010, leading to a $58 million decrease in net interest, while average interest rates increased 60 basis points generating a $37 million increase in net interest. The average interest rate on our total outstanding debt was 6.3 percent in fiscal 2010 compared to 5.7 percent in fiscal 2009. In fiscal 2010, we also recorded a loss of $40 million related to the repurchase of certain notes, which represented the premium paid, the write-off of the remaining discount and unamortized fees, and the settlement of the related swaps. 20 Table of Contents Restructuring, impairment, and other exit costs totaled $31 million in fiscal 2010 as follows: Expense (Income), in Millions Discontinuation of kids refrigerated yogurt beverage and microwave soup product lines $ 24.1 Discontinuation of the breadcrumbs product line at Federalsburg, Maryland plant 6.2 Sale of Contagem, Brazil bread and pasta plant (0.6 ) Charges associated with restructuring actions previously announced 1.7 Total $ 31.4 In fiscal 2010, we decided to exit our kids refrigerated yogurt beverage product line at our Murfreesboro, Tennessee plant and our microwave soup product line at our Vineland, New Jersey plant to rationalize capacity for more profitable items. Our decisions to exit these U.S. Retail segment products resulted in a $24 million non-cash charge against the related long-lived assets. No employees were affected by these actions. We expect to recognize $2 million of other exit costs related to these actions, which we anticipate will be completed by the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2011. We also decided to exit our breadcrumb product line at our Federalsburg, Maryland plant in our Bakeries and Foodservice segment. As a result of this decision, we concluded that the future cash flows generated by these products were insufficient to recover the net book value of the associated long-lived assets. Accordingly, we recorded a non-cash charge of $6 million primarily related to the impairment of these long-lived assets and in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, we sold our manufacturing facility in Federalsburg for $3 million. In fiscal 2010, we also recorded a $1 million net gain on the sale of our previously closed Contagem, Brazil bread and pasta plant for cash proceeds of $6 million, and recorded $2 million of costs related to previously announced restructuring actions. In fiscal 2010, we paid $8 million in cash related to restructuring actions taken in fiscal 2010 and previous years. Our consolidated effective tax rate for fiscal 2010 was 35.0 percent compared to 37.1 percent in fiscal 2009. The 2.1 percentage point decrease primarily reflects an unfavorable court decision last year on an uncertain tax matter, which increased fiscal 2009 income tax expense by $53 million. In addition, fiscal 2009 included $15 million of tax expense related to nondeductible goodwill write-offs associated with divestitures. Fiscal 2010 income tax expense included a $35 million increase related to the enactment of federal health care reform (the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010). This legislation changed the tax treatment of subsidies to companies that provide prescription drug benefits that are at least the equivalent of benefits under Medicare Part D (see the Impact of Inflation section below for additional discussion of this legislation). The fiscal 2010 tax rate also included increased benefits from the domestic manufacturing deduction. After-tax earnings from joint ventures for fiscal 2010 increased to $102 million compared to $92 million in the same period in fiscal 2009. In fiscal 2010, net sales for CPW grew 6 percent, due to 4 percentage points of growth from net price realization and mix, 1 percentage point from favorable foreign exchange and a 1 percentage point increase in volume, including growth in Russia, Southeast Asia, the Middle East and Latin America. Net sales for HDJ decreased 4 percent, due primarily to an 11 percentage point decline in volume, partially offset by favorable foreign exchange. Average diluted shares outstanding decreased by 4 million in fiscal 2010 from fiscal 2009, due primarily to the timing of share repurchases including the repurchase of 21 million shares since the end of fiscal 2009, partially offset by the issuance of shares upon stock option exercises. FISCAL 2010 CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS Cash and cash equivalents decreased $77 million from fiscal 2009, as discussed in the Liquidity section below. Receivables increased $88 million from fiscal 2009, as a result of sales timing shifts and a $33 million increase in foreign exchange translation. The allowance for doubtful accounts was essentially unchanged from fiscal 2009. 21 Table of Contents Inventories were essentially flat to fiscal 2009 balances. Prepaid expenses and other current assets decreased $91 million from fiscal 2009, due mainly to a $48 million decrease in certain equipment parts as a result of a change in the capitalization threshold, enabled by an upgrade to our parts management system. In addition, there was a $22 million decrease in notes receivable and a $19 million reduction in collateral for certain derivative contracts. Land, buildings, and equipment increased $93 million from fiscal 2009, as capital expenditures of $650 million were partially offset by depreciation expense of $448 million and foreign exchange impact of $32 million in fiscal 2010. Goodwill and other intangible assets decreased $102 million from fiscal 2009 primarily due to foreign currency translation. Other assets decreased $132 million from fiscal 2009, driven mainly by a $193 million decrease in our prepaid pension assets due to a decrease in the funded status of our pension plans and a $60 million decrease in non-current interest rate derivative receivables, partially offset by an increase in advances to joint ventures, mainly CPW, of $131 million. Accounts payable increased $46 million to $850 million in fiscal 2010 as a result of an increase in SG&A expenses and shifts in timing. Long-term debt, including current portion, and notes payable decreased $650 million from fiscal 2009. In May 2010, we paid $437 million to repurchase $400 million of debt as part of a cash tender offer. We repurchased $221 million of our 6.0 percent notes due 2012 and $179 million of the 5.65 percent notes due 2012. The current and noncurrent portions of net deferred income taxes liability decreased $318 million from fiscal 2009, due to increased pension and post retirement liabilities and the book versus tax treatment of our deferred compensation plans. We also incurred $22 million of deferred income tax expense in fiscal 2010, including a $35 million increase in the net deferred income tax liability related to changes in the tax treatment of subsidies to companies that provide prescription drug benefits that are at least the equivalent of benefits under Medicare Part D included in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010. Other current liabilities increased $280 million from fiscal 2009, primarily driven by increases in accrued taxes of $272 million and an $82 million increase in consumer marketing accruals. These increases were partially offset by a $46 million decrease in accrued interest payable. Other liabilities increased $186 million from fiscal 2009, driven by an increase in accrued compensation and benefits of $537 million primarily due to a decrease in the funded status of our pension plans, partially offset by a $265 million shift in taxes payable from non-current to current and a $78 million decrease in non-current interest derivatives payable. Retained earnings increased $887 million from fiscal 2009, reflecting fiscal 2010 net earnings of $1,530 million less dividends paid of $644 million. Treasury stock increased $142 million from fiscal 2009, due to $692 million of share repurchases, partially offset by $550 million related to stock-based compensation plans. Additional paid in capital increased $95 million from fiscal 2009, due to stock compensation plan activity. Accumulated other comprehensive loss (AOCI) increased by $609 million after-tax from fiscal 2009, primarily driven by losses in our pension, other postretirement, and postemployment benefit plans of $460 million. Noncontrolling interests increased by $1 million from fiscal 2009, due primarily to an increase in net earnings attributable to General Mills Cereals, LLC (GMC) in fiscal 2010. 22 Table of Contents FISCAL 2009 CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Net earnings attributable to General Mills were $1,304 million in fiscal 2009, up 1 percent from $1,295 million in fiscal 2008, and we reported diluted EPS of $1.90 in fiscal 2009, up 3 percent from $1.85 in fiscal 2008. Fiscal 2009 and 2008 results include effects from the mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions and grain inventories, and the effects of court rulings on an uncertain tax matter. Fiscal 2009 results also include a net divestiture gain and income from a settlement with an insurance carrier. Diluted EPS excluding these items affecting comparability, a non-GAAP measure used for management reporting and incentive compensation purposes, was $1.99 in fiscal 2009, up 13 percent from $1.76 in fiscal 2008 (see the Non-GAAP Measures section below for our use of this measure and our discussion of the items affecting comparability). The components of net sales growth are shown in the following table: Components of Net Sales Growth Fiscal 2009 vs. 2008 Contributions from volume growth (a) 2 pts Net price realization and mix 8 pts Foreign currency exchange -2 pts Net sales growth 8 pts (a) Measured in tons based on the stated weight of our product shipments. Net sales for fiscal 2009 grew 8 percent to $14.7 billion, driven by 2 percentage points of volume growth, mainly in our U.S. Retail and International segments, and 8 percentage points of growth from net price realization and mix. This growth was offset by 2 percentage points of unfavorable foreign currency exchange. The 53rd week in fiscal 2009 contributed 1 percentage point of net sales growth. Cost of sales was up $680 million in fiscal 2009 versus fiscal 2008, while cost of sales as a percent of net sales remained essentially flat from fiscal 2008 to fiscal 2009. Higher volume drove $90 million of the increase in cost of sales. Higher input costs and changes in mix increased cost of sales by $453 million. We also recorded a $119 million net increase in cost of sales related to mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions and grain inventories, compared to a net decrease of $57 million in fiscal 2008. In fiscal 2008, we recorded $18 million of charges to cost of sales, primarily for depreciation associated with restructured assets. Cost of sales for fiscal 2008 also included $21 million of costs, including product write-offs, logistics, and other costs related to voluntary product recalls. Gross margin grew 7 percent in fiscal 2009 versus fiscal 2008, as operating leverage, cost savings initiatives, and net price realization offset input cost inflation. Gross margin as a percent of net sales decreased by 10 basis points from fiscal 2008 to fiscal 2009. SG&A expenses increased by $328 million in fiscal 2009 versus fiscal 2008. The increase in SG&A expenses from fiscal 2008 was largely the result of a 17 percent increase in advertising and media expense and other consumer marketing spending consistent with our brand-building strategy, along with higher levels of compensation and benefits expense. We also recorded write-downs of $35 million related to various corporate investments in fiscal 2009, compared to a net gain of $16 million in fiscal 2008. These higher costs were partially offset by a $41 million settlement with the insurance carrier covering our La Salte a pasta manufacturing plant in Argentina that was destroyed by fire. SG&A expenses as a percent of net sales increased by 90 basis points in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008. During fiscal 2009 we recorded a net divestiture gain of $85 million. We recorded a gain of $129 million related to the sale of our Pop Secret microwave popcorn product line from our U.S. Retail segment. We recorded a $38 million loss on the sale of a portion of the assets of our frozen unbaked bread dough product line in our Bakeries and Foodservice segment, including the discontinuation of our frozen dinner roll product line in our U.S. Retail segment 23 Table of Contents that shared a divested facility. In addition, we recorded a $6 million loss on the sale of our bread concentrates product line in our Bakeries and Foodservice segment. Interest, net for fiscal 2009 totaled $383 million, $17 million lower than fiscal 2008. Average interest-bearing instruments decreased $70 million in fiscal 2009 leading to a $4 million decrease in net interest. Average interest rates also decreased 20 basis points generating a $13 million decrease in net interest. The average interest rate on our total outstanding debt was 5.7 percent in fiscal 2009 compared to 5.9 percent in fiscal 2008. Restructuring, impairment, and other exit costs totaled $42 million in fiscal 2009 as follows: Expense, in Millions Closure of Contagem, Brazil bread and pasta plant $ 16.8 Discontinuation of product line at Murfreesboro, Tennessee plant 8.3 Charges associated with restructuring actions previously announced 16.5 Total $ 41.6 In fiscal 2009, due to declining financial results, we approved the restructuring of our International segment business in Brazil. We discontinued the production and marketing of Forno De Minas cheese bread and Frescarini pasta brands in Brazil and closed our Contagem, Brazil manufacturing facility. These actions affected 556 employees in our Brazilian operations. Our other product lines in Brazil were not affected by the decision. As a result of this decision, we incurred a charge of $17 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, consisting primarily of $5 million of employee severance, an $11 million non-cash impairment charge to write down assets to their net realizable value, and $1 million of other costs associated with this restructuring action. This restructuring action was completed in the second quarter of fiscal 2010. Due to declining net sales and to improve manufacturing capacity for other product lines, we decided to exit our U.S. Retail segment Perfect Portions refrigerated biscuits product line at our manufacturing facility in Murfreesboro, Tennessee. We recorded an $8 million non-cash impairment charge against long lived assets used for this product line. Our other product lines at Murfreesboro were not affected by the decision, and no employees were affected by this action, which was completed in the second quarter of fiscal 2010. In fiscal 2009, we also incurred $17 million of incremental plant closure expenses related to previously announced restructuring activities, including $10 million for the remainder of our lease obligation at our previously closed facility in Trenton, Ontario. In fiscal 2009, we paid $10 million in cash related to restructuring actions taken in fiscal 2009 and previous years. Our consolidated effective income tax rate for fiscal 2009 was 37.1 percent compared to 34.0 percent in fiscal 2008. The increase in the effective rate is primarily due to the effect of a 2009 U.S. appellate court decision that reversed a 2008 U.S. district court decision. In the third quarter of fiscal 2008, we recorded an income tax benefit of $31 million as a result of a favorable U.S. district court decision on an uncertain tax matter. In the third quarter of fiscal 2009, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit issued an opinion reversing the district court decision. As a result, we recorded $53 million (including interest) of income tax expense related to the reversal of cumulative income tax benefits from this uncertain tax matter recognized in fiscal years 1992 through 2008. The rate also increased in fiscal 2009 due to $15 million of tax expense related to nondeductible goodwill write-offs associated with our divestitures. Other items that decreased the 2009 effective income tax rate include a favorable California appeals court decision that resulted in the recognition of $10 million of tax benefits. In addition, we recognized $21 million of other tax benefits, primarily related to foreign tax credits and audit settlements. After-tax earnings from joint ventures totaled $92 million in fiscal 2009, compared to $111 million in fiscal 2008. Fiscal 2009 earnings were reduced by a $6 million deferred income tax valuation allowance. In fiscal 2008, earnings included $16 million for our share of a gain on the sale of a CPW property in the United Kingdom offset by 24 Table of Contents restructuring expenses of $8 million. Fiscal 2008 results also included $2 million for our share of a gain on the sale of the 8th Continent soymilk business. In fiscal 2009, net sales for CPW increased 5 percent. Volume growth of 4 percentage points, including growth in Russia, the Middle East, Asia, and Latin America, and net price realization were offset by unfavorable foreign exchange. Net sales for our H agen-Dazs joint venture in Japan increased 2 percent in fiscal 2009 as a result of favorable foreign exchange of 11 percentage points and positive net price realization, offset by a decrease in volume. Average diluted shares outstanding decreased by 7 million from fiscal 2008 due to the repurchase of 40 million shares of common stock in fiscal 2009, partially offset by the issuance of 29 million shares of common stock in fiscal 2008 to settle a forward contract with an affiliate of Lehman Brothers, Inc. (Lehman Brothers), the issuance of common stock upon stock option exercises, the issuance of annual stock awards, the vesting of restricted stock units, and the issuance of shares to acquire Humm Foods. RESULTS OF SEGMENT OPERATIONS Our businesses are organized into three operating segments: U.S. Retail; International; and Bakeries and Foodservice. The following tables provide the dollar amount and percentage of net sales and operating profit from each segment for fiscal years 2010, 2009, and 2008: Net Sales Percent of Percent of Percent of Net Sales Net Sales Net Sales Net Sales Net Sales Net Sales Fiscal Year In Millions 2010 2009 2008 U.S. Retail $ 10,323.5 70 % $ 10,052.1 68 % $ 9,072.0 66 % International 2,702.5 18 2,591.4 18 2,558.8 19 Bakeries and Foodservice 1,770.5 12 2,047.8 14 2,021.3 15 Total $ 14,796.5 100 % $ 14,691.3 100 % $ 13,652.1 100 % Segment Operating Profit Percent of Percent of Percent of Segment Segment Segment Segment Segment Segment Operating Operating Operating Operating Operating Operating Profit Profit Profit Profit Profit Profit Fiscal Year In Millions 2010 2009 2008 U.S. Retail $ 2,392.0 83 % $ 2,208.5 84 % $ 1,971.2 82 % International 219.2 8 263.5 10 270.3 11 Bakeries and Foodservice 250.1 9 171.0 6 165.4 7 Total $ 2,861.3 100 % $ 2,643.0 100 % $ 2,406.9 100 % Segment operating profit excludes unallocated corporate items, gain on divestitures, and restructuring, impairment, and other exit costs because these items affecting operating profit are centrally managed at the corporate level and are excluded from the measure of segment profitability reviewed by our executive management. U.S. RETAIL SEGMENT Our U.S. Retail segment reflects business with a wide variety of grocery stores, mass merchandisers, membership stores, natural food chains, and drug, dollar and discount chains operating throughout the United States. Our major 25 Table of Contents product categories in this business segment are ready-to-eat cereals, refrigerated yogurt, ready-to-serve soup, dry dinners, shelf stable and frozen vegetables, refrigerated and frozen dough products, dessert and baking mixes, frozen pizza and pizza snacks, grain, fruit and savory snacks, and a wide variety of organic products including soup, granola bars, and cereal. Components of net sales growth are shown in the following table: Components of U.S. Retail Net Sales Growth Fiscal 2010 Fiscal 2009 vs. 2009 vs. 2008 Contributions from volume growth (a) 1 pt 4 pts Net price realization and mix 2 pts 7 pts Net sales growth 3 pts 11 pts (a) Measured in tons based on the stated weight of our product shipments. In fiscal 2010, net sales for our U.S. Retail segment were $10.3 billion, up 3 percent from fiscal 2009. Net price realization and mix added 2 percentage points of growth and volume on a tonnage basis contributed 1 percentage point of growth including a loss of 2 percentage points from an additional week in fiscal 2009. Net sales for this segment totaled $10.1 billion in fiscal 2009 and $9.1 billion in fiscal 2008. Net price realization and mix added 7 percentage points of growth and volume on a tonnage basis contributed 4 percentage points of growth from fiscal 2008 to fiscal 2009. We experienced growth in all of our U.S. retail divisions in fiscal 2010 as shown in the tables below: U.S. Retail Net Sales by Division Fiscal Year 2010 2009 2008 Big G $ 2,382.2 $ 2,259.5 $ 2,028.0 Meals 2,168.2 2,157.1 2,006.1 Pillsbury 1,883.8 1,869.8 1,673.4 Yoplait 1,504.2 1,468.9 1,293.1 Snacks 1,326.9 1,246.6 1,197.6 Baking Products 854.8 850.7 723.3 Small Planet Foods and other 203.4 199.5 150.5 Total $ 10,323.5 $ 10,052.1 $ 9,072.0 26 Table of Contents U.S. Retail Net Sales Percentage Change by Division Fiscal 2010 Fiscal 2009 vs. 2009 vs. 2008 Big G 5 % 11 % Meals 1 8 Pillsbury 1 12 Yoplait 2 14 Snacks 6 4 Baking Products Flat 18 Small Planet Foods 3 30 Total 3 % 11 % In fiscal 2010, net sales for Big G cereals grew 5 percent driven by Multigrain Cheerios , Cinnamon Toast Crunch , and Fiber One cereals and introductory sales of Chocolate Cheerios and Wheaties Fuel . Meals division net sales increased 1 percent as gains from Green Giant frozen vegetables and Old El Paso Mexican products were partially offset by lower sales of Progresso ready-to-serve soups. Pillsbury net sales grew 1 percent including gains on Totino pizza and Pizza Rolls snacks and Pillsbury Toaster Strudel pastries. Net sales for Yoplait grew 2 percent, led by introductory sales from Yoplait Delights and Yoplait Greek style yogurt. Snacks net sales grew 6 percent, driven by Fiber One bars, Nature Valley grain snacks and several fruit snack varieties. Net sales for Baking Products were flat. Small Planet Food net sales were up 3 percent, reflecting performance of Cascadian Farm cereal and granola bars and L rabar fruit and nut energy bars. In fiscal 2009, Big G cereals net sales increased 11 percent driven by growth across the portfolio, including gains on MultiGrain Cheerios , Honey Nut Cheerios , Cinnamon Toast Crunch, and the Fiber One cereals. Net sales for Meals grew 8 percent led by Helper dinner mixes, the new Macaroni Grill dinner mix line, and Green Giant frozen vegetables. Pillsbury net sales increased 12 percent led by Totino pizza and Pizza Rolls snacks, Pillsbury refrigerated dough products, and new Pillsbury Savorings frozen appetizers. Yoplait net sales grew 14 percent led by contributions from Yoplait Light. Net sales for Snacks increased 4 percent, as gains in grain snacks including Fiber One bars and Chex Mix more than offset the reduction in sales from the divestiture of Pop Secret in fiscal 2009. Baking Products net sales grew 18 percent reflecting gains in Betty Crocker dessert mixes, Bisquick baking mix, and Gold Medal flour. Net sales for Small Planet Foods grew 30 percent including contributions from the L rabar product line acquired in fiscal 2009. Segment operating profit of $2.4 billion in fiscal 2010 improved $184 million, or 8 percent, over fiscal 2009. The increase was primarily driven by favorable supply chain costs of $218 million, net price realization and mix of $153 million, and volume growth of $49 million, partially offset by a 22 percent increase in advertising and media expense and higher administrative costs. Segment operating profit of $2.2 billion in fiscal 2009 improved $237 million, or 12 percent, over fiscal 2008. Net price realization and mix increased segment operating profit by $596 million, and volume growth increased segment operating profit by $146 million. These were partially offset by increased supply chain input costs of $338 million, a 19 percent increase in consumer marketing expense consistent with our brand-building strategy, and higher administrative costs. In fiscal 2008, voluntary product recalls reduced segment operating profit by $24 million. INTERNATIONAL SEGMENT In Canada, our major product categories are ready-to-eat cereals, shelf stable and frozen vegetables, dry dinners, refrigerated and frozen dough products, dessert and baking mixes, frozen pizza snacks, and grain, fruit and savory snacks. In markets outside North America, our product categories include super-premium ice cream, grain snacks, shelf stable and frozen vegetables, dough products, and dry dinners. Our International segment also includes products manufactured in the United States for export, mainly to Caribbean and Latin American markets, as well as products we manufacture for sale to our international joint ventures. Revenues from export activities are reported in 27 Table of Contents the region or country where the end customer is located. These international businesses are managed through 34 sales and marketing offices.

In fiscal 2010, net sales for our International segment were $2,702 million, up 4 percent from fiscal 2009. This growth was driven by 3 percentage points from net price realization and mix and 1 percentage point of favorable foreign currency exchange. Pound volume was flat, reflecting a 2 percentage point reduction from divested product lines. Net sales totaled $2,591 million in fiscal 2009, up 1 percent from $2,559 million in fiscal 2008. The growth in fiscal 2009 was driven mainly by 9 percentage points of net price realization and mix and 1 percentage point of volume growth, partially offset by 9 percentage points of unfavorable foreign currency exchange.

In the Asia/Pacific region, net sales grew 14 percent due to growth from H agen-Dazs shops and Wanchai Ferry products in China. Latin America net sales decreased 11 percent due to unfavorable foreign currency exchange, partially offset by net price realization. 28 Table of Contents In fiscal 2009, net sales in Europe decreased by 5 percent driven by 9 points of unfavorable foreign currency exchange, partially offset by net sales growth of Old El Paso across Europe and dough products in the United Kingdom. Net sales in Canada decreased 6 percent due to 13 points of unfavorable foreign currency exchange partially offset by growth from cereal products and Fiber One bars. Net sales in the Asia/Pacific region increased by 10 percent, including sales growth for H agen-Dazs and Wanchai Ferry brands in China, and increased sales of Old El Paso and Latina in Australia. Latin America net sales increased 16 percent due to net price realization and the sales volume recovery in Argentina after a fire destroyed our La Salte a manufacturing facility in fiscal 2008. Segment operating profit for fiscal 2010 declined 17 percent to $219 million from $264 million in fiscal 2009, reflecting unfavorable foreign currency effects and a 31 percent increase in advertising and media expense, partially offset by favorable net price realization. In January 2010, the Venezuelan government devalued the Bolivar by resetting the official exchange rate. The effect of the devaluation was a $14 million foreign exchange loss, primarily on the revaluation of non-Bolivar monetary balances in Venezuela. We continue to use the official exchange rate to remeasure the financial statements of our Venezuelan operations, as we intend to remit dividends solely through the government-operated Foreign Exchange Administration Board (CADIVI). The devaluation of the Bolivar also reduced the U.S. dollar equivalent of our Venezuelan results of operations and financial condition, but this did not have a material impact on our results. During fiscal 2010, Venezuela became a highly inflationary economy, which did not have a material impact on our results in fiscal 2010. Segment operating profit for fiscal 2009 declined 3 percent to $264 million, from $270 million in fiscal 2008, driven by a 14 percentage point decrease due to unfavorable foreign exchange. Increases in net price realization and mix and volume growth offset increases in supply chain input costs of $16 million and a 3 percent increase in advertising and media marketing expense. BAKERIES AND FOODSERVICE SEGMENT In our Bakeries and Foodservice segment our major product categories are cereals, snacks, yogurt, unbaked and fully baked frozen dough products, baking mixes, and flour. Many products we sell are branded to the consumer and nearly all are branded to our customers. We sell to distributors and operators in many customer channels including foodservice, convenience stores, vending, and supermarket bakeries. Components of net sales growth are shown in the following table: Components of Bakeries and Foodservice Net Sales Growth Fiscal 2010 Fiscal 2009 vs. 2009 vs. 2008 Contributions from volume growth (a) -8 pts -6 pts Net price realization and mix -6 pts 7 pts Foreign currency exchange Flat Flat Net sales growth -14 pts 1 pt (a) Measured in tons based on the stated weight of our product shipments. For fiscal 2010, net sales for our Bakeries and Foodservice segment decreased 14 percent to $1,770 million. The decrease in fiscal 2010 was driven by 8 percentage points of volume decline, including 8 percentage points from divested product lines and a loss of 2 percentage points from an additional week in fiscal 2009. Net price realization and mix decreased 6 percentage points, primarily from prices indexed to commodity markets. For fiscal 2009, net sales for our Bakeries and Foodservice segment increased 1 percent to $2,048 million. The increase in fiscal 2009 was driven by 7 percentage points of net price realization and mix. This was offset by a 6 29 Table of Contents percentage point decrease in volume, mainly in the Foodservice Distributors and Bakeries and National Restaurant Accounts channels, including the effects of divested product lines. Net sales growth for our Bakeries and Foodservice segment by customer channel is shown in the following tables: Bakeries and Foodservice Net Sales by Customer Channel Fiscal Year 2010 2009 2008 Foodservice Distributors $ 559.8 $ 574.1 $ 565.5 Convenience Stores 213.4 206.9 191.5 Bakeries and National Restaurant Accounts 997.3 1,266.8 1,264.3 Total $ 1,770.5 $ 2,047.8 $ 2,021.3 Bakeries and Foodservice Net Sales Percentage Change by Customer Channel Fiscal 2010 Fiscal 2009 vs. 2009 vs. 2008 Foodservice Distributors (2 )% 2 % Convenience Stores 3 8 Bakeries and National Restaurant Accounts (21 ) Flat Total (14 )% 1 % We realigned our Bakeries and Foodservice customer channels in fiscal 2010 and reclassified previous years to conform to the current year presentation. In fiscal 2010, segment operating profit was $250 million, up from $171 million in fiscal 2009. The increase was due to lower input costs, plant operating performance, and increased grain merchandising earnings. Segment operating profit was $171 million in fiscal 2009, up 3 percent from $165 million in fiscal 2008. The increase was due to margin expansion and HMM efforts which offset significant volume declines and lower grain merchandising activities. UNALLOCATED CORPORATE ITEMS Unallocated corporate items include variances to planned corporate overhead expenses, variances to planned domestic employee benefits and incentives, all stock compensation costs, annual contributions to the General Mills Foundation, and other items that are not part of our measurement of segment operating performance. This includes gains and losses from mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions until passed back to our operating segments in accordance with our policy as discussed in Note 2 of the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. For fiscal 2010, unallocated corporate expense totaled $224 million compared to $361 million last year. In fiscal 2010 we recorded a $7 million net increase in expense related to mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions and grain inventories, compared to a $119 million net increase in expense last year. Also in fiscal 2010, we recorded a $13 million recovery against a corporate investment compared to $35 million of write-downs against various investments in fiscal 2009. In fiscal 2009, we recognized a $41 million gain from an insurance settlement. Unallocated corporate expense totaled $361 million in fiscal 2009 compared to $157 million in fiscal 2008. The $204 million increase in expense was driven primarily by a $176 million net increase in expense related to mark-to-market valuations of certain commodity positions and grain inventories. We also recorded write-downs of $35 million related to various corporate investments in fiscal 2009, compared to a net gain of $16 million in fiscal 2008, 30 Table of Contents and a $16 million increase in contributions to the General Mills Foundation, offset by a fiscal 2009 gain from an insurance settlement as discussed above under the heading Fiscal 2009 Consolidated Results of Operations . JOINT VENTURES In addition to our consolidated operations, we participate in two joint ventures. We have a 50 percent equity interest in CPW, which manufactures and markets ready-to-eat cereal products in more than 130 countries and republics outside the United States and Canada. CPW also markets cereal bars in several European countries and manufactures private label cereals for customers in the United Kingdom. We also have a 50 percent equity interest in HDJ, which manufactures, distributes, and markets H agen-Dazs ice cream products and frozen novelties. During fiscal 2008, the 8th Continent soy milk business was sold. Our share of after-tax joint venture earnings increased from $92 million in fiscal 2009 to $102 million in fiscal 2010. The increase is mainly due to lower fiscal 2009 earnings which were reduced by a $6 million deferred income tax valuation allowance. Our share of after-tax joint venture earnings decreased from $111 million in fiscal 2008 to $92 million in fiscal 2009. In fiscal 2009, earnings were reduced by a $6 million deferred income tax valuation allowance. In fiscal 2008, earnings included $16 million for our share of a gain on the sale of a CPW property in the United Kingdom partially offset by restructuring expenses of $8 million. Also, fiscal 2008 results included $2 million for our share of a gain on the sale of the 8th Continent soymilk business. The change in net sales for each joint venture is set forth in the following table: Joint Venture Change in Net Sales Fiscal 2010 Fiscal 2009 vs. 2009 vs. 2008 CPW 6 % 5 % HDJ (4 ) 2 Joint Ventures 4 % 3 % For fiscal 2010, CPW net sales grew by 6 percent due to 4 percentage points of growth from net price realization and mix, 1 percentage point from favorable foreign exchange and a 1 percentage point increase in volume, including growth in Russia, Southeast Asia, the Middle East and Latin America. Net sales for HDJ decreased 4 percent from fiscal 2009 due to an 11 percentage point decline in volume, partially offset by favorable foreign exchange. CPW reclassified certain expenses as a reduction to net sales. To conform to the current period presentation, CPW reduced its previously reported net sales by approximately $150 million in fiscal 2009 and $200 million in 2008. There was no effect on after-tax earnings from joint ventures in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings. For fiscal 2009, CPW net sales grew by 5 percent reflecting higher volume and net price realization, slightly offset by unfavorable foreign currency exchange. Net sales for HDJ increased 2 percent from fiscal 2008 as a result of favorable foreign exchange of 11 percentage points and positive net price realization, offset by a decrease in volume. 31 Table of Contents Selected cash flows from our joint ventures are set forth in the following table: Selected Cash Flows from Joint Ventures Fiscal Year Inflow (Outflow), in Millions 2010 2009 2008 Advances to joint ventures $ (131.0 ) $ (14.2 ) $ (20.6 ) Repayments of advances 2.9 22.4 95.8 Dividends received 88.0 68.5 108.7 IMPACT OF INFLATION We have experienced significant input cost volatility since fiscal 2006. Our gross margin performance in fiscal 2010 reflects the impact of modest input cost deflation, primarily on commodities inputs, following three consecutive years of significant input cost inflation. We expect the cost of commodities and energy to increase in fiscal 2011. We attempt to minimize the effects of inflation through planning and operating practices. Our risk management practices are discussed in Item 7A of this report. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the Act) was signed into law in March 2010. The Act codifies health care reforms with staggered effective dates from 2010 to 2018. Many provisions in the Act require the issuance of additional guidance from various government agencies. Because the Act does not take effect fully until future years, we do not expect the Act to have a material impact on our fiscal 2011 results of operations. Given the complexity of the Act, the extended time period over which the reforms will be implemented, and the unknown impact of future regulatory guidance, the full impact of the Act on future periods will not be known until those regulations are adopted. LIQUIDITY The primary source of our liquidity is cash flow from operations. Over the most recent three-year period, our operations have generated $5.7 billion in cash. A substantial portion of this operating cash flow has been returned to stockholders through share repurchases and dividends. We also use this source of liquidity to fund our capital expenditures. We typically use a combination of cash, notes payable, and long-term debt to finance acquisitions and major capital expansions.

The $353 million increase primarily reflects the $221 million increase in net earnings, including earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests. Fiscal 2009 cash flows from operations were also affected by several transactions. We 32 Table of Contents voluntarily contributed $200 million to our principal domestic pension plans. In addition, net earnings, including earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests for fiscal 2009 included an $85 million net gain on the sale of certain product lines and a $41 million gain on the insurance settlement covering the loss at our La Salte a pasta manufacturing facility in Argentina. Accounts payable generated $186 million more cash year-over-year primarily due to an increase in SG&A expense and shifts in timing. Accounts receivable was a $203 million increased use of cash primarily driven by sales timing shifts. Inventory used $11 million less cash in fiscal 2010. We strive to grow core working capital at or below our growth in net sales. For fiscal 2010, core working capital increased 3 percent, compared to net sales growth of 1 percent which included the effects of one less week in fiscal 2010. In fiscal 2009, core working capital declined 1 percent, compared to net sales growth of 8 percent, and in fiscal 2008, core working capital grew 12 percent compared to net sales growth of 10 percent. In fiscal 2009, our operations generated $1,828 million of cash compared to $1,730 million in fiscal 2008, primarily reflecting a $304 million reduction in the use of working capital in fiscal 2009, partially offset by a $200 million voluntary contribution made to our principal domestic pension plans. 33 Table of Contents Cash Flows from Investing Activities Fiscal Year In Millions 2010 2009 2008 Purchases of land, buildings, and equipment $ (649.9 ) $ (562.6 ) $ (522.0 ) Acquisitions 0.6 Investments in affiliates, net (130.7 ) 5.9 64.6 Proceeds from disposal of land, buildings, and equipment 7.4 4.1 25.9 Proceeds from divestitures of product lines 244.7 Proceeds from insurance settlement 41.3 Other, net 52.0 (22.3 ) (11.5 ) Net cash used by investing activities $ (721.2 ) $ (288.9 ) $ (442.4 ) In fiscal 2010, cash used by investing activities increased by $432 million from fiscal 2009 primarily due to $245 million of proceeds from the sale of certain product lines in fiscal 2009 and the $41 million received in fiscal 2009 related to insurance proceeds from the settlement with the insurance carrier covering the loss at our La Salte a pasta manufacturing facility in Argentina. We also invested $131 million in affiliates in fiscal 2010, mainly our CPW joint venture, to repay local borrowings. Capital expenditures in fiscal 2010 increased $87 million from fiscal 2009 as we increased manufacturing capacity for cereal, snack bars, and yogurt products. In fiscal 2009, cash used by investing activities decreased by $154 million from fiscal 2008 primarily due to proceeds of $245 million from the sale of certain product lines. We also received insurance proceeds of $41 million in fiscal 2009 from the settlement with the insurance carrier covering the loss at our La Salte a pasta manufacturing facility in Argentina. These proceeds offset the capital expenditures required to replace the manufacturing facility that was destroyed by fire in fiscal 2008. We expect capital expenditures to increase to approximately $700 million in fiscal 2011, including initiatives that will: increase manufacturing capacity for cereals and Yoplait yogurt; continue HMM initiatives throughout the supply chain; and expand International production capacity for Wanchai Ferry and H agen-Dazs products.

We repurchased $221 million of our 6.0 percent notes due 2012 and $179 million of our 5.65 percent notes due 2012. As a result of the repurchase, we recorded interest expense of $40 million which represented the premium paid in the tender offer, the write-off of the remaining discount and unamortized fees, and the settlement of related swaps. We issued commercial paper to fund the repurchase. During fiscal 2010, we repaid $88 million of long-term bank debt held by wholly owned foreign subsidiaries. In January 2009, we issued $1.2 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.65 percent notes due 2019. In August 2008, we issued $700 million aggregate principal amount of 5.25 percent notes due 2013. The proceeds of these notes were used to repay a portion of our outstanding commercial paper. Interest on these notes is payable semi-annually in arrears. These notes may be redeemed at our option at any time for a specified make-whole amount. These notes are senior unsecured, unsubordinated obligations that include a change of control repurchase provision. In June 2010, subsequent to our fiscal 2010 year-end, we issued $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.4 percent notes due 2040. The significant terms of these notes are similar to our previously issued notes. On October 15, 2007, we settled the forward contract established with Lehman Brothers in October 2004 in conjunction with the issuance by Lehman Brothers of $750 million of notes that were mandatorily exchangeable for shares of our common stock. In settlement of that forward contract, we issued 29 million shares of our common stock and received $750 million in cash from Lehman Brothers. We used the cash to reduce outstanding commercial paper balances. On August 7, 2007, we repurchased for a net amount of $843 million all of the outstanding Series B-1 Interests in GMC as part of a required remarketing of those interests. The purchase price reflected the Series B-1 Interests original capital account balance of $835 million and $8 million of capital account appreciation attributable and paid to the third-party holder of the Series B-1 Interests. The capital appreciation paid to the third-party holder of the Series B-1 Interests was recorded as a reduction to retained earnings, a component of stockholders equity, on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, and reduced net earnings available to common stockholders in our basic and diluted EPS calculations. In April 2007, we issued $1.15 billion of floating rate convertible senior notes. In April 2008, holders of $1.14 billion of those notes tendered them to us for repurchase. In April 2009, we repurchased all of the remaining outstanding notes. We issued commercial paper to fund the repurchases. We and the third-party holder of all of GMC outstanding Class A limited membership interests (Class A Interests) agreed to reset, effective on June 28, 2007, the preferred rate of return applicable to the Class A Interests to the sum of three-month LIBOR plus 65 basis points. On June 28, 2007, we sold $92 million of additional Class A Interests to the same third party. There was no gain or loss associated with these transactions. As of May 30, 2010, the carrying value of all outstanding Class A Interests on our Consolidated Balance Sheets was $245 million, and the capital account balance of the Class A Interests upon which preferred distributions are calculated was $248 million. On June 28, 2007, we repurchased for $150 million all of the outstanding Series A preferred stock of our subsidiary General Mills Capital, Inc. using proceeds from the sale of the Class A Interests and commercial paper. There was no gain or loss associated with this repurchase. During fiscal 2010, we repurchased 21 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $692 million. During fiscal 2009, we repurchased 40 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $1,296 million. During fiscal 2008, we repurchased 48 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $1,385 million. In fiscal 2007, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 150 million shares of our common stock. On June 28, 2010, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 100 million shares of our common stock. The fiscal 2011 authorization terminated and replaced the fiscal 2007 authorization. Purchases under the authorization can be made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, including the use of call options and other derivative instruments, Rule 10b5-1 trading plans, and accelerated repurchase programs. The authorization has no specified termination date. 35 Table of Contents Dividends paid in fiscal 2010 totaled $644 million, or $0.96 per share, a 12 percent per share increase from fiscal 2009. Dividends paid in fiscal 2009 totaled $580 million, or $0.86 per share, a 10 percent per share increase from fiscal 2008 dividends of $0.78 per share.

Our commercial paper borrowings are supported by $2.9 billion of fee-paid committed credit lines, consisting of a $1.8 billion facility expiring in October 2012 and a $1.1 billion facility expiring in October 2010. We also have $0.3 billion in uncommitted credit lines that support our foreign operations. As of May 30, 2010, there were no amounts outstanding on the fee-paid committed credit lines and $76 million was drawn on the uncommitted lines. The credit facilities contain several covenants, including a requirement to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 2.5. Certain of our long-term debt agreements, our credit facilities, and our noncontrolling interests contain restrictive covenants. As of May 30, 2010, we were in compliance with all of these covenants. We have $107.3 million of long-term debt maturing in the next 12 months that is classified as current. We believe that cash flows from operations, together with available short- and long-term debt financing, will be adequate to meet our liquidity and capital needs for at least the next 12 months. As of May 30, 2010, our total debt, including the impact of derivative instruments designated as hedges, was 75 percent in fixed-rate and 25 percent in floating-rate instruments, compared to 88 percent in fixed-rate and 12 percent in floating-rate instruments on May 31, 2009. The change in the fixed-rate and floating-rate percentages was driven 36 Table of Contents by the execution of fixed-to-floating rate swaps during fiscal 2010 and refinancing of fixed-rate debt with commercial paper. We have an effective shelf registration statement on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) covering the sale of debt securities. The shelf registration statement will expire in December 2011. Growth in return on average total capital is one of our key performance measures (see the Non-GAAP Measures section below for our discussion of this measure, which is not defined by GAAP). Return on average total capital increased from 12.3 percent in fiscal 2009 to 13.8 percent in fiscal 2010 primarily due to increased earnings and improvements in core working capital. We also believe that the ratio of fixed charge coverage and the ratio of operating cash flow to debt are important measures of our financial strength. Our fixed charge coverage ratio in fiscal 2010 was 6.42 compared to 5.33 in fiscal 2009. The measure increased from fiscal 2009 as earnings before income taxes and after-tax earnings from joint ventures increased by $262 million and fixed charges decreased by $40 million, driven mainly by lower interest expense. Our operating cash flow to debt ratio increased 8.1 points to 33.9 percent in fiscal 2010, driven by an increase in cash flows from operations and a decrease in our year-end debt balance. Currently, Standard and Poor (S&P) has ratings of BBB+ on our long-term debt and A-2 on our commercial paper. Moody Investors Services (Moody s) has ratings of Baa1 for our long-term debt and P-2 for our commercial paper. Fitch Ratings rates our long-term debt BBB+ and our commercial paper F-2. These ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating organization, and should be evaluated independently of any other rating. In April 2002, we contributed assets to our subsidiary GMC. In exchange for the contribution of these assets, GMC issued its managing membership interest and its limited preferred membership interests to certain of our wholly owned subsidiaries. We continue to hold the entire managing membership interest, and therefore direct the operations of GMC. The third-party holder of the Class A Interests in GMC receives quarterly preferred distributions from available net income based on the application of a floating preferred return rate, currently equal to the sum of three-month LIBOR plus 65 basis points. The preferred return rate of the Class A Interests is adjusted every five years through a negotiated agreement between the Class A Interest holder and GMC, or through a remarketing auction. The next remarketing is scheduled to occur in June 2012 and thereafter in five-year intervals. The holder of the Class A Interests may initiate a liquidation of GMC under certain circumstances, including, without limitation, the bankruptcy of GMC or its subsidiaries, GMC failure to deliver the preferred distributions on the Class A Interests, GMC failure to comply with portfolio requirements, breaches of certain covenants, lowering of our senior debt rating below either Baa3 by Moody or BBB- by S&P, and a failed attempt to remarket the Class A Interests as a result of GMC failure to assist in such remarketing. In the event of a liquidation of GMC, each member of GMC will receive the amount of its then current capital account balance. The managing member may avoid liquidation by exercising its option to purchase the Class A Interests. We may exercise our option to purchase the Class A Interests for consideration equal to the then current capital account value, plus any unpaid preferred return and the prescribed make-whole amount. If we purchase these interests, any change in the unrelated third-party investor capital account from its original value will be charged directly to retained earnings and will increase or decrease the net earnings used to calculate EPS in that period. OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS As of May 30, 2010, we have issued guarantees and comfort letters of $538 million for the debt and other obligations of consolidated subsidiaries, and guarantees and comfort letters of $302 million for the debt and other obligations of non-consolidated affiliates, mainly CPW. In addition, off-balance sheet arrangements are generally limited to the future payments under non-cancelable operating leases, which totaled $315 million as of May 30, 2010. 37 Table of Contents As of May 30, 2010, we had invested in three variable interest entities (VIEs). We have an interest in a contract manufacturer at our former facility in Geneva, Illinois. We are the primary beneficiary (PB) and have consolidated this entity. This entity had property and equipment with a carrying value of $19 million and long-term debt of $21 million as of May 30, 2010. The liabilities recognized as a result of consolidating this entity do not represent additional claims on our general assets. We also have an interest in a contract manufacturer in Greece that is a VIE. Although we are the PB, we have not consolidated this entity because it is not practical to do so and it is not material to our results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity as of and for the year ended May 30, 2010. This entity had assets of $7 million and liabilities of $1 million as of May 30, 2010. We are not the PB of the remaining VIE. Our maximum exposure to loss from the three VIEs is limited to the $21 million of long-term debt of the contract manufacturer in Geneva, Illinois and our $2 million equity investment in the VIE of which we are not the PB. We have not provided financial or other support to these VIEs during the current period nor are there arrangements related to these VIEs that could require us to provide financial support in the future. Our defined benefit plans in the United States are subject to the requirements of the Pension Protection Act (PPA). The PPA revised the basis and methodology for determining defined benefit plan minimum funding requirements as well as maximum contributions to and benefits paid from tax-qualified plans. Most of these provisions were applicable to our domestic defined benefit pension plans in fiscal 2010 on a phased-in basis. The PPA may ultimately require us to make additional contributions to our domestic plans. We did not make a contribution to our principal defined benefit pension plans in fiscal 2010. Although not required under the provisions of the PPA, we voluntarily contributed $200 million to our principal defined benefit plans in fiscal 2009. We do not expect to make any contributions to our domestic plans in fiscal 2011. Actual fiscal 2011 contributions could exceed our current projections, and may be influenced by our decision to undertake discretionary funding of our benefit trusts or by changes in regulatory requirements. Additionally, our projections concerning timing of the PPA funding requirements are subject to change and may be influenced by factors such as general market conditions affecting trust asset performance, interest rates, and our future decisions regarding certain elective provisions of the PPA. The following table summarizes our future estimated cash payments under existing contractual obligations, including payments due by period: Payments Due by Fiscal Year 2016 and In Millions Total 2011 2012 - 13 2014 - 15 Thereafter Long-term debt (a) $ 5,371.0 $ 105.9 $ 1,662.6 $ 1,452.3 $ 2,150.2 Accrued interest 136.5 136.5 Operating leases (b) 315.3 87.4 110.7 53.9 63.3 Capital leases 4.6 1.7 2.4 0.5 Purchase obligations (c) 2,358.5 2,019.2 177.5 67.8 94.0 Total contractual obligations 8,185.9 2,350.7 1,953.2 1,574.5 2,307.5 Other long-term obligations (d) 2,466.1 Total long-term obligations $ 10,652.0 $ 2,350.7 $ 1,953.2 $ 1,574.5 $ 2,307.5 (a) Amounts represent the expected cash payments of our long-term debt and do not include $4 million for capital leases or $1 million for net unamortized bond premiums and discounts and fair value adjustments. (b) Operating leases represents the minimum rental commitments under non-cancelable operating leases. (c) The majority of the purchase obligations represent commitments for raw material and packaging to be utilized in the normal course of business and for consumer marketing spending commitments that support our brands. For purposes of this table, arrangements are considered purchase obligations if a contract specifies all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, a pricing structure, and approximate timing of the transaction. Most arrangements are cancelable without a significant penalty and with short notice (usually 30 days). Any amounts reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as accounts payable and accrued liabilities are excluded from the table above. (d) The fair value of our interest rate and equity swaps with a payable position to the counterparty was $180 million as of May 30, 2010, based on fair market values as of that date. Future changes in market values will impact the amount of cash ultimately paid or received to settle those instruments in the future. Other long-term obligations mainly consist of liabilities for uncertain income tax positions, accrued compensation and benefits, including the 38 Table of Contents underfunded status of certain of our defined benefit pension, other postretirement, and postemployment plans, and miscellaneous liabilities. We expect to pay $18 million of benefits from our unfunded postemployment benefit plans and $13 million of deferred compensation in fiscal 2011. We are unable to reliably estimate the amount of these payments beyond fiscal 2011. As of May 30, 2010, our total liability for uncertain tax positions and the associated accrued interest and penalties was $728 million. We expect to pay approximately $425 million of tax liabilities related to uncertain tax positions and accrued interest in the next 12 months, including a portion of our potential liability for the matter resolved by the U.S. Court of Appeals discussed within this MD&A. While fiscal years 2007 and 2008 are currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows beyond 12 months due to uncertainties in the timing of this and other tax audit outcomes. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES For a complete description of our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. Our significant accounting estimates are those that have a meaningful impact on the reporting of our financial condition and results of operations. These estimates include our accounting for promotional expenditures, valuation of long-lived assets, intangible assets, stock-based compensation, income taxes, and defined benefit pension, other postretirement and postemployment benefits. Promotional Expenditures Our promotional activities are conducted through our customers and directly or indirectly with end consumers. These activities include: payments to customers to perform merchandising activities on our behalf, such as advertising or in-store displays; discounts to our list prices to lower retail shelf prices; payments to gain distribution of new products; coupons, contests, and other incentives; and media and advertising expenditures. The media and advertising expenditures are recognized as expense when the advertisement airs. The cost of payments to customers and other consumer activities are recognized as the related revenue is recorded, which generally precedes the actual cash expenditure. The recognition of these costs requires estimation of customer participation and performance levels. These estimates are made based on the forecasted customer sales, the timing and forecasted costs of promotional activities, and other factors. Differences between estimated expenses and actual costs are normally insignificant and are recognized as a change in management estimate in a subsequent period. Our accrued trade, coupon, and consumer marketing liabilities were $555 million as of May 30, 2010, and $474 million as of May 31, 2009. Because our total promotional expenditures (including amounts classified as a reduction of revenues) are significant, if our estimates are inaccurate we would have to make adjustments in subsequent periods that could have a material effect on our results of operations. Valuation of Long-Lived Assets Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (or asset group) may not be recoverable. An impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the operation and disposition of the asset group are less than the carrying amount of the asset group. Asset groups have identifiable cash flows independent of other asset groups. Measurement of an impairment loss would be based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset group over its fair value. Fair value is measured using discounted cash flows or independent appraisals, as appropriate. Intangible Assets Goodwill is not subject to amortization and is tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. Impairment testing is performed for each of our reporting units. We compare the carrying value of a reporting unit, including goodwill, to the fair value of the unit. Carrying value is based on the assets and liabilities associated with the operations of that reporting unit, which often requires allocation of shared or corporate items among reporting units. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we revalue all assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, excluding goodwill, to determine if the fair value of the net assets is greater than the net assets including goodwill. If the fair value of the net assets is less than the net assets including goodwill, impairment has occurred. Our estimates of fair value are determined based on a discounted cash flow model. Growth rates for sales and profits are determined using inputs from our annual long-range planning process. We also make estimates of discount rates, perpetuity growth assumptions, market comparables, and other factors. 39 Table of Contents We evaluate the useful lives of our other intangible assets, mainly brands, to determine if they are finite or indefinite-lived. Reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, other economic factors (such as the stability of the industry, known technological advances, legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment, and expected changes in distribution channels), the level of required maintenance expenditures, and the expected lives of other related groups of assets. Our indefinite-lived intangible assets, mainly intangible assets primarily associated with the Pillsbury , Totino , Progresso , Green Giant , Old El Paso , and H agen-Dazs brands, are also tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. We performed our fiscal 2010 assessment of our brand intangibles as of December 1, 2009. Our estimate of the fair value of the brands was based on a discounted cash flow model using inputs which included: projected revenues from our annual long-range plan; assumed royalty rates that could be payable if we did not own the brands; and a discount rate. As of our assessment date, there was no impairment of any of our intangibles as their related fair values were substantially in excess of the carrying values. As of May 30, 2010, we had $10.3 billion of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. While we currently believe that the fair value of each intangible exceeds its carrying value and that those intangibles so classified will contribute indefinitely to our cash flows, materially different assumptions regarding future performance of our businesses or a different weighted-average cost of capital could result in significant impairment losses and amortization expense. Stock-based Compensation The valuation of stock options is a significant accounting estimate which requires us to use judgments and assumptions that are likely to have a material impact on our financial statements. Annually, we make predictive assumptions regarding future stock price volatility, employee exercise behavior, dividend yield, and the forfeiture rate. We estimate our future stock price volatility using the historical volatility over the expected term of the option, excluding time periods of volatility we believe a marketplace participant would exclude in estimating our stock price volatility. For the fiscal 2010 grants, we have excluded historical volatility for fiscal 2002 and prior, primarily because volatility driven by our acquisition of The Pillsbury Company (Pillsbury) in fiscal 2002 does not reflect what we believe to be expected future volatility. We also have considered, but did not use, implied volatility in our estimate, because trading activity in options on our stock, especially those with tenors of greater than 6 months, is insufficient to provide a reliable measure of expected volatility. If all other assumptions are held constant, a one percentage point increase in our fiscal 2010 volatility assumption would increase the grant-date fair value of our fiscal 2010 option awards by 7 percent. Our expected term represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding based on historical data to estimate option exercise and employee termination within the valuation model. Separate groups of employees have similar historical exercise behavior and therefore were aggregated into a single pool for valuation purposes. The weighted-average expected term for all employee groups is presented in the table below. An increase in the expected term by 1 year, leaving all other assumptions constant, would change the grant date fair value by less than 1 percent. The risk-free interest rate for periods during the expected term of the options is based on the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon yield curve in effect at the time of grant. 40 Table of Contents The estimated fair values of stock options granted and the assumptions used for the Black-Scholes option-pricing model were as follows: Fiscal Year 2010 2009 2008 Estimated fair values of stock options granted $ 3.20 $ 4.70 $ 5.28 Assumptions: Risk-free interest rate 3.7 % 4.4 % 5.1 % Expected term 8.5 years 8.5 years 8.5 years Expected volatility 18.9 % 16.1 % 15.6 % Dividend yield 3.4 % 2.7 % 2.7 % To the extent that actual outcomes differ from our assumptions, we are not required to true up grant-date fair value-based expense to final intrinsic values. However, these differences can impact the classification of cash tax benefits realized upon exercise of stock options, as explained in the following two paragraphs. Furthermore, historical data has a significant bearing on our forward-looking assumptions. Significant variances between actual and predicted experience could lead to prospective revisions in our assumptions, which could then significantly impact the year-over-year comparability of stock-based compensation expense. Any corporate income tax benefit realized upon exercise or vesting of an award in excess of that previously recognized in earnings (referred to as a windfall tax benefit) is presented in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as a financing cash flow. The actual impact on future years financing cash flow will depend, in part, on the volume of employee stock option exercises during a particular year and the relationship between the exercise-date market value of the underlying stock and the original grant-date fair value previously determined for financial reporting purposes. Realized windfall tax benefits are credited to additional paid-in capital within the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Realized shortfall tax benefits (amounts which are less than that previously recognized in earnings) are first offset against the cumulative balance of windfall tax benefits, if any, and then charged directly to income tax expense, potentially resulting in volatility in our consolidated effective income tax rate. We calculated a cumulative amount of windfall tax benefits from post-1995 fiscal years for the purpose of accounting for future shortfall tax benefits and currently have sufficient cumulative windfall tax benefits to absorb projected arising shortfalls, such that we do not currently expect future earnings to be affected by this provision. However, as employee stock option exercise behavior is not within our control, it is possible that materially different reported results could occur if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail. Income Taxes We apply a more-likely-than-not threshold to the recognition and derecognition of uncertain tax positions. Accordingly we recognize the amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being ultimately realized upon settlement. Future changes in judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions will affect earnings in the quarter of such change. Annually we file more than 350 income tax returns in approximately 100 global taxing jurisdictions. A number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position is audited and finally resolved. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax position, we believe that our liabilities for income taxes reflect the most likely outcome. We adjust these liabilities, as well as the related interest, in light of changing facts and circumstances. Settlement of any particular position would usually require the use of cash. The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. Our major taxing jurisdictions include the United States (federal and state) and Canada. We are no longer subject to United States federal examinations by the IRS for fiscal years before 2002. 41 Table of Contents The IRS has concluded its field examination of our 2006 and prior federal tax years, which resulted in payments of $18 million in fiscal 2009 and $56 million in fiscal 2008 to cover the additional U.S. income tax liability plus interest related to adjustments during these audit cycles. The IRS also proposed additional adjustments for the fiscal 2002 to 2006 audit cycles related to the amount of capital loss and depreciation and amortization we reported as a result of our sale of noncontrolling interests in our GMC subsidiary. The IRS has proposed adjustments that effectively eliminate most of the tax benefits associated with this transaction. We believe our positions are supported by substantial technical authority and are vigorously defending our positions. We are currently in negotiations with the IRS Appeals Division for fiscal 2002 to 2006. Our potential liability for this matter is significant. We have determined that a portion of this matter should be included as a tax liability and have accordingly included it in our total liabilities for uncertain tax positions as disclosed in Note 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report. The IRS initiated its audit of our fiscal 2007 and 2008 tax years during fiscal 2009. In the third quarter of fiscal 2008, we recorded an income tax benefit of $31 million as a result of a favorable U.S. district court decision on an uncertain tax matter. In the third quarter of fiscal 2009, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit issued an opinion reversing the district court decision. As a result, we recorded $53 million (including interest) of income tax expense related to the reversal of cumulative income tax benefits from this uncertain tax matter recognized in fiscal years 1992 through 2008. We expect to make cash tax and interest payments of approximately $32 million in connection with this matter. As of May 30, 2010, our total liability for uncertain tax positions and the associated accrued interest and penalties was $728 million. We expect to pay approximately $425 million of tax liabilities related to uncertain tax positions and accrued interest in the next 12 months, including a portion of our potential liability for the matter resolved by the IRS Appeals Division and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit as discussed in the preceding paragraphs. While fiscal years 2007 and 2008 are currently under examination by the IRS, we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows beyond 12 months due to uncertainties in the timing of this and other tax audit outcomes. Various tax examinations by United States state taxing authorities could be conducted for any open tax year, which vary by jurisdiction, but are generally from 3 to 5 years. Currently, several state examinations are in progress. The Canada Revenue Agency is conducting an audit of our income tax returns in Canada for fiscal years 2003 (which is our earliest tax year still open for examination) through 2005. We do not anticipate that any United States state tax or Canadian tax adjustments will have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations. Defined Benefit Plans Defined Benefit Pension Plans We have defined benefit pension plans covering most domestic, Canadian, and United Kingdom employees. Benefits for salaried employees are based on length of service and final average compensation. Benefits for hourly employees include various monthly amounts for each year of credited service. Our funding policy is consistent with the requirements of applicable laws. We made $200 million of voluntary contributions to our principal domestic plans in fiscal 2009. We did not make any contributions in fiscal 2010, and we do not expect to be required to make any contributions in fiscal 2011. Our principal domestic retirement plan covering salaried employees has a provision that any excess pension assets would be allocated to active participants if the plan is terminated within five years of a change in control. Other Postretirement Benefit Plans We also sponsor plans that provide health care benefits to the majority of our domestic and Canadian retirees. The salaried health care benefit plan is contributory, with retiree contributions based on years of service. We make decisions to fund related trusts for certain employees and retirees on an annual basis. We did not make voluntary contributions to these plans in fiscal 2010. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as modified by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, was enacted in March 2010. The effect of the Act, including possible modifications to provider plans, has not yet been fully evaluated, but could affect the future cost of our benefit plans. 42 Table of Contents Postemployment Benefit Plans Under certain circumstances, we also provide accruable benefits to former or inactive employees in the United States, Canada, and Mexico, and members of our Board of Directors, including severance and certain other benefits payable upon death. We recognize an obligation for any of these benefits that vest or accumulate with service. Postemployment benefits that do not vest or accumulate with service (such as severance based solely on annual pay rather than years of service) are charged to expense when incurred. Our postemployment benefit plans are unfunded. We recognize benefits provided during retirement or following employment over the plan participants active working life. Accordingly, we make various assumptions to predict and measure costs and obligations many years prior to the settlement of our obligations. Assumptions that require significant management judgment and have a material impact on the measurement of our net periodic benefit expense or income and accumulated benefit obligations include the long-term rates of return on plan assets, the interest rates used to discount the obligations for our benefit plans, and the health care cost trend rates. Expected Rate of Return on Plan Assets Our expected rate of return on plan assets is determined by our asset allocation, our historical long-term investment performance, our estimate of future long-term returns by asset class (using input from our actuaries, investment services, and investment managers), and long-term inflation assumptions. We review this assumption annually for each plan, however, our annual investment performance for one particular year does not, by itself, significantly influence our evaluation. The investment objective for our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans is to secure the benefit obligations to participants at a reasonable cost to us. Our goal is to optimize the long-term return on plan assets at a moderate level of risk. The defined benefit pension and other postretirement portfolios are broadly diversified across asset classes. Within asset classes, the portfolios are further diversified across investment styles and investment organizations. For the defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans, the long-term investment policy allocations are: 30 percent to equities in the United States; 20 percent to international equities; 10 percent to private equities; 30 percent to fixed income; and 10 percent to real assets (real estate, energy, and timber). The actual allocations to these asset classes may vary tactically around the long-term policy allocations based on relative market valuations. Our historical investment returns (compound annual growth rates) for our United States defined benefit pension and other postretirement plan assets were a 17 percent gain in the 1 year period ended May 30, 2010, and returns of 5 percent, 6 percent, 9 percent, and 10 percent for the 5, 10, 15, and 20 year periods ended May 30, 2010. Our principal defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans in the United States have an expected return on plan assets of 9.6 percent. On a weighted-average basis, the expected rate of return for all defined benefit plans was 9.55 percent for fiscal 2010, 9.55 percent for fiscal 2009, and 9.56 percent for fiscal 2008. Lowering the expected long-term rate of return on assets by 50 basis points would increase our net pension and postretirement expense by $23 million for fiscal 2011. A market-related valuation basis is used to reduce year-to-year expense volatility. The market-related valuation recognizes certain investment gains or losses over a five-year period from the year in which they occur. Investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the market-related value of assets and the actual return based on the market-related value of assets. Our outside actuaries perform these calculations as part of our determination of annual expense or income. Discount Rates Our discount rate assumptions are determined annually as of the last day of our fiscal year for all of our defined benefit pension, other postretirement, and postemployment benefit plan obligations. We also use the same discount rates to determine defined benefit pension, other postretirement, and postemployment benefit plan income and expense for the following fiscal year. We work with our actuaries to determine the timing and amount of expected future cash outflows to plan participants and, using the top quartile of AA-rated corporate bond yields, to develop a forward interest rate curve, including a margin to that index based on our credit risk. This forward interest rate curve is applied to our expected future cash outflows to determine our discount rate assumptions. 43 Table of Contents Our weighted-average discount rates were as follows: Weighted-Average Discount Rates Defined Other Benefit Postretirement Postemployment Pension Benefit Benefit Plans Plans Plans Obligations as of May 30, 2010, and fiscal 2011 expense 5.85 % 5.80 % 5.12 % Obligations as of May 31, 2009, and fiscal 2010 expense 7.49 % 7.45 % 7.06 % Fiscal 2009 expense 6.88 % 6.90 % 6.64 % Lowering the discount rates by 50 basis points would increase our net defined benefit pension, other postretirement, and postemployment benefit plan expense for fiscal 2011 by approximately $31 million. All obligation-related experience gains and losses are amortized using a straight-line method over the average remaining service period of active plan participants. Health Care Cost Trend Rates We review our health care cost trend rates annually. Our review is based on data we collect about our health care claims experience and information provided by our actuaries. This information includes recent plan experience, plan design, overall industry experience and projections, and assumptions used by other similar organizations. Our initial health care cost trend rate is adjusted as necessary to remain consistent with this review, recent experiences, and short-term expectations. Our initial health care cost trend rate assumption is 9.0 percent for all retirees. Rates are graded down annually until the ultimate trend rate of 5.2 percent is reached in 2019 for all retirees. The trend rates are applicable for calculations only if the retirees benefits increase as a result of health care inflation. The ultimate trend rate is adjusted annually, as necessary, to approximate the current economic view on the rate of long-term inflation plus an appropriate health care cost premium. Assumed trend rates for health care costs have an important effect on the amounts reported for the other postretirement benefit plans. A one percentage point change in the health care cost trend rate would have the following effects: One One Percentage Percentage Point Point In Millions Increase Decrease Effect on the aggregate of the service and interest cost components in fiscal 2011 $ 7.9 $ (6.8 ) Effect on the other postretirement accumulated benefit obligation as of May 30, 2010 96.7 (85.0 ) Any arising health care claims cost-related experience gain or loss is recognized in the calculation of expected future claims. Once recognized, experience gains and losses are amortized using a straight-line method over 15 years, resulting in at least the minimum amortization required being recorded. Financial Statement Impact In fiscal 2010, we recorded net defined benefit pension, other postretirement, and postemployment benefit plan income of $11 million compared to $4 million of income in fiscal 2009 and $19 million of expense in fiscal 2008. As of May 30, 2010, we had cumulative unrecognized actuarial net losses of $1.4 billion on our defined benefit pension plans and $225 million on our postretirement benefit plans, mainly as the result of declines in the values of plan assets. These unrecognized actuarial net losses will result in decreases in our future pension income and increases in postretirement expense since they currently exceed the corridors defined by GAAP. 44 Table of Contents We use the Retirement Plans (RP) 2000 Mortality Table projected forward to our plans measurement dates to calculate the year-end defined benefit pension, other postretirement, and postemployment benefit obligations and annual expense. Actual future net defined benefit pension, other postretirement, and postemployment benefit plan income or expense will depend on investment performance, changes in future discount rates, changes in health care cost trend rates, and other factors related to the populations participating in these plans. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 was signed into law in March 2010. The Act codifies health care reforms with staggered effective dates from 2010 to 2018 with many provisions in the Act requiring the issuance of additional guidance from various government agencies. Estimates of the future impacts of several of the Act provisions are incorporated into our postretirement benefit liability including the elimination of lifetime maximums and the imposition of an excise tax on high cost health plans. These changes resulted in a $24 million increase in our postretirement benefit liability as of May 30, 2010. Given the complexity of the Act, the extended time period over which the reforms will be implemented, and the unknown impact of future regulatory guidance, further financial impacts to our postretirement benefit liability and related future expense may occur. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In June 2009, the FASB issued new accounting guidance that changes the consolidation model for variable interest entities (VIEs). The guidance requires companies to qualitatively assess the determination of the primary beneficiary of a VIE based on whether the company (1) has the power to direct matters that most significantly impact the VIE economic performance, and (2) has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2009, which for us is fiscal 2011. We are currently evaluating the impact of the guidance on our results of operations and financial position. NON-GAAP MEASURES We have included in this report measures of financial performance that are not defined by GAAP. Each of the measures is used in reporting to our executive management and as a component of the Board of Director measurement of our performance for incentive compensation purposes. Management and the Board of Directors believe that these measures provide useful information to investors, and include these measures in other communications to investors. For each of these non-GAAP financial measures, we are providing below a reconciliation of the differences between the non-GAAP measure and the most directly comparable GAAP measure, an explanation of why our management or the Board of Directors believes the non-GAAP measure provides useful information to investors, and any additional purposes for which our management or Board of Directors uses the non-GAAP measure. These non-GAAP measures should be viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of, the comparable GAAP measure. Total Segment Operating Profit Management and the Board of Directors believe that this measure provides useful information to investors because it is the profitability measure we use to evaluate segment performance. A reconciliation of this measure to operating profit, the relevant GAAP measure, is included in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. Diluted EPS Excluding Certain Items Affecting Comparability Management and the Board of Directors believe that this measure provides useful information to investors because it is the profitability measure we use to evaluate earnings performance on a comparable year-over-year basis. The adjustments are either items resulting from infrequently occurring events or items that, in management judgment, significantly affect the year-over-year assessment of operating results. 45 Table of Contents The reconciliation of diluted EPS excluding certain items affecting comparability to diluted EPS, the relevant GAAP measure, follows: Fiscal Year EPS Growth Per Share Data 2010 2009 2008 2010 2009 Diluted earnings per share, as reported $ 2.24 $ 1.90 $ 1.85 $ 0.34 $ 0.05 Mark-to-market effects (a) 0.01 0.11 (0.05 ) (0.10 ) 0.16 Divestitures gain, net (b) (0.06 ) 0.06 (0.06 ) Gain from insurance settlement (c) (0.04 ) 0.04 (0.04 ) Uncertain tax item (d) 0.08 (0.04 ) (0.08 ) 0.12 Tax charge - health care reform (e) 0.05 0.05 Diluted earnings per share, excluding certain items affecting comparability $ 2.30 $ 1.99 $ 1.76 $ 0.31 $ 0.23 (a) Net (gain) loss from mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions and grain inventories.
