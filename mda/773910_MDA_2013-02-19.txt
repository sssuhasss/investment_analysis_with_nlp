Also, the Company had higher sales volumes in the Rockies of 52 MMcf/d associated with drilling in the Greater Natural Buttes area and the Wattenberg field. These increases were partially offset by reduced sales volumes in the Gulf of Mexico of 111 MMcf/d primarily due to natural production declines. The Company natural-gas sales volumes increased 62 MMcf/d for the year ended December 31, 2011, primarily due to higher sales volumes in the Rockies of 84 MMcf/d, resulting from increased drilling in the Greater Natural Buttes area and the Wattenberg field, as well as higher sales volumes in the Southern and Appalachia Region of 66 MMcf/d, primarily related to increased drilling in the Marcellus shale. These increases were partially offset by lower sales volumes in the Gulf of Mexico of 86 MMcf/d, primarily due to 2010 price-related royalty relief that did not apply in 2011 and natural production declines. 58 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The average natural-gas price Anadarko received decreased for the year ended December 31, 2012, due to continued growth in U.S. natural-gas production, reduced U.S. natural-gas demand as a result of mild winter temperatures, and above-average U.S. natural-gas storage levels in 2012. Anadarko average natural-gas price received decreased for the year ended December 31, 2011, primarily due to the industry supply growing at a faster pace than demand in 2011. Crude-Oil and Condensate Sales Volumes, Average Prices, and Revenues 2012 Inc/(Dec) vs. 2011 2011 Inc/(Dec) vs. 2010 2010 United States Sales volumes MMBbls 55 14 % 48 1 % 48 MBbls/d 149 14 132 1 130 Price per barrel $ 97.46 $ 97.70 30 $ 74.96 International Sales volumes MMBbls 31 (2 )% 31 20 % 26 MBbls/d 84 (2 ) 85 20 71 Price per barrel $ 111.11 2 $ 109.20 39 $ 78.52 Total Sales volumes MMBbls 86 8 % 79 8 % 74 MBbls/d 233 8 217 8 201 Price per barrel $ 102.35 $ 102.24 34 $ 76.22 Oil and condensate sales revenues (millions) $ 8,728 8 $ 8,072 44 $ 5,592 MMBbls million barrels MBbls/d thousand barrels per day Anadarko crude-oil and condensate sales volumes increased 16 MBbls/d for the year ended December 31, 2012. Increased horizontal drilling in the Wattenberg field led to a 9 MBbls/d sales-volume improvement in the Rockies. Horizontal drilling in the Eagleford shale and Bone Spring/Avalon formations also contributed to increased sales volumes in the Southern and Appalachia Region of 8 MBbls/d. Anadarko crude-oil and condensate sales volumes increased 16 MBbls/d for the year ended December 31, 2011. This increase primarily resulted from an additional 15 MBbls/d in Ghana, where the Company first lifting occurred in the first quarter of 2011. Increased drilling in the Wattenberg field led to a 5 MBbls/d sales-volume improvement in the Rockies. Additionally, increased activity in the Eagleford shale and Bone Spring/Avalon formations increased sales volumes from those areas by approximately 170%, contributing to an 8 MBbls/d sales-volume increase in the Southern and Appalachian Region. Partially offsetting these increases was a 9 MBbls/d sales-volume decline in the Gulf of Mexico principally caused by downtime for repairs at the Company Constitution spar and a third-party oil pipeline in 2011, and natural production declines. Anadarko average crude-oil price received increased for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, primarily due to supply disruption concerns associated with political and civil unrest in the Middle East and North Africa, and steady global demand growth. Additionally, average realized crude-oil prices for 2012 and 2011 were enhanced by the wide differential between West Texas Intermediate and Brent crude, as approximately 70% of Anadarko crude-oil sales volumes were based on prices that were either directly indexed to, or highly correlated to, Brent crude. The price increase for the year ended December 31, 2012, was offset by downward price pressure caused by macroeconomic concerns in Europe and China. 59 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Natural-Gas Liquids Sales Volumes, Average Prices, and Revenues 2012 Inc/(Dec) vs. 2011 2011 Inc/(Dec) vs. 2010 2010 United States Sales volumes MMBbls 30 12 % 27 17 % 23 MBbls/d 83 12 74 17 63 Price per barrel $ 40.44 (25 ) $ 53.95 25 $ 43.07 Natural-gas liquids sales revenues (millions) $ 1,224 (16 ) $ 1,462 47 $ 997 NGLs sales represent revenues from the sale of products derived from the processing of Anadarko natural-gas production. The Company NGLs sales volumes increased by 9 MBbls/d for the year ended December 31, 2012, as a result of drilling in liquids-rich areas, primarily in the Eagleford and Haynesville shales in the Southern and Appalachia Region. Anadarko NGLs sales volumes increased by 11 MBbls/d for the year ended December 31, 2011, as a result of the Company increased focus on liquids-rich areas, expanded horizontal drilling programs in the Wattenberg field, and increases related to the acquisition of an additional 93% interest in a natural-gas processing plant (Wattenberg Plant). Anadarko average NGLs price decreased for the year ended December 31, 2012, primarily due to lower market prices for ethane and propane. Ethane demand was reduced by down-time for maintenance and conversion upgrades at petrochemical facilities. Mild winter temperatures across much of the United States in 2011 reduced demand for propane and contributed to above-average levels of propane stockpiles. Also, increased production from continued liquids-rich development has created further downward pricing pressures for NGLs. The average NGLs price increased for the year ended 2011, primarily due to higher crude-oil prices and sustained global petrochemical demand. Gathering, Processing, and Marketing Margin millions except percentages 2012 Inc/(Dec) vs. 2011 2011 Inc/(Dec) vs. 2010 2010 Gathering, processing, and marketing sales $ 911 (13) % $ 1,048 26 % $ 833 Gathering, processing, and marketing expenses 763 (4) 791 29 615 Margin $ 148 (42) $ 257 18 $ 218 For the year ended December 31, 2012, the gathering, processing, and marketing margin decreased $109 million. This decrease was due primarily to lower commodity prices, which led to reduced natural-gas processing margins and decreased marketing margins on sales from inventory. Also, for the year ended December 31, 2012, transportation expenses increased primarily due to higher unutilized demand fees. These decreases for the year ended December 31, 2012, were partially offset by additional margin provided by midstream assets acquired in February 2011 and May 2011, and an increase in gathering and processing revenues associated with increased throughput volumes across several of Anadarko fee-based systems. For the year ended December 31, 2011, the gathering, processing, and marketing margin increased $39 million. This increase was primarily due to increased natural-gas processing margins from higher NGLs prices and volumes, lower prices for natural-gas purchases, and favorable impacts attributable to 2011 asset acquisitions discussed above. These increases were partially offset by lower margins associated with natural-gas sales from inventory. 60 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Gains (Losses) on Divestitures and Other, net For the year ended December 31, 2012, gains (losses) on divestitures and other, net increased $19 million primarily due to increased mineral revenue of $36 million related to increased mining of soda ash on Anadarko Land Grant and higher per-ton average sales prices. Increased mineral revenue was partially offset by an increase in net losses on divestitures of $17 million. In January 2013, the Company divested its equity interest in the OCI soda ash business for $310 million and additional potential consideration while retaining its royalty interest in minerals mined from the Company Land Grant. Gains (losses) on divestitures for 2012 included net losses of $71 million, primarily related to the sale of oil and gas exploration and production reporting segment properties in Indonesia. Gains (losses) on divestitures for 2011 included net losses of $54 million, primarily related to write-downs of $422 million of assets held for sale. In 2011, the Company began marketing certain domestic properties from the oil and gas exploration and production reporting segment and the midstream reporting segment in order to redirect its operating activities and capital investment to other areas. Also included in 2011 was a $76 million loss, which occurred in connection with the Company purchase of the Wattenberg Plant. This loss was associated with the effective elimination, for purposes of consolidated financial reporting, of a pre-existing third-party relationship between the Company and the previous owner of the plant related to natural-gas processing contracts. The loss represents the aggregate amount by which the Company contracts with the previous owner of the Wattenberg Plant were unfavorable as compared to market transactions for the same or similar services at the date of the Company acquisition of the plant. These losses were partially offset by 2011 gains of $419 million for receipt and final settlement of contingent consideration related to the 2008 divestiture of its interest in the Peregrino field offshore Brazil and $21 million from the acquisition-date fair-value remeasurement of the Company pre-acquisition 7% equity interest in the Wattenberg Plant. For the year ended December 31, 2011, gains (losses) on divestitures and other, net decreased $57 million primarily due to 2011 net losses on divestitures discussed above. Costs and Expenses 2012 Inc/(Dec) vs. 2011 2011 Inc/(Dec) vs. 2010 2010 Oil and gas operating (millions) $ 976 (2) % $ 993 20 % $ 830 Oil and gas operating per BOE 3.65 (9) 4.00 13 3.54 Oil and gas transportation and other (millions) 955 7 891 9 816 Oil and gas transportation and other per BOE 3.57 (1) 3.59 3 3.48 For the year ended December 31, 2012, oil and gas operating expenses decreased by $17 million primarily due to lower workover expenses of $67 million associated with fewer workovers, primarily in the Gulf of Mexico and the Rockies, partially offset by $52 million of higher operating expenses from increased activity in Ghana. Per-BOE oil and gas operating expenses decreased by $0.35 for the year ended December 31, 2012, primarily as a result of increased sales volumes, while efficiently maintaining production costs, and lower workover expenses discussed above. For the year ended December 31, 2011, oil and gas operating expenses increased by $163 million primarily due to (i) $47 million from increased workovers and related freight costs, primarily in the Gulf of Mexico and the Rockies, (ii) $36 million related to increased joint-venture activity primarily in the Rockies, Bone Spring and Marcellus shale in the Southern and Appalachia Region, and in Alaska, (iii) $34 million in operating costs resulting from the start of production in Ghana, and (iv) $10 million in higher surface maintenance costs primarily in the Rockies. Oil and gas operating expenses per BOE increased by $0.46 for the year ended December 31, 2011, primarily due to the higher costs discussed above, partially offset by increased sales volumes. 61 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements For the year ended December 31, 2012, oil and gas transportation and other expenses increased $64 million primarily due to higher gas-gathering and transportation costs attributable to higher volumes and increased costs attributable to growth in the Company U.S. onshore asset base. For the year ended December 31, 2011, oil and gas transportation and other expenses increased $75 million due to higher volumes, higher natural-gas processing fees that rise with increases in NGLs prices, and increased costs attributable to growth in U.S. onshore plays. These increases were partially offset by the 2010 expensing of amounts attributable to drilling rig lease payments for rigs that sat idle during the moratorium, as well as rig termination fees incurred in 2010 related to deepwater drilling rigs in the Gulf of Mexico. Oil and gas transportation and other expenses per BOE decreased by $0.02 for the year ended December 31, 2012, primarily due to increased sales volumes, partially offset by the higher costs discussed above. For the year ended December 31, 2011, oil and gas transportation and other expenses per BOE increased by $0.11, primarily due to the higher costs discussed above, partially offset by increased sales volumes. millions 2012 2011 2010 Exploration Expense Dry hole expense $ 440 $ 154 $ 202 Impairments of unproved properties 1,104 471 480 Geological and geophysical expenses 151 246 103 Exploration overhead and other 251 205 189 Total exploration expense $ 1,946 $ 1,076 $ 974 Exploration expense increased $870 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, primarily due to increases of $633 million in impairments of unproved properties and $286 million in dry hole expense, partially offset by a $95 million decrease in geological and geophysical expenses. The increase in 2012 impairments of unproved properties was primarily due to $845 million of impairments for certain unproved properties in the Rockies and the Gulf of Mexico. Approximately $721 million of the impairments were due to lower natural-gas prices associated with Powder River coalbed methane properties in the Rockies and $124 million related to a Gulf of Mexico natural-gas property that the Company does not plan to pursue under the forecasted natural-gas price environment. These increases were partially offset by 2011 impairments of certain unproved properties in the Gulf of Mexico of $124 million and Indonesia of $63 million due to decreases in the estimated recoverable cash flows. The $286 million increase in dry hole expense for the year ended December 31, 2012, was primarily due to wells in Brazil, Sierra Leone, C te d Ivoire, Mozambique, and the Gulf of Mexico. The $95 million decrease in geological and geophysical expense was primarily due to fewer seismic purchases in Kenya, Liberia, New Zealand, and Mozambique. For the year ended December 31, 2012, exploration overhead and other increased $46 million primarily due to increased exploration activity onshore United States and in Mozambique. Exploration expense increased $102 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, due to $143 million of higher geological and geophysical expense, primarily associated with increased seismic purchases in the Rockies, Gulf of Mexico, the Marcellus shale, Indonesia, Liberia, and East Africa. These additional expenses were partially offset by $48 million of lower dry hole expense, primarily in the Gulf of Mexico. 62 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements millions except percentages 2012 Inc/(Dec) vs. 2011 2011 Inc/(Dec) vs. 2010 2010 General and administrative $ 1,246 18 % $ 1,060 10 % $ 967 Depreciation, depletion, and amortization 3,964 3 3,830 3 3,714 Other taxes 1,224 (18 ) 1,492 40 1,068 Impairments 389 (78 ) 1,774 NM 216 NM not meaningful For the year ended December 31, 2012, general and administrative (G&A) expense increased by $186 million due to higher employee-related expenses of $150 million primarily related to expense associated with general partner Unit Appreciation Rights (UARs) awarded in prior years to certain officers of the general partner of WES, pursuant to the WGH Equity Incentive Plan. This increase was related to the change in fair value of the UARs upon the WGP IPO. In addition, G&A expense increased by $41 million due to higher legal-related and consulting expenses primarily related to the Tronox litigation. For the year ended December 31, 2011, G&A expense increased by $93 million primarily due to higher employee-related costs of $67 million primarily from operational expansions and changes in pension discount rates, and increased insurance costs of $9 million related to higher industry-specific rates as a result of the Deepwater Horizon events. For the year ended December 31, 2012, depreciation, depletion, and amortization (DD&A) expense increased by $134 million primarily due to higher sales volumes, accelerated expense in 2012 associated with the depletion of fields in the Gulf of Mexico, and the start of production at Caesar/Tonga in March 2012. These increases were partially offset by lower per-barrel DD&A rates resulting from asset impairments recorded in the fourth quarter of 2011 and reserves additions in 2012 related to the Southern and Appalachia Region. For the year ended December 31, 2011, DD&A expense increased by $116 million primarily attributable to higher sales volumes, partially offset by a lower average DD&A rate, largely the result of an $89 million DD&A expense recognized in 2010 associated with depleted fields in the Gulf of Mexico. For the year ended December 31, 2012, other taxes decreased by $268 primarily related to lower Algeria exceptional profits taxes of $184 million due to a lower Algeria effective tax rate resulting from the resolution of the Algeria exceptional profits tax dispute. Other taxes also decreased due to lower commodity prices, which resulted in lower U.S. production and severance taxes of $55 million, and lower ad valorem taxes of $27 million. For the year ended December 31, 2011, other taxes increased by $424 million primarily due to higher crude-oil prices and total sales volumes, resulting in increased Algerian exceptional profits tax of $172 million, increased U.S. production and severance taxes of $152 million, and increased Chinese windfall profits tax of $55 million. Additionally, ad valorem taxes increased by $46 million in 2011 due to higher assessed property values. Impairment expense was $389 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. The Company recognized impairments of $363 million related to oil and gas exploration and production reporting segment properties located in the United States, $13 million related to midstream properties, and $13 million related to the Company Venezuelan cost-method investment. Impairment expense for U.S. oil and gas exploration and production reporting segment properties included $259 million related to lower natural-gas prices. Impairment expense for U.S. properties also included $79 million related to downward reserves revisions for a Gulf of Mexico property that was near the end of its economic life and $25 million for a platform in the Gulf of Mexico with no salvage value. Also during 2012, the Company recognized impairment expense of $13 million related to the Company Venezuelan cost-method investment due to declines in estimated recoverable reserves and lower crude-oil prices. Further declines in commodity prices or negative reserves revisions could result in additional impairments. See Risk Factors under Item 1A of this Form 10-K for further discussion on the risks associated with oil, natural-gas, and NGLs prices. 63 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Impairment expense of $1.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2011, included $1.2 billion related to oil and gas exploration and production reporting segment properties located in the United States, $458 million for midstream reporting segment properties, and $91 million related to the Company Venezuelan cost-method investment. Impairment expense of $952 million for U.S. onshore oil and gas properties and $446 million for associated midstream properties was triggered by lower natural-gas prices. Impairment expense also included $162 million for certain Gulf of Mexico properties related to declines in estimated recoverable reserves, and $100 million related to onshore properties due to changes in projected cash flows resulting from the Company intent to divest of the subject properties. All of these assets were impaired to fair value. Impairment expense for the year ended December 31, 2010, included $114 million related to a production platform included in the oil and gas exploration and production reporting segment that remains idle with no immediate plan for use, and for which a limited market exists, and $61 million related to the Company Venezuelan cost-method investment. millions 2012 2011 2010 Algeria exceptional profits tax settlement $ (1,797 ) $ $ Deepwater Horizon settlement and related costs 18 3,930 15 In March 2012, Anadarko and Sonatrach resolved the exceptional profits tax dispute. The resolution provided for delivery to the Company of crude oil valued at approximately $1.7 billion and the elimination of $62 million of the Company previously recorded and unpaid transportation charges. The crude oil is to be delivered to the Company over a 12-month period that began in June 2012. The Company recognized a $1.8 billion credit in the Costs and Expenses section of the Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended December 31, 2012, to reflect the effect of this agreement for previously recorded expenses. During 2012, the Company collected $1.0 billion associated with the Algeria exceptional profits tax receivable. The Company expects to collect the balance of the Algeria exceptional profits tax receivable during the first half of 2013. In October 2011, the Company and BP entered into the Settlement Agreement, pursuant to which the Company agreed to pay $4.0 billion in cash and transfer its interest in the Macondo well and the Mississippi Canyon Block 252 lease (Lease) to BP, and BP agreed to accept this consideration in full satisfaction of its claims against Anadarko for $6.1 billion of invoices issued through the settlement date as well as for potential reimbursements of subsequent costs incurred by BP related to the Deepwater Horizon events, including costs under the Operating Agreement (OA). In addition, BP fully indemnified Anadarko against all claims, causes of action, losses, costs, expenses, liabilities, damages, or judgments of any kind arising out of the Deepwater Horizon events, related damage claims arising under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA), claims for natural resource damages (NRD) and assessment costs, and any claims arising under the OA. This indemnification is guaranteed by BP Corporation North America Inc. (BPCNA) and, in the event that the net worth of BPCNA declines below an agreed-on amount, BP p.l.c. has agreed to become the sole guarantor. Under the Settlement Agreement, BP does not indemnify the Company against fines and penalties, punitive damages, shareholder derivative, or security laws claims, or certain other claims. The Company believes that costs associated with any non-indemnified items, individually or in the aggregate, will not materially impact the Company consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. Refer to Note 17 Contingencies Deepwater Horizon Events in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for discussion and analysis of these events. 64 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements For the year ended December 31, 2012, Deepwater Horizon settlement and related costs included $18 million of legal expenses and related costs associated with the Deepwater Horizon events. For the year ended December 31, 2011, Deepwater Horizon settlement and related costs included a $4.0 billion expense for the Company cash payment made to BP pursuant to the Settlement Agreement discussed above, as well as $93 million of legal expenses and other related costs associated with the Deepwater Horizon events. These amounts were partially offset by a $163 million gain recognized in the fourth quarter of 2011 for insurance recoveries associated with the Deepwater Horizon events. Although Anadarko has been indemnified by BP for certain costs, the Company may be required to recognize a liability for amounts in advance of or in connection with recognizing a receivable from BP for the related indemnity payment. In all circumstances, however, the Company expects that any additional indemnified liability that may be recognized by the Company will be subsequently recovered from BP itself or through the guarantees of BPCNA or BP p.l.c. Additionally, as part of the Settlement Agreement, BP has agreed that, to the extent it receives value in the future from claims that it has asserted or could assert against third parties arising from or relating to the Deepwater Horizon events, it will make cash payments (not to exceed $1.0 billion in the aggregate) to Anadarko, on a current and continuing basis, equal to 12.5% of the aggregate value received by BP in excess of $1.5 billion. Any payments received by the Company pursuant to this arrangement will be accounted for as a reimbursement of the $4.0 billion 2011 payment made to BP as part of the Settlement Agreement.

Additionally, interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2012, decreased $32 million as a result of interest incurred during 2011 related to the Company capital lease obligations for a floating production, storage, and offloading vessel (FPSO) for the Company Jubilee field operations in Ghana. In December 2011, the Company and its partners in the Jubilee project purchased the vessel, resulting in cancellation of the capital lease obligation. Anadarko interest expense decreased for the year ended December 31, 2011, due to $19 million of increased capitalized interest related to higher construction-in-progress balances for long-term capital projects. Additionally, 2011 interest expense was lower due to items that occurred in 2010 with no similar expense in 2011, including $86 million associated with losses on early debt retirements, $17 million of commitment and structuring costs associated with a contemplated term-loan facility, and $9 million related to unamortized debt issuance costs recognized with the retirement of the Midstream Subsidiary Note Payable to a Related Party. These items were partially offset by $48 million from a higher average outstanding debt balance and weighted-average interest rate on outstanding debt, $29 million related to interest on capital lease obligations incurred in 2011, $24 million attributable to increased amortization of debt-issuance and credit-facility origination costs, and $20 million of higher fees on issued letters of credit and commitment fees related to the $5.0 billion Facility.

For additional information on (gains) losses on commodity derivatives, see Note 12 Derivative Instruments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Anadarko enters into interest-rate swaps to fix or float interest rates on existing or anticipated indebtedness to manage exposure to unfavorable interest-rate changes. The fair value of the Company interest-rate swap portfolio increases (decreases) when interest rates increase (decrease). In 2012, the Company extended the swap maturity dates from October 2012 to September 2016 for interest-rate swaps with an aggregate notional principal amount of $800 million. In 2011, the Company extended the swap maturity dates from October 2011 to June 2014 for interest-rate swaps with an aggregate notional principal amount of $1.85 billion. In connection with these extensions, the swap interest rates were also adjusted. Interest-rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional principal amount of $200 million were settled in October 2012, resulting in a realized loss of $64 million, and interest-rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional principal amount of $150 million were settled in October 2011, resulting in a realized loss of $57 million.

See Note 17 Contingencies Tronox Litigation in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. For 2011, total other income decreased $373 million, primarily due to the recognition of a $250 million Tronox-related contingent loss in 2011, and the 2010 reversal of the $95 million reimbursement obligation to Tronox as a result of the cancellation of the Master Separation Agreement (MSA) by Tronox that occurred as part of Tronox bankruptcy proceedings. Additionally, total other income in 2011 decreased $20 million due to unfavorable exchange-rate changes applicable to foreign currency purchased in anticipation of funding future expenditures on major development projects and foreign currency held in escrow at December 31, 2011, pending final determination of the Company Brazilian tax liability from its 2008 divestiture of the Peregrino field offshore Brazil. The Brazilian tax matter is currently under consideration by the Brazilian courts, and the Company expects this litigation to be resolved within the next year. An unfavorable decision may require the Company to record a tax liability in the Consolidated Financial Statements.

This amount was partially offset by the following: Algerian exceptional profits taxes tax impact from foreign operations The Company reported a loss before income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2011. As a result, items that ordinarily increase or decrease the tax rate will have the opposite effect. The decrease from the 35% U.S. federal statutory rate for the year ended December 31, 2011, was primarily attributable to the following: Algerian exceptional profits taxes tax impact from foreign operations items resulting from business acquisitions and other items These amounts were partially offset by state income tax benefits of the loss. The increase from the 35% U.S. federal statutory rate for the year ended December 31, 2010, was primarily attributable to the following: Algerian exceptional profits taxes unfavorable resolution of uncertain tax positions tax impact from foreign operations For additional information on income tax rates, see Note 19 Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests In December 2012, WGP completed its IPO of approximately 20 million common units representing limited partner interests in WGP at a price of $22.00 per common unit. The Company net income attributable to noncontrolling interests of $54 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, $81 million for 2011, and $60 million for 2010, primarily related to public ownership interests in WES and WGP. Public ownership of WES was 51.8% at December 31, 2012, 54.7% at December 31, 2011, and 51.5% at December 31, 2010. Public ownership of WGP was 9.0% at December 31, 2012. See Note 10 Noncontrolling Interests in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. 68 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements OPERATING RESULTS Segment Analysis Adjusted EBITDAX To assess the performance of Anadarko operating segments, the chief operating decision maker analyzes Adjusted EBITDAX. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDAX as income (loss) before income taxes, interest expense, exploration expense, DD&A, impairments, Deepwater Horizon settlement and related costs, Algeria exceptional profits tax settlement, Tronox-related contingent loss, unrealized (gains) losses on derivatives, net, and realized (gains) losses on other derivatives, net, less net income attributable to noncontrolling interests. The Company definition of Adjusted EBITDAX, which is not a GAAP measure, excludes interest expense to allow for assessment of segment operating results without regard to Anadarko financing methods or capital structure. Adjusted EBITDAX also excludes exploration expense, as it is not an indicator of operating efficiency for a given reporting period. However, exploration expense is monitored by management as part of costs incurred in exploration and development activities. Similarly, DD&A and impairments are excluded from Adjusted EBITDAX as a measure of segment operating performance because capital expenditures are evaluated at the time capital costs are incurred. Anadarko definition of Adjusted EBITDAX excludes Deepwater Horizon settlement and related costs, Algeria exceptional profits tax settlement, and Tronox-related contingent loss, as these costs are outside the normal operations of the Company. See Note 17 Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for discussion of these events. Finally, unrealized (gains) losses on derivatives, net and realized (gains) losses on other derivatives, net are excluded from Adjusted EBITDAX because these (gains) losses are not considered a measure of asset operating performance. Management believes that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDAX provides information useful in assessing the Company financial condition and results of operations and that Adjusted EBITDAX is a widely accepted financial indicator of a company ability to incur and service debt, fund capital expenditures, and make distributions to stockholders. Adjusted EBITDAX, as defined by Anadarko, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Therefore, Anadarko consolidated Adjusted EBITDAX should be considered in conjunction with net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders and other performance measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, such as operating income or cash flows from operating activities. Adjusted EBITDAX has important limitations as an analytical tool because it excludes certain items that affect net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders and net cash provided by operating activities. Adjusted EBITDAX should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of Anadarko results as reported under GAAP. Below is a reconciliation of consolidated Adjusted EBITDAX to income (loss) before income taxes, and consolidated Adjusted EBITDAX by reporting segment. 69 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Adjusted EBITDAX millions except percentages 2012 Inc/(Dec) vs. 2011 2011 Inc/(Dec) vs. 2010 2010 Income (loss) before income taxes $ 3,565 NM $ (3,424 ) NM $ 1,641 Exploration expense 1,946 81 % 1,076 10 % 974 DD&A 3,964 3 3,830 3 3,714 Impairments 389 (78 ) 1,774 NM 216 Deepwater Horizon settlement and related costs 18 (100 ) 3,930 NM 15 Algeria exceptional profits tax settlement (1) (1,797 ) NM NM Tronox-related contingent loss (1) (250 ) NM 250 NM (95 ) Interest expense 742 (12 ) 839 (2 ) 855 Unrealized (gains) losses on derivatives, net 377 (39 ) 616 NM (114 ) Realized (gains) losses on other derivatives, net (1) 66 12 59 NM Less net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 54 (33 ) 81 35 60 Consolidated Adjusted EBITDAX $ 8,966 1 $ 8,869 24 $ 7,146 Adjusted EBITDAX by segment Oil and gas exploration and production $ 8,500 (3 ) $ 8,787 29 $ 6,786 Midstream 474 13 419 36 308 Marketing (104 ) (65 ) (63 ) NM 4 Other and intersegment eliminations 96 135 (274 ) NM 48 (1) In the first quarter of 2012, the Company revised the definition of Adjusted EBITDAX to exclude Algeria exceptional profits tax settlement, Tronox-related contingent loss, and realized (gains) losses on other derivatives, net. The prior periods have been adjusted to reflect this change. Oil and Gas Exploration and Production The decrease in Adjusted EBITDAX for the year ended December 31, 2012, was primarily due to lower NGLs and natural-gas prices, partially offset by higher sales volumes. The increase in Adjusted EBITDAX for the year ended December 31, 2011, was primarily due to the higher crude-oil and NGLs prices and higher sales volumes. These increases were partially offset by lower natural-gas prices and increased operating expenses, primarily other taxes, which increased as a result of higher sales volumes and crude-oil prices. Midstream The increase in Adjusted EBITDAX for the year ended December 31, 2012, is primarily due to additional margin provided by assets acquired in February 2011 and May 2011, and an increase in gathering and processing revenues associated with increased throughput across several of Anadarko fee-based systems. This increase was partially offset by lower commodity prices, which led to reduced natural-gas processing margins. For the year ended December 31, 2011, the increase in Adjusted EBITDAX resulted from increased margins due to higher NGLs prices and volumes, lower prices for natural-gas purchases, and margins provided by 2011 asset acquisitions. Also contributing to the increase was the recognition of a $21 million gain from the acquisition-date fair-value remeasurement of the Company pre-acquisition 7% equity interest in the Wattenberg Plant. These increases were partially offset by losses related to midstream assets held for sale. Marketing Marketing earnings primarily represent the margin earned on sales of natural gas, oil, and NGLs purchased from third parties. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDAX for the year ended December 31, 2012, resulted from lower margins on sales from inventory as a result of lower prices and increased transportation expenses primarily due to higher unutilized demand fees. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDAX for the year ended December 31, 2011, resulted primarily from lower margins associated with natural-gas sales from inventory and an increase in transportation expense related to new transportation agreements effective January 2011. 70 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Other and Intersegment Eliminations Other and intersegment eliminations consist primarily of corporate costs, realized gains and losses on derivatives, and income from hard minerals investments and royalties. The increase in Adjusted EBITDAX for the year ended December 31, 2012, was primarily due to higher realized gains on commodity derivatives in 2012, partially offset by expense associated with general partner UARs awarded in prior years to certain officers of the general partner of WES, pursuant to the WGH Equity Incentive Plan. This increase was related to the change in fair value of the UARs in connection with the WGP IPO. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDAX for the year ended December 31, 2011, was primarily due to lower realized gains on commodity derivatives in 2011 and exchange-rate changes applicable to foreign currency. Proved Reserves Anadarko is focused on growth and profitability, and reserves replacement is a key to growth. Future profitability partially depends on commodity prices and the cost of finding and developing oil and gas reserves. Reserves growth can be achieved through successful exploration and development drilling, improved recovery, or acquisition of producing properties. Additional reserves information is contained in the Supplemental Information on Oil and Gas Exploration and Production Activities (Supplemental Information) under Item 8 of this Form 10-K.

Proved Reserves Additions and Revisions During 2012, the Company added 370 MMBOE of proved reserves as a result of additions (purchases in place, discoveries, and extensions) and revisions. The Company expects the majority of future reserves growth to come from revisions associated with infill drilling (reserves bookings related to infill wells are treated as positive revisions due to increases in expected recovery), extensions of current fields, new discoveries onshore United States and in the Gulf of Mexico, successful exploration in international growth areas, and purchases of properties in strategic areas. 71 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Additions During 2012, Anadarko added 82 MMBOE of proved reserves through extensions and discoveries primarily as a result of successful drilling in the Marcellus shale area and the Gulf of Mexico. Although shale plays represent only about 10% of the Company total proved reserves at December 31, 2012, growth in the shale plays contributed 66 MMBOE of the total extensions and discoveries. During 2011, Anadarko added 174 MMBOE of proved reserves primarily as a result of successful drilling in the Marcellus and Eagleford shale areas and the Gulf of Mexico. Shale plays contributed 119 MMBOE of additions in 2011. During 2010, Anadarko added 83 MMBOE of proved reserves primarily as a result of successful drilling in the United States. Shale plays contributed 45 MMBOE of the 2010 additions. Revisions Total revisions in 2012 resulted in an increase of 284 MMBOE or 11% of the beginning-of-year reserves base. Total revisions include: the effects of new infill drilling, changes in commodity prices and other updates reflecting changes in economic conditions, reservoir performance, and development plans. Total 2012 revisions included an increase of 383 MMBOE related to successful infill drilling, primarily in large onshore areas such as Greater Natural Buttes, Wattenberg, and Carthage, and 33 MMBOE resulting from the resolution of the Algeria exceptional profits tax dispute. Partially offsetting these positive revisions were decreases of 68 MMBOE due to lower commodity prices, 56 MMBOE at Wattenberg primarily due to removing reserves associated with the discontinued vertical drilling program, and 8 MMBOE resulting from updates to all other assets. Total revisions in 2011 were 218 MMBOE or 9% of the beginning-of-year reserves base. The revisions included an increase of 203 MMBOE related to continuation of successful infill drilling in large onshore areas, including Greater Natural Buttes, Wattenberg, and Pinedale fields, 182 MMBOE of positive revisions to prior estimates, and 8 MMBOE associated with higher oil prices. These positive revisions were partially offset by the transfer of 175 MMBOE of proved reserves to unproved categories as a result of changes to development plans and economic conditions experienced during 2011. Total revisions in 2010 were 275 MMBOE or 12% of the beginning-of-year reserves base. The revisions included an increase of 312 MMBOE related to successful infill drilling in large onshore areas, 77 MMBOE of favorable revisions to prior estimates, and 29 MMBOE associated with higher oil and natural-gas prices. Sales in Place In 2012, the Company sold U.S. properties or interests in U.S. properties containing 59 MMBOE of proved developed reserves and 22 MMBOE of proved undeveloped reserves. Sales included partial sales of working interests in the Rockies Salt Creek enhanced oil recovery project and the Gulf of Mexico Lucius development project, and asset divestitures in South Texas, West Texas, the Gulf of Mexico, Rockies, and North Louisiana. In 2011, the Company sold U.S. properties containing 7 MMBOE of proved developed reserves and 22 MMBOE of proved undeveloped reserves. This included a sale of a working interest in the Maverick basin and asset divestitures in South Texas and Alaska. Discounted Future Net Cash Flows At December 31, 2012, the discounted estimated future net cash flows (at 10%) from Anadarko proved reserves was $26.3 billion (measured in accordance with the regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)). This amount was calculated based on the 12-month average beginning-of-month prices for the year, held flat for the life of the reserves, adjusted for any contractual provisions. See Supplemental Information under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. The present value of future net cash flows is not an estimate of the fair value of Anadarko proved reserves. An estimate of fair value would also take into account, among other things, anticipated changes in future prices and costs, the expected recovery of reserves in excess of proved reserves and a discount factor more representative of the time value of money and the risks inherent in producing oil and natural gas. 72 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Overview Anadarko generates cash needed to fund capital expenditures, debt-service obligations, and dividend payments primarily from operating activities, and enters into debt and equity transactions to maintain its desired capital structure and to finance acquisition opportunities. Liquidity may also be enhanced through asset divestitures and joint ventures that reduce future capital expenditures. Consistent with this approach, the primary source for capital investment funding during 2012 was cash flows from operating activities. In addition, the Company collected $1.0 billion associated with the Algerian exceptional profits tax receivable that was used to reduce outstanding borrowings under the $5.0 billion Facility. The Company continuously monitors its liquidity needs, coordinates its capital expenditure program with its expected cash flows and projected debt-repayment schedule, and evaluates available funding alternatives in light of current and expected conditions. In March 2012, Moody Investors Service returned the Company senior unsecured rating to investment grade. As a result, the Company was able to terminate the LOC Facility (discussed below). All cash that secured financial trades previously posted due to credit-related provisions has been returned to the Company. During 2012, the Company fully repaid $2.5 billion of borrowings under the Company $5.0 billion Facility with cash on hand and cash realized from the resolution of the Algeria exceptional profits tax dispute. At December 31, 2012, Anadarko had no scheduled debt maturities in 2013, exclusive of the Zero-Coupon Senior Notes due 2036 (Zero Coupons) that can be put to the Company in October 2013 (the next potential put date) for the then-accreted value of $718 million. Scheduled debt maturities in 2014 are $775 million, exclusive of the Zero Coupons. The Company has a variety of funding sources available to it, including cash on hand, an asset portfolio that provides ongoing cash-flow-generating capacity, opportunities for liquidity enhancement through divestitures and joint-venture arrangements, and availability of the $5.0 billion Facility. Management believes that the Company liquidity position, asset portfolio, and continued strong operating and financial performance provide the necessary financial flexibility to fund the Company current and long-term operations. Revolving Credit Facility and Letter of Credit Facility Borrowings under the $5.0 billion Facility bear interest, at the Company election, at (i) the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a margin ranging from 1.25% to 2.50%, based on the Company credit rating, or (ii) the greatest of (a) the JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. prime rate, (b) the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus 0.50%, or (c) one-month LIBOR plus 1%, plus, in each case, an applicable margin ranging from 0.25% to 1.50%. Obligations incurred under the $5.0 billion Facility, as well as obligations Anadarko has to lenders or their affiliates pursuant to certain derivative instruments as discussed in Note 12 Derivative Instruments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K, are guaranteed by certain of the Company wholly owned domestic subsidiaries, and are secured by a perfected first-priority security interest in certain exploration and production assets located in the United States and 65% of the capital stock of certain wholly owned foreign subsidiaries. In 2011, the Company entered into an agreement with a financial institution to provide up to $400 million of letters of credit (LOC Facility). In the third quarter of 2012, the Company terminated the LOC Facility. Financial Covenants The $5.0 billion Facility contains various customary covenants with which Anadarko must comply, including, but not limited to, limitations on incurrence of indebtedness, liens on assets, and asset sales. Anadarko is also required to maintain, at the end of each quarter, (i) a Consolidated Leverage Ratio of no more than 4.5 to 1.0 (relative to Consolidated EBITDAX for the most recent period of four calendar quarters), (ii) a ratio of Current Assets to Current Liabilities of no less than 1.0 to 1.0, and (iii) a Collateral Coverage Ratio of no less than 1.75 to 1.0, in each case, as defined in the $5.0 billion Facility. The Collateral Coverage Ratio is the ratio of an annually redetermined value of pledged assets to outstanding loans under the $5.0 billion Facility. Additionally, to borrow from the $5.0 billion Facility, the Collateral Coverage Ratio must be no less than 1.75 to 1.0 after giving pro forma effect to the requested borrowing. At December 31, 2012, the Company was in compliance with applicable covenants, and there were no restrictions on its ability to utilize the $5.0 billion Facility. 73 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The covenants contained in certain of the Company credit agreements provide for a maximum debt-to-capitalization ratio of 67%. The covenants do not specifically restrict the payment of dividends; however, the impact of dividends paid on the Company debt-to-capitalization ratio must be considered in order to ensure covenant compliance. At December 31, 2012, Anadarko was in compliance with all financial covenants. Zero-Coupon Notes In a 2006 private offering, Anadarko received $500 million of loan proceeds upon issuing the Zero Coupons. The Zero Coupons mature in October 2036 and have an aggregate principal amount due at maturity of $2.4 billion, reflecting a yield to maturity of 5.24%. The holder has the right to cause the Company to repay an amount up to the then-accreted value of the outstanding Zero Coupons in October of each year. The accreted value of the outstanding Zero Coupons was $690 million at December 31, 2012, and will be $718 million in October 2013 (the next potential put date). The Company considers its cash-flow-generating capacity and access to additional liquidity sufficient to continue to satisfy the Company debt-service and other obligations, including the potential early repayment of the outstanding Zero Coupons. WES Funding Sources Anadarko consolidated subsidiary, WES, uses cash flows from operations to fund ongoing operations (including capital investments in the ordinary course of business), service its debt, and make distributions to its equity holders. As needed, WES supplements cash generated from its operating activities with proceeds from debt or equity issuances or borrowings under its five-year, $800 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility maturing in March 2016 (RCF). Borrowings under the RCF bear interest at (i) LIBOR plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.30% to 1.90%, or (ii) the greatest of (a) the Wells Fargo Bank, National Association prime rate, (b) the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus 0.50%, or (c) one-month LIBOR plus 1%, plus, in each case, an applicable margin ranging from 0.30% to 0.90%. At December 31, 2012, WES was in compliance with all covenants contained in the RCF, had no outstanding borrowings under the RCF, and had all $800 million of RCF borrowing capacity available. See Financing Activities below. Insurance Coverage and Other Indemnities Anadarko maintains property and casualty insurance that includes coverage for physical damage to the Company properties, blowout/control of a well, restoration and redrill, sudden and accidental pollution, third-party liability, workers compensation and employers liability, and other risks. Anadarko insurance coverage includes deductibles that must be met prior to recovery. Additionally, the Company insurance is subject to exclusions and limitations, and there is no assurance that such coverage will adequately protect the Company against liability or loss from all potential consequences and damages. The Company current insurance coverage, which was obtained subsequent to the Deepwater Horizon events, includes physical damage to Anadarko properties on a replacement cost basis; $750 million for an offshore blowout/control of a well, restoration and redrill, and pollution from an offshore blowout ($75 million for onshore); $275 million for aircraft liability; and $675 million for third-party liabilities (including sudden and accidental pollution). The Company total limit for the negative environmental impacts of an offshore blowout is approximately $1.425 billion (which is reduced proportionally to the Company participating interest in a venture except for the $750 million portion dealing with an offshore blowout, which does not reduce below a 50% participating interest subject to certain reporting requirements). There is currently no coverage for loss of production income from any facilities or for physical damage to the Company properties, blowout/control of a well, or restoration and redrill to the extent these items result from the effects of a named windstorm. Anadarko property and casualty insurance policies renew in June of each year. At the next renewals scheduled for June 2013, the Company may not be able to secure similar coverage for the same costs, if at all. Future insurance coverage costs for the oil and gas industry could increase and may include higher deductibles or retentions. In addition, some forms of insurance may become unavailable in the future or unavailable on terms that the Company considers economically acceptable. 74 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The Company service agreements, including drilling contracts, generally indemnify Anadarko for injuries and death to employees of the service provider and subcontractors hired by the service provider as well as for property damage suffered by the service provider and its contractors. Also, these service agreements generally indemnify Anadarko for pollution originating from the equipment of any contractors or subcontractors hired by the service provider. Following is a discussion of significant sources and uses of cash flows for the three-year period ended December 31, 2012. Forward-looking information related to the Company liquidity and capital resources is discussed in Outlook that follows. Sources of Cash Operating Activities Anadarko cash flows from operating activities in 2012 was $8.3 billion compared to $2.5 billion in 2011 and $5.2 billion in 2010. Cash flows from operating activities for 2012 increased year over year primarily due to the $4.0 billion payment to BP related to the Settlement Agreement in 2011, $1.0 billion collected in 2012 associated with the Algeria exceptional profits tax receivable, higher sales volumes, and the favorable impact of changes in working capital items, partially offset by lower average NGLs and natural-gas prices. Cash flows from operating activities for 2011 decreased year over year primarily due to the $4.0 billion payment to BP, lower natural-gas prices, increased operating expenses primarily due to other taxes (which increased as a result of higher sales volumes and crude-oil prices), and the unfavorable impact of changes in working capital items. These decreases were partially offset by higher crude-oil and NGLs prices and higher sales volumes. One of the primary sources of variability in the Company cash flows from operating activities is fluctuation in commodity prices, which Anadarko partially mitigates by entering into commodity derivatives. Sales-volume changes also impact cash flow, but have not been as volatile as commodity prices. Anadarko long-term cash flows from operating activities is dependent on commodity prices, sales volumes, costs required for continued operations, and debt service. Investing Activities Anadarko received pretax sales proceeds related to property divestiture transactions of $657 million in 2012, $555 million in 2011, and $70 million in 2010. Financing Activities During 2012, Anadarko consolidated subsidiary, WES, borrowed $374 million under its RCF, primarily to fund the acquisition of certain midstream assets from Anadarko. Also during 2012, WES completed its public offering of $670 million aggregate principal amount of 4.000% Senior Notes due 2022 and issued five million common units to the public, raising net proceeds of $212 million. Proceeds from these public offerings were used to repay outstanding RCF borrowings and for other general partnership purposes, including the funding of capital expenditures. In December 2012, WGP completed its IPO of approximately 20 million common units representing limited partner interests in WGP at a price of $22.00 per common unit, for net proceeds of $411 million. The proceeds will be used for general partnership purposes, including the funding of WES capital expenditures. During 2011, Anadarko borrowed $2.5 billion under the $5.0 billion Facility to fund a portion of the $4.0 billion payment to BP associated with the Settlement Agreement (see Deepwater Horizon Settlement Costs below). In 2011, WES borrowed $320 million under its RCF primarily to fund a third-party asset acquisition and $250 million under its RCF to repay the senior unsecured term loan (Term Loan) as discussed in Uses of Cash . Also during 2011, WES issued approximately 10 million common units to the public, raising net proceeds of $328 million, which were used to repay outstanding RCF borrowings and for other general partnership purposes. In addition, during 2011, WES completed a public offering of $500 million aggregate principal amount of 5.375% Senior Notes due 2021, with net proceeds from the offering used to repay amounts then outstanding under its RCF. 75 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements During 2010, the Company received net proceeds of $2.7 billion related to the issuance of $2.8 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior notes and used the net proceeds, combined with cash on hand, to redeem $3.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 2011 and 2012 debt maturities. See Uses of Cash for further information about debt repayments. During 2010, WES borrowed a total of $670 million under its Term Loan and RCF primarily to fund the acquisition of certain midstream assets from Anadarko. WES also issued approximately 13 million common units in two 2010 public offerings, realizing net proceeds of $338 million, which were used to repay a portion of outstanding RCF borrowings. Uses of Cash Anadarko invests significant capital to develop, acquire, and explore for oil and natural-gas resources and to expand its midstream infrastructure, and also utilizes cash to fund ongoing operating costs, capital contributions to equity subsidiaries, debt repayments, and distributions to its shareholders. Capital Expenditures The following table presents the Company capital expenditures by category: millions 2012 2011 2010 Property acquisitions Exploration $ 239 $ 647 $ 519 Development 22 Exploration 2,064 1,469 1,278 Development 4,064 3,525 3,267 Total oil and gas costs incurred (1) 6,367 5,641 5,086 Less corporate acquisitions and non-cash property exchanges (32 ) (17 ) (37 ) Less asset retirement costs (98 ) (148 ) (86 ) Less geological and geophysical, exploration overhead, delay rentals expenses, and other expenses (401 ) (450 ) (291 ) Total oil and gas capital expenditures 5,836 5,026 4,672 Gathering, processing, and marketing and other ( 2 ) 1,475 1,527 497 Total capital expenditures (1) $ 7,311 $ 6,553 $ 5,169 (1) Oil and gas costs incurred represent costs related to finding and developing oil and gas reserves. Capital expenditures represent additions to property and equipment excluding corporate acquisitions, property exchanges, and asset retirement costs. Capital expenditures and costs incurred are presented on an accrual basis. Additions to properties and equipment and dry hole costs on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows include certain adjustments that give effect to the timing of actual cash payments in order to provide a cash-basis presentation. (2 ) Includes WES capital expenditures of $529 million in 2012, $439 million in 2011, and $81 million in 2010. The Company capital spending increased 12% for the year ended December 31, 2012, primarily due to increased exploration drilling onshore and offshore United States, and in East and West Africa; increased development drilling onshore United States; construction costs related to the development of the Lucius project located in the Gulf of Mexico; and higher expenditures for additional capital projects at domestic onshore plants and gathering systems. These increases were partially offset by lower exploration property acquisition costs, primarily onshore United States, and 2011 midstream asset acquisitions. In May 2011, Anadarko increased its ownership interest in the Wattenberg Plant to 100% by acquiring an additional 93% interest for $576 million. Also, in February 2011, WES acquired a third-party natural-gas processing plant and related gathering systems, located in the Rocky Mountains area, for $302 million. In the third quarter of 2012, the Company entered into a carried-interest arrangement that requires a third-party partner to fund $556 million of Anadarko capital costs to earn a 7.2% working interest in the Lucius development, located in the Gulf of Mexico. The amount of the carry obligation represents 100% of the Company expected future capital costs through first production. The funding obligation is expected to be complete by year-end 2014. At December 31, 2012, $179 million of the $556 million obligation had been funded. 76 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The Company capital spending increased 27% for the year ended December 31, 2011, primarily due to the 2011 midstream asset acquisitions discussed above. The increase to capital expenditures was also due to increased development drilling costs of $258 million primarily related to onshore U.S. properties and higher exploration expenditures of $191 million primarily resulting from exploration drilling in Ghana. In the first quarter of 2011, the Company entered into a carried-interest arrangement that requires a third-party partner to fund approximately $1.6 billion of Anadarko future capital costs in the Eagleford shale, located in South Texas, to earn a one-third interest in Anadarko Eagleford shale assets. The third-party funding is expected to cover 90% of Anadarko future capital costs in the basin until the carry is fully funded, which is expected to occur by year-end 2013. At December 31, 2012, $1.2 billion of the $1.6 billion obligation had been funded. Deepwater Horizon Settlement Costs In October 2011, the Company and BP entered into the Settlement Agreement related to the Deepwater Horizon events. The Company paid $4.0 billion and transferred its interest in the Macondo well and Lease to BP. Refer to Note 17 Contingencies Deepwater Horizon Events in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information. Pension Contributions During 2012, the Company made contributions of $101 million to its funded pension plans, $6 million to its unfunded pension plans, and $19 million to its unfunded other postretirement benefit plans. The decrease in contributions to the funded pension plans in 2012 resulted from revised discount rates used for funding purposes. The Company expects to contribute approximately $81 million to its funded pension plans, approximately $45 million to its unfunded pension plans, and approximately $16 million to its unfunded other postretirement benefit plans in 2013. During 2011, the Company made contributions of $301 million to its funded pension plans, $10 million to its unfunded pension plans, and $17 million to its unfunded other postretirement benefit plans. The increase in contributions to the funded pension plans during 2011 resulted from lower discount rates compared to the prior measurement period, which increased the pension liability and the corresponding funding target. Debt Retirements and Repayments During 2012, the Company repaid the entire $2.5 billion of borrowings under its $5.0 billion Facility, and retired $131 million of 6.125% Senior Notes that matured in March 2012 and $39 million of 5.000% Senior Notes that matured in October 2012. In addition, WES repaid $374 million of borrowings under its RCF. During 2011, WES repaid $619 million of borrowings under its RCF and a $250 million Term Loan primarily from proceeds from public debt and equity offerings, as discussed in Sources of Cash . In addition, the Company repaid $285 million principal amount of 6.875% Senior Notes that matured in September 2011. In 2010, the Company used $1.6 billion to repay the Midstream Subsidiary Note and $1.5 billion, including $86 million for early-tender premiums, to redeem senior notes scheduled to mature in 2011 and 2012. The repayments were funded with proceeds from new borrowings, as well as cash on hand. Also in 2010, WES repaid $371 million outstanding under its RCF primarily from proceeds related to its public offerings discussed in Sources of Cash . In connection with entering into the $5.0 billion Facility in 2010, the Company paid upfront underwriting, structuring, arrangement, and other costs totaling $172 million. For additional information on the Company debt instruments, such as transactions during the period, years of maturity, and interest rates, see Note 13 Debt and Interest Expense in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Common Stock Dividends and Distributions to Noncontrolling Interest Owners Anadarko paid dividends to its common stockholders (nine cents per share per quarter) of $181 million in 2012, $181 million in 2011, and $180 million in 2010. Anadarko has paid a dividend to its common stockholders quarterly since becoming an independent public company in 1986. The amount of future dividends paid to Anadarko common stockholders will be determined by the Board of Directors on a quarterly basis and will depend on earnings, financial conditions, capital requirements, the effect a dividend payment would have on the Company compliance with relevant financial covenants, and other factors. 77 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements WES distributed to its unitholders, other than Anadarko, an aggregate of $100 million in 2012, $72 million in 2011, and $42 million in 2010. WES has made quarterly distributions to its unitholders since its IPO in the second quarter of 2008 and has increased its distribution from $0.30 per common unit for the third quarter of 2008 to $0.52 per common unit for the fourth quarter of 2012. WGP has declared a prorated cash distribution of $0.03587 per unit for the fourth quarter of 2012. The distribution is the first declared by WGP and corresponds to a per-unit quarterly distribution of $0.165. Other During 2011, the Company and its partners in the Jubilee project in Ghana purchased the FPSO. The Company cash contribution was $108 million. Outlook The Company is committed to the execution of its worldwide exploration, appraisal, and development programs. The Company plans to allocate approximately 70% of its 2013 capital spending to development activities, 20% to exploration activities, and 10% to gas-gathering and processing activities and other business activities. The Company expects its 2013 capital spending by area to be approximately 60% for the U.S. onshore region and Alaska, 15% for the Gulf of Mexico, 15% for International, and 10% for Midstream and other. Anadarko believes that its cash on hand and expected level of operating cash flows will be sufficient to fund the Company projected operational and capital programs for 2013, while continuing to meet its other obligations. The Company cash on hand is available for use and could be supplemented, as needed, with available borrowing capacity under the $5.0 billion Facility. The Company currently does not consider European sovereign debt events to pose significant risk to its ability to access available borrowing capacity under the $5.0 billion Facility. The Company may also enter into carried-interest arrangements with third parties to fund certain capital expenditures and asset divestitures to supplement cash flow. The Company continuously monitors its liquidity needs, coordinates its capital expenditure program with its expected cash flows and projected debt-repayment schedule, and evaluates available funding alternatives in light of current and expected conditions. In order to reduce commodity-price risk and increase the predictability of 2013 cash flows, Anadarko entered into strategic derivative positions, which cover a portion of its anticipated natural-gas and crude-oil sales volumes for 2013. For details of derivative positions at December 31, 2012, see Note 12 Derivative Instruments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements Anadarko may enter into off-balance-sheet arrangements and transactions that can give rise to material off-balance-sheet obligations. The Company material off-balance-sheet arrangements and transactions include operating lease arrangements and undrawn letters of credit. There are no other transactions, arrangements, or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect Anadarko liquidity or availability of or requirements for capital resources. See Obligations and Commitments for more information regarding off-balance-sheet arrangements. 78 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Obligations and Commitments The following is a summary of the Company obligations at December 31, 2012: Obligations by Period (1) millions 2013 2014-2015 2016-2017 2018 and beyond Total Total debt Principal long-term borrowings ( 2 ) $ $ 775 $ 3,750 $ 10,427 $ 14,952 Investee entities debt ( 3 ) 2,853 2,853 Interest on borrowings 844 1,603 1,451 7,604 11,502 Investee entities interest ( 3 ) 38 89 141 2,990 3,258 Operating leases Drilling rig commitments 706 1,596 825 258 3,385 Production platforms 44 107 68 135 354 Other 67 89 55 49 260 Asset retirement obligations 298 466 202 919 1,885 Midstream and marketing activities 629 1,573 1,414 2,722 6,338 Oil and gas activities 1,021 950 239 212 2,422 Derivative liabilities ( 4 ) 7 823 377 1,207 Uncertain tax positions, interest, and penalties (5) 56 7 11 74 Environmental liabilities 17 14 4 46 81 Total $ 3,727 $ 8,092 $ 8,537 $ 28,215 $ 48,571 (1) This table does not include the Company pension or postretirement benefit obligations. See Note 22 Pension Plans, Other Postretirement Benefits, and Defined-Contribution Plans in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. (2) Includes the fully accreted principal amount of the Zero Coupons of $2.4 billion as coming due after 2016. While the Zero Coupons do not mature until 2036, the holder has the right to put the outstanding Zero Coupons to the Company each October at the then-accreted value. The Company could be required to repurchase the outstanding Zero Coupons at $718 million in October 2013 (the next potential put date). (3) Anadarko has legal right of setoff and intends to net-settle its obligations under each of the notes payable to the investees with the distributable value of its interest in the corresponding investee. Accordingly, the investments and the obligations are presented net on the Consolidated Balance Sheets in other long-term liabilities other for all periods presented. These notes payable provide for a variable rate of interest, reset quarterly. Therefore, future interest payments presented in the table above are estimated using the forward LIBOR rate curve. Further, the above table does not reflect the preferred return that Anadarko receives on its investment in these entities, which is also LIBOR-based, with a lower margin than the margin on the associated notes payable. See Note 11 Equity-Method Investments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. (4) Represents Anadarko gross derivative liability after taking into account the impacts of netting margin and collateral balances deposited with counterparties. See Note 12 Derivative Instruments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. (5) See Note 19 Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Operating Leases Operating lease obligations include approximately $3.2 billion related to 12 offshore drilling vessels and $183 million related to certain contracts for onshore U.S. drilling rigs. Anadarko manages its access to rigs in order to execute its drilling strategy over the next several years. Lease payments associated with the drilling of exploratory wells and development wells, net of amounts billed to partners, will initially be capitalized as a component of oil and gas properties, and either depreciated or impaired in future periods or written off as exploration expense. See Note 17 Contingencies Deepwater Drilling Moratorium and Other Related Matters in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information on drilling rigs. 79 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements At December 31, 2012, the Company had $614 million in various commitments under non-cancelable operating lease agreements for production platforms and equipment, buildings, facilities, compressors, and aircraft. For additional information, see Note 16 Commitments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Asset Retirement Obligations Anadarko is obligated to fund the costs of disposing of long-lived assets upon their abandonment. The majority of Anadarko asset retirement obligations (AROs) relate to the plugging of wells and the related abandonment of oil and gas properties. The Company AROs are recorded at estimated fair value, measured by reference to the expected future cash outflows required to satisfy the retirement obligation discounted at the Company credit-adjusted risk-free interest rate. Revisions to estimated AROs can result from changes in retirement cost estimates, revisions to estimated inflation rates, and changes in the estimated timing of abandonment. Midstream and Marketing Activities Anadarko has entered into various processing, transportation, storage, and purchase agreements in order to access markets and provide flexibility for the sale of its natural gas, crude oil, and NGLs in certain areas. Oil and Gas Activities Anadarko has various long-term contractual commitments pertaining to exploration, development, and production activities that extend beyond 2012. The Company has work-related commitments for, among other things, drilling wells, obtaining and processing seismic, and fulfilling rig commitments. The preceding table includes long-term drilling and work-related commitments of $2.4 billion, comprised of approximately $1.5 billion related to the United States and $872 million related to international locations. Environmental Liabilities Anadarko is subject to various environmental-remediation and reclamation obligations arising from federal, state, and local laws and regulations. At December 31, 2012, the Company balance sheet included an $81 million liability for remediation and reclamation obligations. The Company continually monitors the liability recorded and ongoing remediation and reclamation processes, and believes the amount recorded is appropriate. For additional information on environmental issues, see Risk Factors under Item 1A of this Form 10-K. For additional information on contracts, obligations, and arrangements the Company enters into from time to time, see Note 12 Derivative Instruments, Note 13 Debt and Interest Expense, Note 16 Commitments, and Note 17 Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES In preparing financial statements in accordance with GAAP in the United States, management makes informed judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. Management evaluates its estimates and related assumptions regularly, including those related to the value of properties and equipment; proved reserves; goodwill; intangible assets; asset retirement obligations; litigation reserves; environmental liabilities; pension assets, liabilities, and costs; income taxes; and fair values. Changes in facts and circumstances or additional information may result in revised estimates, and actual results may differ from these estimates. Management considers the following to be its most critical accounting estimates that involve judgment. The selection and development of these estimates is discussed with the Company Audit Committee. 80 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Oil and Gas Activities Anadarko applies the successful efforts method of accounting to account for its oil and gas activities. Under this method, acquisition costs and the costs associated with drilling exploratory wells are capitalized pending the determination of proved oil and gas reserves. Exploration geological and geophysical costs and other costs of carrying properties such as delay rentals are expensed as incurred. Acquisition Costs Acquisition costs of unproved properties are periodically assessed for impairment and are transferred to proved oil and gas properties to the extent the costs are associated with successful exploration activities. Significant undeveloped leases are assessed individually for impairment, based on the Company current exploration plans, and a valuation allowance is provided if impairment is indicated. Significant undeveloped leasehold costs are assessed for impairment at a lease level or resource play (for example, the Greater Natural Buttes area in the Rockies), while leasehold acquisition costs associated with prospective areas that have limited or no previous exploratory drilling are generally assessed for impairment by major prospect area. Unproved oil and gas properties with individually insignificant lease acquisition costs are amortized on a group basis (thereby establishing a valuation allowance) over the average lease term at rates that provide for full amortization of unsuccessful leases upon lease expiration or abandonment. Costs of expired or abandoned leases are charged against the valuation allowance, while costs of productive leases are transferred to proved oil and gas properties. Costs of maintaining and retaining unproved properties, as well as amortization of individually insignificant leases and impairment of unsuccessful leases, are included in exploration expense. Certain of the Company unproved property costs are associated with acquired properties to which proved developed producing reserves are also attributed. Generally, economic recovery of unproved reserves in such areas is not yet supported by actual production or conclusive formation tests, but may be confirmed by the Company continuing exploration and development programs. Another portion of the Company unproved property costs are associated with the Land Grant acreage, where the Company owns mineral interests in perpetuity and plans to continue to explore and evaluate the acreage. A change in the Company expected future plans for exploration and development could cause an impairment of the Company unproved property. Exploratory Costs Under the successful efforts method of accounting, exploratory costs associated with a well discovering hydrocarbons are initially capitalized, or suspended, pending a determination as to whether a commercially sufficient quantity of proved reserves can be attributed to the area as a result of drilling. At the end of each quarter, management reviews the status of all suspended exploratory drilling costs in light of ongoing exploration activities in particular, whether the Company is making sufficient progress in its ongoing exploration and appraisal efforts or, in the case of discoveries requiring government sanctioning, analyzing whether development negotiations are underway and proceeding as planned. If management determines that future appraisal drilling or development activities are unlikely to occur, associated suspended exploratory drilling costs are expensed in that period. Therefore, at any point in time, the Company may have capitalized costs on its Consolidated Balance Sheets associated with exploratory wells that may be charged to exploration expense in future periods. 81 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Proved Reserves Anadarko estimates its proved oil and gas reserves as defined by the SEC and the FASB. This definition includes crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be economically producible in future periods from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions, operating methods, government regulations, etc. (i.e., at prices and costs as of the date the estimates are made). Prices include consideration of price changes provided only by contractual arrangements, and do not include adjustments based on expected future conditions. The Company estimates of proved reserves are made using available geological and reservoir data, as well as production performance data. These estimates are reviewed annually by internal reservoir engineers and revised, either upward or downward, as warranted by additional data. Revisions are necessary due to changes in, among other things, reservoir performance, prices, economic conditions, and governmental restrictions, as well as changes in the expected recovery associated with infill drilling. Decreases in prices, for example, may cause a reduction in some proved reserves due to reaching economic limits at an earlier projected date. A material adverse change in the estimated volumes of proved reserves could have a negative impact on DD&A and could result in property impairments. Fair Value The Company estimates fair value for derivatives, long-lived assets for impairment testing, reporting units for goodwill impairment testing when necessary, assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination or exchanged in non-monetary transactions, guarantees, pension plan assets, initial measurements of AROs, and financial instruments that require fair-value disclosure, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and debt. When the Company is required to measure fair value and there is not a market-observable price for the asset or liability or for a similar asset or liability, the Company utilizes the cost, income, or market valuation approaches depending on the quality of information available to support management assumptions. The cost approach is based on management best estimate of the current asset replacement cost. The income approach is based on management best assumptions regarding expectations of projected cash flows, and discounts the expected cash flows using a commensurate risk-adjusted discount rate. The market approach is based on management best assumptions regarding prices and other relevant information from market transactions involving comparable assets. Such evaluations involve significant judgment and the results are based on expected future events or conditions, such as sales prices, estimates of future oil and gas production or throughput, development and operating costs and the timing thereof, future net cash flows, economic and regulatory climates, and other factors, most of which are often outside of management control. However, assumptions used reflect a market participant view of long-term prices, costs, and other factors, and are consistent with assumptions used in the Company business plans and investment decisions. Business Combinations Accounting for the acquisition of a business requires the assets and liabilities of the acquired business to be recorded at fair value. Deferred taxes are recorded for any differences between the fair value and the tax basis of acquired assets and liabilities. Any excess of the purchase price over the amounts assigned to the identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. 82 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Goodwill At December 31, 2012, the Company had $5.5 billion of goodwill. The Company tests goodwill for impairment annually at October 1, or more frequently as circumstances dictate. The first step in assessing whether an impairment of goodwill is necessary is an optional qualitative assessment to determine the likelihood of whether the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount. If the Company concludes that fair value of the reporting unit more than likely exceeds the related carrying amount, then goodwill is not impaired and further testing is not necessary. If the qualitative assessment is not performed or indicates fair value of the reporting unit may be less than its carrying amount, the Company will compare the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to which goodwill is assigned to the carrying amount of the associated net assets, including goodwill, and determine whether an impairment is necessary. Because quoted market prices for the Company reporting units are not available, management must apply judgment in determining the estimated fair value of reporting units for purposes of performing goodwill impairment tests, when such tests are necessary. Management uses all available information to make these fair-value estimates, including the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates commensurate with the risks associated with the assets and observed for the oil and gas exploration and production reporting unit, and market multiples of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) for the gathering and processing and transportation reporting units. In estimating the fair value of its oil and gas exploration and production reporting unit, the Company assumes production profiles utilized in its estimation of reserves that are disclosed in the Company supplemental oil and gas disclosures, market prices based on the forward price curve for oil and gas at the test date (adjusted for location and quality differentials), capital and operating costs consistent with pricing and expected inflation rates, and discount rates that management believes a market participant would utilize based upon the risks inherent in Anadarko operations. For the Company other gathering and processing, WES gathering and processing, and transportation reporting units, the Company estimates fair value by applying an estimated multiple to projected EBITDA. The Company considered observable transactions in the market and trading multiples for peers in determining an appropriate multiple to apply against the Company projected EBITDA for these reporting units. A lower fair-value estimate in the future for any of these reporting units could result in impairment of goodwill. Factors that could trigger a lower fair-value estimate include sustained price declines, cost increases, regulatory or political environment changes, and other changes in market conditions such as decreased prices in market-based transactions for similar assets, as well as difficulty or potential delays in obtaining drilling permits or other unanticipated events. Environmental Obligations and Other Contingencies Management makes judgments and estimates when it establishes reserves for environmental remediation, litigation, and other contingent matters. Provisions for such matters are charged to expense when it is probable that a liability is incurred and reasonable estimates of the liability can be made. Estimates of environmental liabilities are based on a variety of matters, including, but not limited to, the stage of investigation, the stage of the remedial design, evaluation of existing remediation technologies, and presently enacted laws and regulations. In future periods, a number of factors could significantly change the Company estimate of environmental-remediation costs, such as changes in laws and regulations, changes in the interpretation or administration of laws and regulations, revisions to the remedial design, unanticipated construction problems, identification of additional areas or volumes of contaminated soil and groundwater, and changes in costs of labor, equipment, and technology. Consequently, it is not possible for management to reliably estimate the amount and timing of all future expenditures related to environmental or other contingent matters and actual costs may vary significantly from the Company estimates. The Company in-house legal counsel and environmental personnel regularly assess these contingent liabilities and, in certain circumstances, consult with third-party legal counsel or consultants to assist in forming the Company conclusion. 83 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Impairment of Long-Lived Assets A long-lived asset other than unproved oil and gas property is evaluated for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying value may be greater than its future net undiscounted cash flows. Impairment, if any, is measured as the excess of an asset carrying amount over its estimated fair value. The Company utilizes a variety of fair-value measurement techniques when market information for the same or similar assets does not exist. Derivative Instruments All derivative instruments, other than those that satisfy specific exceptions, are recorded at fair value. If market quotes are not available to estimate fair value, management best estimate of fair value is based on the quoted market price of derivatives with similar characteristics or determined through industry-standard valuation techniques. The Company derivative instruments are either exchange-traded or transacted in an over-the-counter market. Valuation is determined by reference to readily available public data for similar instruments. Option fair values are measured using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and verified by comparing a sample to market quotes for similar options. Unrealized gains or losses on derivatives are recorded to current earnings. Income Taxes The amount of income taxes recorded by the Company requires interpretations of complex rules and regulations of various tax jurisdictions throughout the world. The Company has recognized deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences, operating losses, and tax-credit carryforwards. The Company routinely assesses the realizability of its deferred tax assets and reduces such assets by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company routinely assesses potential uncertain tax positions and, if required, establishes accruals for such amounts. The accruals for deferred tax assets and liabilities, including deferred state income tax assets and liabilities, are subject to significant judgment by management and are reviewed and adjusted routinely based on changes in facts and circumstances. Although management considers its tax accruals adequate, material changes in these accruals may occur in the future, based on the progress of ongoing tax audits, changes in legislation, and resolution of pending tax matters. Benefit Plan Obligations The Company has contributory and non-contributory defined-benefit pension plans, which include both qualified and supplemental plans. The Company also provides certain health care and life insurance benefits for certain retired employees. Determination of the benefit obligations for the Company defined-benefit pension plans and postretirement benefit plans impacts the recorded amounts for such obligations on the balance sheet and the amount of benefit expense recorded to the income statement. Accounting for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations involves many assumptions, the most significant of which are the discount rate used to measure the present value of plan benefit obligations, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets (for funded pension plans), the rate of future increases in compensation levels of participating employees, and the future level of health care costs (for postretirement plans). Other assumptions involve demographic factors such as retirement age, mortality, and turnover. The Company evaluates and updates its actuarial assumptions at least annually. The Company amortizes prior service costs (credits) on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of employees expected to receive benefits under each plan. Actuarial gains and losses that exceed 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation and the market-related value of assets are amortized over the average remaining service period of participating employees expected to receive benefits under each plan. 84 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Discount rate Accumulated and projected benefit obligations are measured as the present value of future cash payments. The Company discounts those cash payments using a discount rate that reflects the weighted average of market-observed yields for select high-quality (AA-rated) fixed-income securities with cash flows that correspond to the expected amounts and timing of benefit payments. Discount-rate selection for measurements prior to December 31, 2011, was based on a similar cash-flow-matching analysis, although, instead of using a portfolio of select high-quality fixed-income securities to determine the effective settlement rate for a given plan obligation, the Company relied primarily on a published yield curve derived from market-observed yields for a universe of high-quality bonds. Both methods are acceptable and result in a discount-rate assumption that represents an estimate of the interest rate at which the pension and other postretirement benefit obligations could effectively be settled on the measurement date. However, the Company believes a discount rate reflecting yields for high-quality fixed-income securities better corresponds to the Company expectations as to the amount and timing of its benefit payments. The weighted-average discount-rate assumption (weighted by the plan-level benefit obligation) used to measure the Company December 31, 2012 pension benefit obligations was 3.50%, and the weighted-average discount-rate assumption for other postretirement benefit obligations, which are longer in duration, was 4.00%. Expected long-term rate of return The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption was determined using the year-end 2012 pension investment balances by asset class and expected long-term asset allocation. The expected return for each asset class reflects capital-market projections formulated using a forward-looking building-block approach, while also taking into account historical return trends and current market conditions. Equity returns generally reflect long-term expectations of real earnings growth, dividend yield, and inflation. Returns on fixed-income securities are generally developed based on expected inflation, real bond yield, and risk spread (as appropriate), adjusted for the expected effect that changing yields have on the rate of return. Other asset class returns are derived from their relationship to the equity and fixed income markets. Because the assumption reflects the Company expectation of average annualized return over a long time horizon, generally, it is not expected to be significantly revised from year to year, even though actual rates of investment return from year to year often experience significant volatility. To measure the net periodic pension cost for its funded pension plans, Anadarko assumed an average long-term rate of return of 7.0%. Rate of compensation increases The Company rate of compensation increases assumption is based on its long-term plans for compensation increases specific to covered employee groups and expected economic conditions. The assumed rate of salary increases includes the effects of merit increases, promotions, and general labor cost inflation within the oil and gas industry. The benefit obligations at December 31, 2012, reflect assumed rates of long-term compensation increases for active participants that vary by age group, with the resulting weighted-average rate (weighted by the plan-level benefit obligation) of 4.50%. Health care cost trend rate The health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data, the near-term outlook and an assessment of likely long-term trends. An 8.00% annual rate of increase in the per-capita cost of covered health care benefits was assumed for 2013, decreasing gradually to 5.00% in 2018 and beyond. 85 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements
