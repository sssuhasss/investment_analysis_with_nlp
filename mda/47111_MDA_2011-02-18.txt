Item 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW Results for the year ended December 31, 2010 were strong, reflecting our continued focus on our major strategic initiatives to deliver sustainable long-term growth in the evolving marketplace. Net sales and earnings per share increased at rates exceeding our growth targets, even as the economic environment continued to be challenging. Our decision to invest in our business through cost savings initiatives, and our consumer-driven approach to core brand investments contributed to our strong financial performance and improved market share in 2010. Net sales increased 7.0% compared with 2009 driven primarily by volume gains both in the United States and international markets, as we continue to execute in the marketplace. Advertising expense increased over 60% versus 2009, with a continued focus on brand building and go-to-market strategies for the U.S. and key international markets. Net income and earnings per share-diluted also increased as the result of our investment initiatives. We generated strong cash flow from operations and our financial position remains solid. Adjusted Non-GAAP Financial Measures Our Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section includes certain measures of financial performance that are not defined by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ). For each of these non-GAAP financial measures, we are providing below (1) the most directly comparable GAAP measure; (2) a reconciliation of the differences between the non-GAAP measure and the most directly comparable GAAP measure; (3) an explanation of why our management believes these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to investors; and (4) additional purposes for which we use these non-GAAP measures. We believe that the disclosure of these non-GAAP measures provides investors with a better comparison of our year-to-year operating results. We exclude the effects of certain items from Income before Interest and Income Taxes ( EBIT ), Net Income and Income per Share-Diluted-Common Stock ( EPS ) when we evaluate key measures of our performance internally, and in assessing the impact of known trends and uncertainties on our business. We also believe that excluding the effects of these items provides a more balanced view of the underlying dynamics of our business. Adjusted non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impacts of charges or credits recorded during the last six years associated with our business realignment initiatives and impairment charges related to goodwill and certain trademarks.

Favorable price realization increased net sales by over 2%. Our international businesses contributed to sales growth during the year as a result of sales volume gains or, in certain markets, favorable price realization, partially offset by sales volume declines. Overall, sales volume increased for our international business compared with 2009. The favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates increased net sales by about 1%. 2009 compared with 2008 The increase in net sales resulted from list price increases and reduced rates of promotional allowances that resulted in favorable price realization of approximately 10%. These increases were partially offset by sales volume declines of approximately 6% associated with pricing elasticity and the rationalization of certain products and businesses in the United States. Net sales growth was primarily contributed by core brands, particularly Hershey , Reese , Twizzlers and Kit Kat , which benefited from our consumer-driven strategy, including advertising and in-store selling, merchandising and programming. Sales increases in local currency for our international businesses, particularly in Mexico, Canada, and Brazil, were more than offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates which reduced total net sales by approximately 1.0%. The acquisition of Van Houten Singapore increased 2009 net sales by $12.0 million, or 0.2%. Key U.S. Marketplace Metrics For the 52 weeks ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Consumer Takeaway Increase 5.3 % 7.2 % 3.3 % Market Share Increase (Decrease) 0.3 0.1 (0.2 ) Consumer takeaway is provided for channels of distribution accounting for approximately 80% of our U.S. confectionery retail business. These channels of distribution include food, drug, mass merchandisers, including 22 Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., and convenience stores. The change in market share is provided for channels measured by syndicated data which include sales in the food, drug, convenience store and mass merchandiser classes of trade, excluding sales of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Cost of Sales and Gross Margin 2010 compared with 2009 The cost of sales increase of 0.3% was associated with sales volume increases, resulting in higher cost of sales of about 4%. Increased supply chain costs and slightly higher input costs also contributed to the cost of sales increase. These increases were substantially offset by cost decreases resulting from supply chain productivity improvements, a favorable sales mix and lower product obsolescence costs, which reduced cost of sales by a total of approximately 4.5%. Business realignment and impairment charges of $13.7 million were included in cost of sales in 2010 compared with $10.1 million in the prior year. The gross margin improvement of 3.9 percentage points resulted from favorable price realization of about 2 percentage points, supply chain productivity improvements of approximately 2 percentage points and lower product obsolescence costs of approximately 1 percentage point. These increases in gross margin were partially offset by the impact of higher supply chain and input costs which reduced gross margin by approximately 1 percentage point. 2009 compared with 2008 The decrease in cost of sales was caused by volume declines of approximately 6% resulting from price elasticity. Higher input costs resulted in an increase to cost of sales of approximately 4% as higher raw material and pension costs more than offset productivity gains and lower product obsolescence costs. During 2009, a reduction in inventories related to working capital initiatives resulted in a liquidation of applicable last-in, first-out ( LIFO ) inventory quantities carried at lower costs in prior years. This LIFO liquidation resulted in a $12.7 million cost of sales decrease. Lower business realignment charges included in cost of sales in 2009 compared with 2008 also contributed to the cost of sales decrease. Business realignment charges of $10.1 million were included in cost of sales in 2009 compared with $77.8 million in the prior year which had the effect of reducing cost of sales by approximately 2%. Gross margin increased 4.5 percentage points. Favorable price realization and supply chain productivity improved gross margin by approximately 7 percentage points, while higher input costs and pension expense reduced gross margin by approximately 3 percentage points. Lower business realignment costs in 2009 increased gross margin by approximately 1 percentage point. Selling, Marketing and Administrative 2010 compared with 2009 Selling, marketing and administrative expenses increased $217.8 million or 18.0% in 2010. The increase was primarily a result of higher advertising and other marketing expenses which increased a total of $171.1 million, or 41.0% versus 2009. Advertising expense increased 62.2% compared with 2009. An increase in other selling, marketing and administrative expenses was associated with higher selling expenses, increased legal costs and higher administrative expenses for our international businesses, including the impact of unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates. These increases were offset somewhat by lower costs related to the consideration of potential acquisitions and divestitures in 2010. Business realignment charges of $1.5 million were included in selling, marketing and administrative expenses in 2010 compared with $6.1 million in 2009. 2009 compared with 2008 Selling, marketing and administrative expenses increased primarily due to higher advertising expense, and increases in administrative and selling costs, principally associated with higher pension and incentive 23 compensation expenses. An increase in advertising expense of approximately 50% was slightly offset by lower consumer promotions. Costs associated with the evaluation of potential acquisitions and divestitures increased selling, marketing and administrative expenses by approximately $11.0 million in 2009 compared with 2008. Business realignment and impairment charges of $6.1 million were included in selling, marketing and administrative expenses in 2009 compared with $8.1 million in 2008. Business Realignment and Impairment Charges In June 2010, we announced Project Next Century (the Next Century program ) as part of our ongoing efforts to create an advantaged supply chain and competitive cost structure. As part of the program, production will transition from the Company century-old facility at 19 East Chocolate Avenue in Hershey, Pennsylvania, to a planned expansion of the West Hershey facility, which was built in 1992. Production from the 19 East Chocolate Avenue plant, as well as a portion of the workforce, will be relocated to the West Hershey facility. This change is expected to result in the reduction of approximately 500 to 600 jobs at the two facilities as investments in technology and automation result in enhanced efficiency. We estimate that the Next Century program will incur pre-tax charges and non-recurring project implementation costs of $140 million to $170 million over three years. This estimate includes $120 million to $150 million in pre-tax business realignment and impairment charges and approximately $20 million in project implementation and start-up costs. During the second quarter of 2010 we completed an impairment evaluation of goodwill and other intangible assets associated with Godrej Hershey Ltd. Based on this evaluation, we recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $44.7 million, including a reduction to reflect the share of the charge associated with the noncontrolling interests. In February 2007, we announced a comprehensive, three-year supply chain transformation program (the global supply chain transformation program or GSCT ). In December 2007, we initiated a business realignment program associated with our business in Brazil. In December 2008, we approved a modest expansion in the scope of the global supply chain transformation program to include the closure of two subscale manufacturing facilities of Artisan Confections Company, a wholly-owned subsidiary. We refer to these programs as the 2007 business realignment initiatives. Total pre-tax charges and non-recurring project implementation costs were $629.1 million for the GSCT. The GSCT was complete as of December 31, 2009. Total costs of $99.1 million were recorded during 2009, costs of $130.0 million were recorded in 2008 and costs of $400.0 million were recorded in 2007 for this program. In addition, the manufacturing facilities in Naugatuck, Connecticut and Smiths Falls, Ontario have been closed and are being held for sale. The carrying value of these manufacturing facilities was $10.4 million as of December 31, 2010. Actual proceeds from the sale of these facilities could differ from expected proceeds which could cause additional charges or credits in 2011 or subsequent years. In an effort to improve the performance of our business in Brazil, in January 2008 Hershey do Brasil entered into a cooperative agreement with Pandurata Alimentos LTDA (now Pandurata Netherlands B.V.) ( Bauducco ), a leading manufacturer of baked goods in Brazil whose primary brand is Bauducco. Business realignment and impairment charges of $4.9 million were recorded in 2008. 24 Charges (credits) associated with business realignment initiatives and impairment recorded during 2010, 2009 and 2008 were as follows: For the years ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 In thousands of dollars Cost of sales Next Century program $ 13,644 $ $ Global supply chain transformation program 10,136 77,767 Total cost of sales 13,644 10,136 77,767 Selling, marketing and administrative Next Century program 1,493 Global supply chain transformation program 6,120 8,102 Total selling, marketing and administrative 1,493 6,120 8,102 Business realignment and impairment charges, net Next Century program: Fixed asset impairment and plant closure expenses 5,516 Employee separation costs 33,225 2007 business realignment initiatives: Global supply chain transformation program: Net gain on sale of fixed assets (3,418 ) (4,882 ) Plant closure expense 22,157 23,415 Employee separation costs 2,474 11,469 Pension settlement loss 60,431 12,501 Contract termination costs 1,231 1,637 Brazilian business realignment: Employee separation costs 1,581 Fixed asset impairment charges 754 Contract termination and other exit costs 2,587 2008 impairment of trademarks 45,739 Godrej Hershey Ltd. goodwill impairment 44,692 Total business realignment and impairment charges, net 83,433 82,875 94,801 Total net charges associated with business realignment initiatives and impairment $ 98,570 $ 99,131 $ 180,670 Next Century Program The charge of $13.6 million recorded in cost of sales during 2010 related primarily to accelerated depreciation of fixed assets over a reduced estimated remaining useful life associated with the Next Century program. A charge of $1.5 million was recorded in selling, marketing and administrative expenses during 2010 for project administration. Fixed asset impairment charges of $5.5 million were recorded during 2010. In determining the costs related to fixed asset impairments, fair value was estimated based on the expected sales proceeds. Employee separation costs of $33.2 million during 2010 were related to expected voluntary and involuntary terminations at the two manufacturing facilities. Godrej Hershey Ltd. Goodwill Impairment As a result of recent operating performance that was below expectations, we completed an impairment evaluation of goodwill and other intangible assets of Godrej Hershey Ltd. during the second quarter of 2010. While Godrej Hershey Ltd. has achieved growth, it has been less than initial expectations due to slower realization of development plans and changes in input costs, as well as the macroeconomic environment which delayed distribution expansion and the implementation of new price points. As a result of reduced expectations 25 for future cash flows from lower than expected profitability, we determined that the carrying amount of Godrej Hershey Ltd. exceeded its fair value. As a result, we recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $44.7 million to reduce the carrying value of Godrej Hershey Ltd. to its fair value, including a reduction to reflect the share of the charge associated with the noncontrolling interests. There was no tax benefit associated with this charge. For more information on our accounting policies for goodwill and other intangible assets see pages 47 and 48. Global Supply Chain Transformation Program The charge of $10.1 million recorded in cost of sales during 2009 related to start-up costs and the accelerated depreciation of fixed assets over the estimated remaining useful life. The $6.1 million recorded in selling, marketing and administrative expenses was associated with project administration. The $3.4 million net gain on sale of fixed assets resulted from higher proceeds received from the sale of equipment. The $22.2 million of plant closure expenses for 2009 pertained to the preparation of plants for sale and equipment removal costs. The global supply chain transformation program had identified six manufacturing facilities which would be closed. As of December 31, 2009, manufacturing facilities located in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia; Oakdale, California; and Montreal, Quebec had been closed and sold. The facilities located in Naugatuck, Connecticut; Reading, Pennsylvania; and Smiths Falls, Ontario had been closed and were being held for sale. The global supply chain transformation program employee separation costs were primarily related to involuntary terminations at the manufacturing facilities of Artisan Confections Company which have been closed. The higher pension settlement loss in 2009 compared to 2008 resulted from an increase in actuarial losses associated with the significant decline in the fair value of pension assets in 2008, along with the increased level of lump sum withdrawals from a defined benefit pension plan related to employee departures. The 2008 charge of $77.8 million recorded in cost of sales related primarily to the accelerated depreciation of fixed assets over a reduced estimated remaining useful life and start-up costs. The $8.1 million recorded in selling, marketing and administrative expenses was associated with project administration. The $4.9 million of gains on sale of fixed assets resulted from the receipt of proceeds in excess of the carrying value primarily from the sale of a warehousing and distribution facility. The $23.4 million of plant closure expenses for 2008 resulted from the preparation of plants for sale and production line removal costs. Employee separation costs were related to involuntary terminations at the North American manufacturing facilities which were being closed. Brazilian Business Realignment The 2008 Brazilian business realignment charges were related to involuntary terminations and costs associated with office consolidation related to the cooperative agreement with Bauducco. 2008 Impairment of Trademarks As a result of our annual impairment tests of intangible assets with useful lives determined to be indefinite, we recorded total impairment charges of $45.7 million in December 2008. We determined that the carrying amounts of certain trademarks, primarily the Mauna Loa brand, exceeded their estimated fair value due to reduced expectations for future sales and cash flows compared with the valuations at the acquisition dates. For more information, refer to pages 47 and 48. Liabilities Associated with Business Realignment Initiatives As of December 31, 2010, the liability balance relating to the Next Century program was $32.9 million primarily for estimated employee separation costs which were recorded in 2010 and will be paid principally in 2012 and 2013 as production transitions to the expanded West Hershey facility. During 2010, we made payments against the liabilities recorded for the Next Century program of $0.3 million related to project administration and employee separation costs. We made payments of $7.8 million in 2010, $28.5 million in 2009 and $46.9 million in 2008 against the liabilities recorded for the global supply chain transformation program, principally related to employee separation and project administration costs. 26 Income Before Interest and Income Taxes and EBIT Margin 2010 compared with 2009 EBIT increased in 2010 compared with 2009 as a result of higher gross profit, partially offset by increased marketing and selling investments and increases in other administrative expenses. Net pre-tax business realignment and impairment charges of $98.6 million were recorded in 2010 compared with $99.1 million recorded in 2009. EBIT margin increased from 14.4% in 2009 to 16.0% in 2010. The increase in EBIT margin was the result of the higher gross margin, partially offset by increased brand investment and higher selling, marketing and administrative expense as a percentage of sales. Business realignment and impairment charges reduced EBIT margin by 1.7% in 2010 and 1.8% in 2009. 2009 compared with 2008 EBIT increased in 2009 compared with 2008 principally as a result of higher gross profit and reduced business realignment charges, partially offset by increased selling, marketing and administrative expenses. Net pre-tax business realignment charges of $99.1 million were recorded in 2009 compared with $180.7 million recorded in 2008, a decrease of $81.6 million. EBIT margin increased from 11.5% for 2008 to 14.4% for 2009. The increase in EBIT margin was the result of the higher gross margin, partially offset by higher selling, marketing and administrative expense as a percentage of sales. Net business realignment and impairment charges reduced EBIT margin by 1.8 percentage points in 2009 and by 3.5 percentage points in 2008, resulting in an improvement in EBIT margin of 1.7 percentage points from 2008 to 2009. Interest Expense, Net 2010 compared with 2009 Net interest expense in 2010 was higher than in 2009 as a result of interest expense of $5.9 million recorded for the tender offer and repurchase of $57.5 million of 6.95% Notes in December 2010. 2009 compared with 2008 Net interest expense was lower in 2009 than in 2008 primarily due to lower interest rates and lower average debt balances. Income Taxes and Effective Tax Rate 2010 compared with 2009 Our effective income tax rate was 37.0% for 2010 compared with 35.0% for 2009. The effective income tax rate was increased by 1.8 percentage points as a result of the effective tax rate associated with business realignment and impairment charges recorded in 2010. The effective income tax rate related to business realignment and impairment charges recorded in 2009 reduced the rate by 0.5 percentage points. 2009 compared with 2008 Our effective income tax rate was 35.0% for 2009 and was decreased by 0.5 percentage points as a result of the effective tax rate associated with business realignment charges recorded during the year. Our effective income tax rate in 2008 was 36.7% and was increased by 0.7 percentage points as a result of the effective tax rate associated with business realignment and impairment charges recorded during 2008. Our effective income tax rate was also lower in 2009 due to changes in the mix of income among various tax jurisdictions as compared with 2008. 27 Net Income and Net Income Per Share 2010 compared with 2009 Earnings per share-diluted increased $0.31, or 16.3% in 2010 compared with 2009. Net income in 2010 was reduced by $77.9 million, or $0.34 per share-diluted, and was reduced by $60.8 million, or $0.27 per share-diluted in 2009 as a result of business realignment and impairment charges. Excluding the impact of business realignment and impairment charges, earnings per share-diluted increased $0.38 or 17.5% in 2010 as compared with 2009. 2009 compared with 2008 Net income in 2009 was reduced by $60.8 million, or $0.27 per share-diluted, and was reduced by $119.1 million, or $0.52 per share-diluted, in 2008 as a result of net business realignment and impairment charges. After considering the impact of business realignment and impairment charges in each period, earnings per share-diluted in 2009 increased $0.29, or 15.4%, as compared with 2008. 28 FINANCIAL CONDITION Our financial condition remained strong during 2010 reflecting solid cash flow from operations. Acquisitions and Divestitures In March 2009, we completed the acquisition of the Van Houten Singapore consumer business. The acquisition from Barry Callebaut, AG provides us with an exclusive license of the Van Houten brand name and related trademarks in Asia and the Middle East for the retail and duty free distribution channels. The purchase price for the acquisition of Van Houten Singapore and the licensing agreement was approximately $15.2 million. Total liabilities assumed were $3.6 million. In January 2008, our Brazilian subsidiary, Hershey do Brasil, entered into a cooperative agreement with Bauducco. In the first quarter of 2008, we received approximately $2.0 million in cash and recorded an other intangible asset of $13.7 million associated with the cooperative agreement with Bauducco in exchange for our conveying to Bauducco a 49% interest in Hershey do Brasil. We maintain a 51% controlling interest in Hershey do Brasil. We included results subsequent to the dates of acquisition in the consolidated financial statements. Had the results of the acquisitions been included in the consolidated financial statements for each of the periods presented, the effect would not have been material. Assets A summary of our assets is as follows: December 31, 2010 2009 In thousands of dollars Current assets $ 2,005,217 $ 1,385,434 Property, plant and equipment, net 1,437,702 1,404,767 Goodwill and other intangibles 647,214 697,100 Deferred income taxes 21,387 4,353 Other assets 161,212 183,377 Total assets $ 4,272,732 $ 3,675,031 The change in current assets from 2009 to 2010 was primarily due to the following: Higher cash and cash equivalents in 2010 due to continued strong cash flow, positive net working capital and the issuance of $350 million of 4.125% Notes in December 2010; A decrease in accounts receivable primarily resulting from the timing of sales and cash collections in December 2010 as compared with December 2009; An increase in inventories primarily related to an increase in finished goods inventories associated with seasonal sales patterns, partially offset by lower raw material inventories due to the timing of deliveries to meet manufacturing requirements; An increase in deferred income taxes principally related to the effect of hedging transactions; and A decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets primarily reflecting assets associated with certain commodity and treasury hedging transactions. Property, plant and equipment was higher in 2010, reflecting an increase in construction in progress of $32.3 million not paid as of December 31, 2010 and capital additions of $179.5 million which more than offset depreciation expense of $169.7 million. Accelerated depreciation of fixed assets of $12.4 million at a manufacturing facility which will be closed as well as certain asset retirements resulted primarily from the Next Century program. 29 Goodwill and other intangibles decreased as a result of the goodwill impairment charge recorded to reduce the carrying value of Godrej Hershey Ltd. to its fair value. Other assets decreased primarily due to the change in the funded status of our pension plans. Liabilities A summary of our liabilities is as follows: December 31, 2010 2009 In thousands of dollars Current liabilities $ 1,298,845 $ 910,628 Long-term debt 1,541,825 1,502,730 Other long-term liabilities 494,461 501,334 Total liabilities $ 3,335,131 $ 2,914,692 Changes in current liabilities from 2009 to 2010 were primarily the result of the following: Higher accounts payable reflecting the timing of inventory deliveries to support manufacturing requirements, higher capital expenditures associated with the Next Century program and increased spending for advertising; Higher accrued liabilities primarily associated with the Next Century program as well as advertising and promotions; and An increase in the current portion of long-term debt reflecting the reclassification of $250 million of 5.3% Notes maturing in September 2011 to current liabilities. An increase in long-term debt reflecting the issuance of $350 million of 4.125% Notes due in December 2020, partially offset by the reclassification of $250 million of Notes described above as well as the repurchase of $57.5 million of 6.95% Notes due in 2012 as part of a cash tender offer. Additional information on the cash tender offer and debt issuance is available in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section.

In addition, the Milton Hershey School Trust currently has three representatives who are members of the Board of Directors of the Company, one of whom is the Chairman of the Board. These representatives, from time to time in performing their responsibilities on the Company Board, may exercise influence with regard to the ongoing business decisions of our Board of Directors or management. The Trust has indicated that, in its role as controlling stockholder of the Company, it intends to retain its controlling interest in The Hershey Company and the Company Board, and not the Trust Board, is solely responsible and accountable for the Company management and performance. The Milton Hershey School Trust decided to explore a sale of The Hershey Company in June 2002, but subsequently decided to terminate the sale process in September 2002. After terminating the sale process, the Trustee of the Milton Hershey School Trust advised the Pennsylvania Office of Attorney General in September 2002 that it would not agree to any sale of its controlling interest in The Hershey Company without approval of 30 the court having jurisdiction over the Milton Hershey School Trust following advance notice to the Office of Attorney General. Subsequently, Pennsylvania enacted legislation that requires that the Office of Attorney General be provided advance notice of any transaction that would result in the Milton Hershey School Trust no longer having voting control of the Company. The law provides specific statutory authority for the Attorney General to intercede and petition the Court having jurisdiction over the Milton Hershey School Trust to stop such a transaction if the Attorney General can prove that the transaction is unnecessary for the future economic viability of the Company and is inconsistent with investment and management considerations under fiduciary obligations. This legislation could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock and thereby delay or prevent a change in control of the Company. In December 2000, our Board of Directors unanimously adopted a Stockholder Protection Rights Agreement and declared a dividend of 1 right ( Right ) for each outstanding share of Common Stock and Class B Stock payable to stockholders of record at the close of business on December 26, 2000. The Rights at no time had voting power or received dividends. The issuance of the Rights had no dilutive effect, did not affect reported earnings per share and was not taxable. The Rights did not change the manner in which our Common Stock was traded. The Rights expired on December 15, 2010. Noncontrolling Interests in Subsidiaries As of January 1, 2009, the Company adopted a Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) accounting standard that establishes new accounting and reporting requirements for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary (formerly known as minority interest) and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary and requires the noncontrolling interest to be reported as a component of equity. In addition, changes in a parent ownership interest while the parent retains its controlling interest will be accounted for as equity transactions, and any retained noncontrolling equity investment upon the deconsolidation of a subsidiary will be measured initially at fair value. In May 2007, we entered into an agreement with Godrej Beverages and Foods, Ltd. to manufacture and distribute confectionery products, snacks and beverages across India. Under the agreement, we own a 51% controlling interest in Godrej Hershey Ltd. In January 2009, the Company contributed cash of approximately $8.7 million to Godrej Hershey Ltd. and owners of the noncontrolling interests in Godrej Hershey Ltd. contributed approximately $7.3 million. In June 2010, the Company and the noncontrolling interests executed a rights agreement with Godrej Hershey Ltd. in the form of unsecured compulsorily and fully convertible debentures. The Company contributed cash of approximately $11.1 million and the noncontrolling interests contributed $9.3 million associated with the rights agreement. The ownership interest percentages in Godrej Hershey Ltd. did not change significantly as a result of the contributions in 2009 and 2010. The noncontrolling interests in Godrej Hershey Ltd. are included in the equity section of the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We also own a 51% controlling interest in Hershey do Brasil under the cooperative agreement with Bauducco. In September 2010, the Company contributed cash of approximately $1.0 million to Hershey do Brasil and Bauducco contributed approximately $0.9 million. The noncontrolling interest in Hershey do Brasil is included in the equity section of the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The decrease in noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries from $39.9 million as of December 31, 2009 to $35.3 million as of December 31, 2010 reflected the noncontrolling interests share of losses of these entities, including the noncontrolling interests share of the goodwill impairment charge recorded for Godrej Hershey Ltd. These decreases were partially offset by the noncontrolling interests contributions in Godrej Hershey Ltd. and Hershey do Brasil described above as well as the impact of foreign currency translation adjustments. The share of losses pertaining to the noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries was $8.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, $4.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 and $6.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. This was reflected in selling, marketing and administrative expenses. 31 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Our principal source of liquidity is operating cash flows. Our net income and, consequently, our cash provided from operations are impacted by: sales volume, seasonal sales patterns, timing of new product introductions, profit margins and price changes. Sales are typically higher during the third and fourth quarters of the year due to seasonal and holiday-related sales patterns. Generally, working capital needs peak during the summer months. We meet these needs primarily by issuing commercial paper. Cash Flows from Operating Activities Our cash flows provided from (used by) operating activities were as follows: For the years ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 In thousands of dollars Net income $ 509,799 $ 435,994 $ 311,405 Depreciation and amortization 197,116 182,411 249,491 Stock-based compensation and excess tax benefits 30,670 30,472 22,196 Deferred income taxes (18,654 ) (40,578 ) (17,125 ) Business realignment and impairment charges, net of tax 77,935 60,823 119,117 Contributions to pension plans (6,073 ) (54,457 ) (32,759 ) Working capital 96,853 157,812 65,791 Changes in other assets and liabilities 13,777 293,272 (198,555 ) Net cash provided from operating activities $ 901,423 $ 1,065,749 $ 519,561 Over the past three years, total cash provided from operating activities was approximately $2.5 billion. Depreciation and amortization expenses increased in 2010, as compared with 2009, principally as the result of higher accelerated depreciation charges related to the Next Century program compared with accelerated depreciation charges related to the global supply chain transformation program recorded in 2009. Depreciation and amortization expenses decreased in 2009 in comparison with 2008 due to lower accelerated depreciation charges related to the GSCT program in 2009 than in 2008. Accelerated depreciation recorded in 2010 was approximately $12.4 million compared with approximately $4.2 million recorded in 2009 and $60.6 million recorded in 2008. Depreciation and amortization expenses represent non-cash items that impacted net income and are reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows to reconcile cash flows from operating activities. Cash used by deferred income taxes was lower in 2010 than in 2009 primarily as a result of the impact of deferred taxes associated with charges recorded in 2010 for the Next Century program, as compared with the tax impact associated with hedging transactions in 2009. Cash used by deferred income taxes in 2008 primarily reflected the impact of deferred taxes associated with business realignment and impairment charges recorded during 2008. We contributed $93.3 million to our pension plans over the past three years to improve the plans funded status and to pay benefits under the non-funded plans. As of December 31, 2010, our pension benefit obligations exceeded the fair value of our pension plan assets by $49.4 million. Over the three-year period, cash provided from working capital tended to fluctuate due to the timing of sales and cash collections during December of each year and working capital management practices, including initiatives implemented to reduce working capital. Changes in cash provided by accounts payable over the three-year period principally related to the timing of inventory deliveries to meet manufacturing requirements and, in 2010, also reflected increases in accounts payable associated with the timing of expenditures for advertising. Changes in cash provided from inventories in 2009 was primarily associated with initiatives to improve sales forecasting and inventory planning. 32 During the three-year period, cash provided from or used by changes in other assets and liabilities reflected the effect of hedging transactions and the impact of business realignment initiatives, along with the related tax effects. The decrease in cash provided by changes in other assets and liabilities from 2009 to 2010 was primarily associated with the effect of hedging transactions of $193.8 million and the effect of changes in deferred and accrued income taxes of $94.3 million, partially offset by a decrease in cash used by business realignment initiatives of $88.8 million. The increase in cash provided by changes in other assets and liabilities from 2008 to 2009 primarily reflected the effect of hedging transactions of $223.9 million, a decrease in the use of cash for business realignment initiatives of $63.3 million and tax impacts of $150.5 million. The increase in interest paid in 2010 versus 2009 was primarily attributable to the $5.9 million premium paid for the repurchase of debt under a cash tender offer. Additional information on the cash tender offer is provided under Cash Flows from Financing Activities. The increase in income taxes paid in 2010 compared with 2009 primarily reflected the impact of higher taxable income for 2010. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Our cash flows provided from (used by) investing activities were as follows: For the years ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 In thousands of dollars Capital additions $ (179,538 ) $ (126,324 ) $ (262,643 ) Capitalized software additions (21,949 ) (19,146 ) (20,336 ) Proceeds from sales of property, plant and equipment 2,201 10,364 82,815 Business acquisition (15,220 ) Proceeds from divestitures 1,960 Net cash used by investing activities $ (199,286 ) $ (150,326 ) $ (198,204 ) Capital additions in 2010 associated with our Next Century program were approximately $34.0 million. Capital additions included $46.3 million in 2009 and $162.6 million in 2008 related to the global supply chain transformation program. Other capital additions were primarily related to modernization of existing facilities and purchases of manufacturing equipment for new products. Capitalized software additions were primarily for ongoing enhancement of our information systems. Over the past three years, total proceeds from the sale of manufacturing facilities and related equipment under the global supply chain transformation program were approximately $95.4 million. We anticipate total capital expenditures, including capitalized software, of approximately $350 million to $370 million in 2011, of which approximately $180 million to $190 million is associated with our Next Century program. In March 2009, our Company completed the acquisition of the Van Houten Singapore consumer business. The purchase price for the acquisition of Van Houten Singapore and a licensing agreement was approximately $15.2 million. In January 2008, our Brazilian subsidiary, Hershey do Brasil, entered into a cooperative agreement with Bauducco. We received approximately $2.0 million in cash associated with the cooperative agreement in exchange for a 49% interest in Hershey do Brasil. 33 Cash Flows from Financing Activities Our cash flows provided from (used by) financing activities were as follows: For the years ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 In thousands of dollars Net change in short-term borrowings $ 1,156 $ (458,047 ) $ (371,393 ) Long-term borrowings 348,208 247,845 Repayment of long-term debt (71,548 ) (8,252 ) (4,977 ) Cash dividends paid (283,434 ) (263,403 ) (262,949 ) Exercise of stock options and excess tax benefits 93,418 32,773 38,383 Contributions from noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries 10,199 7,322 Repurchase of Common Stock (169,099 ) (9,314 ) (60,361 ) Net cash used by financing activities $ (71,100 ) $ (698,921 ) $ (413,452 ) We use short-term borrowings (commercial paper and bank borrowings) to fund seasonal working capital requirements and ongoing business needs. As a result of long-term borrowings and strong cash flow from operating activities over the last three years, we had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2010 and 2009. Additional information on short-term borrowings is included under Borrowing Arrangements below. In December 2010, we issued $350 million of 4.125% Notes due in 2020. The Notes were issued under a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 filed in May 2009 described under Registration Statements below. In December 2010, we paid $63.4 million to repurchase $57.5 million of our 6.95% Notes due in 2012 as part of a cash tender offer. As a result of the repurchase, we recorded interest expense of $5.9 million, which reflected the premium paid on the tender offer. We used a portion of the proceeds from the $350 million of 4.125% Notes issued in December 2010 to fund the repurchase. In March 2008, we issued $250 million of 5.0% Notes due in 2013. The Notes were issued under a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 filed in May 2006 described under Registration Statements below. We paid cash dividends of $213.0 million on our Common Stock and $70.4 million on our Class B Stock in 2010. Cash used for the repurchase of Common Stock was partially offset by cash received from the exercise of stock options. Repurchases and Issuances of Common Stock For the years ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 In thousands Shares Dollars Shares Dollars Shares Dollars Shares repurchased under pre-approved share repurchase programs: Open market repurchases $ $ $ Shares repurchased to replace Treasury Stock issued for stock options and employee benefits 3,932 169,099 252 9,314 1,610 60,361 Total share repurchases 3,932 169,099 252 9,314 1,610 60,361 Shares issued for stock options and employee benefits (2,964 ) (96,627 ) (1,215 ) (39,616 ) (1,595 ) (51,992 ) Net change 968 $ 72,472 (963 ) $ (30,302 ) 15 $ 8,369 34 We intend to repurchase shares of Common Stock in order to replace Treasury Stock shares issued for exercised stock options. The value of shares purchased in a given period will vary based on stock options exercised over time and market conditions. In December 2006, our Board of Directors approved a $250 million share repurchase program. As of December 31, 2010, $100.0 million remained available for repurchases of Common Stock under this program. Cumulative Share Repurchases and Issuances A summary of cumulative share repurchases and issuances is as follows: Shares Dollars In thousands Shares repurchased under authorized programs: Open market repurchases 57,436 $ 1,984,431 Repurchases from the Milton Hershey School Trust 11,918 245,550 Shares retired (1,056 ) (12,820 ) Total repurchases under authorized programs 68,298 2,217,161 Privately negotiated purchases from the Milton Hershey School Trust 67,282 1,501,373 Shares reissued for stock option obligations, supplemental retirement contributions, and employee stock ownership trust obligations (33,269 ) (898,786 ) Shares repurchased to replace reissued shares 30,561 1,232,353 Total held as Treasury Stock as of December 31, 2010 132,872 $ 4,052,101 Borrowing Arrangements We maintain debt levels we consider prudent based on our cash flow, interest coverage ratio and percentage of debt to capital. We use debt financing to lower our overall cost of capital which increases our return on stockholders equity. In December 2006, we entered into a five-year agreement establishing an unsecured committed revolving credit facility to borrow up to $1.1 billion, with an option to increase borrowings to $1.5 billion with the consent of the lenders. During the fourth quarter of 2007, the lenders approved an extension of this agreement by one year in accordance with our option under the agreement. The five-year agreement will now expire in December 2012. As of December 31, 2010, $1.1 billion was available to borrow under the agreement. The unsecured revolving credit agreement contains certain financial and other covenants, customary representations, warranties, and events of default. As of December 31, 2010, we complied with all of these covenants. We may use these funds for general corporate purposes, including commercial paper backstop and business acquisitions. In addition to the revolving credit facility, we maintain lines of credit with domestic and international commercial banks. As of December 31, 2010, we could borrow up to approximately $77.2 million in various currencies under the lines of credit and as of December 31, 2009, we could borrow up to $68.9 million. Registration Statements In May 2009, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 that registered an indeterminate amount of debt securities. This registration statement was effective immediately upon filing under Securities and Exchange Commission regulations governing well-known seasoned issuers (the WKSI Registration Statement ). This WKSI Registration Statement was filed to replace a May 2006 WKSI Registration Statement which expired in May 2009. 35 In December 2010, we issued $350 million of 4.125% Notes due December 1, 2020. The Notes were issued under the 2009 WKSI Registration Statement. In March 2008, we issued $250 million of 5.0% Notes due April 1, 2013. The Notes were issued under the 2006 WKSI Registration Statement. Proceeds from the debt issuances and any other offerings under the WKSI Registration Statement may be used for general corporate requirements. These may include reducing existing borrowings, financing capital additions, funding contributions to our pension plans, future business acquisitions and working capital requirements. OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS, CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND COMMITMENTS As of December 31, 2010, our contractual cash obligations by year were as follows: Payments Due by Year In thousands of dollars Contractual Obligations 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Thereafter Total Unconditional Purchase Obligations $ 1,257,100 $ 565,300 $ 201,700 $ 5,600 $ $ $ 2,029,700 Non-cancelable Operating Leases 14,888 12,771 7,551 6,040 5,559 8,771 55,580 Long-term Debt 261,392 93,651 250,071 71 250,071 947,961 1,803,217 Total Obligations $ 1,533,380 $ 671,722 $ 459,322 $ 11,711 $ 255,630 $ 956,732 $ 3,888,497 In entering into contractual obligations, we have assumed the risk that might arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts. We mitigate this risk by performing financial assessments prior to contract execution, conducting periodic evaluations of counterparty performance and maintaining a diverse portfolio of qualified counterparties. Our risk is limited to replacing the contracts at prevailing market rates. We do not expect any significant losses resulting from counterparty defaults. Purchase Obligations We enter into certain obligations for the purchase of raw materials. These obligations were primarily in the form of forward contracts for the purchase of raw materials from third-party brokers and dealers. These contracts minimize the effect of future price fluctuations by fixing the price of part or all of these purchase obligations. Total obligations for each year presented above consists of fixed price contracts for the purchase of commodities and unpriced contracts that were valued using market prices as of December 31, 2010. The cost of commodities associated with the unpriced contracts is variable as market prices change over future periods. We mitigate the variability of these costs to the extent we have entered into commodities futures contracts to hedge our costs for those periods. Increases or decreases in market prices are offset by gains or losses on commodities futures contracts. This applies to the extent that we have hedged the unpriced contracts as of December 31, 2010 and in future periods by entering into commodities futures contracts. Taking delivery of and making payments for the specific commodities for use in the manufacture of finished goods satisfies our obligations under the forward purchase contracts. For each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2010, we satisfied these obligations by taking delivery of and making payment for the specific commodities. Asset Retirement Obligations We have a number of facilities that contain varying amounts of asbestos in certain locations within the facilities. Our asbestos management program is compliant with current applicable regulations. Current regulations 36 require that we handle or dispose of asbestos in a special manner if such facilities undergo major renovations or are demolished. Plans associated with the closure of a manufacturing facility under the Next Century program may require the removal of asbestos. The estimated liability associated with the possible removal of asbestos from the facility is not material and is included in our estimates. With regard to other facilities, we believe we do not have sufficient information to estimate the fair value of any asset retirement obligations related to those facilities. We cannot specify the settlement date or range of potential settlement dates and, therefore, sufficient information is not available to apply an expected present value technique. We expect to maintain the facilities with repairs and maintenance activities that would not involve or require the removal of asbestos. As of December 31, 2010, certain real estate associated with the closure of facilities under the global supply chain transformation program is being held for sale. We are not aware of any significant obligations related to the environmental remediation of these facilities which have not been reflected in our current estimates. Income Tax Obligations We base our deferred income taxes, accrued income taxes and provision for income taxes upon income, statutory tax rates, the legal structure of our Company and interpretation of tax laws. We are regularly audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. From time to time, these audits result in assessments of additional tax. We maintain reserves for such assessments. We adjust the reserves based upon changing facts and circumstances, such as receiving audit assessments or clearing of an item for which a reserve has been established. Assessments of additional tax require cash payments. We are not aware of any significant income tax assessments. The amount of tax obligations is not included in the table of contractual cash obligations by year on page 36 because we are unable to reasonably predict the ultimate amount or timing of settlement of our reserves for income taxes. ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND MARKET RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS We use certain derivative instruments, from time to time, including interest rate swaps, foreign currency forward exchange contracts and options, and commodities futures and options contracts, to manage interest rate, foreign currency exchange rate and commodity market price risk exposures, respectively. We enter into interest rate swap agreements and foreign exchange forward contracts and options for periods consistent with related underlying exposures. These derivative instruments do not constitute positions independent of those exposures. We enter into commodities futures and options contracts for varying periods. These futures and options contracts are intended to be, and are effective as hedges of market price risks associated with anticipated raw material purchases, energy requirements and transportation costs. We do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to any instruments with leverage or prepayment features. In entering into these contracts, we have assumed the risk that might arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts. We mitigate this risk by performing financial assessments prior to contract execution, conducting periodic evaluations of counterparty performance and maintaining a diverse portfolio of qualified counterparties. We do not expect any significant losses from counterparty defaults. Accounting Policies Associated with Derivative Instruments We report the effective portion of the gain or loss on a derivative instrument designated and qualifying as a cash flow hedging instrument as a component of other comprehensive income. We reclassify the effective portion of the gain or loss on these derivative instruments into income in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. The remaining gain or loss on the derivative instrument resulting from hedge ineffectiveness, if any, must be recognized currently in earnings. Fair value hedges pertain to derivative instruments that qualify as a hedge of exposures to changes in the fair value of a firm commitment or assets and liabilities recognized on the balance sheet. For fair value hedges, our policy is to record the gain or loss on the derivative instrument in earnings in the period of change together with the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item. The effect of that accounting is to reflect in earnings the extent to which the hedge is not effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value. 37 As of December 31, 2010, we designated and accounted for all derivative instruments, including foreign exchange forward contracts and options, interest rate swap agreements and commodities futures and options contracts, as cash flow hedges. Additional information regarding accounting policies associated with derivative instruments is contained in Note 6, Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities . The information below summarizes our market risks associated with long-term debt and derivative instruments outstanding as of December 31, 2010. Note 1, Note 6 and Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements provide additional information. Long-Term Debt The table below presents the principal cash flows and related interest rates by maturity date for long-term debt, including the current portion, as of December 31, 2010. We determined the fair value of long-term debt based upon quoted market prices for the same or similar debt issues. Maturity Date 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Thereafter Total Fair Value In thousands of dollars except for rates Long-term Debt $ 261,392 $ 93,651 $ 250,071 $ 71 $ 250,071 $ 947,961 $ 1,803,217 $ 1,968,737 Interest Rate 5.5 % 7.0 % 5.0 % 4.5 % 4.8 % 5.8 % 5.6 % We calculated the interest rates on variable rate obligations using the rates in effect as of December 31, 2010. Interest Rate Swaps In order to minimize financing costs and to manage interest rate exposure, from time to time, we enter into interest rate swap agreements. In March 2009, we entered into forward starting interest rate swap agreements to hedge interest rate exposure related to the anticipated $250 million of term financing expected to be executed during 2011 to repay $250 million of 5.3% Notes maturing in September 2011. The weighted-average fixed rate on the forward starting swap agreements was 3.5%. The fair value of interest rate swap agreements was a net liability of $8.9 million as of December 31, 2010. Our risk related to interest rate swap agreements is limited to the cost of replacing such agreements at prevailing market rates. As of December 31, 2010, the potential net loss associated with interest rate swap agreements resulting from a hypothetical near-term adverse change in interest rates of ten percent was approximately $3.5 million. In December 2010, we terminated forward starting swap agreements which were entered into in August 2010 to hedge the anticipated execution of term financing. The swap agreements were terminated upon the issuance of the 4.125% Notes due December 1, 2020, resulting in cash receipts of $13.5 million. The $13.5 million gain on the swap agreements will be amortized as a reduction to interest expense over the term of the Notes. For more information see Note 6, Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities . Foreign Exchange Forward Contracts and Options We enter into foreign exchange forward contracts and options to hedge transactions denominated in foreign currencies. These transactions are primarily purchase commitments or forecasted purchases of equipment, raw materials and finished goods. We also may hedge payment of forecasted intercompany transactions with our subsidiaries outside of the United States. These contracts reduce currency risk from exchange rate movements. We generally hedge foreign currency price risks for periods from 3 to 24 months. 38 Foreign exchange forward contracts are effective as hedges of identifiable foreign currency commitments. We designate our foreign exchange forward contracts as cash flow hedging derivatives. The fair value of these contracts is classified as either an asset or liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We record gains and losses on these contracts as a component of other comprehensive income and reclassify them into earnings in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. A summary of foreign exchange forward contracts and the corresponding amounts at contracted forward rates is as follows: December 31, 2010 2009 Contract Amount Primary Currencies Contract Amount Primary Currencies In millions of dollars Foreign exchange forward contracts to purchase foreign currencies $ 73.5 Euros Canadian dollars $ 2.7 Euros Swiss francs Foreign exchange forward contracts to sell foreign currencies $ 150.3 Canadian dollars $ 106.3 Canadian dollars We define the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts as the amount of the difference between the contracted and current market foreign currency exchange rates at the end of the period. We estimate the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts on a quarterly basis by obtaining market quotes of spot and forward rates for contracts with similar terms, adjusted where necessary for maturity differences. A summary of the fair value and market risk associated with foreign exchange forward contracts is as follows: December 31, 2010 2009 In millions of dollars Fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts, net asset (liability) $ 2.0 $ (4.8 ) Potential net loss associated with foreign exchange forward contracts resulting from a hypothetical near-term adverse change in market rates of ten percent $ 24.7 $ 10.9 Our risk related to foreign exchange forward contracts is limited to the cost of replacing the contracts at prevailing market rates. Commodities Price Risk Management and Futures Contracts Our most significant raw material requirements include cocoa products, sugar, dairy products, peanuts and almonds. The cost of cocoa products and prices for related futures contracts historically have been subject to wide fluctuations attributable to a variety of factors. These factors include: Commodity market fluctuations; Currency exchange rates; Imbalances between supply and demand; The effect of weather on crop yield; Speculative influences; Trade agreements among producing and consuming nations; Political unrest in producing countries; and Changes in governmental agricultural programs and energy policies. 39 We use futures and options contracts in combination with forward purchasing of cocoa products, sugar, corn sweeteners, natural gas, fuel oil and certain dairy products primarily to provide favorable pricing opportunities and flexibility in sourcing our raw material and energy requirements. We attempt to minimize the effect of future price fluctuations related to the purchase of raw materials by using forward purchasing to cover future manufacturing requirements generally for 3 to 24 months. However, the dairy futures markets are not as developed as many of the other commodities futures markets and, therefore, it is difficult to hedge our costs for dairy products by entering into futures contracts or other derivative instruments to extend coverage for long periods of time. We use fuel oil futures contracts to minimize price fluctuations associated with our transportation costs. Our commodity procurement practices are intended to reduce the risk of future price increases and provide visibility to future costs, but also may potentially limit our ability to benefit from possible price decreases. During 2010, the average cocoa futures contract prices increased slightly compared with 2009, and traded in a range between $1.26 and $1.53 per pound, based on the IntercontinentalExchange futures contract. Cocoa futures prices during 2010 traded at prices which were near 30-year highs. The sustained high cocoa futures prices reflected concern over long-term growth capabilities in the Ivory Coast and continued interest in commodities as an investment by various hedge funds. During 2010, prices for dairy products started the year slightly above $.14 per pound and increased to approximately $.18 per pound on a class II fluid milk basis. Prices are stronger in the face of strong demand for dairy products and tight supply of butterfat. Our costs for certain dairy products may not necessarily reflect market price fluctuations because of our forward purchasing practices. The price of sugar is subject to price supports under U.S. farm legislation. This legislation establishes import quotas and duties to support the price of sugar. As a result, sugar prices paid by users in the U.S. are currently substantially higher than prices on the world sugar market. In 2010, sugar supplies in the U.S. were negatively impacted by government import restrictions, strong demand and high world market prices. As a result, refined sugar prices increased significantly, trading in a range from $.48 to $.66 per pound. Our costs for sugar will not necessarily reflect market price fluctuations primarily because of our forward purchasing and hedging practices. We make or receive cash transfers to or from commodity futures brokers on a daily basis reflecting changes in the value of futures contracts on the IntercontinentalExchange or various other exchanges. These changes in value represent unrealized gains and losses. We report these cash transfers as a component of other comprehensive income. The cash transfers offset higher or lower cash requirements for the payment of future invoice prices of raw materials, energy requirements and transportation costs. Futures held in excess of the amount required to fix the price of unpriced physical forward contracts are effective as hedges of anticipated purchases. 40 Commodity Position Sensitivity Analysis The following sensitivity analysis reflects our market risk to a hypothetical adverse market price movement of 10%, based on our net commodity positions at four dates spaced equally throughout the year. Our net commodity positions consist of the amount of futures contracts we hold over or under the amount of futures contracts we need to price unpriced physical forward contracts for the same commodities. Inventories, priced forward contracts and estimated anticipated purchases not yet under contract were not included in the sensitivity analysis calculations. We define a loss, for purposes of determining market risk, as the potential decrease in fair value or the opportunity cost resulting from the hypothetical adverse price movement. The fair values of net commodity positions reflect quoted market prices or estimated future prices, including estimated carrying costs corresponding with the future delivery period. For the years ended December 31, 2010 2009 Fair Value Market Risk (Hypothetical 10% Change) Fair Value Market Risk (Hypothetical 10% Change) In millions of dollars Highest long position $ (386.2 ) $ 38.6 $ (209.0 ) $ 20.9 Lowest long position (594.6 ) 59.5 (513.2 ) 51.3 Average position (long) (489.8 ) 49.0 (363.1 ) 36.3 The decrease in fair values from 2009 to 2010 primarily reflected a decrease in net commodity positions. The negative positions primarily resulted as unpriced physical forward contract futures requirements exceeded the amount of commodities futures that we held at certain points in time during the years. USE OF ESTIMATES AND OTHER CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. In various instances, GAAP requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We believe that our most critical accounting policies and estimates relate to the following: Accounts Receivable Trade Accrued Liabilities Pension and Other Post-Retirement Benefits Plans Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Commodities Futures Contracts Management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. While we base estimates and assumptions on our knowledge of current events and actions we may undertake in the future, actual results may ultimately differ from these estimates and assumptions. We discuss our significant accounting policies in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies . Accounts Receivable Trade In the normal course of business, we extend credit to customers that satisfy pre-defined credit criteria based upon the results of our recurring financial account reviews and our evaluation of the current and projected economic conditions. Our primary concentrations of credit risk are associated with McLane Company, Inc. and Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. McLane Company, Inc. is one of the largest wholesale distributors in the United States to convenience stores, drug stores, wholesale clubs and mass merchandisers. McLane Company, Inc. accounted for 41 approximately 16.1% of our total accounts receivable as of December 31, 2010. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. accounted for approximately 14.5% of our total accounts receivable as of December 31, 2010. As of December 31, 2010, no other customers accounted for more than 10% of our total accounts receivable. We believe that we have little concentration of credit risk associated with the remainder of our customer base. Accounts Receivable Trade, as shown on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, were net of allowances and anticipated discounts. An allowance for doubtful accounts is determined through analysis of the following: Aging of accounts receivable at the date of the financial statements; Assessments of collectability based on historical trends; and Evaluation of the impact of current and projected economic conditions. We monitor the collectability of our accounts receivable on an ongoing basis by analyzing aged accounts receivable, assessing the credit worthiness of our customers and evaluating the impact of reasonably likely changes in economic conditions that may impact credit risks. Estimates with regard to the collectability of accounts receivable are reasonably likely to change in the future. Information on our Accounts Receivable Trade, related expenses and assumptions is as follows: For the three-year period 2008-2010 In millions of dollars, except percents Average expense for potential uncollectible accounts $1.8 Average write-offs of uncollectible accounts $1.9 Allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of gross accounts receivable 1%-2 % We recognize the provision for uncollectible accounts as selling, marketing and administrative expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. If we made reasonably possible near-term changes in the most material assumptions regarding collectability of accounts receivable, our annual provision could change within the following range: A reduction in expense of approximately $4.9 million; and An increase in expense of approximately $3.9 million. Changes in estimates for future uncollectible accounts receivable would not have a material impact on our liquidity or capital resources. Accrued Liabilities Accrued liabilities requiring the most difficult or subjective judgments include liabilities associated with marketing promotion programs and potentially unsaleable products. Liabilities associated with marketing promotion programs We recognize the costs of marketing promotion programs as a reduction to net sales along with a corresponding accrued liability based on estimates at the time of revenue recognition. Information on our promotional costs and assumptions is as follows: For the years ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 In millions of dollars Promotional costs $ 767.6 $ 721.5 $ 766.6 42 We determine the amount of the accrued liability by: Analysis of programs offered; Historical trends; Expectations regarding customer and consumer participation; Sales and payment trends; and Experience with payment patterns associated with similar, previously offered programs. The estimated costs of these programs are reasonably likely to change in the future due to changes in trends with regard to customer and consumer participation, particularly for new programs and for programs related to the introduction of new products. Reasonably possible near-term changes in the most material assumptions regarding the cost of promotional programs could result in changes within the following range: A reduction in costs of approximately $14.4 million; and An increase in costs of approximately $5.6 million. Changes in these assumptions would affect net sales and income before income taxes. Over the three-year period ended December 31, 2010, actual promotion costs have not deviated from the estimated amounts by more than approximately 3%. Changes in estimates related to the cost of promotional programs would not have a material impact on our liquidity or capital resources. Liabilities associated with potentially unsaleable products At the time of sale, we estimate a cost for the possibility that products will become aged or unsaleable in the future. The estimated cost is included as a reduction to net sales. A related accrued liability is determined using statistical analysis that incorporates historical sales trends, seasonal timing and sales patterns, and product movement at retail. Estimates for costs associated with unsaleable products may change as a result of inventory levels in the distribution channel, current economic trends, changes in consumer demand, the introduction of new products and changes in trends of seasonal sales in response to promotional programs. Over the three-year period ended December 31, 2010, costs associated with aged or unsaleable products have amounted to approximately 2% of gross sales. Reasonably possible near-term changes in the most material assumptions regarding the estimates of such costs would have increased or decreased net sales and income before income taxes in a range from $0.6 million to $1.2 million. Over the three-year period ended December 31, 2010, actual costs have not deviated from our estimates by more than approximately 4%. Reasonably possible near-term changes in the estimates of costs associated with unsaleable products would not have a material impact on our liquidity or capital resources. Pension and Other Post-Retirement Benefits Plans Overview We sponsor a number of defined benefit pension plans. The primary plans are The Hershey Company Retirement Plan and The Hershey Company Retirement Plan for Hourly Employees. These are cash balance 43 plans that provide pension benefits for most domestic employees hired prior to January 1, 2007. We monitor legislative and regulatory developments regarding cash balance plans, as well as recent court cases, for any impact on our plans. We also sponsor two primary post-retirement benefit plans. The health care plan is contributory, with participants contributions adjusted annually, and the life insurance plan is non-contributory. We fund domestic pension liabilities in accordance with the limits imposed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and federal income tax laws. Beginning January 1, 2008, we complied with the funding requirements of the Pension Protection Act of 2006. We fund non-domestic pension liabilities in accordance with laws and regulations applicable to those plans. We broadly diversify our pension plan assets, consisting primarily of domestic and international common stocks and fixed income securities. Short-term and long-term liabilities associated with benefit plans are primarily determined based on actuarial calculations. These calculations consider payroll and employee data, including age and years of service, along with actuarial assumptions at the date of the financial statements. We take into consideration long-term projections with regard to economic conditions, including interest rates, return on assets and the rate of increase in compensation levels. With regard to liabilities associated with post-retirement benefit plans that provide health care and life insurance, we take into consideration the long-term annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of the covered benefits. We review the discount rate assumptions and revise them annually. The expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption ( asset return assumption ) for funded plans is of a longer duration and revised only when long-term asset return projections demonstrate that need. An employer that is a business entity and sponsors one or more single-employer defined benefit plans is required to: Recognize the funded status of a benefit plan measured as the difference between plan assets at fair value and the benefit obligation in its statement of financial position. For a pension plan, the benefit obligation is the projected benefit obligation; for any other post-retirement benefit plan, such as a retiree health care plan, the benefit obligation is the accumulated post-retirement benefit obligation. Recognize as a component of other comprehensive income, net of tax, the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise during the period but are not recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost. Measure defined benefit plan assets and obligations as of the date of the employer fiscal year-end statement of financial position. Disclose in the notes to financial statements additional information about certain effects on net periodic benefit costs for the next fiscal year that arise from delayed recognition of the gains or losses, prior service costs or credits, and transition asset or obligation. Pension Plans Our pension plan costs and related assumptions were as follows: For the years ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 In millions of dollars Net periodic pension benefit cost (income) $ 35.7 $ 48.9 $ (17.4 ) Assumptions: Average discount rate assumptions net periodic benefit cost calculation 5.7 % 6.4 % 6.3 % Average discount rate assumptions benefit obligation calculation 5.2 % 5.7 % 6.4 % Asset return assumptions 8.5 % 8.5 % 8.5 % Net Periodic Pension Benefit Costs We recorded net periodic pension benefit expense of $35.7 million in 2010. The decrease from 2009 was primarily due to the significant increase in the value of pension assets reflecting the actual return on pension 44 assets and contributions during 2009. Net periodic pension benefit expense of $48.9 million recorded in 2009 reflected the significant decline in the value of pension assets during 2008 resulting from volatility and deterioration in financial market and economic conditions. We recorded net periodic pension benefit income in 2008 primarily due to the modifications announced in October 2006 which reduced future benefits under The Hershey Company Retirement Plan, The Hershey Company Retirement Plan for Hourly Employees and the Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan and the impact of a higher discount rate assumption as of December 31, 2007. Our periodic pension benefit costs are expected to be slightly higher in 2011. We anticipate a remeasurement of the assets and liabilities of one of our pension plans in the second quarter of 2011 as a result of initiatives under the Next Century program. This could impact periodic pension benefit costs for the year. Actuarial gains and losses may arise when actual experience differs from assumed experience or when we revise the actuarial assumptions used to value the plans obligations. We only amortize the unrecognized net actuarial gains and losses in excess of 10% of a respective plan projected benefit obligation, or the fair market value of assets, if greater. The estimated recognized net actuarial loss component of net periodic pension benefit expense for 2011 is $29.1 million. The 2010 recognized net actuarial loss component of net periodic pension benefit expense was $28.5 million. Projections beyond 2011 are dependent on a variety of factors such as changes to the discount rate and the actual return on pension plan assets. Average Discount Rate Assumption Net Periodic Benefit Cost (Income) The discount rate represents the estimated rate at which we could effectively settle our pension benefit obligations. In order to estimate this rate for 2010, a single effective rate of discount was determined by our actuaries after discounting the pension obligation cash flows using the spot rate of matching duration from the Towers Watson RATE:Link discount curve. For 2009 and 2008, the rate of discount was determined by our actuaries using the spot rate of matching duration from the Citigroup Pension Discount Curve. We changed to the Towers Watson RATE:Link discount curve in 2010 to obtain more transparency into the underlying securities. The use of a different discount rate assumption can significantly affect net periodic benefit cost (income): A one-percentage point decrease in the discount rate assumption would have increased 2010 net periodic pension benefit expense by $5.6 million. A one-percentage point increase in the discount rate assumption would have decreased 2010 net periodic pension benefit expense by $5.2 million. Average Discount Rate Assumption Benefit Obligations The discount rate assumption to be used in calculating the amount of benefit obligations is determined in the same manner as the average discount rate assumption used to calculate net periodic benefit cost (income) as described above. We reduced our 2010 discount rate assumption due to the declining interest rate environment consistent with the duration of our pension plan liabilities. The use of a different discount rate assumption can significantly affect the amount of benefit obligations: A one-percentage point decrease in the discount rate assumption would have increased the December 31, 2010 pension benefits obligations by $108.7 million. A one-percentage point increase in the discount rate assumption would have decreased the December 31, 2010 pension benefits obligations by $92.0 million. Asset Return Assumptions During 2011, we will be reducing the expected return on plan assets assumption to 8.0% from the 8.5% assumption used during 2010, reflecting lower expected future returns on plan assets. We based the expected return on plan assets component of net periodic pension benefit cost (income) on the fair market value of pension plan assets. To determine the expected return on plan assets, we consider the current and expected asset 45 allocations, as well as historical and expected returns on the categories of plan assets. The historical geometric average return over the 23 years prior to December 31, 2010 was approximately 8.5%. The actual return on assets was as follows: For the years ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Actual return (loss) on assets 13.3 % 21.2 % (24.1 %) The use of a different asset return assumption can significantly affect net periodic benefit cost (income): A one-percentage point decrease in the asset return assumption would have increased 2010 net periodic pension benefit expense by $9.1 million. A one-percentage point increase in the asset return assumption would have decreased 2010 net periodic pension benefit expense by $9.0 million. Our investment policies specify ranges of allocation percentages for each asset class. The ranges for the domestic pension plans were as follows: Asset Class Allocation Range Equity securities 58% 85% Debt securities 15% 42% Cash and certain other investments 0% 5% As of December 31, 2010, actual allocations were within the specified ranges. We expect the level of volatility in pension plan asset returns to be in line with the overall volatility of the markets and weightings within the asset classes. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, the benefit plan fixed income assets were invested primarily in conventional instruments benchmarked to the Barclays Capital U.S. Aggregate Bond Index. For 2010 and 2009, minimum funding requirements for the plans were not material. However, we made contributions of $6.1 million in 2010 and $54.5 million in 2009 to improve the funded status of our qualified plans and for the payment of benefits under our non-qualified pension plans. These contributions were fully tax deductible. A one-percentage point change in the funding discount rate would not have changed the 2010 minimum funding requirements significantly for the domestic plans. For 2011, there are no significant minimum funding requirements for our pension plans and currently planned voluntary funding of our pension plans in 2011 is not material. Post-Retirement Benefit Plans Other post-retirement benefit plan costs and related assumptions were as follows: For the years ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 In millions of dollars Net periodic other post-retirement benefit cost $ 17.5 $ 19.9 $ 21.9 Assumptions: Average discount rate assumption 5.7 % 6.4 % 6.3 % The use of a different discount rate assumption can significantly affect net periodic other post-retirement benefit cost: A one-percentage point decrease in the discount rate assumption would have decreased 2010 net periodic other post-retirement benefit cost by $1.1 million. A one-percentage point increase in the discount rate assumption would not have impacted 2010 net periodic other post-retirement benefit cost. 46 For the domestic post-retirement benefit plan, a decrease in the discount rate assumption would result in a decrease in benefit cost because of the lower interest cost which would more than offset the impact of the lower discount rate assumption on the post-retirement benefit obligation. Other post-retirement benefit obligations and assumptions were as follows: December 31, 2010 2009 In millions of dollars Other post-retirement benefit obligation $ 306.3 $ 324.6 Assumptions: Benefit obligations discount rate assumption 5.2 % 5.7 % A one-percentage point decrease in the discount rate assumption would have increased the December 31, 2010 other post-retirement benefits obligations by $30.9 million. A one-percentage point increase in the discount rate assumption would have decreased the December 31, 2010 other post-retirement benefits obligations by $25.8 million. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets We account for goodwill and other intangible assets by classifying intangible assets into three categories: (1) intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization; (2) intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization; and (3) goodwill. For intangible assets with definite lives, impairment testing is required if conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. For intangible assets with indefinite lives and for goodwill, impairment testing is required at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that these assets might be impaired. We use a two-step process to evaluate goodwill for impairment. In the first step, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit with the carrying amount of the reporting unit, including goodwill. We estimate the fair value of the reporting unit based on discounted future cash flows. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit, we complete a second step to determine the amount of the goodwill impairment that we should record. In the second step, we determine an implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill by allocating the reporting unit fair value to all of its assets and liabilities other than goodwill (including any unrecognized intangible assets). We compare the resulting implied fair value of the goodwill to the carrying amount and record an impairment charge for the difference. The assumptions we used to estimate fair value are based on the past performance of each reporting unit and reflect the projections and assumptions that we use in current operating plans. We also consider assumptions that market participants may use. Such assumptions are subject to change due to changing economic and competitive conditions. We perform annual impairment tests of goodwill at the beginning of the fourth quarter of each year or when circumstances arise that indicate a possible impairment might exist. As a result of recent operating performance that was below expectations, we completed an impairment evaluation of goodwill and other intangible assets associated with Godrej Hershey Ltd. during the second quarter of 2010. Based on this evaluation, we recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $44.7 million in the second quarter, including a reduction to reflect the share of the charge associated with the noncontrolling interests. We determined that none of our goodwill was impaired as of December 31, 2010. The fair value of our Godrej Hershey Ltd. reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 7%. As of December 31, 2010, the goodwill allocated to the reporting unit was approximately $27.9 million. The assumptions used to estimate fair value were based on the past performance of the reporting unit as well as the projections incorporated in our current operating plans. Significant assumptions and estimates included in our current operating plans were associated with sales growth, profitability, and related 47 cash flows, along with cash flows associated with taxes and capital spending. The discount rate used to estimate fair value was risk adjusted in consideration of the economic conditions of the reporting unit. We also considered assumptions that market participants may use. By their nature, these projections and assumptions are uncertain. Potential events and circumstances that could have an adverse effect on our assumptions include the unavailability of raw or packaging materials or significant cost increases, pricing constraints and possible disruptions to our supply chain. The fair values of our other reporting units were substantially in excess of their carrying values. Our other intangible assets consist primarily of customer-related intangible assets, patents and trademarks obtained through business acquisitions. We amortize customer-related intangible assets and patents over their estimated useful lives. The useful lives of existing trademarks that were determined to be indefinite are not amortized. We evaluate our trademarks for impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the assets to their estimated fair value. The fair value of trademarks is calculated using a relief from royalty payments methodology. This approach involves two steps. In the first step, we estimate reasonable royalty rates for each trademark. In the second step, we apply these royalty rates to a net sales stream and discount the resulting cash flows to determine fair value. This fair value is then compared with the carrying value of each trademark. If the estimated fair value is less than the carrying amount, we record an impairment charge to reduce the asset to its estimated fair value. The estimates of future cash flows are generally based on past performance of the brands and reflect net sales projections and assumptions for the brands that we use in current operating plans. We also consider assumptions that market participants may use. Such assumptions are subject to change due to changing economic and competitive conditions. We perform annual impairment tests and re-evaluate the useful lives of other intangible assets with indefinite lives at the beginning of the fourth quarter of each year or when circumstances arise that indicate a possible impairment might exist. We determined that none of our other intangible assets was impaired as of December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009. In December 2008, we recorded total non-cash impairment charges of $45.7 million. We determined that the carrying amounts of certain trademarks, primarily the Mauna Loa brand, exceeded their estimated fair value due to reduced expectations for future sales and cash flows compared with the valuations at the acquisition dates. Commodities Futures and Options Contracts We use futures and options contracts in combination with forward purchasing of cocoa products and other commodities primarily to reduce the risk of future price increases, provide visibility to future costs and take advantage of market fluctuations. Additional information with regard to accounting policies associated with commodities futures and options contracts and other derivative instruments is contained in Note 6, Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities . Our gains (losses) on cash flow hedging derivatives were as follows: For the years ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 In millions of dollars Net after-tax gains on cash flow hedging derivatives $ 1.0 $ 78.3 $ 11.5 Reclassification adjustments from accumulated other comprehensive loss to income (32.5 ) 1.9 (34.1 ) Hedge ineffectiveness gains (losses) recognized in cost of sales, before tax .8 .2 (.1 ) We reflected reclassification adjustments related to gains or losses on commodities futures and options contracts in cost of sales. No gains or losses on commodities futures and options contracts resulted because we discontinued a hedge due to the probability that the forecasted hedged transaction would not occur. 48 We recognized no components of gains or losses on commodities futures and options contracts in income due to excluding such components from the hedge effectiveness assessment. The amount of net gains on cash flow hedging derivatives, including foreign exchange forward contracts and options, interest rate swap agreements and commodities futures and options contracts, expected to be reclassified into earnings in the next 12 months was approximately $20.7 million after tax as of December 31, 2010. This amount was primarily associated with commodities futures contracts. OUTLOOK The outlook section contains a number of forward-looking statements, all of which are based on current expectations. Actual results may differ materially. Refer to Risk Factors beginning on page 10 for information concerning the key risks to achieving our future performance goals. We expect the economic environment to continue to be challenging in 2011. In this environment, we will continue to build our business by focusing on a consumer-driven approach to core brand investment and new product innovation in North America, along with investments in our strategic international businesses. We will continue to focus on our core brands and leverage the Company scale at retail during 2011. We exited 2010 with momentum and expect to build on our success in 2011 as we have a number of initiatives planned to drive growth across our markets, including the U.S. launch of Hershey Drops, Reese Minis and other new products. We will also continue the disciplined roll-out and distribution of the Hershey and Hershey Kisses brands in select key emerging markets where we are gaining consumer awareness and trial. In 2011, we expect advertising to increase in the mid-single digits on a percentage basis versus last year, supporting new product launches and core brands in both the United States and international markets. We expect 2011 net sales growth to be around the top of our 3% to 5% long-term objective. Commodity markets remain volatile and we expect significantly higher input costs in 2011 compared with 2010. We have visibility into our cost structure for 2011; however, the risk of cost increases remains for certain inputs, such as dairy products, which we are not able to effectively hedge. We expect to substantially offset higher input costs in 2011 through productivity and cost savings initiatives which are in place and we estimate that 2011 adjusted gross margin will be about the same as in 2010. As a result, we expect 2011 adjusted earnings per share-diluted growth to be around the top of our long-term 6% to 8% objective. Note : In the Outlook above, the Company has provided income measures excluding certain items, in addition to net income determined in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures are used in evaluating results of operations for internal purposes. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to replace the presentation of financial results in accordance with GAAP. Rather, the Company believes exclusion of such items provides additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations. Below is a reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP items to the Company 2010 and projected 2011 adjusted earnings per share-diluted: 2010 2011 (Projected) Reported EPS-Diluted $ 2.21 $ 2.54 $2.63 Total Business Realignment and Impairment Charges $ 0.34 $ 0.13 $0.16 Adjusted EPS-Diluted* $ 2.55 $ 2.70 $2.76 * Excludes business realignment and impairment charges. 49 Outlook for Project Next Century In June 2010, we announced Project Next Century as part of our ongoing efforts to create an advantaged supply chain and competitive cost structure. We expect total pre-tax charges and non-recurring project implementation costs for the Project Next Century program of $140 million to $170 million. During 2011, we expect to record $45 million to $55 million in program charges. During 2011, we now expect capital expenditures for Project Next Century to be approximately $180 million to $190 million. Depreciation and amortization for 2011 is estimated to be $175 million to $185 million, excluding accelerated depreciation of $15 million to $20 million related to Project Next Century. When fully implemented, Project Next Century is expected to provide annual cost savings from efficiency improvements of $60 million to $80 million.
