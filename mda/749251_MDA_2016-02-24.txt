BUSINESS OVERVIEW Gartner, Inc. is the world leading information technology research and advisory company that helps executives use technology to build, guide and grow their enterprises. We offer independent and objective research and analysis on the information technology, computer hardware, software, communications and related technology industries. We provide comprehensive coverage of the IT industry to thousands of client organizations across the globe. Our client base consists of CIOs, other senior IT personnel, executives, and others from a wide variety of business enterprises, government agencies and the investment community. Gartner is headquartered in Stamford, Connecticut, U.S.A., and as of December 31, 2015, we had 7,834 associates, including 1,731 research analysts and consultants, and clients in over 90 countries. We have three business segments: Research, Consulting and Events. Research provides objective insight on critical and timely technology and supply chain initiatives for CIOs, other IT professionals, supply chain leaders, digital marketing professionals, technology companies and the institutional investment community through reports, briefings, proprietary tools, access to our analysts, peer networking services and membership programs that enable our clients to make better decisions about their IT, supply chain and digital marketing investments.

Events provides IT, supply chain, digital marketing and business professionals the opportunity to attend various symposia, conferences and exhibitions to learn, contribute and network with their peers. From our flagship Symposium/ITxpo series, to summits focused on specific technologies and industries, to experimental workshop-style seminars, our events distill the latest Gartner research into applicable insight and advice. 17 BUSINESS MEASUREMENTS We believe the following business measurements are important performance indicators for our business segments: BUSINESS SEGMENT BUSINESS MEASUREMENTS Research Contract value represents the value attributable to all of our subscription-related research products that recognize revenue on a ratable basis. Contract value is calculated as the annualized value of all subscription research contracts in effect at a specific point in time, without regard to the duration of the contract. Client retention rate represents a measure of client satisfaction and renewed business relationships at a specific point in time. Client retention is calculated on a percentage basis by dividing our current clients, who were also clients a year ago, by all clients from a year ago. Client retention is calculated at an enterprise level, which represents a single company or customer. Wallet retention rate represents a measure of the amount of contract value we have retained with clients over a twelve-month period. Wallet retention is calculated on a percentage basis by dividing the contract value of clients, who were clients one year ago, by the total contract value from a year ago, excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange. When wallet retention exceeds client retention, it is an indication of retention of higher-spending clients, or increased spending by retained clients, or both. Wallet retention is calculated at an enterprise level, which represents a single company or customer. Consulting Consulting backlog represents future revenue to be derived from in-process consulting, measurement and strategic advisory services engagements. Utilization rate represents a measure of productivity of our consultants. Utilization rates are calculated for billable headcount on a percentage basis by dividing total hours billed by total hours available to bill. Billing rate represents earned billable revenue divided by total billable hours. Average annualized revenue per billable headcount represents a measure of the revenue generating ability of an average billable consultant and is calculated periodically by multiplying the average billing rate per hour times the utilization percentage times the billable hours available for one year. Events Number of events represents the total number of hosted events completed during the period. Number of attendees represents the total number of people who attend events. 18 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL POSITION We have executed a consistent growth strategy since 2005 to drive double-digit annual revenue and earnings growth. The fundamentals of our strategy include a focus on creating extraordinary research content, delivering innovative and highly differentiated product offerings, building a strong sales capability, providing world class client service with a focus on client engagement and retention, and continuously improving our operational effectiveness. We had total revenues of $2.163 billion in 2015, an increase of 7% over 2014 on a reported basis and 13% adjusted for the impact of foreign currency exchange. Diluted earnings per share increased to $2.06 per share in 2015 from $2.03 per share in 2014. Research revenues rose 10% year-over-year, to $1.583 billion in 2015, and the contribution margin was 69%, the same as 2014. At December 31, 2015, Research contract value was $1.761 billion, an increase of 10% over December 31, 2014 on a reported basis and 14% adjusted for the impact of foreign currency exchange. Both client and wallet retention remained strong, at 84% and 105%, respectively, at December 31, 2015. Consulting revenues in 2015 decreased 6% when compared to 2014 but were flat when adjusted for the foreign exchange impact. The gross contribution margin was 33% in 2015 compared to 34% in 2014. Consultant utilization declined by 2 points in 2015, to 66%. We had 606 billable consultants at December 31, 2015 compared to 535 at year-end 2014. Backlog increased 15% year-over-year, to $117.7 million at December 31, 2015, which is the highest in the Company's history. Events revenues increased 11% year-over-year, to $251.8 million. Adjusted for the foreign currency impact, Events revenues increased 18%. The segment contribution margin was 52% in 2015, a 3 point increase over 2014. We held 65 events in 2015 compared to 61 in 2014, while the number of attendees increased 7% year-over-year, to 52,595. For a more detailed discussion of our results, see the Segment Results section below. Cash flow from our operating activities was $345.6 million in 2015. We ended 2015 with $373.0 million in cash and cash equivalents while $656.0 million was available for borrowing under the revolving credit line. We believe that we have adequate liquidity to meet our currently anticipated needs. We continue to focus on maximizing shareholder value. During 2015 we repurchased 6.2 million of our outstanding common shares, and we also acquired Nubera eBusiness S.L., based in Barcelona, Spain ("Nubera"), and Capterra, Inc., based in Arlington, Virginia ("Capterra"), both of which help organizations find the right business software to meet their needs. Note 2 - Acquisitions in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K provides additional information regarding these acquisitions. FLUCTUATIONS IN QUARTERLY RESULTS Our quarterly and annual revenue, operating income, and cash flow fluctuate as a result of many factors, including: the timing of our Symposium/ITxpo series, which are normally held during the fourth calendar quarter, as well as other events; the timing and amount of new business generated; the mix between domestic and international business; changes in market demand for our products and services; changes in foreign currency rates; the timing of the development, introduction and marketing of our new products and services; competition in the industry; acquisitions; general economic conditions; and other factors which are beyond our control. The potential fluctuations in our operating income could cause period-to-period comparisons of operating results not to be meaningful and could provide an unreliable indication of future operating results and cash flows. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements requires the application of appropriate accounting policies and the use of estimates. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K. Management considers the policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our financial statements because their application requires complex and subjective management judgments and estimates. Specific risks for these critical accounting policies are described below. The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions about future events. We develop our estimates using both current and historical experience, as well as other factors, including the general economic environment and actions we may take in the future. We adjust such estimates when facts and circumstances dictate. However, our estimates may involve significant uncertainties and judgments and cannot be determined with precision. In addition, these estimates are based on our best judgment at a point in time and as such these estimates may ultimately differ materially from actual results. On-going 19 changes in our estimates could be material and would be reflected in the Company consolidated financial statements in future periods. Our critical accounting policies are as follows: Revenue recognition Revenue is recognized in accordance with the requirements of U.S. GAAP as well as SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104, Revenue Recognition ( SAB 104 ). Revenue is only recognized once all required criteria for revenue recognition have been met. Revenue by significant source is accounted for as follows: Research revenues are mainly derived from subscription contracts for research products. The related revenues are deferred and recognized ratably over the applicable contract term. Fees derived from assisting organizations in selecting the right business software for their needs is recognized when the leads are provided to vendors. Consulting revenues are principally generated from fixed fee and time and material engagements. Revenues from fixed fee contracts are recognized on a proportional performance basis. Revenues from time and materials engagements are recognized as work is delivered and/or services are provided. Revenues related to contract optimization contracts are contingent in nature and are only recognized upon satisfaction of all conditions related to their payment. Events revenues are deferred and then recognized upon the completion of the related symposium, conference or exhibition. The majority of research contracts are billable upon signing, absent special terms granted on a limited basis from time to time. All research contracts are non-cancelable and non-refundable, except for government contracts that may have cancellation or fiscal funding clauses. It is our policy to record the entire amount of the contract that is billable as a fee receivable at the time the contract is signed with a corresponding amount as deferred revenue, since the contract represents a legally enforceable claim. Uncollectible fees receivable We maintain an allowance for losses which is composed of a bad debt allowance and a sales reserve. Provisions are charged against earnings, either as a reduction in revenues or an increase to expense. The determination of the allowance for losses is based on historical loss experience, an assessment of current economic conditions, the aging of outstanding receivables, the financial health of specific clients, and probable losses. This evaluation is inherently judgmental and requires estimates. These valuation reserves are periodically re-evaluated and adjusted as more information about the ultimate collectability of fees receivable becomes available. Circumstances that could cause our valuation reserves to increase include changes in our clients liquidity and credit quality, other factors negatively impacting our clients ability to pay their obligations as they come due, and the effectiveness of our collection efforts. The following table provides our total fees receivable and the related allowance for losses (in thousands): December 31, 2015 2014 Total fees receivable $ 587,663 $ 558,807 Allowance for losses (6,900 ) (6,700 ) Fees receivable, net $ 580,763 $ 552,107 Goodwill and other intangible assets The Company evaluates recorded goodwill in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic No. 350, which requires goodwill to be assessed for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. In addition, an impairment evaluation of our amortizable intangible assets may also be performed if events or circumstances indicate potential impairment. Among the factors that could trigger an impairment review are our current operating results relative to our annual plan or historical performance; changes in our strategic plan or use of our assets; restructuring charges or other changes in our business segments; competitive pressures and changes in the general economy or in the markets in which we operate; a significant decline in our stock price and our market capitalization relative to our net book value. ASC Topic No. 350 requires an annual assessment of the recoverability of recorded goodwill, which can be either quantitative or qualitative in nature, or a combination of the two. Both methods require the use of estimates which in turn contain judgments and assumptions regarding future trends and events. As a result, both the precision and reliability of the resulting estimates are subject to uncertainty. If our annual goodwill impairment evaluation determines that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its related carrying amount, we may recognize an impairment charge against earnings. Among the factors we consider in a qualitative assessment are general economic conditions and the competitive environment; actual and projected reporting unit financial performance; forward-looking business measurements; and external market assessments. A quantitative analysis requires 20 management to consider all of the factors relevant to a qualitative assessment, as well as the utilization of detailed financial projections, to include the rate of revenue growth, profitability, and cash flows, as well as assumptions regarding discount rates, the Company's weighted-average cost of capital, and other data, in order to determine a fair value for our reporting units. We conducted a quantitative assessment of the fair value of all of the Company's reporting units during the third quarter of 2015. The results of this test determined that the fair values of the Company's reporting units continue to exceed their respective carrying values. See Note 1 Business and Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding goodwill and amortizable intangible assets. Accounting for income taxes The Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. We estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions where we operate. This process involves estimating our current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our consolidated balance sheets. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We consider the availability of loss carryforwards, projected reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in making this assessment. The Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained based on the technical merits of the position. Accounting for stock-based compensation The Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with FASB ASC Topic No. 505 and 718 and SEC Staff Accounting Bulletins No. 107 ( SAB No. 107 ) and No. 110 ( SAB No. 110 ). The Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense, which is based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant, over the related service period, net of estimated forfeitures (see Note 8 Stock-Based Compensation in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information). Determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stock compensation awards requires the input of certain complex and subjective assumptions, including the expected life of the stock compensation award and the Company Common Stock price volatility. In addition, determining the appropriate amount of associated periodic expense requires management to estimate the rate of employee forfeitures and the likelihood of achievement of certain performance targets. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock compensation awards and the associated periodic expense represent management best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of judgment. As a result, if factors change and the Company deems it necessary in the future to modify the assumptions it made or to use different assumptions, or if the quantity and nature of the Company stock-based compensation awards changes, then the amount of expense may need to be adjusted and future stock compensation expense could be materially different from what has been recorded in the current period. Restructuring and other accruals We may record accruals for severance costs, costs associated with excess facilities that we have leased, contract terminations, asset impairments, and other costs as a result of on-going actions we undertake to streamline our organization, reposition certain businesses and reduce ongoing costs. Estimates of costs to be incurred to complete these actions, such as future lease payments, sublease income, the fair value of assets, and severance and related benefits, are based on assumptions at the time the actions are initiated. These accruals may need to be adjusted to the extent actual costs differ from such estimates. In addition, these actions may be revised due to changes in business conditions that we did not foresee at the time such plans were approved. We also record accruals during the year for our various employee cash incentive programs. Amounts accrued at the end of each reporting period are based on our estimates and may require adjustment as the ultimate amount paid for these incentives are sometimes not known with certainty until the end of our fiscal year. 21 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Consolidated Results 2015 VERSUS 2014 The following table presents the changes in selected line items in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the two years ended December 31, 2015 (in thousands): Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2015 Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2014 Income Increase (Decrease) $ Increase (Decrease) % Total revenues $ 2,163,056 $ 2,021,441 $ 141,615 7 % Costs and expenses: Cost of services & product development 839,076 797,933 (41,143 ) (5 ) Selling, general and administrative 962,677 876,067 (86,610 ) (10 ) Depreciation 33,789 31,186 (2,603 ) (8 ) Amortization of intangibles 13,342 8,226 (5,116 ) (62 ) Acquisition & integration charges 26,175 21,867 (4,308 ) (20 ) Operating income 287,997 286,162 1,835 1 Interest expense, net (20,782 ) (10,887 ) (9,895 ) (91 ) Other income (expense), net 4,996 (592 ) 5,588 >100 Provision for income taxes (96,576 ) (90,917 ) (5,659 ) (6 ) Net income $ 175,635 $ 183,766 $ (8,131 ) (4 )% TOTAL REVENUES for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 increased $141.6 million, or 7%, compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2014. Revenues increased by double-digits in our Research and Events businesses but declined 6% in Consulting. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency, total revenues increased 13% in 2015 compared to 2014.

Foreign exchange had a favorable impact on COS expense during 2015, and adjusted for this impact, COS expense increased 11% in 2015 when compared to 2014. The year-over-year increase in COS expense was due to $56.0 million in higher payroll and related benefits costs from additional headcount and merit salary increases, and $31.0 million in higher charges in 2015 for events costs, travel, and other corporate expenses. Partially offsetting these increased expenses was approximately $46.0 million in favorable foreign exchange impact. The additional headcount was primarily in our Research business which includes the additional employees resulting from our 2015 acquisitions, and to a lesser extent, an increase in headcount in our Consulting business. COS as a percentage of revenues was 39% in both the 2015 and 2014 periods. SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE ( SG&A ) expense increased by $86.6 million in 2015, or 10%, to $962.7 million compared to $876.1 million in 2014. Excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange, SG&A expense increased 16% year-over-year. The increase was primarily due to $111.0 million in higher payroll and related benefits costs from additional headcount, higher sales commissions, and merit salary increases, and we also had $27.0 million in additional travel and training, recruiting, and other costs. Partially offsetting these additional charges was approximately $51.0 million in favorable foreign exchange impact. SG&A headcount increased 17% overall, with the majority of the increase in additional quota-bearing sales associates and related support staff. Quota-bearing sales associates increased 15% year-over-year, to 2,171 at December 31, 2015 from 1,881 at year-end 2014. DEPRECIATION expense increased 8% in 2015 compared to 2014, which reflects our additional investment in fixed assets. AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLES increased to $13.3 million in 2015 from $8.2 million 2014, an increase of 62% year-over-year due to the additional intangibles resulting from our acquisitions. ACQUISITION AND INTEGRATION CHARGES was $26.2 million in 2015 compared to $21.9 million in 2014. These charges are directly-related to our acquisitions and primarily include amounts accrued for payments contingent on the achievement of certain employment conditions, legal, consulting, and severance costs. OPERATING INCOME increased 1% in 2015 compared to 2014, to $288.0 million in 2015 from $286.2 million in 2014. Operating income as a percentage of revenues was 13% in 2015 and 14% in 2014, with the decrease primarily driven by higher year-over-year SG&A costs, and to a lesser extent a lower gross contribution in the Consulting business and additional charges from acquisitions. INTEREST EXPENSE, NET increased 91% year-over-year due to additional borrowings in the 2015 period. OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET was $5.0 million in 2015 which includes a $6.8 million gain from the sale of certain state tax credits partially offset by net losses resulting from foreign currency exchange transactions. The $0.6 million expense in 2014 was due to net foreign currency transaction gains and losses. PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES was $96.6 million in 2015 compared to $90.9 million in 2014 and the effective tax rate was 35.5% for 2015 compared to 33.1% for 2014. The higher effective tax rate in 2015 was primarily due to decreases in foreign tax credit benefits, increases in non-deductible expenses relating to acquisitions, and increases in valuation allowances on foreign net operating losses. NET INCOME was $175.6 million in 2015 and $183.8 million in 2014, a decrease of 4%. Diluted earnings per share increased 1% year-over-year, to $2.06 in 2015 compared to $2.03 in 2014, due to a 6% decrease in the number of weighted-average shares in the 2015 period. 23 2014 VERSUS 2013 The following table presents the changes in selected line items in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the two years ended December 31, 2014 (in thousands): Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2014 Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2013 Income Increase (Decrease) $ Increase (Decrease) % Total revenues $ 2,021,441 $ 1,784,213 $ 237,228 13 % Costs and expenses: Cost of services & product development 797,933 713,484 (84,449 ) (12 ) Selling, general and administrative 876,067 760,458 (115,609 ) (15 ) Depreciation 31,186 28,996 (2,190 ) (8 ) Amortization of intangibles 8,226 5,446 (2,780 ) (51 ) Acquisition & integration charges 21,867 337 (21,530 ) >(100) Operating income 286,162 275,492 10,670 4 Interest expense, net (10,887 ) (8,837 ) (2,050 ) (23 ) Other expense, net (592 ) (216 ) (376 ) >(100) Provision for income taxes (90,917 ) (83,638 ) (7,279 ) (9 ) Net income $ 183,766 $ 182,801 $ 965 1 % TOTAL REVENUES for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014 increased $237.2 million, or 13%, compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2013. Total revenues increased 14% excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency. Revenues increased in all three of our business segments and across all geographic regions. The following table presents total revenues by geographic region for the twelve months ended (in thousands): Geographic Region December 31, 2014 December 31, 2013 Increase (Decrease) $ Increase (Decrease) % U.S. and Canada $ 1,204,476 $ 1,049,734 $ 154,742 15 % Europe, Middle East, Africa 570,334 508,755 61,579 12 Other International 246,631 225,724 20,907 9 Totals $ 2,021,441 $ 1,784,213 $ 237,228 13 % The following table presents our revenues by segment for the twelve months ended (in thousands): Segment December 31, 2014 December 31, 2013 Increase (Decrease) $ Increase (Decrease) % Research $ 1,445,338 $ 1,271,011 $ 174,327 14 % Consulting 348,396 $ 314,257 34,139 11 Events 227,707 $ 198,945 28,762 14 Totals $ 2,021,441 $ 1,784,213 $ 237,228 13 % COST OF SERVICES AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT ( COS ) expense increased 12% in 2014 compared to 2013, or $84.4 million, to $797.9 million compared to $713.5 million in 2013. The impact of foreign currency exchange for the full year was not significant. The increase was primarily due to higher payroll and related benefits costs from additional headcount, which increased 12%. The headcount increase reflects our continued investment in our Research business and includes the additional employees resulting from the 2014 Acquisitions. COS as a percentage of revenues was 39% in the 2014 period compared to 40% in the 2013 period. 24 SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE ( SG&A ) expense increased by $115.6 million in 2014, or 15%, to $876.1 million compared to $760.5 million in 2013. Excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange, SG&A expense increased 16% year-over-year. The increase was primarily due to higher payroll and related benefits costs from additional headcount, higher sales commissions, and merit salary increases. The increased headcount includes our investment in additional quota-bearing sales associates, which increased to 1,881 at December 31, 2014, a 14% increase over year-end 2013. DEPRECIATION expense increased 8% in 2014 compared to 2013, which reflects our additional investment in fixed assets. AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLES increased 51% year-over-year due to the intangibles arising from the 2014 Acquisitions. ACQUISITION AND INTEGRATION CHARGES was $21.9 million in 2014 compared to $0.3 million in 2013. These charges are directly-related to our acquisitions and primarily include amounts accrued for payments contingent on the achievement of certain employment conditions, legal, consulting, and severance costs. OPERATING INCOME increased $10.7 million year-over-year, or 4%, to $286.2 million in 2014 from $275.5 million in 2013. The increased operating income was attributable to higher segment contributions from our Research and Events businesses. Operating income as a percentage of revenues was 14% in 2014 and 15% in 2013. INTEREST EXPENSE, NET increased 23% year-over-year due to additional borrowings in the 2014 period. OTHER EXPENSE, NET was $0.6 million in 2014 and $0.2 million in 2013. These expenses primarily consisted of net foreign currency exchange gains and losses. PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES was $90.9 million in 2014 compared to $83.6 million in 2013 and the effective tax rate was 33.1% for 2014 compared to 31.4% for 2013. The higher effective tax rate in 2014 was primarily due to the impact of certain favorable items in 2013, as well as the unfavorable mix of pretax income by jurisdiction in 2014 which was partially offset by foreign tax credit benefits in 2014. The favorable items in 2013 included the enactment of certain beneficial legislation in 2013, the release of tax reserves due to audit settlements, and increased tax exempt income. During 2014, the Internal Revenue Service closed its audit of the Company's 2011 and 2010 federal income tax returns. The resolution of the audit did not have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial position, cash flows, or results of operations. NET INCOME was $183.8 million in 2014 and $182.8 million in 2013, an increase of 1%, as the increased operating income in 2014 was substantially offset by additional income tax charges. Diluted earnings per share increased 5% year-over-year, to $2.03 in 2014, primarily due to a lower number of weighted-average shares outstanding. 25 SEGMENT RESULTS We evaluate reportable segment performance and allocate resources based on gross contribution margin. Gross contribution is defined as operating income excluding certain Cost of services and product development charges, SG&A, Depreciation, Acquisition and integration charges, and Amortization of intangibles. Gross contribution margin is defined as gross contribution as a percentage of revenues. The following sections present the results of our three business segments as of and for the three years-ended December 31, 2015. Research The following table presents the financial results and business measurements of our Research segment for the twelve months ended December 31: 2015 2014 $ Increase (Decrease) % Increase (Decrease) 2014 2013 $ Increase (Decrease) % Increase (Decrease) Financial Measurements: Revenues (1) $1,583,486 $1,445,338 $ 138,148 10 % $1,445,338 $1,271,011 $ 174,327 14 % Gross contribution (1) $1,096,827 $1,001,914 $ 94,913 9 % $1,001,914 $879,384 $ 122,530 14 % Gross contribution margin 69 % 69 % 69 % 69 % Business Measurements: Contract value (1) $1,760,700 $1,603,200 $ 157,500 10 % $1,603,200 $1,423,179 $ 180,021 13 % Client retention 84 % 85 % (1) point 85 % 83 % 2 points Wallet retention 105 % 106 % (1) point 106 % 104 % 2 points (1) Dollars in thousands. 2015 VERSUS 2014 Research segment revenues increased 10% in 2015 compared to 2014. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency, Research revenues increased 16% in 2015. The segment gross contribution margin was 69% in both annual periods. The contribution margin remained at 69% in spite of a 12% increase in segment headcount, mostly driven by new hires but also to a lesser extent the additional employees resulting from our acquisitions. The overall headcount increase reflects our continuing investment in this business. Research contract value increased 10% in 2015 to $1.761 billion, and increased 14% year-over-year adjusted for the impact of foreign currency exchange. The growth in contract value was broad-based, with every region, client size, and industry sector growing at double-digit rates, with the exception of the Energy and Utilities sector, which still increased year-over-year but at a slower rate. The number of our research client enterprises increased by 8% in 2015, to 10,796. Both client retention and wallet retention remained strong, at 84% and 105% respectively, as of December 31, 2015. 2014 VERSUS 2013 Research segment revenues in 2014 increased 14% compared to 2013. The impact of foreign exchange translation was not significant. The segment gross contribution margin was 69% for both periods. Research contract value increased 13% in 2014 to $1.603 billion, and increased 14% year-over-year adjusted for the impact of foreign currency translation. Our growth in contract value was broad-based, with every region, industry segment, and client size growing at double-digit rates compared to 2013. The number of our research client enterprises increased by 10% in 2014, to 9,958. Client retention and wallet retention were 85% and 106% as of December 31, 2014, respectively. 26 Consulting The following table presents the financial results and business measurements of our Consulting segment as of and for the twelve months ended December 31: 2015 2014 $ Increase (Decrease) % Increase (Decrease) 2014 2013 $ Increase (Decrease) % Increase (Decrease) Financial Measurements: Revenues (1) $327,735 $348,396 $ (20,661 ) (6 )% $348,396 $314,257 $ 34,139 11 % Gross contribution (1) $107,193 $119,931 $ (12,738 ) (11 )% $119,931 $107,565 $ 12,366 11 % Gross contribution margin 33 % 34 % (1) point 34 % 34 % Business Measurements: Backlog (1) $117,700 $102,600 $ 15,100 15 % $102,600 $106,130 $ (3,530 ) (3 )% Billable headcount 606 535 71 13 % 535 509 26 5 % Consultant utilization 66 % 68 % (2) points 68 % 64 % 4 points Average annualized revenue per billable headcount (1) $ 391 $ 442 $ (51 ) (12 )% $ 442 $ 409 $ 33 8 % (1) Dollars in thousands. 2015 VERSUS 2014 Consulting revenue decreased 6% year-over-year but was essentially flat excluding the negative foreign exchange impact. The revenue decline was primarily in our core consulting practice, which was mainly driven by the foreign exchange impact. We also had lower revenues in our contract optimization practice, which can fluctuate from period to period. The year-over-year gross contribution margin declined by 1 point, primarily driven by higher headcount. Backlog increased by $15.1 million year-over-year, or 15%, to $117.7 million at December 31, 2015, which is the highest backlog in the Company's history. 2014 VERSUS 2013 Consulting revenues increased 11% year-over-year and 12% when adjusted for the impact of foreign exchange. The increase was primarily due to higher core consulting revenues and to a lesser extent, higher contract optimization revenues. Contract optimization revenues can fluctuate from period to period but are generally about 10-15% of total annual Consulting segment revenues. The gross contribution margin was 34% for both periods. Backlog decreased $3.5 million, or 3%, year-over-year, to $102.6 million at December 31, 2014. 27 Events The following table presents the financial results and business measurements of our Events segment as of and for the twelve months ended December 31: 2015 2014 $ Increase (Decrease) % Increase (Decrease) 2014 2013 $ Increase (Decrease) % Increase (Decrease) Financial Measurements: Revenues (1) $251,835 $227,707 $ 24,128 11 % $227,707 $198,945 $ 28,762 14 % Gross contribution (1) $130,527 $112,384 $ 18,143 16 % $112,384 $91,216 $ 21,168 23 % Gross contribution margin 52 % 49 % 3 points 49 % 46 % 3 points Business Measurements: Number of events 65 61 4 7 % 61 64 (3 ) (5 )% Number of attendees 52,595 49,047 3,548 7 % 49,047 44,986 4,061 9 % (1) Dollars in thousands. 2015 VERSUS 2014 Events revenues increased $24.1 million when comparing 2015 to 2014, or 11%. Excluding the negative impact of foreign currency translation, revenues increased 18% year-over-year. We held 65 events in 2015, consisting of 61 ongoing events and 4 new events, compared to 61 events in 2014. The year-over-year revenue increase was primarily attributable to higher attendee revenue at our ongoing events and to a lesser extent, higher exhibitor revenue.The number of attendees in 2015 increased 7%, while the number of exhibitors increased 4%. Average revenue per attendee rose 9% and average revenue per exhibitor increased 2%. The gross contribution margin increased 3 points year-over-year. 2014 VERSUS 2013 Events revenues increased $28.8 million when comparing 2014 to 2013, or 14%. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, revenues increased 16% year-over-year. We held 61 events in 2014, consisting of 59 ongoing events and 2 new events, compared to 64 events in 2013. The year-over-year revenue increase was primarily attributable to higher exhibitor revenue at our ongoing events and to a lesser extent, higher attendee revenue. The overall number of attendees increased 9%, while the number of exhibitors increased 10%. Average revenue per attendee rose 6% and average revenue per exhibitor increased 9%. The gross contribution margin increased 3 points year-over-year. 28 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES We had $373.0 million of cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2015 and $656.0 million of available borrowing capacity under our 2014 Credit Agreement. In addition, the 2014 Credit Agreement contains an expansion feature by which the Company may borrow up to an additional $500.0 million in the aggregate under certain conditions. We believe that our consistently strong operating cash flow, as well as our existing cash balances and our available borrowing capacity under our 2014 Credit Agreement, provide us with adequate liquidity to meet our currently anticipated needs. However, should we need to borrow additional amounts, we believe we would be able to do so on reasonable terms. We had operating cash flow of $345.6 million in 2015. In addition, we also borrowed an additional $420.0 million on a net basis under our 2014 Credit Agreement. During 2015 we used $196.2 million in cash to acquire other businesses and we also used $509.0 million in cash to repurchase our common shares. We currently have a $1.2 billion board approved authorization to repurchase the Company's common stock, and as of December 31, 2015, approximately $1.1 billion of this authorization remains. We have historically generated significant cash flows from our operating activities. Our operating cash flow has been continuously enhanced by the leverage characteristics of our subscription-based business model as well as our focus on operational efficiencies. Revenues in our Research segment, which is our largest business segment, increased 10% in 2015 compared to 2014, and constituted 73% and 72% of our total revenues in 2015 and 2014, respectively. The majority of our research contracts are paid in advance and renew annually, and combined with a strong customer retention rate and high incremental margins, has resulted in continuously strong operating cash flow. Our cash flow generation has also benefited from our continuing efforts to improve the operating efficiencies of our businesses as well as a focus on the optimal management of our working capital as we increase our sales volume. Our cash and cash equivalents are held in numerous locations throughout the world. At December 31, 2015, approximately $351.0 million of our total of $373.0 million in cash and cash equivalents was held outside the U.S. Of the $351.0 million of cash and cash equivalents held overseas, approximately 80% represents unremitted earnings of our non-U.S subsidiaries. Under U.S. accounting rules, no provision for income taxes that may result from the remittance of such earnings is required if the Company intends to reinvest such funds overseas indefinitely. Our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these undistributed earnings to fund our U.S. operations or otherwise satisfy the liquidity needs of our U.S operations. We intend to reinvest these earnings in our non-U.S. operations, except in instances in which the repatriation of these earnings would result in minimal additional tax. As a result, the Company has not recognized additional income tax expense that could result from the remittance of these earnings. However, should our liquidity needs change or we decide to repatriate some or all of these unremitted earnings, we may be required to accrue additional taxes which could have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, cash flows, and results of operations in future periods. Changes in cash and cash equivalents The following table summarizes and explains the changes in our cash and cash equivalents for the three years ended December 31, 2015 (in thousands): 2015 vs. 2014 2014 vs. 2013 Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2015 Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2014 Increase (Decrease) Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2014 Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2013 Increase (Decrease) Cash provided by operating activities $ 345,561 $ 346,779 $ (1,218 ) $ 346,779 $ 315,654 $ 31,125 Cash used in investing activities (242,357 ) (162,777 ) (79,580 ) (162,777 ) (36,498 ) (126,279 ) Cash used by financing activities (67,690 ) (208,670 ) 140,980 (208,670 ) (153,855 ) (54,815 ) Net increase (decrease) 35,514 (24,668 ) 60,182 (24,668 ) 125,301 (149,969 ) Effects of exchange rate changes (1) (27,840 ) (34,020 ) 6,180 (34,020 ) (1,163 ) (32,857 ) Beginning cash and cash equivalents 365,302 423,990 (58,688 ) 423,990 299,852 124,138 Ending cash and cash equivalents $ 372,976 $ 365,302 $ 7,674 $ 365,302 $ 423,990 $ (58,688 ) (1) A number of foreign currencies in which we hold cash weakened relative to the U.S. dollar over the past two years. As a result, the effects of foreign currency exchange rates has had a significant impact on our cash and cash equivalents balances. 29 2015 VERSUS 2014 Operating Operating cash flow decreased slightly when comparing 2015 to 2014. The decrease reflects the negative impact of a stronger U.S. dollar and lower 2015 net income, as well as additional cash payments for employee incentives related to our acquisitions, income taxes, and interest on our debt obligations in the 2015 period. Partially offsetting these elements were additional collections in the 2015 period. Investing We used an additional $79.6 million of cash in our investing activities in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to the acquisitions we made during 2015. In total, we used $196.2 million and $124.3 million of cash (net of the cash acquired) for acquisitions in 2015 and 2014, respectively. The Company used both existing cash and additional borrowings to finance its 2015 acquisitions. We also used an additional $7.6 million in cash for capital expenditures in the 2015 period, with a total of $46.1 million used in 2015 compared to $38.5 million in 2014. Financing In total, we used $67.7 million of cash in our financing activities during 2015 compared to $208.7 million of cash used in 2014. The Company used $509.0 million of cash for share repurchases in 2015 compared to $432.0 million used for share repurchases in 2014. The Company borrowed an additional $420.0 million in 2015 on a net basis compared to $200.0 million of net additional borrowings in 2014. Additions to financing cash flows from employee share-based activities were $21.4 million 2015 and $28.0 million in 2014. 2014 VERSUS 2013 Operating Operating cash flow increased by $31.1 million, or 10%, when comparing 2014 to 2013. The increase was primarily due to additional cash collections in our Research and Events businesses and other positive working capital changes. Partially offsetting the additional collections were higher cash payments for bonuses, commissions, and income taxes. Investing We used an additional $126.3 million of cash in our investing activities in 2014 compared to 2013, principally due to the 2014 Acquisitions, in which we paid a total of $109.9 million (net of the cash acquired), and an additional $14.3 million was placed in escrow. The Company used both existing cash and additional borrowings to finance its 2014 acquisitions. We also used an additional $2.0 million in cash for capital expenditures in the 2014 period. Financing We used $208.7 million of cash in our financing activities during 2014 compared to $153.9 million of cash used in 2013. During 2014, the Company used $432.0 million of cash for share repurchases, which was partially offset by $195.4 million of net proceeds from debt issuance and related debt issuance costs and $28.0 million from employee share-based activity. During 2013, the Company used $182.0 million of cash for share repurchases and $4.0 million for debt refinancing fees, which was partially offset by $32.0 million from employee share-based activities. OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS 2014 Credit Agreement The Company has a five-year credit arrangement that it entered into in December 2014 that provides for a $400.0 million term loan and a $1.1 billion revolving credit facility (the 2014 Credit Agreement ). Under the revolving credit facility, amounts may be borrowed, repaid, and re-borrowed through the maturity date of the agreement in December 2019. The term and revolving facilities may be increased, at the Company's option, by up to an additional $500.0 million in the aggregate. As of December 31, 2015, the Company had $380.0 million outstanding under the term facility and $440.0 million under the revolver. See Note 5 - Debt in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the 2014 Credit Agreement. 30 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Through December 31, 2015, we have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements or transactions with unconsolidated entities or other persons. Contractual Cash Commitments The Company has certain commitments that contractually require future cash payments. The following table summarizes the contractual cash commitments due after December 31, 2015 (in thousands): Commitment Description: Due In Less Than 1 Year Due In 2-3 Years Due In 4-5 Years Due In More Than 5 Years Total Debt principal and interest (1), (2) $ 42,860 $ 115,689 $ 752,860 $ 5,060 $ 916,469 Operating leases (3) 40,910 67,214 44,314 111,555 263,993 Deferred compensation arrangement (4) 3,511 5,454 3,784 26,322 39,071 Other (5) 17,630 18,849 9,180 14,613 60,272 Totals $ 104,911 $ 207,206 $ 810,138 $ 157,550 $ 1,279,805 (1) Amounts borrowed under the Company's 2014 Credit Agreement, which matures in December 2019, have been classified in the table based on the scheduled repayment dates. Projected interest payments on amounts outstanding were based on the effective interest rates as of December 31, 2015. See Note 5 Debt in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. (2) The Company also has a $5.0 million State of Connecticut economic development loan which is classified in the Due In More Than 5 Years category since it has a 10 year maturity. Interest payments on the loan have been calculated based on the contractual fixed rate of interest. Under certain circumstances, part or all of this debt may be forgiven by the State. See Note 5 Debt in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. (3) The Company leases various facilities, furniture, computer equipment, and automobiles. These leases expire between 2016 and 2030. See Note 1 Business and Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the Company's leases. (4) The Company has a supplemental deferred compensation arrangement with certain employees (see Note 13 Employee Benefits in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information). Amounts payable with a known payment date have been classified in the table based on the payment date. Amounts payable whose payment date is unknown have been included in the Due In More Than 5 Years category since the Company cannot determine when the amounts will be paid. (5) The Other category includes (i) contractual commitments for software, building maintenance, telecom, and other services; (ii) amounts due for share repurchase transactions that occurred in late December 2015 but were settled in January 2016; and (iii) projected cash contributions to the Company's defined benefit pension plans. In addition to the contractual cash commitments included in the table above, the Company has other payables and liabilities that may be legally enforceable but are not considered contractual commitments. Information regarding the Company's payables and liabilities is included in Note 4 Accounts Payable, Accrued, and Other Liabilities in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Among these liabilities is approximately $30.0 million for unrecognized tax benefits and related interest and penalties. 31 QUARTERLY FINANCIAL DATA The following tables present our quarterly operating results for the two-year period ended December 31, 2015: 2015 (In thousands, except per share data) First Second Third Fourth Revenues $ 471,186 $ 547,936 $ 500,166 $ 643,768 Operating income 48,682 85,220 52,474 101,621 Net income 28,351 51,155 30,366 65,763 Net income per share: (1) Basic $ 0.33 $ 0.61 $ 0.37 $ 0.80 Diluted $ 0.32 $ 0.61 $ 0.36 $ 0.78 2014 (In thousands, except per share data) First Second Third Fourth Revenues $ 446,702 $ 519,820 $ 470,940 $ 583,979 Operating income 59,170 81,761 49,391 95,840 Net income 37,736 53,040 33,846 59,144 Net income per share: (1) Basic $ 0.41 $ 0.59 $ 0.38 $ 0.67 Diluted $ 0.40 $ 0.58 $ 0.38 $ 0.66 (1) The aggregate of the four quarters basic and diluted earnings per common share may not equal the reported full calendar year amounts due to the effects of share repurchases, dilutive equity compensation, and rounding. RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS Accounting rules issued by the various U.S. standard setting and governmental authorities that have not yet become effective and that may impact our Consolidated Financial Statements in future periods are described below, together with our assessment of the potential impact they may have on our Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures in future periods. Business Combinations In September 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2015-16, " Business Combinations - Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments " ("ASU No. 2015-16"). ASU No. 2015-16 requires the recognition of adjustments to business combination provisional amounts, that are identified during the measurement period, in the reporting period in which the adjustments are determined. The effects of the adjustments to provisional amounts on depreciation, amortization or other income effects should be recognized in current-period earnings as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. Disclosure of the portion of the adjustment recorded in current-period earnings that would have been reported in prior reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized at the acquisition date is also required. The rule is to be applied retrospectively and is effective for Gartner on January 1, 2016. ASU No. 2015-16 will not have an impact on the Company consolidated financial statements at the date of adoption. However, ASU No. 2016-16 could have an impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements in the future if a transaction occurs within the scope of the rule. Debt Issuance Cost Presentation In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs , which amends the current presentation of debt issuance costs in the financial statements. ASU No. 2015-03 requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts, instead of a deferred asset. The amendment is to be applied retrospectively and is effective for 32 Gartner on January 1, 2016. The adoption of the new guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company consolidated financial statements. Revenue Recognition In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, " Revenue from Contracts with Customers " ("ASU No. 2014-09"). ASU No. 2014-09 is intended to clarify the principles for recognizing revenue by: removing inconsistencies and weaknesses in revenue recognition requirements; providing a more robust framework for addressing revenue issues; improving comparability of revenue recognition practices across entities, industries, jurisdictions and capital markets; and providing more useful information to users of financial statements through improved revenue disclosure requirements. ASU No. 2014-09 is effective for Gartner on January 1, 2018. We continue to evaluate the impact of ASU No. 2014-09. The FASB also continues to work on a number of significant accounting rules which if issued could materially impact the Company's accounting policies and disclosures in future periods. However, since these rules have not yet been issued, the effective dates and potential impact are unknown.
