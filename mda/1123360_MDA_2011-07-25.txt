ITEM 7 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements about our plans and expectations of what may happen in the future. Forward-looking statements are based on a number of assumptions and estimates that are inherently subject to significant risks and uncertainties, and our results could differ materially from the results anticipated by our forward-looking statements as a result of many known and unknown factors, including but not limited to those discussed in Item 1A Risk Factors of this report. See also Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Statements located above Item 1 Business. You should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with Item 6 Selected Financial Data and Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data appearing elsewhere in this annual report. General We are a provider of electronic payments transaction processing services for consumers, merchants, Independent Sales Organizations (ISOs), financial institutions, government agencies and multi-national corporations located throughout the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Spain, the Asia-Pacific region, the Czech Republic and the Russian Federation. We serve as an intermediary to facilitate payments transactions and operate in two business segments, North America Merchant Services and International Merchant Services. We were incorporated in Georgia as Global Payments Inc. in September 2000 and spun-off from our former parent company on January 31, 2001. Including our time as part of our former parent company, we have been in business since 1967. Our North America Merchant Services and International Merchant Services segments target customers in many vertical industries including financial institutions, gaming, government, health care, professional services, restaurants, retail, universities, nonprofit organizations and utilities. Our offerings provide merchants, ISOs and financial institutions with credit and debit card transaction processing and check-related services. The majority of our business model provides payment products and services directly to merchants as our end customers. We also provide similar products and services to financial institutions and a limited number of ISOs that, in turn, resell our products and services, in which case, the financial institutions and select ISOs are our end customers. These particular services are marketed in the United States, Canada, and parts of Eastern Europe. The majority of merchant services revenue is generated on services priced as a percentage of transaction value or a specified fee per transaction, depending on card type. We also charge other fees based on specific services that are unrelated to the number of transactions or the transaction value. The majority of credit cards and signature debit cards, which are only a U.S. based card type, are based on a percentage of transaction value along with other related fees, while PIN debit cards are typically a fee per transaction. Our products and services are marketed through a variety of sales channels that include a dedicated direct sales force, ISOs, an internal telesales group, retail outlets, trade associations, alliance bank relationships and financial institutions. We seek to leverage the rapid adoption of, and transition to, card based payments by expanding market share in our existing markets through our distribution channels or through acquisitions in North America, the Asia-Pacific region and Europe, and investing in and leveraging technology and people, thereby maximizing shareholder value. We also seek to enter new markets through acquisitions in the Asia-Pacific region, Europe, and South America. Our business does not have pronounced seasonality in which more than 30% of our revenues occur in one quarter. However, each geographic channel has somewhat higher and lower quarters given the nature of the portfolio. For example, in our North American channels, the first and fourth quarters are generally the strongest, and the third quarter tends to be the slowest due to lower volumes in the months of January and February. In contrast, Asia-Pacific typically has a stronger third quarter, and the first quarter in Asia-Pacific and the United Kingdom, tends to be slower. 26 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Executive Overview On December 20, 2010, we acquired a 51% controlling financial interest in Comercia Global Payments Entidad de Pago, S.L. ( Comercia ), a newly formed company into which Caixa d Estalvis i Pensions de Barcelona ( la Caixa ) contributed its merchant acquiring business in Spain. la Caixa owns the remaining 49% of Comercia. We purchased our share of Comercia for 125 million. The shareholders contributed a total of 6.4 million as initial capital to form Comercia. Our total investment in Comercia, including our 51% share of the initial capital was 128.3 million ($173.5 million as of the closing date). We manage the day-to-day operations of the corporation, control all major decisions and, accordingly, consolidate the corporation financial results for accounting purposes effective with the closing date. In conjunction with the acquisition, la Caixa agreed to a twenty-year marketing alliance agreement in which la Caixa will refer customers to Comercia for payment processing services in Spain and provide sponsorship into the card networks. We funded the purchase with a combination of existing cash resources in Europe and borrowings on our Corporate Credit Facility. Revenues increased $217.3 million during fiscal 2011 compared to the prior year. Revenue growth was driven by our North America merchant services segment as a result of our direct ISO channel which continues to gain market share in the United States. Revenues for fiscal 2011 also increased by 18% in our International merchant services segment compared to the prior year. This increase is due to the impact of our acquisition in Spain on December 20, 2010. In addition, our merchant services revenue increased due to business performance in the United Kingdom, Russia, and, particularly, the Asia Pacific region. Consolidated operating margins during fiscal 2011 declined to 17.8% compared to 19.7% in the prior year. The decline in operating margins is due to the dilutive impact of ISO transactions, Canada pricing compression, the dilutive impact of our Spain acquisition and increased corporate costs, offset by improved margins in the International merchant services segment. Sales, general and administrative costs increased $128.6 million, or 18% due to employee termination benefits, relocation benefits and expenses related to a new Global Service Center in Manila, Philippines, and proportional increases in commission payments to ISOs as a percentage of ISO revenues. For the fiscal year 2011, currency exchange rate fluctuations increased our revenues by $19.2 million and our earnings by $0.08 per diluted share. To calculate this impact, we converted our fiscal 2011 actual revenues and expenses from continuing operations using average exchange rates for fiscal 2010. 27 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Results of Operations Fiscal Year Ended May 31, 2011 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended May 31, 2010 The following table shows key selected financial data for the fiscal years ended May 31, 2011 and 2010, this data as a percentage of total revenues, and the changes between fiscal years in dollars and as a percentage of fiscal 2010. 2011 % of Revenue (1) 2010 % of Revenue ( 1) Change % Change (dollar amounts in thousands) Revenues: United States $ 1,031,997 55 % $ 902,844 55 % $ 129,153 14 % Canada 330,872 18 317,272 19 13,600 4 North America merchant services 1,362,869 73 1,220,116 74 142,753 12 Europe 359,567 19 315,023 19 44,544 14 Asia-Pacific 137,366 7 107,329 7 30,037 28 International merchant services 496,933 27 422,352 26 74,581 18 Total revenues $ 1,859,802 100 % $ 1,642,468 100 % $ 217,334 13 % Consolidated operating expenses: Cost of service $ 665,017 35.8 % $ 584,609 35.6 % $ 80,408 14 % Sales, general and administrative 863,191 46.4 734,580 44.7 128,611 18 Operating income $ 331,594 17.8 % $ 323,279 19.7 % $ 8,315 3 % Operating income for segments: North America merchant services $ 268,233 $ 275,386 $ (7,153 ) (3 )% International merchant services 143,911 113,699 30,212 27 Corporate (80,550 ) (65,806 ) (14,744 ) (22 ) Operating income $ 331,594 $ 323,279 $ 8,315 3 % Operating margin for segments: North America merchant services 19.7 % 22.6 % (2.9 )% International merchant services 29.0 % 26.9 % 2.1 % (1) Percentage amounts may not sum to the total due to rounding. Revenues We derive our revenues from three primary sources: charges based on volumes and fees for services, charges based on transaction quantity, and equipment sales, leases and service fees. Revenues generated by these areas depend upon a number of factors, such as demand for and price of our services, the technological competitiveness of our product offerings, our reputation for providing timely and reliable service, competition within our industry and general economic conditions. For fiscal 2011, revenues increased 13% to $1,859.8 million compared to the prior year. 28 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements North America Merchant Services Segment For fiscal 2011, revenue from our North America merchant services segment increased 12% to $1,362.9 million. We grow our United States revenue by adding small and mid-market merchants in diversified vertical markets, primarily through our ISO channel. For fiscal 2011, United States revenue grew 14% as transaction growth of 18% was offset by a 4% decrease in average dollar amount per transaction ( average ticket ). We believe this decline in average ticket is due to a shift toward smaller merchants added through our ISO channel. Smaller merchants tend to have lower average tickets when compared to larger merchants. The effect of consumers replacing cash-based payments with debit card transactions increases volume but also lowers our overall United States average ticket amounts. Based on our mix of merchants, slightly more than half of our United States transactions are comprised of a combination of signature- and PIN-based debit, with PIN-based debit representing less than 10% of our total transactions. For fiscal 2011, our Canadian revenue increased 4% compared to the prior year period. The increase in revenue was due to favorable foreign currency trends in Canada, which were offset, on a year-to-date basis, by reduced spreads due to market-driven pricing pressure compared to the prior year. International Merchant Services Segment For fiscal 2011, International merchant services revenue increased 18% to $496.9 million. Our Europe merchant services revenue for fiscal 2011 increased 14% to $359.6 million compared to the prior year period. Our Europe merchant services revenue increased primarily due to the impact of our acquisition in Spain on December 20, 2010. Asia-Pacific merchant services revenue for fiscal 2011 increased 28% to $137.4 million compared to the prior year period. The growth was due to business performance in the Asia-Pacific region helped by the roll-out of new products by a major retailer with both physical and e-commerce transactions in several markets in the region and continued growth of our installment payment plan and dynamic currency conversion products. Consolidated Operating Expenses Cost of service consists primarily of the following costs: operations-related personnel, including those who monitor our transaction processing systems and settlement functions; assessment fees paid to card networks; transaction processing systems, including third-party services such as the costs for transition services paid to HSBC in the Asia-Pacific market and the United Kingdom; network telecommunications capability; depreciation and occupancy costs associated with the facilities performing these functions; amortization of intangible assets; and provisions for operating losses. Cost of service increased 14% to $665.0 million for fiscal 2011 compared to the prior year. As a percentage of revenue, cost of service increased to 35.8% of revenue for fiscal 2011 from 35.6% for the prior year. Sales, general and administrative expenses consists primarily of salaries, wages and related expenses paid to sales personnel; non-revenue producing customer support functions and administrative employees and management; commissions paid to ISOs, independent contractors, and other third parties, advertising costs; other selling expenses, share-based compensation expenses and occupancy of leased space directly related to these functions. Sales, general and administrative expenses increased 18% to $863.2 million for fiscal 2011 compared to the prior year. This increase was primarily due to employee termination benefits, relocation benefits and expenses related to a new Global Service Center in Manila, Philippines, and proportional increases in commission payments to ISOs as a percentage of ISO revenues. 29 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Operating Income and Operating Margin for Segments For the purpose of discussing segment operations, we refer to operating income as calculated by subtracting segment direct expenses from segment revenue. Overhead and shared expenses, including share-based compensation costs, are not allocated to segment operations; they are reported in the caption Corporate. Similarly, references to operating margin regarding segment operations mean segment operating income divided by segment revenue. North America Merchant Services Segment Operating income in the North America merchant services segment decreased 3% to $268.2 million for fiscal 2011 compared to the prior year. The operating margin was 19.7% and 22.6% for fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively. Growth in the U.S. ISO channel reduced margins in fiscal 2011. The ISO channel generally has a dilutive effect on our operating margin compared to our other channels due to the ongoing commission payments to the ISOs. North America margins were also unfavorably affected by competitive pricing pressure in Canada. International Merchant Services Segment Operating income in International merchant services increased 27% to $143.9 million for fiscal 2011 compared to the prior year. The operating margin was 29.0% and 26.9% for fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively. The increase in operating margin is due to improving economies of scale and growth in the International merchant services segment. We completed the migration of merchants in the United Kingdom to our back-end processing platform at the end of February 2011. Corporate Our corporate expenses include costs associated with our Atlanta headquarters, the Global Service Center in Manila, Philippines, insurance, employee incentive programs, and certain corporate staffing areas, including finance, accounting, legal, human resources, marketing, and executive. Corporate also includes expenses associated with our share-based compensation programs. Our corporate costs increased 22% to $80.6 million for fiscal 2011 compared to the prior year. These increases are primarily due to expenses related to our new Global Service Center in Manila, Philippines and employee termination and relocation benefits. Consolidated Operating Income During fiscal 2011, our consolidated operating income increased $8.3 million to $331.6 million compared to the prior year. The increase in our consolidated operating income is due to the increases in our International merchant services segment, offset by a decrease in North America merchant services and increased corporate, sales, general and administrative expenses as discussed above. Consolidated Other Income/Expense, Net Other expense, net, decreased to $7.4 million for fiscal 2011 compared to expense of $12.9 million in the prior year. The decrease in other expense is due to lower interest expense because of lower term loan borrowings outstanding and lower interest rates. In addition, we recognized a previously deferred gain of $2.6 million, which was recognized during fiscal 2011 for the sale of our 20% interest in Global Payments Credit Services ( GPCS ) to Equifax Decision Systems, BV. See Note 13 Commitments and Contingencies in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements for further information. 30 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Provision for Income Taxes Our effective tax rates, reflected as the provision for income taxes divided by income from continuing operations before income tax, were 29.3% and 28.2% for fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively. During fiscal 2011 our effective tax rate was negatively impacted by an adjustment to our UK deferred tax asset driven by the corporate tax rate reduction in the United Kingdom enacted in July 2010. We have net deferred tax assets associated with our UK business of $100.6 million. The measurement of such deferred tax assets is based, in part, on the current enacted corporate tax rate in the United Kingdom of 27%. The 2011 United Kingdom budget includes a reduction in the corporate tax rate from 27% to 26%. Upon enactment of this rate, which is expected during the first half of our fiscal year 2012, we estimate that we will record a reduction of our UK deferred tax asset and an corresponding increase to our deferred income tax provision of approximately $2.5 million. Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests increased to $18.9 million from $15.8 million in the prior year primarily due to our acquisition of a 51% controlling financial interest in Comercia on December 20, 2010. Fiscal Year Ended May 31, 2010 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended May 31, 2009 The following table shows key selected financial data for the fiscal years ended May 31, 2010 and 2009, this data as a percentage of total revenues, and the changes between fiscal years in dollars and as a percentage of fiscal 2009. 2010 % of Revenue (1) 2009 % of Revenue(1) Change % Change (dollar amounts in thousands) Revenues: United States $ 902,844 55 % $ 805,557 55 % $ 97,287 12 % Canada 317,272 19 301,294 21 15,978 5 North America merchant services 1,220,116 74 1,106,851 76 113,265 10 Europe 315,023 19 265,121 18 49,902 19 Asia-Pacific 107,329 7 90,334 6 16,995 19 International merchant services 422,352 26 355,455 24 66,897 19 Total revenues $ 1,642,468 100 % $ 1,462,306 100 % $ 180,162 12 % Consolidated operating expenses: Cost of service $ 584,609 35.6 % $ 504,855 34.5 % $ 79,754 16 % Sales, general and administrative 734,580 44.7 664,905 45.5 69,675 10 Operating income $ 323,279 19.7 % $ 292,546 20.0 % $ 30,733 10 % Operating income for segments: North America merchant services $ 275,386 $ 272,972 $ 2,414 1 % International merchant services 113,699 82,763 30,936 37 Corporate (65,806 ) (63,189 ) (2,617 ) (4 ) Operating income $ 323,279 $ 292,546 $ 30,733 10 % Operating margin for segments: North America merchant services 22.6 % 24.7 % (2.1 )% International merchant services 26.9 % 23.3 % 3.6 % (1) Percentage amounts may not sum to the total due to rounding. 31 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Revenues We derive our revenues from three primary sources: charges based on volumes and fees for services, charges based on transaction quantity and equipment sales, leases and service fees. Revenues generated by these areas depend upon a number of factors, such as demand for and price of our services, the technological competitiveness of our product offerings, our reputation for providing timely and reliable service, competition within our industry and general economic conditions. In fiscal 2010, revenues increased 12% to $1,642.5 million compared to the prior year. 32 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements North America Merchant Services Segment In fiscal 2010, revenue from our North America merchant services segment increased 10% to $1,220.1 million compared to the prior year. We have grown our United States revenue by adding small and mid-market merchants in diversified vertical markets, primarily through our ISO channel. For fiscal 2010, our United States direct credit and debit card processed transactions grew 18%, and our total United States revenue grew 12% compared to the prior year. In fiscal 2010 compared to the prior year, our United States direct credit and debit card average dollar value of transaction, or average ticket, decreased approximately 8%. We believe this decline is due to a combination of lower consumer spending as a result of a weakened economy, the industry shift of increasing debit transactions and a shift toward smaller merchants added through our ISO channel. Smaller merchants tend to have lower average tickets than larger merchants. The effect of consumers replacing cash-based payments with debit card transactions and the increasing acceptance of credit cards for small dollar transactions also lowers our overall average ticket amounts. Based on our mix of merchants, approximately 60% of our United States transactions are comprised of a combination of signature- and PIN-based debit transactions, with PIN-based debit transactions representing less than 10% of our total transactions. Aside from the impact of changes in our average ticket, the remaining differences between our transaction growth and revenue growth are due to our service fees, equipment fees, check-related services and our domestic indirect revenue. Revenue from these services grew at a lesser rate than our credit and debit card transaction growth. For fiscal 2010, our Canadian revenue increased 5% compared to the prior year. This growth was due to favorable foreign currency trends, offset by challenging macroeconomic conditions which resulted in reduced spreads due to market-driven pricing pressure as compared to the prior year. International Merchant Services Segment For fiscal 2010, International merchant services revenue increased 19% to $422.4 million compared to the prior year. Our Europe merchant services revenue for fiscal 2010 increased 19% to $315.0 million compared to the prior year. This growth was primarily due to our April 30, 2009 acquisition of UCS in the Russian Federation, in addition to solid business performance in the United Kingdom. Asia-Pacific merchant services revenue for fiscal 2010 increased 19% to $107.3 million compared to the prior year period. The growth was primarily due to business performance in the Asia Pacific region driven in part by the increasing penetration of dynamic currency conversion products in the region. The growth for the fiscal 2010 also reflects our acquisition of Global Payments Asia-Pacific Philippines Incorporated on September 4, 2008. Consolidated Operating Expenses Cost of service consists primarily of the following costs: operations-related personnel, including those who monitor our transaction processing systems and settlement functions; assessment fees paid to card networks; transaction processing systems, including third-party services such as the costs of settlement channels for transition services paid to HSBC in the Asia-Pacific market and the United Kingdom; network telecommunications capability, depreciation and occupancy costs associated with the facilities performing these functions; amortization of intangible assets; and provisions for operating losses. Cost of service increased 16% to $584.6 million for fiscal 2010 compared to the prior year comparable period. As a percentage of revenue, cost of service increased to 35.6% of revenue for the fiscal 2010 from 34.5% for the prior year. The growth in cost of service expenses was due to our UCS acquisition, increases in variable processing expenses such as card network assessments and fees associated with our revenue growth and the impact of our June 30, 2008 acquisition of 51% of HSBC Merchant Services LLP. 33 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Sales, general and administrative expenses consists primarily of salaries, wages and related expenses paid to sales personnel, non-revenue producing customer support functions and administrative employees and management, commissions to independent contractors and ISOs, advertising costs, other selling expenses, share-based compensation expenses and occupancy of leased space directly related to these functions. Sales, general and administrative expenses increased 10% to $734.6 million for fiscal 2010 compared to the prior year comparable period. As a percentage of revenue, these expenses decreased to 44.7% for fiscal 2010 compared to 45.5% in the prior year comparable period. Operating Income and Operating Margin for Segments For the purpose of discussing segment operations, we refer to operating income as calculated by subtracting segment direct expenses from segment revenue. Overhead and shared expenses, including share-based compensation costs, are not allocated to the segments operations; they are reported in the caption Corporate. Similarly, references to operating margin regarding segment operations mean segment operating income divided by segment revenue. North America Merchant Services Segment Operating income in the North America merchant services segment increased 1% to $275.4 million for fiscal 2010 compared to the prior year comparable period. The operating margin was 22.6% and 24.7% for the fiscal years ended, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Growth in the United States ISO channel reduced margins for fiscal 2010. The ISO channel generally has a dilutive effect on our operating margin compared to our other channels due to the ongoing commission payments to the ISOs. International Merchant Services Segment Operating income in the International merchant services segment increased 37% to $113.7 million for fiscal 2010 compared to the prior year comparable period. The operating margin was 26.9% and 23.3% for the fiscal years ended, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The increase in operating margin is due to the acquisition of HSBC Merchant Services LLP and the higher operating margins in the United Kingdom and expanding margins in the Asia-Pacific region. Corporate Our corporate expenses primarily include costs associated with our Atlanta headquarters, insurance, employee incentive programs, and certain corporate staffing areas, including finance, accounting, legal, human resources, marketing, and executive. Our corporate costs increased 4% to $65.8 million for fiscal 2010 compared to the prior year comparable period. Consolidated Operating Income During fiscal 2010, our consolidated operating income increased $30.7 million to $323.3 million compared to the prior year comparable period. This increase was primarily due to the impact of growth in our International merchant services segment. Consolidated Other Income/Expense, Net Other income and expense consists primarily of interest income and interest expense. Other expense, net increased to $12.9 million for fiscal 2010 compared to $0.3 million in the prior year comparable period. This increase in other expense, net was primarily due to higher debt balances and, to a lesser extent, lower interest income. Interest rates decreased during fiscal 2010 when compared to the prior year. This decline in interest rates partially offset the impact of increased debt balances on interest expense and contributed to lower interest income. 34 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Provision for Income Taxes Our effective tax rates were 28.2% and 29.2% for fiscal years, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The reductions of our effective tax rates are due to domestic and international tax planning initiatives and the increasing amount of income being generated in lower tax jurisdictions due to international expansion. Loss from Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax During fiscal 2010, we reported a net loss from discontinued operations of $3.9 million ($0.04 diluted loss per share) compared to a net loss of $132.8 million ($1.64 diluted loss per share) in the prior year. The prior year results reflect our pre-tax impairment charge of $147.7 million in our money transfer business during the three months ended February 28, 2009. During fiscal 2010, loss from discontinued operations, net of tax includes an estimated pre-tax loss on disposal of $24.6 million and an income tax benefit associated with the disposal of $15.7 million. Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests Noncontrolling interests, net of tax decreased to $15.8 million from $37.0 million for the fiscal years 2010 and 2009, respectively. The decrease was due to our June 2009 acquisition of the remaining 49% of HSBC Merchant Services LLP. Liquidity and Capital Resources A significant portion of our liquidity comes from operating cash flows and available lines of credit, which are generally sufficient to fund operations, planned capital expenditures, debt service and various strategic investments in our business. Cash flow from operations is used to make planned capital investments in our business, to pursue acquisitions that meet our corporate objectives, to pay dividends, and to pay off debt and repurchase our shares at the discretion of our Board of Directors. Accumulated cash balances are invested in high-quality and marketable short term instruments. Our capital plan objectives are to support our operational needs and strategic plan for long-term growth while maintaining a low cost of capital. Lines of credit are used in certain of our markets to fund settlement and as a source of working capital and, along with other bank financing, to fund acquisitions. We regularly evaluate our liquidity and capital position relative to cash objectives, and we may elect to raise additional funds in the future, either through the issuance of debt, equity or otherwise. To meet our current capital plan objectives, we entered into a new, unsecured five-year, $600 million revolving credit facility on December 7, 2010. Please see Long-Term Debt and Credit Facilities below for further information regarding this facility. At May 31, 2011, we had cash and cash equivalents totaling $1,354.3 million. Of this amount, we consider approximately $240 million to be available cash. Our available cash balance includes $165.0 million of cash held by foreign subsidiaries that are considered permanently reinvested for income tax purposes. These cash balances reflect the accumulation of cash flows generated by each subsidiary operations, net of cash flows used to service debt locally and fund non-US acquisitions. We believe that we are able to maintain a sufficient level of liquidity for our domestic operations and commitments without repatriation of the cash held by these foreign subsidiaries. Available cash generally excludes settlement related and merchant reserve cash balances. Settlement related cash balances represent funds that we hold on behalf of our member sponsors when the incoming amount from the card networks precedes the member sponsors funding obligation to the merchant. At May 31, 2011, settlement related cash balances and the corresponding settlement processing obligations were unusually high due to the timing of month end cut off. Merchant reserve cash balances represent funds collected from our merchants that serve as collateral ( Merchant Reserves ) to minimize contingent liabilities associated with any losses that may occur under the merchant agreement. At May 31, 2011, our cash and cash equivalents included $271.4 million related to Merchant Reserves. While this cash is not restricted in its use, we believe that 35 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements designating this cash to collateralize Merchant Reserves strengthens our fiduciary standing with our member sponsors and is in accordance with the guidelines set by the card networks. See Cash and cash equivalents and Settlement processing assets and obligations under Note 1 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional details. Operating activities provided cash of $709.8 million during fiscal year 2011 compared to providing cash of $465.8 million during the prior year. The increase in cash flow from operating activities was primarily due to the change in net settlement processing assets and obligations of $159.0 million. As noted above, our settlement processing obligations were unusually high at May 31, 2011 due to the timing of month end cut off. See Settlement processing assets and obligations under Note 1 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional details. Net cash used in investing activities increased $241.8 million to $267.0 million for fiscal 2011. During fiscal year 2011, we used $168.0 million in acquisitions, which included a $165.0 million, net of cash, investment in Comercia. Also, during fiscal year 2011 we had capital expenditures of $98.5 million which was primarily for terminals, software and infrastructure. During fiscal year 2010 we had $29.5 million of cash investments in Auctionpay (currently known as Greater Giving) and other asset purchases. Also, during fiscal year 2010 we had capital expenditures of $56.1 million which was primarily for terminals, software and infrastructure. We received net proceeds from the disposition of our money transfer business of $60.2 million (sales proceeds of $85.0 million less $24.8 million remaining in the business at closing to fund associated settlement obligations) during fiscal year 2010. In fiscal year 2011, we generated $114.1 million in cash from financing activities compared to $95.8 million cash used in financing activities in the prior year. The increase in cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to increased line of credit borrowings in the Asia Pacific region, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Spain to fund settlement, and borrowings on our Corporate Credit Facility. This increase in cash provided by financing activities was offset by higher debt repayments in fiscal year 2011. We are not contractually obligated to make repayments on the Corporate Credit Facility within the next twelve months; however, we intend to make repayments in the near future. See Long-Term Debt and Credit Facilities below for a more detailed discussion of our borrowing activities. In addition, in fiscal year 2011 we repurchased an additional 344,847 shares of our common stock for $14.9 million in cash, $1.9 million of which represents the cash settlement of the $100.0 million purchase executed during fiscal year 2010 (2,382,890 shares of our common stock). We believe that our current level of cash and borrowing capacity under our lines of credit described below, together with future cash flows from operations, are sufficient to meet the needs of our existing operations and planned requirements for the foreseeable future. During fiscal year 2012, we expect capital expenditures to range between $85.0 and $90.0 million. 36 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Long-Term Debt and Lines of Credit Outstanding debt consisted of the following: May 31, 2011 May 31, 2010 Lines of credit: (in thousands) Corporate Credit Facility $ 183,975 $ Short-term lines of credit: United Kingdom Credit Facility 108,333 Hong Kong Credit Facility 73,554 63,786 Canada Credit Facility 18,725 Malaysia Credit Facility 17,743 Spain Credit Facility 17,646 Singapore Credit Facility 17,245 Philippines Credit Facility 9,736 9,064 Maldives Credit Facility 3,202 2,501 Macau Credit Facility 2,372 1,454 Sri Lanka Credit Facility 2,189 2,382 270,745 79,187 Total lines of credit 454,720 79,187 Notes Payable 14,285 10,064 Term loans 155,759 411,070 Total debt $ 624,764 $ 500,321 Current portion $ 356,547 $ 227,356 Long-term debt 268,217 272,965 Total debt $ 624,764 $ 500,321 Maturity requirements on term loans and notes payable are as follows (in thousands): 2012 $ 356,547 2013 77,758 2014 2,725 2015 2,484 2016 185,250 Total $ 624,764 We had increased borrowings on our lines of credit at May 31, 2011 to fund settlement as noted above. Our 2012 maturities should be considered with our increased cash balances at May 31, 2011. Lines of Credit Our line of credit facilities are used to provide a source of working capital and for general corporate purposes, while the Corporate Credit Facility is additionally available to fund future strategic acquisitions. Certain of our line of credit facilities allow us to fund merchants for credit and debit card transactions prior to receipt of corresponding settlement funds from credit and debit card networks. With certain of our credit facilities, the facility nets the amounts pre-funded to merchants against specific cash balances in local Global Payments accounts, which we characterize as cash and cash equivalents. Therefore, the amounts reported in lines of credit, which represents the amounts pre-funded to merchants, may exceed the stated credit limit, when in fact the combined position is less than the credit limit. The total available borrowings under our credit facilities at May 31, 2011 were $892.7 million. 37 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements During fiscal 2011 the maximum and average borrowings under our credit facilities were $565.3 million and $360.3 million, respectively. The weighted average interest rates on these borrowings were 1.9% and 2.2%, respectively. Our maximum borrowed amount was greater than our average and period end borrowings due to the timing of settlement funding. Our line of credit facilities consist of the following: Corporate On December 7, 2010, we entered into a new, unsecured five-year, $600.0 million revolving credit facility, which we refer to as the Corporate Credit Facility with a syndicate of financial institutions. The multi-currency facility expires in December 2015 and has a variable interest rate based on a market short-term interest rate plus a leverage based margin. In addition, the Corporate Credit Facility allows us to expand the facility size to $750.0 million by requesting additional commitments from new or existing lenders. The Corporate Credit Facility contains certain financial and non-financial covenants and events of default customary for financings of this nature. We plan to use the Corporate Credit Facility to support strategic growth initiatives and for general corporate purposes, and we used approximately $150.0 million of the new facility to pay down existing term loan debt. As of May 31, 2011, interest rates on the term loan were 1.7% and 2.1%, for United States dollar and British Pound Sterling borrowings, respectively, and the aggregate outstanding balance was $184.0 million. The Corporate Credit Facility is included in long-term debt in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets because we are not contractually obligated to make repayments in the next twelve months. In conjunction with our entry into the Corporate Credit Facility on December 7, 2010, we terminated our United States Credit Facility, which was due to expire in November 2011. United Kingdom a revolving credit facility with HSBC Bank, for up to 80.0 million to fund merchants prior to receipt of corresponding settlement funds from the card associations.

This facility is subject to annual review. Macau a revolving overdraft facility with HSBC Asia Pacific, for 40.0 million Macau Pataca to fund merchants prior to receipt of corresponding settlement funds from the card associations. In addition, the Macau Credit Facility allows us to expand the size of the uncommitted facility to 150 million Macau Pataca. This credit facility has a variable interest rate based on the lending rate stipulated by HSBC Asia Pacific, less a margin. As of May 31, 2011 the interest rate on the facility was 2.5%. This facility is subject to annual review. Sri Lanka a revolving overdraft facility with HSBC Bank, Sri Lanka, for 650.0 million Sri Lankan Rupees in two tranches: one to fund merchants prior to receipt of corresponding settlement funds from the card associations and the other for general corporate purposes. The facility has a variable short term interest rate plus a margin. As of May 31, 2011 the interest rate on the two tranches of the facility was 10.1%. This facility is subject to annual review. National Bank of Canada a revolving credit facility for up to $80.0 million Canadian dollars and $5 million United States dollars to provide certain Canadian merchants with same day value for their Canadian and United States dollar MasterCard credit card transactions and debit card transactions. This credit facility has a variable short term interest rate plus a margin. As of May 31, 2011 the facility was undrawn. Term Loans We have a five year unsecured $200.0 million term loan agreement with a syndicate of banks in the United States which we used to partially fund our HSBC Merchant Services LLP acquisition. The term loan bears interest, at our election, at the prime rate or LIBOR, plus a leverage based margin. As of May 31, 2011 and 2010, the interest rate on the term loan was 1.26% and 1.4%, respectively. The term loan calls for quarterly principal payments of $5.0 million beginning with the quarter ended August 31, 2008 and increasing to $10.0 million beginning with the quarter ended August 31, 2010 and $15.0 million beginning with the quarter ending August 31, 2011. As of May 31, 2011, the outstanding balance of the term loan was $120.0 million. We have a $300.0 million term loan agreement ($230.0 million and 43.5 million) with a syndicate of financial institutions. We used the proceeds of this term loan to pay down our then-existing credit facility which had been used to initially fund the purchase of the remaining 49% interest in the LLP. In December 2010, the entire balance of the United States dollar portion of the term loan was repaid by a borrowing on the Corporate Credit Facility, and the facility terms were amended. The term loan expires in July 2012 and has a variable interest rate based on the London Interbank Offered Rate plus a leverage based margin. As of May 31, 2011, the interest rate on the remaining British Pound Sterling portion of the term loan was 2.1%. The term loan requires quarterly 39 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements principal payments of 2.2 million beginning with the quarter ended August 31, 2009 and increasing to 3.3 million beginning with the quarter ended August 31, 2010. As of May 31, 2011, the outstanding balance of this term loan was $35.8 million ( 21.7 million). Notes Payable Our subsidiary in the Russian Federation has notes payable with a total outstanding balance of approximately $14.3 million at May 31, 2011. These notes are used to fund the purchase of ATMs and have interest rates ranging from 8.0% to 10.0% with maturity dates ranging from June 2011 through May 2016. Compliance with Covenants There are certain financial and non-financial covenants contained in our various credit facilities and term loans. Our term loan agreements include financial covenants requiring a leverage ratio no greater than 3.25 to 1.00 and a fixed charge coverage ratio no less than 2.50 to 1.00. We complied with these covenants as of May 31, 2011. Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest We have a redeemable noncontrolling interest associated with our Asia-Pacific merchant services business channel. Global Payments Asia-Pacific, Limited, or GPAP, is the entity through which we conduct our merchant acquiring business in the Asia-Pacific region. We own 56% of GPAP and HSBC Asia Pacific owns the remaining 44%. The GPAP shareholders agreement includes provisions pursuant to which HSBC Asia Pacific may compel us to purchase, at the lesser of fair value or a net revenue multiple, additional GPAP shares from HSBC Asia Pacific (the Put Option ). HSBC Asia Pacific may exercise the Put Option on the fifth anniversary of the closing of the acquisition (July 24, 2011) and on each anniversary thereafter. By exercising the Put Option, HSBC Asia Pacific can require us to purchase, on an annual basis, up to 15% of the total issued shares of GPAP. HSBC Asia Pacific did not exercise the Put Option as of July 24, 2011. We estimate the maximum total redemption amount of the redeemable noncontrolling interest under the Put Option would be $133.9 million as of May 31, 2011, $45.6 million of which was puttable to us on July 24, 2011. We have adjusted our redeemable noncontrolling interest to reflect the maximum redemption amount as of May 31, 2011 on our consolidated balance sheet. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby we have financial guarantees, subordinated retained interest, derivative instruments, or other contingent arrangements that expose us to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities, or other obligations under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides us with financing, liquidity, market, or credit risk support other than the guarantee products described under Critical Accounting Estimates below. BIN/ICA Agreements In connection with our acquisition of merchant credit card operations of banks, we have entered into sponsorship or depository and processing agreements with certain of the banks. These agreements allow us to use the banks identification numbers, referred to as Bank Identification Number for Visa transactions and Interbank Card Association number for MasterCard transactions, to clear credit card transactions through Visa and MasterCard. Certain of such agreements contain financial covenants, and we were in compliance with all such covenants as of May 31, 2011. 40 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Commitments and Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments as of May 31, 2011: Payments Due by Future Period Total Less than 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years 5+ Years (in thousands) Operating leases (Note 13) $ 60,727 $ 7,802 $ 14,201 $ 11,966 $ 26,758 Long-term debt including current portion (Note 6) 624,764 356,547 80,483 187,734 Interest on long-term debt (1) 5,444 3,156 1,925 363 (1) Interest on variable rate debt is based on rates effective as of May 31, 2011. Note: This table excludes other obligations that we may have, such as employee benefit plan obligations, unrecognized tax benefits, and other current and long term liabilities reflected in our consolidated balance sheet and the redeemable noncontrolling interest put option rights described above. At this time, we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of these payments; therefore such amounts are not included in the above contractual obligation table. We do not have any material purchase commitments as of May 31, 2011. Critical Accounting Estimates In applying the accounting policies that we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements, we necessarily make accounting estimates that affect our reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Some of these accounting estimates require us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time we make the accounting estimates. We base these assumptions and the resulting estimates on historical information and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, and we evaluate these assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis. In many instances, however, we reasonably could have used different accounting estimates and, in other instances, changes in our accounting estimates could occur from period to period, with the result in each case being a material change in the financial statement presentation of our financial condition or results of operations. We refer to accounting estimates of this type as critical accounting estimates. The critical accounting estimates that we discuss below are those that we believe are most important to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements. Accounting estimates necessarily require subjective determinations about future events and conditions. Therefore, the following descriptions of critical accounting estimates are forward-looking statements, and actual results could differ materially from the results anticipated by these forward-looking statements. You should read the following in conjunction with Note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and the risk factors contained in Item 1A Risk Factors of this annual report. Reserve for operating losses As a part of our direct merchant credit card and debit card processing services and check guarantee services in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Spain, Asia-Pacific and the Russian Federation we experience merchant losses and check guarantee losses, which we collectively refer to as operating losses. Merchant losses occur when we are unable to collect amounts from merchant customers for any charges properly reversed by the cardholder. Check guarantee losses occur when we are unable to collect the full amount of a guaranteed check from the checkwriter. Please refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements for a further explanation of these operating losses. We process credit card transactions for direct merchants and recognize revenue based on a percentage of the gross amount charged. Our direct merchant customers have the liability for any charges properly reversed by the cardholder. In the event, however, that we are not able to collect such amount from the merchants, due to 41 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements merchant fraud, insolvency, bankruptcy or any other reason, we may be liable for any such reversed charges. We require cash deposits, guarantees, letters of credit and other types of collateral by certain merchants to minimize any such contingent liability, and we also utilize a number of systems and procedures to manage merchant risk. We have, however, historically experienced losses due to merchant defaults. We account for our potential liability relating to merchant losses as guarantees. We estimate the fair value of these guarantees by adding a fair value margin to our estimate of losses. This estimate of losses is comprised of two components, (i) estimated incurred losses, and (ii) a projection of future losses. Estimated incurred loss accruals are recorded when it is probable that we have incurred a loss and the loss is reasonably estimable. These losses typically result from chargebacks related to merchant bankruptcies, closures, or fraud. Estimated incurred losses are calculated at the merchant level based on chargebacks received to date, processed volume, and historical chargeback ratios. The estimate is reduced for any collateral that we hold. Accruals for estimated incurred losses are evaluated periodically and adjusted as appropriate based on actual loss experience. The projection of future losses component is based on an assumed percentage of our direct merchant credit card and signature debit card sales volumes processed, or processed volume. For the years ended May 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, our processed volume was $167.3 billion, $146.6 billion, and $135.0 billion, respectively. For these same periods, we recorded provisions for merchant losses of $6.0 million, $9.6 million, and $7.1 million, respectively. As a percentage of processed volume, these charges were 0.0036%, 0.0065%, and 0.0052%, respectively, during the above periods. For these same years, we experienced actual losses of $8.7 million, $7.3 million, and $6.9 million, respectively. We believe that our estimation process has been materially accurate on a historical basis. A 10% increase or decrease in our provision for merchant losses as a percentage of processed volume for the year ended May 31, 2011 would have resulted in a decrease or increase in net income of $0.4 million. Further, if our provision for merchant losses as a percentage of processed volume for our fiscal 2011 had equaled our provision for merchant losses as a percentage of processed volume of 0.0065% for the same prior year period, our net income would have decreased by $3.4 million. As of May 31, 2011 and 2010, $3.1 million and $5.8 million, respectively, have been recorded for guarantees associated with merchant card processing and are included in settlement processing obligations in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. In our check guarantee service offering, we charge our merchants a percentage of the gross amount of the check and guarantee payment of the check to the merchant in the event the check is not honored by the checkwriter bank. We have the right to collect the full amount of the check from the checkwriter but have not historically recovered 100% of the guaranteed checks. Our check guarantee loss reserve is also comprised of estimated incurred losses and a projection of future losses based on historical return and collection (recovery) percentages and an assumed percentage of the face value of our guaranteed checks. For the years ended May 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, we guaranteed total check face values of $2.6 billion, $2.5 billion, and $2.5 billion, respectively. For those same periods, we recorded provisions for check guarantee losses of $14.2 million, $14.9 million, and $17.9 million, respectively. As a percentage of the total guaranteed check face value, these charges were 0.55%, 0.61%, and 0.73%, respectively, during the years mentioned above. For these same years, we experienced actual losses of $14.5 million, $14.8 million, and $20.0 million, respectively. Since actual losses were similar to the check guarantee loss provisions provided above, we believe that our estimation process has been materially accurate on a historical basis. A 10% increase or decrease in our percentage assumption for the year ended May 31, 2011 would have resulted in a decrease or increase in net income of $1.0 million. Further, if our guarantee loss as a percentage of guarantee volume for our fiscal 2011 had equaled our guarantee loss as a percentage of guarantee volume of 0.61% for the same prior year period, our net income would have decreased by $1.0 million. As of May 31, 2011 and 2010, we had a check guarantee reserve of $3.9 million and $4.2 million, respectively, which is included in claims receivable, net, in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. We derive our projected loss rate assumptions primarily based on a rolling six to twelve month analysis of historic loss activity. These assumptions, however, bear the risk of change, which may occur as a result of several 42 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements qualitative factors. For merchant losses, these factors include the following: a change in the creditworthiness of our merchant customers; a change in the levels of credit card fraud affecting our merchant customers; and a change in the effectiveness of our internal credit, risk management, and collection departments. For check guarantee losses, these factors include a change in the levels of dishonored consumer checks presented to our guarantee service merchant customers and a change in the effectiveness of our internal check guarantee procedures, customer acceptance and retention policies, or collection protocols. Application of our percentage assumptions involve uncertainty regarding changes in any of the factors above, especially those that are outside of our control, such as the financial health of the United States, Canadian, the United Kingdom, Spain, Asia-Pacific, and the Russian Federation economies at a regional or national level and the related impact on our customers. Goodwill and long-lived asset valuations We regularly evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the carrying amounts of goodwill, property and equipment, and other intangible assets may warrant revision or may not be recoverable. Goodwill and other indefinite-life intangible assets are evaluated for impairment annually by applying a fair value based test. Property and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment when facts and circumstances indicate the carrying value of such assets may exceed their fair values. When factors indicate that these assets should be evaluated for possible impairment, we assess the potential impairment of their carrying values by determining whether the carrying value of such long-lived assets will be recovered through the future undiscounted cash flows expected from use of the asset and its eventual disposition. We completed our most recent annual goodwill and indefinite-life intangible asset impairment test as of January 1, 2011. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level, and the impairment test consists of two steps. In the first step the reporting unit carrying amount, including goodwill, is compared to its fair value which is measured based upon, among other factors, a discounted cash flow analysis as well as market multiples for comparable companies. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit is greater than its fair value, goodwill is considered impaired and step two must be performed. Step two measures the impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all the assets and liabilities of that unit (including unrecognized intangibles) as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. The excess of fair value over the amounts allocated to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit is the implied fair value of goodwill. The excess of the carrying amount over the implied fair value is the impairment loss. We have six reporting units: North America Merchant Services, UK Merchant Services, Asia Pacific Merchant Services, Central and Eastern Europe Merchant Services, Russia Merchant Services and Spain Merchant Services. We estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a combination of the income approach and the market approach. The income approach utilizes a discounted cash flow model incorporating management expectations for future revenue, operating expenses, EBITDA, capital expenditures and an anticipated tax rate. We discount the related cash flow forecasts using our estimated weighted-average cost of capital for each reporting unit at the date of valuation. The market approach utilizes comparative market multiples in the valuation estimate. Multiples are derived by relating the value of guideline companies, based on either the market price of publicly traded shares or the prices of companies being acquired in the marketplace, to various measures of their earnings and cash flow. Such multiples are then applied to the historical and projected earnings and cash flow of the reporting unit in developing the valuation estimate. Preparation of forecasts and the selection of the discount rates involve significant judgments about expected future business performance and general market conditions. Significant changes in our forecasts, the discount rates selected or the weighting of the income and market approach could affect the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period. At May 31, 2011 we had goodwill of $779.6 million recorded on our consolidated balance sheet. We completed our most recent annual goodwill and indefinite-life intangible asset impairment test on January 1, 43 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements 2011 and determined that the fair value of each of our reporting units is substantially in excess of the carrying value. No events or changes in circumstances have occurred since the date of our most recent annual impairment test that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. Other intangible assets primarily represent customer-related intangible assets (such as customer lists and merchant contracts), contract-based intangible assets (such as non-compete agreements, referral agreements and processing rights), and trademarks associated with acquisitions. Customer-related intangible assets, contract-based intangible assets and certain trademarks are amortized over their estimated useful lives of up to 30 years. The useful lives for customer-related intangible assets are determined based primarily on forecasted cash flows, which include estimates for the revenues, expenses, and customer attrition associated with the assets. The useful lives of contract-based intangible assets are equal to the terms of the agreements. The useful lives of amortizable trademarks are based on our plans to phase out the trademarks in the applicable markets. We use the accelerated method of amortization for most of our customer related intangible assets. In determining amortization expense under our accelerated method for any given period, we calculate the expected cash flows for that period that were used in determining the acquired value of the asset and divide that amount by the expected total cash flows over the estimated life of the asset. We multiply that percentage by the initial carrying value of the asset to arrive at the amortization expense for that period. In addition, if the cash flow patterns that we experience are less favorable than our initial estimates, we will adjust the amortization schedule accordingly. These cash flow patterns are derived using certain assumptions and cost allocations due to a significant amount of asset interdependencies that exist in our business. During fiscal 2011, we did not adjust the amortization schedules. We believe that our accelerated method better approximates the distribution of cash flows generated by our acquired customer relationships. We use the straight-line method of amortization for our contract-based intangibles and amortizable trademarks. Capitalization of Internally Developed Software We develop software that is used in providing processing services to customers. Capitalization of internally developed software, primarily associated with operating platforms, occurs when we have completed the preliminary project stage, management authorizes the project, management commits to funding the project, it is probable the project will be completed and the project will be used to perform the function intended. The preliminary project stage consists of the conceptual formulation of alternatives, the evaluation of alternatives, the determination of existence of needed technology and the final selection of alternatives. Costs incurred prior to the preliminary project stage are expensed as incurred. Currently unforeseen circumstances in software development could require us to implement alternative plans with respect to a particular effort, which could result in the impairment of previously capitalized software development costs. Costs capitalized during fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009 totaled $26.3 million, $17.6 million and $11.8 million, respectively. Internally developed software has an amortization period of 5 to 10 years. Internally developed software assets are placed into service when they are ready for their intended use. During fiscal 2010, we placed into service $54.9 million of hardware and software associated with our technology processing platform, referred to as G2. This platform is planned to be a new front-end operating environment for our merchant processing, and is intended to replace a number of legacy platforms. Depreciation and amortization associated with these costs is calculated based on transactions expected to be processed over the life of the platform. We believe that this method is more representative of the platform use than the straight-line method. We are currently processing transactions on our G2 platform in seven markets in our Asia-Pacific region. As these markets represent a small percentage of our overall transactions, depreciation and amortization related to our G2 platform for fiscal 2011 was not significant. Depreciation and amortization expense will increase as we complete migrations of other markets to the G2 platform. We did not place any hardware or software costs associated with G2 into service during fiscal 2011. 44 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Income Taxes The determination of our provision for income taxes requires management judgment in the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Judgment is also required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items. We believe our tax return positions are fully supportable; however, we establish liabilities for material tax exposures relating to deductions, transactions and other matters involving some uncertainty as to the proper tax treatment of the item. Issues raised by a tax authority may be finally resolved at an amount different than the related liability. When facts and circumstances change (including a resolution of an issue or statute of limitations expiration), these liabilities are adjusted through the provision for income taxes in the period of change. Judgment will be required to determine whether or not some portion or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized. To the extent we determine that we will not realize the benefit of some or all of our deferred tax assets, then these deferred tax assets will be adjusted through our provision for income taxes in the period in which this determination is made. At May 31, 2011 our consolidated balance sheet includes net deferred tax assets associated with our United Kingdom business of $100.6 million. Our assessment of the recoverability of these deferred tax assets is based, in part, on our projections of future business performance and viable tax planning strategies. If future business performance fails to meet projections, we may determine that some or all of these deferred tax assets will not be realized. In the event of such a determination, we would record a valuation allowance for the amount deemed unrecoverable with a corresponding charge to the provision for income taxes. New Accounting Pronouncements In June 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued ASU 2011-05, Presentation of Comprehensive Income ( ASU 2011-05 ). In accordance with ASU 2011-05, an entity has the option to present the total of comprehensive income, the components of net income, and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. In both choices, an entity is required to present each component of net income along with total net income, each component of other comprehensive income along with a total for other comprehensive income, and a total amount for comprehensive income. ASU 2011-05 eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity. ASU 2011-05 does not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income. ASU 2011-05 is effective retrospectively for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2011. This standard will become effective for us beginning June 2012 and we are currently evaluating the impact on our consolidated financial statements. In May 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-04, Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRS ( ASU 2011-04 ). The amendments in ASU 2011-04 result in common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs. Consequently, ASU 2011-04 changes the wording used to describe many of the requirements in U.S. GAAP for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements. For many of the requirements, the FASB does not intend for the amendments in ASU 2011-04 to result in a change in the application of the requirements in Topic 820. ASU 2011-04 is effective prospectively for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2011. This ASU will become effective for us beginning March 2012 and we do not expect an impact on our consolidated financial statements. In December 2010, the FASB issued ASU 2010-29 , Disclosure of Supplementary Pro Forma Information for Business Combinations ( ASU 2010-29 ). ASU 2010-29 amends and clarifies the acquisition date to be used for reporting pro forma financial disclosures when comparative financial statements are presented. In addition, it requires a description of the nature of and amount of any material, non-recurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination. ASU 2010-29 is effective prospectively for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting 45 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements period beginning on or after December 15, 2010, with early adoption permitted. The standard will become effective for us beginning in June 2011 and will not have an impact on our financial position or results of operations as it only amends required disclosures. In December 2010, the FASB issued ASU 2010-28, When to Perform Step 2 of the Goodwill Impairment Test for Reporting Units with Zero or Negative Carrying Amounts ( ASU 2010-28 ). ASU 2010-28 modifies Step 1 of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts. For those reporting units, an entity is required to perform Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test if it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists. In determining whether it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists, an entity should consider whether there are any adverse qualitative factors indicating that an impairment may exist. The qualitative factors are consistent with existing guidance which requires that goodwill of a reporting unit be tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. This ASU is effective for us beginning June 1, 2011. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have an impact on our financial position or results of operations because none of our reporting units have zero or negative carrying amounts. In July 2010, the FASB issued ASU 2010-20, Receivables Disclosures about the Credit Quality of Financing Receivables and the Allowance for Credit Losses ( ASU 2010-20 ). ASU 2010-20 amends Accounting Standards Codification Topic 310 to improve the disclosures that an entity provides about the credit quality of its financing receivables and the related allowance for credit losses. As a result of these amendments, an entity is required to disaggregate by portfolio segment or class certain existing disclosures and provide new disclosures about its financing receivables and related allowance for credit losses. ASU 2010-20 was effective for us beginning with the quarter ended February 28, 2011. The impact of ASU 2010-20 on our disclosures is reflected in notes to the audited consolidated financial statements. 46 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements
