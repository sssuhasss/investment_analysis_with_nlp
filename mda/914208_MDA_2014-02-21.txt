Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Executive Overview The following executive overview summarizes the significant trends affecting our results of operations and financial condition for the periods presented. This overview and the remainder of this management's discussion and analysis supplements and should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements of Invesco Ltd. and its subsidiaries (collectively, the company or Invesco ) and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. During 2013 , economies in the developed world continued to show improvement, resulting in strong equity market gains. Equity markets such as the U.S., Japan and the U.K. produced positive returns, as evidenced by the S&P 500 index, which was up 29.6% , the Nikkei 225 index, which increased 56.7% , and the FTSE 100, which rose 14.4% . However, developing markets lagged in 2013, as questions about the impact of slowing monetary stimulus on emerging economies weighed on equity prices, resulting in the MSCI Emerging Market index declining 5.0% . Bond markets declined in 2013, as evidenced by the Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond index, driven in part by a change in the U.S. Federal Reserve's monetary policy. The expectation of a tapering in the monthly bond purchases resulted in pressure on bond prices. This was confirmed in December 2013 when the Federal Reserve announced a reduction in the monthly purchases from $85 billion to $75 billion. The table below summarizes the year ended December 31 returns based on price appreciation/(depreciation) of several major market indices for 2013 , 2012 , and 2011 : Year ended December 31, Equity Index 2013 2012 2011 S&P 500 29.6% 13.4% 0.0% FTSE 100 14.4% 5.8% (5.6)% Nikkei 225 56.7% 22.9% (17.3)% MSCI Emerging Markets (5.0)% 15.2% (20.4)% Bond Index Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond (2.0)% 4.2% 7.8% Throughout 2013, we continued to execute our long-term strategy, which further improved our ability to serve clients, strengthened our investment reputation, and helped to deliver competitive levels of operating income and margins. We also took advantage of opportunities in the market and continued to invest in our products and capabilities, our brand, our global platform and our people in ways that strengthened our business and competitive position for long-term success. In late 2013, we launched the Global Targeted Return product line, with strong flows to the new fund in the U.K. market in the fourth quarter. In addition, late in 2013, we launched a number of new "liquid alternative" capabilities. These capabilities leverage the firm's 25 years of experience managing alternative assets to bring existing institutional-quality alternative investment capabilities to our retail clients. The company launched more funds in the fourth quarter of 2013 than in any year within the last five years. As a global investment management firm dedicated to delivering investment excellence to our clients, Invesco is committed to further strengthening and enhancing our risk management approach. We believe a key factor in Invesco's ability to manage through the economic uncertainty of the past three years was our integrated approach to risk management. Invesco's enterprise risk management approach is embedded in its management processes across the organization. Broadly, our approach includes two governance structures - one for investments and another for business risk. Investment risk oversight is supported by the Global Performance Measurement and Risk group, which provides senior management and the Board with insight into core investment risks, and the investment teams. Business risk oversight is supported by the Corporate Risk Management Committee, which facilitates a focus on strategic, operational and other key business risks, and related committees. Further, functional and geographic risk management committees maintain an ongoing risk assessment process that provides a bottom-up perspective on the specific risk areas existing in various domains of our business. As a result of our efforts in this area, Standard & Poor's Ratings Services has designated our enterprise risk management rating as "strong." In addition, we benefited from our long-term efforts to ensure a diversified base of assets under management. One of Invesco's core strengths, and a key differentiator for the company within the industry, is our broad diversification across client domiciles, asset classes and distribution channels. Our geographical diversification recognizes growth opportunities in different parts of the 26 Table of Contents world. This broad diversification mitigates the impact on Invesco of different market cycles and enables the company to take advantage of growth opportunities in various markets and channels. On October 15, 2013, the company announced that the Head of U.K. Equities, Neil Woodford, will be leaving on April 29, 2014. Mark Barnett will succeed Mr. Woodford as Head of U.K. Equities. As of December 31, 2013, Mr. Woodford was the named lead manager for U.K. Equity AUM totaling $46.6 billion. Between October 15, 2013 and December 31, 2013, U.K. equity income AUM experienced net outflows of $4.8 billion. Our total AUM in EMEA at December 31, 2013 is $171.9 billion. Excluding the net outflows from U.K. equity income, EMEA long term net inflows for the fourth quarter of 2013 were $4.3 billion. On December 31, 2013, the sale of Atlantic Trust to CIBC was completed. The results of Atlantic Trust, together with expenses associated with the sale and the gain on the sale, are reflected as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Income and are therefore excluded from the continuing operations of Invesco. Comparative periods shown in the Consolidated Statements of Income have been adjusted to conform with this presentation. Similarly, total AUM excludes the AUM of Atlantic Trust with comparative periods adjusted to a consistent basis. Regulators in various jurisdictions have proposed or are exploring changes to the manner in which fund distributers are compensated for the services they provide. The U.K. Financial Conduct Authority has implemented its Retail Distribution Review ( RDR ), which is expected to reshape the manner in which retail investment funds are sold in the U.K. by changing how retail clients pay for investment advice given in respect of all retail investment products. Invesco has prepared for the RDR implementation by offering investment funds to U.K. investors which are priced at a reduced gross management fee, but which in turn do not result in the payment by the company of a distribution fee to the intermediary. These changes are not expected to have a significant impact on net revenues as investors move into these offerings. In the U.S., the SEC has previously proposed and may repurpose significant changes to Rule 12b-1. Other countries have announced similar distribution fee reviews. Presentation of Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The company provides investment management services to, and has transactions with, various private equity, real estate, fund-of-funds, collateralized loan obligation products (CLOs), and other investment entities sponsored by the company for the investment of client assets in the normal course of business. The company serves as the investment manager, making day-to-day investment decisions concerning the assets of the products. Investment products that are consolidated are referred to in this Report as either Consolidated Sponsored Investment Products (CSIP), which generally includes consolidated majority-held sponsored investment products, or Consolidated Investment Products (CIP), which includes consolidated nominally-held investment products. This distinction is important, as it differentiates the company's economic risk associated with each type of consolidated managed fund. The company's economic risk with respect to each investment in a CSIP and a CIP is limited to its equity ownership and any uncollected management fees. Gains and losses arising from nominally-held CIP do not have a significant impact on the company's results of operations, liquidity, or capital resources. Gains and losses arising from majority-held CSIP could have a significant impact on the company's results of operations, as the company has greater economic risk associated with its investment. See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, - Note 1 "Accounting Policies," Note 19 , "Consolidated Sponsored Investment Products," and Note 20 , "Consolidated Investment Products," for additional information regarding the impact of consolidation of managed funds. The majority of the company's CIP balances are CLO-related. The collateral assets of the CLOs are held solely to satisfy the obligations of the CLOs. The company has no right to the benefits from, nor does it bear the risks associated with, the collateral assets held by the CLOs, beyond the company's minimal direct investments in, and management and performance fees generated from, the CLOs. If the company were to liquidate, the collateral assets would not be available to the general creditors of the company, and as a result, the company does not consider them to be company assets. Likewise, the investors in the CLOs have no recourse to the general credit of the company for the notes issued by the CLOs. The company therefore does not consider this debt to be a company liability. 27 Table of Contents The impact of CIP is so significant to the presentation of the company Consolidated Financial Statements (but not to the underlying financial condition or results of operations of the company) that the company has elected to deconsolidate these products in its non-GAAP disclosures. The following discussion therefore combines the results presented under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) with the company non-GAAP presentation. This Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains four distinct sections, which follow after the Assets Under Management discussion: Results of Operations (years ended December 31, 2013 compared to December 31, 2012 compared to December 31, 2011 ); Schedule of Non-GAAP Information; Balance Sheet Discussion; and Liquidity and Capital Resources. Each of the Consolidated Financial Statement summary sections (Results of Operations, Balance Sheet Discussion, and Liquidity and Capital Resources) begins with a table illustrating the impact of CIP relative to the company's consolidated totals. The impact is illustrated by a column which shows the dollar-value change in the consolidated figures, as caused by the consolidation of CIP. For example, the impact of CIP on operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2013 was a reduction of $37.9 million . This indicates that their consolidation reduced consolidated revenues by this amount, reflecting the elimination upon their consolidation of the operating revenues earned by Invesco for managing these investment products. The narrative in each of these sections separately provides discussion of the underlying financial statement activity for the company, before consolidation of CIP, as well as of the financial statement activity of CIP. Additionally, wherever a non-GAAP measure is referenced, a disclosure will follow in the narrative or in the note referring the reader to the Schedule of Non-GAAP Information, where additional details regarding the use of the non-GAAP measure by the company are disclosed, along with reconciliations of the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures to the non-GAAP measures. To further enhance the readability of the Results of Operations section, separate tables for each of the revenue, expense, and other income and expenses (non-operating income/expense) sections of the income statement introduce the narrative that follows, providing a section-by-section review of the company income statements for the periods presented. 28 Table of Contents Summary Operating Information Summary operating information for 2013 , 2012 and 2011 is presented in the table below. $ in millions, other than per share amounts, operating margins, ratios and AUM Year ended December 31, U.S. GAAP Financial Measures Summary (1) 2013 2012 2011 Operating revenues 4,644.6 4,050.4 3,982.3 Operating income 1,120.2 842.6 882.1 Operating margin 24.1 % 20.8 % 22.2 % Net income attributable to common shareholders 940.3 677.1 729.7 Diluted EPS 2.10 1.49 1.57 Debt/equity ratio including CIP (%) 64.3 % 56.2 % 74.4 % Non-GAAP Financial Measures Summary Net revenues (2) 3,252.0 2,836.0 2,791.6 Adjusted operating income (3) 1,292.1 1,012.1 1,046.2 Adjusted operating margin (3) 39.7 % 35.7 % 37.5 % Adjusted net income attributable to common shareholders (4) 953.3 748.6 759.1 Adjusted diluted EPS (4) 2.13 1.65 1.63 Debt/equity ratio excluding CIP (%) (5) 19.1 % 14.5 % 16.5 % Assets Under Management (1) Ending AUM (billions) 778.7 667.4 607.3 Average AUM (billions) 725.6 645.3 617.8 _________ (1) The company has adopted a discontinued operations presentation for Atlantic Trust.

See Item 6, "Selected Financial Data," footnote 4, for the definition of these measures and the related reconciliation reference. (5) The debt-to-equity ratio excluding CIP is a non-GAAP financial measure. See the "Liquidity and Capital Resources" section for a recalculation of this ratio and other important disclosures. 29 Table of Contents Investment Capabilities Performance Overview Invesco's first strategic priority is to achieve strong investment performance over the long-term for our clients. The table below presents the one-, three- and five-year performance of our actively managed investment products measured by the percentage of AUM ahead of benchmark and AUM in the top half of peer group. (1) Benchmark Comparison Peer Group Comparison % of AUM Ahead of Benchmark % of AUM In Top Half of Peer Group 1yr 3yr 5yr 1yr 3yr 5yr Equities U.S. Core 32 % 49 % 26 % 17 % 48 % 17 % U.S. Growth 71 % 30 % 38 % 70 % 24 % 38 % U.S. Value 81 % 57 % 80 % 71 % 81 % 56 % Sector Funds 77 % 72 % 97 % 19 % 23 % 53 % U.K. 98 % 99 % 86 % 96 % 98 % 11 % Canadian 100 % 100 % 73 % 96 % 72 % 56 % Asian 76 % 78 % 77 % 64 % 68 % 67 % Continental European 96 % 100 % 100 % 67 % 94 % 94 % Global 72 % 91 % 61 % 85 % 85 % 69 % Global Ex U.S. and Emerging Markets 83 % 97 % 97 % 6 % 94 % 97 % Fixed Income Money Market 52 % 58 % 58 % 96 % 96 % 96 % U.S. Fixed Income 60 % 87 % 81 % 72 % 95 % 84 % Global Fixed Income 84 % 85 % 97 % 79 % 84 % 86 % Stable Value 100 % 100 % 100 % 100 % 100 % 25 % Other Alternatives 32 % 49 % 47 % 67 % 60 % 26 % Balanced 43 % 73 % 60 % 62 % 97 % 97 % _____________________________ (1) AUM measured in the one-, three-, and five-year peer group rankings represents 61% , 61% , and 57% of total Invesco AUM, respectively, and AUM measured versus benchmark on a one-, three-, and five-year basis represents 72% , 72% , and 68% of total Invesco AUM, respectively, as of December 31, 2013 . Peer group rankings are sourced from a widely-used third party ranking agency in each fund's market (Lipper, Morningstar, IMA, Russell, Mercer, eVestment Alliance, SITCA, Value Research) and are asset-weighted in USD. Rankings are as of prior quarter-end for most institutional products and preceding month-end for Australian retail funds due to their late release by third parties. Rankings for the most representative fund in each Global Investment Performance Standard (GIPS) composite are applied to all products within each GIPS composite. Excludes passive products, closed-end funds, private equity limited partnerships, non-discretionary direct real estate, unit investment trusts fund-of-funds with component funds managed by Invesco, stable value building block funds and CLOs. Atlantic Trust results are excluded due to its sale. Certain funds and products were excluded from the analysis because of limited benchmark or peer group data. Had these been available, results may have been different. These results are preliminary and subject to revision. Performance assumes the reinvestment of dividends. Past performance is not indicative of future results and may not reflect an investor's experience. As of December 31, 2013, 72%, 83% and 62% of ranked actively managed assets performed in the top half of peer groups on a one-year, three-year and five-year basis respectively. Within our equity asset class, the performance of Canadian equities continued to improve in both the benchmark and peer group comparisons. The U.K., Continental European and Global Ex U.S. and Emerging Markets equities have also had strong relative performance, with 86% or more of assets beating their benchmark over three- and five-year periods. Additionally, Continental European and Global Ex U.S. and Emerging Markets reflect strong performance with 94% and 97%, respectively, of assets beating peers on a five-year basis. The U.K. shows solid improvement during the one- and three-year basis as a comparison to peer group from a brief period in which we trailed the market during 2009 in the five-year comparison. Our balanced asset class reflects strong peer group comparison with 97% in the top half on both the three- and five-year basis. Within our fixed income asset class, Stable Value products have achieved excellent long-term performance with 100% of AUM ahead of benchmark on a one-, three- and five-year basis. 30 Table of Contents Assets Under Management The following presentation and discussion of AUM includes Passive and Active AUM. Passive AUM includes ETFs, UITs, leveraged fund balances upon which we do not earn a fee, and other passive mandates. Active AUM is total AUM less Passive AUM. The AUM tables and the discussion below refer to AUM as long-term and short-term. Short-term AUM includes institutional money market and Invesco PowerShares QQQ AUM. Long-term AUM is total AUM less short-term AUM. Long-term inflows and the underlying reasons for the movements in this line item include investments from new clients, existing clients adding new accounts/funds or contributions/subscriptions into existing accounts/funds, and new funding commitments into private equity funds. Long-term outflows reflect client redemptions from accounts/funds and include the return of invested capital on the maturity or liquidation of private equity funds. We present net flows into institutional money market funds separately because shareholders of those funds typically use them as short-term funding vehicles and because their flows are particularly sensitive to short-term interest rate movements. The net flows in Invesco PowerShares QQQ AUM can also be relatively short-term in nature and, due to the relatively low revenue yield, these can have a significant impact on overall net revenue yield. Changes in AUM were as follows (1) : 2013 2012 2011 $ in billions Total AUM Active Passive Total AUM Active Passive Total AUM Active Passive January 1 667.4 553.4 114.0 607.3 511.0 96.3 599.6 518.8 80.8 Long-term inflows 179.6 137.0 42.6 131.9 102.2 29.7 138.0 102.5 35.5 Long-term outflows (157.9 ) (123.9 ) (34.0 ) (121.5 ) (102.7 ) (18.8 ) (123.3 ) (102.2 ) (21.1 ) Long-term net flows 21.7 13.1 8.6 10.4 (0.5 ) 10.9 14.7 0.3 14.4 Net flows in Invesco Powershares QQQ fund 3.7 3.7 0.2 0.2 3.1 3.1 Net flows in institutional money market funds 9.0 9.0 0.1 0.1 5.3 5.3 Total net flows 34.4 22.1 12.3 10.7 (0.4 ) 11.1 23.1 5.6 17.5 Market gains and losses/reinvestment 78.8 64.5 14.3 48.3 41.3 7.0 (15.0 ) (12.9 ) (2.1 ) Acquisitions/dispositions, net (1.7 ) (1.7 ) Foreign currency translation (1.9 ) (1.0 ) (0.9 ) 2.8 3.2 (0.4 ) (0.4 ) (0.5 ) 0.1 December 31 778.7 639.0 139.7 667.4 553.4 114.0 607.3 511.0 96.3 Average AUM Average long-term AUM 613.7 523.3 90.4 543.5 466.1 77.4 524.4 458.2 66.2 Average short-term AUM 111.9 75.6 36.3 101.8 69.0 32.8 93.4 68.3 25.1 Average AUM 725.6 598.9 126.7 645.3 535.1 110.2 617.8 526.5 91.3 Revenue yield Gross revenue yield on AUM (2) 64.4 75.6 11.6 63.1 74.2 9.3 64.8 74.3 10.8 Gross revenue yield on AUM before performance fees (2) 63.6 74.7 11.6 62.4 73.4 9.3 64.4 73.8 10.8 Net revenue yield on AUM (3) 44.8 51.8 11.6 43.9 51.1 9.3 45.2 51.2 10.8 Net revenue yield on AUM before performance fees (3) 43.9 50.7 11.6 43.3 50.3 9.3 44.8 50.7 10.8 (1) On December 31, 2013, the company completed the sale of Atlantic Trust. All AUM amounts quoted in the tables exclude the AUM of the discontinued operations, Atlantic Trust. As of December 31, 2012 , the excluded Atlantic Trust total AUM were $20.3 billion ( $18.0 billion at December 31, 2011 ; $16.9 billion at December 31, 2010 ) with $18.5 billion in balanced at December 31, 2012 ( $17.4 billion at December 31, 2011 ; $16.9 billion at December 31, 2010 ) and $1.8 billion in equity at December 31, 2012 ( $0.6 billion at December 31, 2011 ; none at December 31, 2010 ). (2) Gross revenue yield on AUM is equal to annualized total operating revenues divided by average AUM, excluding joint venture (JV) AUM. Our share of the average AUM in 2013 for our JVs in China was $4.0 billion ( 2012 : $3.0 billion , 2011 : $3.3 billion ). It is appropriate to exclude the average AUM of our JVs for purposes of computing gross revenue yield on AUM, because the revenues resulting from these AUM are not presented in our operating revenues. Under U.S. GAAP, our share of the net income of the JVs is recorded as equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates on our Consolidated S tatements of Income. Additionally, the numerator of the gross revenue yield measure, 31 Table of Contents operating revenues, excludes the management fees earned from CIP; however, the denominator of the measure includes the AUM of these investment products. Therefore, the gross revenue yield measure is not considered representative of the company's true effective fee rate from AUM. (3) Net revenue yield on AUM is equal to annualized net revenues divided by average AUM. See Schedule of Non-GAAP Information for a reconciliation of operating revenues to net revenues. Flows There are numerous drivers of AUM inflows and outflows, including individual investor decisions to change investment preferences, fiduciaries and other gatekeepers making broad asset allocation decisions on behalf of their clients and reallocation of investments within portfolios. We are not a party to these asset allocation decisions, as the company does not generally have access to the underlying investor's decision-making process, including their risk appetite or liquidity needs. Therefore, the company is not in a position to provide meaningful information regarding the drivers of inflows and outflows. AUM at December 31, 2013 were $778.7 billion ( December 31, 2012 : $667.4 billion ; December 31, 2011 : $607.3 billion ). During the year ended December 31, 2013 , long-term net inflows increased AUM by $21.7 billion , net inflows of short-term AUM included institutional money market funds of $9.0 billion and net inflows in Invesco PowerShares QQQ fund of $3.7 billion . During the year ended December 31, 2012 , net long-term inflows increased AUM by $10.4 billion . We experienced net inflows in institutional money market funds of $0.1 billion and Invesco PowerShares QQQ fund of $0.2 billion , and net outflows from dispositions of $1.7 billion during the year ended December 31, 2012 . During the year ended December 31, 2011 , net long-term inflows increased AUM by $14.7 billion . We experienced net inflows in institutional money market funds of $5.3 billion and $3.1 billion in Invesco PowerShares QQQ fund during the year ended December 31, 2011 . Net inflows during the year ended December 31, 2013 included net long-term inflows of passive AUM of $8.6 billion and active net long-term inflows of $13.1 billion . Net flows were driven by net inflows into our retail distribution channel of $21.4 billion , primarily in the equity and balanced asset classes. This is the first year since 2009 that net long-term flows have been positive into the equity class of assets. Net inflows during the year ended December 31, 2012 included net long-term inflows of passive AUM of $10.9 billion and active net long-term AUM outflows of $0.5 billion . Net flows in 2012 were driven by net inflows of $10.4 billion into our retail distribution channel, primarily in the fixed income and balanced asset classes, while our equity asset class experienced net outflows of $10.7 billion . Net inflows during the year ended December 31, 2011 included net long-term inflows of passive AUM of $14.4 billion . Net flows in 2011 were driven by positive net inflow of $6.0 billion into our retail and $8.7 billion into institutional distribution channels, primarily in the fixed income asset class, while our equity asset class experienced net outflows of $11.4 billion. Average AUM during the year ended December 31, 2013 were $725.6 billion , compared to $645.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2012 and $617.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2011 . Market Returns Market gains and losses/reinvestment of AUM includes the net change in AUM resulting from changes in market values of the underlying securities from period to period and reinvestment of client dividends. As discussed in the Executive Overview section of this Management Discussion and Analysis, global equity markets produced strong returns during both the year ended December 31, 2013 and the year ended December 31, 2012, contrasting with an overall decline experienced in the year ending December 31, 2011. During the year ended December 31, 2013 , positive market movement increased AUM by $78.8 billion , with $77.4 billion attributed to our equity asset class. Our balanced asset class was also positively impacted by the change in market valuations during the period. During the year ended December 31, 2012 , market gains increased AUM by $48.3 billion and included $33.3 billion in positive market movement of our equity asset class. Our fixed income, balanced, and alternatives asset classes were also positively impacted by the change in market valuations during the period. Market losses during the year ended December 31, 2011 decreased the value of our equity asset class by $15.0 billion , decreasing in line with equity markets globally. 32 Table of Contents Foreign Exchange Rates Foreign exchange rate movements in our AUM result from the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates from period to period as non-U.S. Dollar denominated AUM is translated into U.S. Dollars, the reporting currency of the company. The table below illustrates the spot foreign exchange rates used for translation into the U.S. Dollar at December 31, 2013 , 2012 , and 2011 : Foreign Exchange Rates December 31, 2013 December 31, 2012 December 31, 2011 Pound Sterling ($ per ) 1.655 1.625 1.555 Canadian Dollar (CAD per $) 1.063 0.996 1.018 Japan ( per $) 105.080 85.520 76.950 Euro ($ per Euro) 1.378 1.319 1.299 During the year ended December 31, 2013 , we experienced decreases in AUM of $1.9 billion due to changes in foreign exchange rates. Changes in foreign exchange rates in the year ended December 31, 2013 were driven primarily by the weakening of the Canadian Dollar relative to the U.S. Dollar, which was reflected in the translation of Canadian Dollar-based AUM into U.S. Dollars and the weakening of the Japanese Yen relative to the U.S. Dollar, which was reflected in the translation of our Yen-based AUM into U.S. Dollars, partially offset by the strengthening of the Pound Sterling relative to the U.S. Dollar, which was reflected in the translation of our Pound Sterling-based AUM into U.S. Dollars, and the strengthening of the Euro relative to the U.S. Dollar, which was reflected in the translation of our Euro-based AUM into U.S. Dollars. In the year ended December 31, 2012 , AUM increased by $2.8 billion due to foreign exchange rate changes impacted by the strengthening of the Pound Sterling, Canadian Dollar and the Euro relative to the U.S. Dollar, partially offset by the weakening of the Japanese Yen relative to the U.S. Dollar. During the year ended December 31, 2011 , foreign exchange rate changes decreased AUM by $0.4 billion and was driven by the weakening of the Pound Sterling, Canadian Dollar and the Euro relative to the U.S. Dollar, offset by the strengthening of the Japanese Yen relative to the U.S. Dollar. Revenue Yield Net revenue yield on AUM increased 0.9 basis points to 44.8 basis points in the year ended December 31, 2013 from the year ended December 31, 2012 level of 43.9 basis points. Excluding performance fees, the net revenue yield increased 0.6 basis points to 43.9 basis points in the year ended December 31, 2013 from the year ended December 31, 2012 level of 43.3 basis points. Changes in our AUM mix significantly impact our net revenue yield. For example, on an asset class basis, our equity and balanced AUM generally earn a higher net revenue rate than money market and fixed income AUM. The combination of average equity and average balanced AUM increased from 50.7% in 2012 to 53.4% of total average AUM in 2013 . The comparable averages for money market and fixed income AUM both reduced. This change in asset class mix correlates with the increase in net revenue yield in 2013 when compared to 2012. The tables that follow also analyze AUM into active and passive style. Passive AUM generally earn a lower effective fee rate than active asset classes. At December 31, 2013 , passive AUM were $139.7 billion , representing 17.9% of total AUM at that date; whereas at December 31, 2012 , passive AUM were $114.0 billion , representing 17.1% of our total AUM at that date. In the year ended December 31, 2013 , the net revenue yield on passive AUM was 11.6 basis points compared to 9.3 basis points in the year ended December 31, 2012 , an increase of 2.3 basis points, due to changes in mix of passive AUM. The increase in the average yield from passive AUM in 2013 when compared to 2012 has offset any reduction in total net revenue yield normally associated with the higher level of passive AUM as a percentage of total AUM. The net revenue yield (before performance fees) on active AUM increased from 50.3 basis points in the year ended December 31, 2012 to 50.7 basis points in the year ended December 31, 2013 . In 2012, net yield decreased by 1.3 basis points from 2011 due to the higher proportion of passive AUM combined with the lower yield earned by passive AUM. The increase in passive AUM includes the movements in the Powershares QQQ Nasdaq-100 index tracking fund. The Powershares QQQ fund AUM increased to $45.7 billion at December 31, 2013 compared to $30.4 billion at December 31, 2012 , and accounts for $15.3 billion of the $25.7 billion increase in passive AUM. The revenue yield for Invesco on this product is less than 1 basis point, reimbursing Invesco for the portfolio trading services provided to the fund, and flows into and out of this product therefore have a significant impact on the overall net revenue yield and are a significant factor in the year-on-year yield changes. 33 Table of Contents Gross revenue yield on AUM increased 1.3 basis points to 64.4 basis points in the year ended December 31, 2013 from the year ended December 31, 2012 level of 63.1 basis points. Management does not consider gross revenue yield, the most comparable U.S. GAAP-based measure to net revenue yield, to be a meaningful effective fee rate measure for the reasons outlined in footnote 2 to the Changes in AUM table above. See Schedule of Non-GAAP Information for a reconciliation of operating revenues (gross revenues) to net revenues.

The impact is illustrated in the tables immediately below by a column which shows the dollar-value change in the consolidated figures, as caused by the consolidation of CIP. For example, the impact of CIP on total operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2013 was a reduction of $37.9 million . This indicates that the consolidation of CIP reduced consolidated revenues by $37.9 million , reflecting the elimination upon consolidation of the operating revenues earned by Invesco for managing these investment products. The discussion below includes the use of non-GAAP financial measures. See Schedule of Non-GAAP Information for additional details and reconciliations of the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures to the non-GAAP measures.

Net revenues increased by 1.6% in the year ended December 31, 2012 to $2,836.0 million (year ended December 31, 2011 : $2,791.6 million ). Net revenues are operating revenues less third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses, plus our proportional share of net revenues from joint venture arrangements, plus management and performance fees earned from, less other revenues recorded by, CIP, plus other reconciling items. See Schedule of Non-GAAP Information for additional important disclosures regarding the use of net revenues. A significant portion of our business and AUM is based outside of the U.S. The strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar against other currencies, primarily the Pound Sterling, Canadian Dollar, Euro and Japanese Yen will impact our reported revenues and expenses from period to period. The income statements of foreign currency subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars, the reporting currency of the company, using average foreign exchange rates. The impact of foreign exchange rate movements decreased operating revenues by $47.4 million , equivalent to 1.0% of total operating revenues, during the year ended December 31, 2013 when compared to the year ended December 31, 2012 ($20.8 million decrease in 2012 as compared to 2011 , or 0.5% of 2012 total operating revenues). Additionally, our revenues are directly influenced by the level and composition of our AUM. Therefore, movements in global capital market levels, net new business inflows (or outflows) and changes in the mix of investment products between asset classes and geographies may materially affect our revenues from period to period. The returns from most global capital markets increased in the year ended December 31, 2013 . These market value increases, combined with net new business inflows, contributed to a 12.4% increase in average AUM for 2013 when compared to 2012. The company acquired Morgan Stanley's retail asset management business, including Van Kampen Investments (the acquired business or the acquisition ) on June 1, 2010. As part of the acquisition-related U.S. mutual fund product alignment, certain 1 year and 2 year fee waivers were agreed between the company and the fund boards which reduced the company annual management fees by approximately $30 million commencing June 1, 2011. These fee waivers began to expire during mid-2012 and have fully lapsed by the end of 2013. 41 Table of Contents Investment Management Fees Investment management fees are derived from providing professional services to manage client accounts and include fees earned from retail mutual funds, unit trusts, investment companies with variable capital (ICVCs), exchange-traded funds, investment trusts and institutional management contracts. Investment management fees for products offered in the retail distribution channel are generally calculated as a percentage of the daily average asset balances and therefore vary daily as the levels of AUM change resulting from inflows, outflows and market movements. Investment management fees for products offered in the institutional distribution channel are calculated in accordance with the underlying investment management contracts and also vary over contractually determined periods in relation to the level of client assets managed. Investment management fees increased by $471.8 million ( 15.1% ) in the year ended December 31, 2013 , to $3,599.6 million (year ended December 31, 2012 : $3,127.8 million ). This compares to a 12.4% increase in average AUM and a 12.9% increase in average long-term AUM. As discussed above, the net revenue yield is higher in the year ended December 31, 2013 when compared to the year ended December 31, 2012 due to changes in the composition of our AUM. In addition, management fees were reduced commencing in June 2011 due to acquisition integration-related U.S. mutual fund mergers, and continuing through mid-2012, negatively impacting yields in 2012 as compared to 2013. See the company's disclosures regarding the changes in AUM and revenue yields during the year ended December 31, 2013 in the Assets Under Management section above for additional information regarding the movements in AUM. The impact of foreign exchange rate movements decreased investment management fees by $41.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2012 . Investment management fees increased by $87.1 million ( 2.9% ) in the year ended December 31, 2012 , to $ 3,127.8 million (year ended December 31, 2011 : $ 3,040.7 million ). The increase compares to a 4.5% increase in average AUM and a 3.6% increase in average long-term AUM. As discussed above, the net revenue yield was lower in the year ended December 31, 2012 when compared to the year ended December 31, 2011 due to changes in the composition of our AUM. In addition, as mentioned above, management fees were reduced commencing in June 2011 due to acquisition integration-related U.S. mutual fund mergers. Some of these fee waiver agreements lapsed in mid-2012 benefiting revenue in the second half of 2012. See the company's disclosures regarding the changes in AUM and revenue yields during the year ended December 31, 2012 in the Assets Under Management section above for additional information regarding the movements in AUM. The impact of foreign exchange rate movements decreased investment management fees by $17.9 million (20.6% of the increase) during the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2011 . Service and Distribution Fees Service fees are generated through fees charged to cover several types of expenses, including fund accounting fees and other maintenance costs for mutual funds, unit trusts and ICVCs, and administrative fees earned from closed-ended funds. Service fees also include transfer agent fees, which are fees charged to cover the expense of processing client share purchases and redemptions, call center support and client reporting. U.S. distribution fees include 12b-1 fees earned from certain mutual funds to cover allowable sales and marketing expenses for those funds and also include asset-based sales charges paid by certain mutual funds for a period of time after the sale of those funds. Distribution fees typically vary in relation to the amount of client assets managed. Generally, retail products offered outside of the U.S. do not generate a separate distribution fee; the quoted management fee rate is inclusive of these services. In the year ended December 31, 2013 , service and distribution fees increased by $101.2 million ( 13.1% ) to $872.8 million (year ended December 31, 2012 : $771.6 million ) due primarily to increases in distribution and redemption fees of $42.5 million, administration and custodial fees of $49.6 million and transfer agency fees of $12.3 million. The impact of foreign exchange rate movements decreased service and distribution fees by $3.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2013 . The fee increases in 2013 are attributable to the increases in average AUM and the expiration of fund waivers noted above. In the year ended December 31, 2012 , service and distribution fees decreased by $8.6 million ( 1.1% ) to $ 771.6 million (year ended December 31, 2011 : $ 780.2 million ) due primarily to decreases in transfer agency fees of $4.8 million and administration and custodial fees of $2.3 million. The impact of foreign exchange rate movements decreased service and distribution fees by $1.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2012. The fee reductions are attributable to the fund mergers and fee waivers associated with the U.S. mutual fund product realignment, the continued conversion of B-share fee structures to class A-shares that generate a lower annual service fee, and other changes in the AUM mix as a larger percentage of AUM charged no or lower distribution fees during the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2011. 42 Table of Contents Performance Fees Performance fee revenues are generated on certain management contracts when performance hurdles are achieved. Such fee revenues are recorded in operating revenues as of the performance measurement date, when the contractual performance criteria have been met and when the outcome of the transaction can be measured reliably in accordance with Method 1 of ASC Topic 605-20-S99, Revenue Recognition - Services - SEC Materials. Cash receipt of earned performance fees occurs after the measurement date. The performance measurement date is defined in each contract in which incentive and performance fee revenue agreements are in effect. We have performance fee arrangements that include monthly, quarterly and annual measurement dates. Given the uniqueness of each transaction, performance fee contracts are evaluated on an individual basis to determine if revenues can and should be recognized. Performance fees are not recorded if there are any future performance contingencies. If performance arrangements require repayment of the performance fee for failure to perform during the contractual period, then performance fee revenues are recognized no earlier than the expiration date of these terms. Performance fees will fluctuate from period to period and may not correlate with general market changes, since most of the fees are driven by relative performance to the respective benchmark rather than by absolute performance. Of our $778.7 billion in AUM at December 31, 2013 , approximately $47.8 billion or 6.1% , could potentially earn performance fees. In the year ended December 31, 2013 , performance fees increased by $14.5 million ( 35.0% ) to $55.9 million (year ended December 31, 2012 : $41.4 million ). The performance fees generated in 2013 arose primarily due to products managed by the following investment teams: U.K. Equities ($36.7 million), Global Quantitative Equity ($4.4 million), Australian Equity ($3.4 million), Direct Real Estate ($1.6 million), Fixed Income ($6.5 million) and various other teams ($3.3 million). During the year ended December 31, 2013, performance fees included 11.5 million (equivalent to $17.5 million when recorded in March 2013) from Edinburgh Investment Trust plc. The company has agreed to a reduction in the performance fee receivable from the Trust in relation to the Trusts' year ending March 31, 2014, with no performance fees in future years. The maximum performance fee receivable, if any, in the year ended December 31, 2014 will be 4.0 million (equivalent to $6.6 million at the year-end exchange rate). In the year ended December 31, 2012 , performance fees increased by $15.4 million ( 59.2% ) to $ 41.4 million (year ended December 31, 2011 : $ 26.0 million ). The performance fees generated in 2012 arose primarily due to products managed by the following investment teams: Fixed Income ($16.5 million), U.K. Equities ($12.7 million) and Direct Real Estate ($7.9 million). Other Revenues Other revenues include fees derived from our UIT operations, transaction commissions earned upon the sale of new investments into certain of our funds, and fees earned upon the completion of transactions in our direct real estate and private equity asset groups. Real estate transaction fees are derived from commissions earned through the buying and selling of properties. Private equity transaction fees include commissions associated with the restructuring of, and fees from providing advice to, portfolio companies held by the funds. These transaction fees are recorded in our Consolidated Financial Statements on the date when the transactions are legally closed. Other revenues also include the revenues of CIP. In its capacity as sponsor of UITs, the company earns other revenues related to transactional sales charges resulting from the sale of UIT products and from the difference between the purchase or bid and offer price of securities temporarily held to form new UIT products. These revenues are recorded as other revenues net of concessions to dealers who distribute UITs to investors. In the year ended December 31, 2013 , other revenues increased by $6.7 million ( 6.1% ) to $116.3 million (year ended December 31, 2012 : $109.6 million ). The impact of foreign exchange rate movements offset the increase in other revenues $1.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2012 . After allowing for foreign exchange rate changes, the increase in other revenues was $7.7 million . The increase in other revenues include increases in transaction commissions of $2.0 million generated by our private equity group, UIT revenues of $3.5 million, mutual funds front end fees of $6.3 million and other revenues of $1.1 million, partially offset by decreases in real estate acquisition and disposition fees of $5.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to the year ended December 31, 2012 . In the year ended December 31, 2012 , other revenues decreased by $25.8 million ( 19.1% ) to $ 109.6 million (year ended December 31, 2011 : $ 135.4 million ). After allowing for foreign exchange rate changes, the decrease in other revenues was $24.8 million. The decrease in other revenues included decreases in transaction commissions of $14.8 million, UIT revenues of $5.5 million, mutual funds front end fees of $2.3 million and other revenues of $2.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2012 43 Table of Contents as compared to the year ended December 31, 2011 . Transaction commissions in 2011 included increased commissions generated by our private equity group. Third-Party Distribution, Service and Advisory Expenses Third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses include periodic renewal commissions paid to brokers and independent financial advisors for their continuing oversight of their clients' assets over the time they are invested, and are payments for the servicing of client accounts. The revenues from our U.S. retail operations include 12b-1 distribution fees, which are passed through to brokers who sell the funds as third-party distribution expenses along with additional marketing support distribution costs. Both the revenues and the costs are dependent on the underlying AUM of the brokers' clients. Renewal commissions are calculated based upon a percentage of the AUM value. Third-party distribution expenses also include the amortization of upfront commissions paid to broker-dealers for sales of fund shares with a contingent deferred sales charge (a charge levied to the investor for client redemption of AUM within a certain contracted period of time). The distribution commissions are amortized over the redemption period. Also included in third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses are sub-transfer agency fees that are paid to third parties for processing client share purchases and redemptions, call center support and client reporting. Third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses may increase or decrease at a rate different from the rate of change in service and distribution fee revenues due to the inclusion of distribution, service and advisory expenses for the U.K. and Canada, where the related revenues are recorded as investment management fee revenues. Third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses increased by $181.0 million ( 13.8% ) in the year ended December 31, 2013 to $1,489.2 million (year ended December 31, 2012 : $1,308.2 million ). The impact of foreign exchange rate movements decreased third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses by $14.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2012 . After allowing for foreign exchange rate changes, the increase in third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses was $195.7 million . The increase includes increases in renewal commissions of $109.4 million, distribution fees of $70.6 million, transfer agent fees of $11.6 million, external commissions of $5.0 million and administration fees of $0.9 million. The increases are offset by decreases in sub advisory fees of $1.8 million. The overall increase is reflective of the higher related retail management fees and service and distribution fees. Third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses increased by $28.8 million ( 2.3% ) in the year ended December 31, 2012 to $1,308.2 million (year ended December 31, 2011 : $ 1,279.4 million ). The impact of foreign exchange rate movements decreased third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses by $6.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2011 . After allowing for foreign exchange rate changes, the increase in third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses was $34.9 million. The increase includes increases in renewal commissions of $22.8 million, distribution fees of $10.2 million, transfer agent fees of $7.4 million and administration fees of $0.9 million. The increases are offset by decreases in sub advisory fees of $3.4 million and external commissions of $3.0 million. As part of the outsourcing of the U.K. transfer agency, operational process changes resulted in an accounting adjustment recognizing additional distribution expense of $15.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2012, which is included in the $10.2 million increase noted above. This additional expense is attributable to periods prior to 2012. Proportional share of revenues, net of third-party distribution expenses, from joint venture investments Management believes that the addition of our proportional share of revenues, net of third-party distribution expenses, from joint venture arrangements should be added to operating revenues to arrive at net revenues, as it is important to evaluate the contribution to the business that our joint venture arrangements are making. See Schedule of Non-GAAP Information for additional disclosures regarding the use of net revenues. The company's most significant joint venture arrangement is our 49% investment in Invesco Great Wall Fund Management Company Limited (the Invesco Great Wall joint venture). Our proportional share of revenues, net of third-party distribution expenses, from joint venture investments increased by $14.2 million ( 37.9% ) to $51.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 (year ended December 31, 2012 : $37.5 million ). The increase moved in line with our share of the Invesco Great Wall joint venture's average AUM for the year ended December 31, 2013 , which was $4.0 billion compared to $3.0 billion at the year ended December 31, 2012 . Our proportional share of revenues, net of third-party distribution expenses, from joint venture investments decreased by $3.9 million (9.4%) to $37.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 (year ended December 31, 2011 : $41.4 million). The decrease moved in line with our share of the Invesco Great Wall joint venture's average AUM for the year ended December 31, 2012 , which was $3.0 billion , compared to $3.3 billion at the year ended December 31, 2011 . 44 Table of Contents Management, performance and other fees earned from CIP Management believes that the consolidation of investment products may impact a reader's analysis of our underlying results of operations and could result in investor confusion or the production of information about the company by analysts or external credit rating agencies that is not reflective of the underlying results of operations and financial condition of the company. Accordingly, management believes that it is appropriate to adjust operating revenues for the impact of CIP in calculating net revenues. As management and performance fees earned by Invesco from the consolidated products are eliminated upon consolidation of the investment products, management believes that it is appropriate to add these operating revenues back in the calculation of net revenues. See Schedule of Non-GAAP Information for additional disclosures regarding the use of net revenues. The elimination of management and performance fees earned from CIP decreased by $2.7 million to $38.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2013 (year ended December 31, 2012 : $41.0 million ). The decrease is primarily due to the impact of funds deconsolidated during the year ended December 31, 2012 . Once the funds are deconsolidated, the management and performance fees are no longer eliminated and are reflected in the respective revenue line items in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The elimination of management and performance fees earned from CIP decreased by $6.3 million to $41.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2012 (year ended December 31, 2011: $47.3 million). The decrease is primarily due to the impact of funds deconsolidated during the year ended December 31, 2012. Operating Expenses The main categories of operating expenses, and the dollar and percentage changes between periods, are as follows: Variance Years ended December 31, 2013 vs 2012 2012 vs 2011 $ in millions 2013 2012 2011 $ Change % Change $ Change % Change Employee compensation 1,329.3 1,228.0 1,180.7 101.3 8.2 % 47.3 4.0 % Third-party distribution, service and advisory 1,489.2 1,308.2 1,279.4 181.0 13.8 % 28.8 2.3 % Marketing 98.6 102.2 85.3 (3.6 ) (3.5 )% 16.9 19.8 % Property, office and technology 292.8 265.1 242.9 27.7 10.4 % 22.2 9.1 % General and administrative 311.3 296.1 282.5 15.2 5.1 % 13.6 4.8 % Transaction and integration 3.2 8.2 29.4 (5.0 ) (61.0 )% (21.2 ) (72.1 )% Total operating expenses 3,524.4 3,207.8 3,100.2 316.6 9.9 % 107.6 3.5 % The table below sets forth these expense categories as a percentage of total operating expenses and operating revenues, which we believe provides useful information as to the relative significance of each type of expense. $ in millions 2013 % of Total Operating Expenses % of Operating Revenues 2012 % of Total Operating Expenses % of Operating Revenues 2011 % of Total Operating Expenses % of Operating Revenues Employee compensation 1,329.3 37.7 % 28.6 % 1,228.0 38.3 % 30.3 % 1,180.7 38.1 % 29.6 % Third-party distribution, service and advisory 1,489.2 42.3 % 32.1 % 1,308.2 40.8 % 32.3 % 1,279.4 41.3 % 32.1 % Marketing 98.6 2.8 % 2.1 % 102.2 3.2 % 2.5 % 85.3 2.8 % 2.1 % Property, office and technology 292.8 8.3 % 6.3 % 265.1 8.3 % 6.5 % 242.9 7.8 % 6.1 % General and administrative 311.3 8.8 % 6.7 % 296.1 9.2 % 7.3 % 282.5 9.1 % 7.1 % Transaction and integration 3.2 0.1 % 0.1 % 8.2 0.2 % 0.2 % 29.4 0.9 % 0.7 % Total operating expenses 3,524.4 100.0 % 75.9 % 3,207.8 100.0 % 79.1 % 3,100.2 100.0 % 77.7 % During the year ended December 31, 2013 , operating expenses increased by $316.6 million ( 9.9% ) to $3,524.4 million (year ended December 31, 2012 : $ 3,207.8 million ). Excluding marketing and transaction and integration, all expense categories increased 45 Table of Contents in 2013 when compared to 2012 . The impact of foreign exchange rate movements offset the increase in operating expenses by $40.2 million , or 1.1% of total operating expenses, during the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2012 . During the year ended December 31, 2012 , operating expenses increased by $ 107.6 million ( 3.5% ) to $ 3,207.8 million (year ended December 31, 2011 : $ 3,100.2 million ). Excluding transaction and integration, all expense categories increased in 2012 when compared to 2011 . The impact of foreign exchange rate movements offset the increase in operating expenses by $22.9 million, or 0.7% of total operating expenses, during the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2011 . Employee Compensation Employee compensation includes salary, cash bonuses and share-based payment plans designed to attract and retain the highest caliber employees. Employee staff benefit plan costs and payroll taxes are also included in employee compensation. Employee compensation increased $101.3 million ( 8.2% ) to $1,329.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2013 (year ended December 31, 2012 : $1,228.0 million ). The impact of foreign exchange rate movements offset the increase in employee compensation by $17.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2012 . After allowing for foreign exchange rate changes, the increase in employee compensation was $118.7 million . Direct compensation increased $101.9 million and includes increases in annual cash bonuses of $59.5 million, base salaries of $13.7 million, sales commissions of $11.5 million, share-based costs of $2.9 million and other deferred compensation costs of $11.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2013 when compared to the year ended December 31, 2012 . Improved company performance was the primary reason for the increase in compensation. Direct compensation also included a $3.5 million increase in signing and severance costs and $3.1 million increase in bonuses linked to performance fee revenues, offset by a $4.5 million reduction in vacation expense during the year ended December 31, 2013 when compared to the year ended December 31, 2012 . Other employee compensation increases included a $9.2 million increase in payroll taxes related to increased compensation costs and a $5.8 million increase in staff relocation costs during the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2012 , related primarily to relocations of several U.S. based groups. Employee compensation increased $ 47.3 million ( 4.0% ) to $ 1,228.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2012 (year ended December 31, 2011 : $ 1,180.7 million ). The impact of foreign exchange rate movements offset the increase in employee compensation by $10.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2011 . After allowing for foreign exchange rate changes, the increase in employee compensation was $58.2 million. Direct compensation increased $64.2 million and includes increases in share-based costs of $22.0 million and other deferred compensation costs of $12.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2012 when compared to the year ended December 31, 2011 . The increase in share-based and deferred cash compensation costs in 2012 includes the impact of a previous change in our vesting service period from three to four years, which results in 2012 being the first year with four award tranches being expensed, as compared to three award tranches in previous years. The change accounts for approximately $17.6 million of the increase in share-based and other deferred compensation expense. The increase in deferred cash compensation also includes $8.1 million from the appreciation of the deferred liability as the return to the employee is linked to specific investments, typically the funds managed by the employee. The remaining increase in share-based and deferred compensation costs reflects the increased use of deferred awards for staff retention purposes. Other changes in direct compensation were an increase in sales commissions of $16.8 million, a $2.6 million increase in bonuses linked to performance fee revenues, $6.3 million increase in base salaries and a $5.4 million reduction in annual cash bonuses during the year ended December 31, 2012 when compared to the year ended December 31, 2011 . The increase in direct compensation expense was partly offset by decreases in staff benefits and related expense of $6.1 million that included a $15.0 million reduction in amortization of prepaid compensation related to the 2006 acquisition of W.L. Ross & Co., which was fully amortized as of September 30, 2011. The reduced amortization expense was partly offset by a $2.6 million increase in staff medical insurance and a $4.4 million increase in staff relocation costs during the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2011 . Staff related expenses in 2012 included termination costs of $18.5 million. Headcount, on a continuing operations basis, at December 31, 2013 was 5,932 (years ended December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011 : 5,889 and 5,917 respectively). The company had 6,128 and 6,162 employees for the years ended December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011 , respectively, including employees of Atlantic Trust. Third-Party Distribution, Service and Advisory Expenses Third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses are discussed above in the operating and net revenues section. 46 Table of Contents Marketing Marketing expenses include the cost of direct advertising of our products through trade publications, television and other media, and public relations costs, such as the marketing of the company's products through conferences or other sponsorships, and the cost of marketing-related employee travel. Marketing expenses decreased by $3.6 million ( 3.5% ) in the year ended December 31, 2013 to $98.6 million (year ended December 31, 2012 : $102.2 million ). Excluding the impact of foreign exchange rate movements of $0.7 million , the decrease in marketing expenses was $2.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2012 . The decrease during the year ended December 31, 2013 includes decreases in sales literature and research of $1.7 million, marketing travel and entertainment expenses of $1.7 million, other marketing costs of $1.7 million and corporate sponsorships of $0.7 million. These were offset by increases in client event expenses of $2.5 million, driven by advertising campaigns as we focused on specific product awareness, and advertising expense increases of $0.4 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2012 , which includes $2.0 million of fourth-quarter 2013 advertising costs related to new product launches. Marketing expenses increased by $ 16.9 million ( 19.8% ) in the year ended December 31, 2012 to $ 102.2 million (year ended December 31, 2011 : $ 85.3 million ). The impact of foreign exchange rate movements offset the increase in marketing expenses by $1.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2011 . After allowing for foreign exchange rate changes, the increase in marketing expenses was $18.0 million. Marketing expenses in 2011 included a $13.4 million expense credit as a result of the termination of the company's sponsorship and naming rights commitments related to a sports stadium in Denver, Colorado. Other marketing expenses increases were advertising expense of $4.7 million, client event expenses of $3.2 million, sales literature and research of $1.2 million and other marketing costs of $1.2 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2011 . Property, Office and Technology Property, office and technology expenses include rent and utilities for our various leased facilities, depreciation of company-owned property, capitalized software and computer equipment costs, minor non-capitalized computer equipment and software purchases and related maintenance payments, and costs related to externally provided operations, technology, and other back office management services. Property, office and technology costs increased by $27.7 million ( 10.4% ) to $292.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2013 (year ended December 31, 2012 : $265.1 million ). The impact of foreign exchange rate movements offset the increase in property, office and technology expenses by $3.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2012 . After allowing for foreign exchange rate movements, the increase was $31.4 million. Property and office costs decreased $0.8 million compared to 2012 , due to decreases in rent expense of $2.6 million, $0.8 million in operating service and property management fees, other property costs of $0.7 million and property lease decreases of $0.1 million. This was partially offset by increases in depreciation of $3.4 million. The decrease in rent expense is, in part, due to a prior year $1.7 million exit charge for leased space related to consolidation of office space. The depreciation increase includes charges for lease exits in Canada and a full year of depreciation on renovations in the Houston and Toronto offices completed during the prior year. Technology and communications expenses increased $32.2 million over the comparable 2012 period. The increase includes increased outsourced administration costs of $15.1 million as the current year reflects the U.K. and the European transfer agency transitions to a third party provider, which were completed mid-2013. The increase also includes a charge of $11.7 million in 2013 related to the write-off of capitalized IT software development costs, together with increased depreciation expenses of $6.3 million from an ongoing investment in portfolio management and client engagement technology initiatives. Property, office and technology costs increased by $ 22.2 million ( 9.1% ) to $265.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2012 (year ended December 31, 2011 : $242.9 million ). The impact of foreign exchange rate movements offset the increase in property, office and technology expenses by $2.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2011 . After allowing for foreign exchange rate movements, the increase is $24.7 million. Property and office expenses increased $6.6 million over the comparable 2011 period, due to an increase of $4.3 million in depreciation expense and $3.2 million in rent expense. The depreciation increase is largely attributable to leasehold improvements as both our Houston and Toronto offices renovated leased space during 2012. This was partially offset by a decrease of $0.8 million in operating service and property 47 Table of Contents management fees. The increase in rent expense included a $1.7 million exit charge for leased space, related to consolidation of office space. Technology and communications expenses increased $18.0 million in 2012 over the comparable 2011 period. The increase reflects an ongoing investment in portfolio management and client engagement technology initiatives that resulted in increases in software and hardware expenses of $9.4 million, together with increased outsourced administration costs of $7.3 million as the U.K and European transfer agency transitions to a third party provider. At December 31, 2012 , the U.K. transfer agency outsourcing was complete, and the European outsourcing was completed in mid-2013. General and Administrative General and administrative expenses include professional services costs, such as information service subscriptions, consulting fees, professional insurance costs, audit, tax and legal fees, non-marketing related employee travel expenditures, recruitment and training costs, and the amortization of certain intangible assets. General and administrative expenses increased by $15.2 million ( 5.1% ) to $311.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2013 (year ended December 31, 2012 : $296.1 million ). The impact of foreign exchange rate movements offset the increase in general and administrative expenses by $3.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2012 . After allowing for foreign exchange rate movements, the increase was $18.9 million. The increase in general and administrative expense is primarily due to higher professional services, contractor and legal costs of $19.2 million, including increased costs relating to regulatory-driven activity in the U.K., costs to develop the compliance and risk management support functions across Europe and costs associated with new product development. Other increases include $5.5 million of travel expenses, $2.6 million of value added taxes (VAT) and $2.5 million of information services. These other increases are offset by a $9.2 million decrease in intangible amortization expense and a $1.9 million reduction in foreign exchange settlement costs. The decrease in intangible amortization in 2013 reflects the completion in mid-2012 of amortization of brand intangibles related an acquired business. General and administrative expenses increased by $13.6 million ( 4.8% ) to $296.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2012 (year ended December 31, 2011 : $ 282.5 million ). The increase in general and administrative expense is largely due to increased expenses of our CIP which includes increases in legal and fund launch costs, of $18.5 million. General and administrative expenses also include acquisition related contingent consideration adjustments with a $2.3 million credit in 2012 compared to a $13.2 million credit in 2011. The reduction in the amounts credited in 2012 versus 2011 resulted in an increase in general and administrative expenses of $10.9 million in 2012. Offsetting these expense increases was a $10.3 million decrease in intangible amortization expense and a $5.2 million reduction in mutual fund expenses. The decrease in intangible amortization in 2012 reflects the write down of certain management contract intangibles in 2011 and the completion in mid-2012 of amortization of brand intangibles related to the acquired business. The impact of foreign exchange rate movements offset the increase in general and administrative expenses by $2.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2011 . Transaction and integration Transaction and integration expenses include acquisition-related charges incurred during the periods to effect a business combination, including legal, regulatory, advisory, valuation, integration-related employee incentive awards and other professional or consulting fees, general and administrative costs, including travel costs related to the transaction and the costs of temporary staff involved in executing the transaction, and post-closing costs of integrating the acquired business into the company's existing operations. Additionally, transaction and integration expenses include legal costs related to the defense of legal challenges to auction rate preferred securities redemptions with respect to various closed-end funds included in the acquisition. See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 18 , Commitments and Contingencies for additional information. Transaction and integration charges were $3.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2013 (year ended December 31, 2012 : $8.2 million ) and largely relate to the business acquired in 2010. Transaction and integration expenses during the year ended December 31, 2013 primarily relate to fund mergers and include professional services and shareholder communications costs. These costs ceased in the first half of 2013. Transaction and integration charges were $8.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2012 (year ended December 31, 2011 : $ 29.4 million ) and largely relate to the business acquired in 2010. Transaction and integration expenses during the year ended December 31, 2012 primarily relate to the final round of open-ended fund mergers and include professional services and shareholder communications costs, as well as updates in sales literature. 48 Table of Contents Operating Income, Adjusted Operating Income, Operating Margin and Adjusted Operating Margin Operating income increased by $277.6 million ( 32.9% ) to $1,120.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2013 (year ended December 31, 2012 : $842.6 million ). Operating margin (operating income divided by operating revenues), increased to 24.1% in the year ended December 31, 2013 from 20.8% in the year ended December 31, 2012 . The increase in operating income and margin resulted from a greater relative increase in operating revenues ( 14.7% ) than in operating expenses ( 9.9% ) during the period. Adjusted operating income, increased by $280.0 million ( 27.7% ) to $1,292.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2013 from $1,012.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2012 . Adjusted operating margin increased to 39.7% in the year ended December 31, 2013 from 35.7% in the year ended December 31, 2012 . See Schedule of Non-GAAP Information for a reconciliation of operating revenues to net revenues, a reconciliation of operating income to adjusted operating income and additional important disclosures regarding net revenues, adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin. Operating income decreased by $ 39.5 million (4.5)% to $ 842.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2012 (year ended December 31, 2011 : $ 882.1 million ). Operating margin (operating income divided by operating revenues), decreased to 20.8% in the year ended December 31, 2012 from 22.2% in the year ended December 31, 2011 . The decrease in operating income and margin resulted from a lower relative increase in operating revenues ( 1.6% ) than in operating expenses ( 3.5% ) during the period. Adjusted operating income decreased by $34.1 million ( 3.3% ) to $1,012.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2012 from $1,046.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 . Adjusted operating margin decreased to 35.7% in the year ended December 31, 2012 from 37.5% in the year ended December 31, 2011 . Other Income and Expenses The main categories of other income and expenses, and the dollar and percentage changes between periods are as follows: Variance Years ended December 31, 2013 vs 2012 2012 vs 2011 $ in millions 2013 2012 2011 $ Change % Change $ Change % Change Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates 35.5 29.7 30.5 5.8 19.5 % (0.8 ) (2.6 )% Interest and dividend income 10.0 9.8 11.0 0.2 2.0 % (1.2 ) (10.9 )% Interest expense (44.6 ) (52.3 ) (61.8 ) 7.7 (14.7 )% 9.5 (15.4 )% Other gains and losses, net 2.6 8.3 49.0 (5.7 ) (68.7 )% (40.7 ) (83.1 )% Other income/(loss) of CSIP, net 2.9 2.9 N/A N/A Other income and expenses of CIP: Interest and dividend income of CIP 190.0 258.5 307.2 (68.5 ) (26.5 )% (48.7 ) (15.9 )% Interest expense of CIP (123.3 ) (168.3 ) (187.0 ) 45.0 (26.7 )% 18.7 (10.0 )% Other gains/(losses) of CIP, net 61.9 (97.7 ) (138.9 ) 159.6 N/A 41.2 (29.7 )% Total other income and expenses 135.0 (12.0 ) 10.0 147.0 N/A (22.0 ) N/A Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates increased by $5.8 million ( 19.5% ) to $35.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2013 (year ended December 31, 2012 : $29.7 million ). The increase in equity in earnings is driven by net increases in our share of the market-driven valuation increases in the underlying holdings of $8.5 million in our private equity partnership investments and $0.7 million in our real estate partnership investments, offset by decreases of the same nature of $1.9 million in our investment in Invesco Mortgage Capital Inc. and $1.5 million in certain other partnerships. Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates decreased by $0.8 million (2.6%) to $29.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2012 (year ended December 31, 2011 : $30.5 million). The decrease in equity in earnings is driven by the declines in our pre-tax earnings from our joint venture investments in China of $3.4 million, offset by the increase of $2.6 million in our share of the market-driven valuation changes in the underlying holdings of certain partnership investments, which includes our investment in Invesco Mortgage Capital Inc. 49 Table of Contents Interest and dividend income and interest expense Interest and dividend income increased by $0.2 million ( 2.0% ) to $10.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2013 (year ended December 31, 2012 : $9.8 million ). Interest expense decreased by $7.7 million (14.7)% to $44.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2013 (year ended December 31, 2012 : $52.3 million ) primarily due to the changes in long-term financing arrangements made during 2012 which lowered the overall borrowing costs versus the comparative period. Interest and dividend income decreased by $1.2 million (10.9%) to $9.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2012 (year ended December 31, 2011 : $11.0 million).The decrease in interest and dividend income is largely due to a decrease in investment income and interest earned on cash and cash equivalents of $1.1 million. The remaining $0.1 million decrease is due to a reduction of dividend income on investments held to hedge economically deferred compensation plans. This dividend income is passed through to employee participants in the deferred compensation plans. Interest expense decreased by $9.5 million (15.4%) to $52.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2012 (year ended December 31, 2011 : $61.8 million) primarily due to the retirement of the $215.1 million 5.625% senior notes in April 2012. Lower borrowing costs versus the comparative period also contributed to lower interest for the period. Other gains and losses, net Other gains and losses, net were a net gain of $2.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to a net gain of $8.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2012 . Included within other gains and losses, net in the year ended December 31, 2013 is a net gain of $38.5 million resulting from the appreciation of investments held for our deferred compensation plans and net realized gains from available for sale and other investments of $5.0 million. These gains were offset by a realized loss of $6.6 million on the liquidation of a co-investment and sale of other securities together with a loss of $31.9 million recorded for a payment to a managed investment trust which resulted in the subsequent termination of an outstanding support agreement. A net loss of $1.8 million was also recorded in 2013 related to the mark-to-market of foreign exchange put option contracts intended to provide protection against the impact of a significant decline in the Pound Sterling/U.S Dollar foreign exchange rate. In the year ended December 31, 2013 , we experienced $ 0.6 million in net foreign exchange losses (year ended December 31, 2012 : $0.3 million in net foreign exchange gains) on the revaluation of intercompany foreign currency denominated loans into the various functional currencies of our subsidiaries. See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, - Note 14 , "Other Gains and Losses, Net" for additional information. Other gains and losses, net were a net gain of $8.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to a net gain of $49.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 . Included within other gains and losses in the year ended December 31, 2012 is a net gain of $19.7 million resulting from the appreciation of investments held for our deferred compensation plans, a gain on the sale of CLO management contracts of $8.3 million, net realized gains from seed and other investments of $5.0 million and a $3.7 million gain on an acquisition-related loan note held to hedge the company's net interest in certain consolidated investment products. These gains were offset by a fourth-quarter charge of $23.5 million related to the call premiums on the redemption of the $333.5 million principal amount of 5.375% senior notes due February 27, 2013 and the $197.1 million principal amount of the 5.375% senior notes due December 15, 2014. A net loss of $2.5 million was also recorded in 2012 related to the mark-to-market of 12-month foreign exchange put option contracts intended to provide protection against the impact of a significant decline in the Pound Sterling/U.S Dollar foreign exchange rate. We incurred $0.8 million in other-than-temporary impairment charges related to seed money investments during the year ended December 31, 2012 (year ended December 31, 2011: $0.9 million) and an impairment charge of $1.9 million related to a cost method investment. In the year ended December 31, 2012, we experienced $0.3 million in net foreign exchange gains (year ended December 31, 2011: $0.6 million in net foreign exchange losses) on the revaluation of intercompany foreign currency denominated loans into the various functional currencies of our subsidiaries. In 2011, other gains and losses included a credit of $45.0 million related to the settlement of litigation arising from the 2007 departure of certain investment professionals to a competitor. Other income/(loss) of CSIP In the year ended December 31, 2013, other income/(loss) of CSIP, net totaled $ 2.9 million in income and consists of $0.9 million of interest and dividend income and other gains of $2.0 million. CSIP products were initially consolidated in the third quarter of 2013. See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes 1 , "Accounting Policies" and 19 , Consolidated Sponsored Investment Products, for additional details. 50 Table of Contents Non-operating income and expense of CIP Interest income of CIP results from interest generated by the collateral assets held by consolidated CLOs, which is used to satisfy the interest expenses of the notes issued by the consolidated CLOs and other CLO operating expense requirements, including the payment of the management and performance fees to the company as investment manager. See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 20 , Consolidated Investment Products, for additional details. In the year ended December 31, 2013 , interest and dividend income of CIP decreased by $68.5 million ( 26.5% ) to $190.0 million (year ended December 31, 2012 : $258.5 million ) primarily due to the impact of the third quarter 2012 sale of our management agreements and equity interests in certain CLOs. Interest expense of CIP decreased by $45.0 million ( 26.7% ) to $123.3 million (year ended December 31, 2012 : $168.3 million ), also primarily due to the impact of the third quarter 2012 sale of our management agreements and equity interests in certain CLOs. Included in other gains/(losses) of CIP, net, are realized and unrealized gains and losses on the underlying investments and debt of CIP. In the year ended December 31, 2013 , other gains and losses of CIP were a net gain of $61.9 million , as compared to a net loss of $97.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2012 . The net gain in the 2013 period is primarily associated with an increase in market value of CLO and private equity investments exceeding losses associated with the increase in market value of the long-term debt of CLOs. In the year ended December 31, 2012 , interest income of CIP decreased by $48.7 million (15.9%) to $258.5 million (year ended December 31, 2011 : $307.2 million) primarily due to the deconsolidation of certain CLO products in the year, as well as the impact of certain CLOs entering their amortization period. Interest expense of CIP decreased by $18.7 million (10.0%) to $168.3 million (year ended December 31, 2011 : $187.0 million) primarily due to CLO deconsolidation. Upon deconsolidation, the operating activities of the managed fund no longer gross up the Consolidated Statements of Income. In the year ended December 31, 2012 other gains and losses of CIP were a net loss of $97.7 million, as compared to a net loss of $138.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 . The net loss in the 2012 period is primarily associated with real estate investments and increases in the market values of the long-term debt of CLOs that more than offset gains in the market values of investments held by CLOs. Net impact of CIP and related noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities As illustrated in the Summary of Income Statement Impact of CIP table at the beginning of this Results of Operations section, the consolidation of investment products during the year ended December 31, 2013 resulted in an increase to net income of $36.0 million before attribution to noncontrolling interests. Invesco invests in only a portion of these products, and as a result this net gain is offset by noncontrolling interests of $44.7 million , resulting in a net decrease in net income of the company of $8.7 million . The consolidation of investment products during the year ended December 31, 2012 resulted in a decrease to net income of $100.5 million before attribution to noncontrolling interests. This net loss is offset by noncontrolling interests of $89.8 million, resulting in a net decrease in net income of the company of $10.7 million. The consolidation of investment products during the year ended December 31, 2011 resulted in a decrease to net income of $87.4 million before attribution to noncontrolling interests. This net loss is offset by noncontrolling interests of $107.6 million, resulting in a net increase in net income of the company of $20.2 million. Noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities represent the profit or loss amounts attributed to third party investors in CIP. Movements in amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities on the company's Consolidated Statements of Income generally offset the gains and losses, interest income and interest expense of CIP. Additionally, CIP represent less than 1% of the company's AUM. Therefore, the net gains or losses of CIP are not indicative of the performance of the company's aggregate assets under management. 51 Table of Contents Income Before Taxes Total income before taxes includes income before taxes of CIP. CIP are taxed at the investor level and not at the product entity level; therefore, there is no tax provision reflected in the net impact of CIP. Accordingly, the table included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 15 , "Taxation," illustrating the division of income/(losses) before taxes between U.S. and Foreign is formatted such that the income before taxes of CIP is separately stated. The commentary below discusses disparities between U.S. and Foreign income before taxes in the Taxation footnote and U.S. and Foreign operating revenues in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 17 , "Geographic Information." Total U.S. income before taxes of $598.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 includes income before taxes of CIP of $45.2 million , which primarily consists of income from consolidated private equity partnerships. U.S. income before taxes from CIP decreased $14.5 million ( 24.3% ) from 2012 due primarily to lower investment gains generated by these private equity partnerships. Excluding CIP, U.S. income before taxes in 2013 increased $96.5 million ( 21.1% ). Income before taxes in 2013 increased due to a larger increase in U.S. operating revenues (12.8%) than operating expenses and other income and expenses (9.8%). Total Foreign income before taxes of $656.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 includes losses before taxes of CIP of $9.2 million , which primarily consists of losses from consolidated CLOs. Foreign CIP pre-tax losses totaled $9.2 million in 2013 compared to pre-tax losses of $160.2 million in 2012 primarily due to lower losses on investments held by the Company's consolidated CLOs in 2013 and the third quarter 2012 sale of our management agreements and equity interests in certain CLOs. Excluding CIP, foreign income before taxes increased by $191.6 million ( 40.4% ). Foreign income in 2013 increased more significantly than the 16.2% increase in foreign operating revenues due to decreased foreign expenses incurred in 2013 , such as the $15.3 million additional distribution fee recorded in 2012 in the U.K., as discussed above, and the completion of the outsourcing of the European transfer agency and related expenses. Total U.S. income before taxes of $516.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 ( December 31, 2011 : $563.4 million ) includes income before taxes of CIP of $59.7 million ( December 31, 2011 : $93.0 million ). U.S. income before taxes of CIP primarily consists of income from consolidated private equity partnerships and for the year ended December 31, 2012 , was a decrease of $33.3 million ( 35.8% ) from 2011 due primarily to lower gains generated by these private equity partnerships. Excluding CIP, U.S. income before taxes in 2012 decrease d $ 13.8 million ( 2.9% ). Income before taxes in 2012 had a small decrease, contrary to the 4.3% increase in U.S. operating revenues, due primarily to a legal settlement gain recognized in 2011. Total Foreign income before taxes of $314.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 ( December 31, 2011 : $328.7 million ) includes losses before taxes of CIP of $160.2 million ( December 31, 2011 : income before taxes of CIP of $180.4 million ). Foreign income in 2012 decreased more significantly than the 0.8% decrease in Foreign operating revenues during the period due to increased foreign expenses incurred in 2012, such as the $15.3 million additional distribution fee recorded in the U.K., as discussed above, and expenses incurred in connection with the outsourcing of the European transfer agency. Income Tax Expense Our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2013 decreased to 26.8% (year ended December 31, 2012 : 31.5% ) primarily due to income in non-controlling interests in 2013 versus losses in 2012 . The inclusion of non-controlling interests decreased our effective tax rate by 0.9% in 2013 and increased our rate 3.1% in 2012 . The remainder of the rate movement was primarily due to changes in the mix of pre-tax income. Our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2012 increased to 31.5% (year ended December 31, 2011 : 31.4% ) due to a smaller impact from losses in non-controlling interests in 2012 versus income in 2011 . The inclusion of non-controlling interests in consolidated entities increased our effective tax rate by 3.1% in 2012 and 3.4% in 2011 . The remainder of the rate movement was primarily due to changes in the mix of pre-tax income. The 2011 rate reflects a favorable impact from the release of provisions for uncertain tax positions as a result of the statute of limitation closing. Income from Discontinued Operations On December 31, 2013, the company completed the sale of Atlantic Trust. The operating results and the gain associated with the sale are reflected as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Income and are therefore excluded from the continuing operations of Invesco. Comparative periods shown in the Consolidated Statements of Income have been adjusted to conform with this presentation. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 23 , "Discontinued Operations." 52 Table of Contents Schedule of Non-GAAP Information We are presenting the following non-GAAP performance measures: net revenue (and by calculation, net revenue yield on AUM), adjusted operating income (and by calculation, adjusted operating margin), adjusted net income attributable to common shareholders (and by calculation, adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS)). We believe these non-GAAP measures provide greater transparency into our business on an ongoing operations basis and allow more appropriate comparisons with industry peers. Management uses these performance measures to evaluate the business, and they are consistent with internal management reporting. The most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures are operating revenues (and by calculation, gross revenue yield on AUM), operating income (and by calculation, operating margin), net income (and by calculation, diluted EPS). Each of these measures is discussed more fully below. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered as substitutes for any measures derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. Additional reconciling items may be added in the future to these non-GAAP measures if deemed appropriate. The tax effect related to reconciling items that are presented net of tax have been calculated based on the tax rate attributable to the jurisdiction to which the transaction relates.

(1) Proportional share of net revenues and operating income from joint venture investments The company has two joint venture investments in China. The Invesco Great Wall joint venture is one of the largest Sino-foreign managers of equity products in China, with AUM of approximately $10.1 billion as of December 31, 2013 . The company has a 49% interest in Invesco Great Wall. The company also has a 50% joint venture with Huaneng Capital Services to access private equity investment opportunities in power generation in China through Huaneng Invesco WLR Investment Consulting Company Ltd. Enhancing our operations in China is one effort that we believe could improve our competitive position over time. Accordingly, we believe that it is appropriate to evaluate the contribution of our joint venture investments to the operations of the business. Management believes that the addition of our proportional share of revenues, net of distribution expenses, from our Chinese joint venture investments in the computation of net revenues and the addition of our proportional share of operating income in the related computations of adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin also provide useful information to investors and other users of the company's Consolidated Financial Statements, as management considers it appropriate to evaluate the contribution of its joint ventures to the operations of the business. It is also consistent with the presentation of AUM and net flows (where our proportional share of the ending balances and related activity are reflected) and therefore provides a more meaningful calculation of net revenue yield on AUM. (2) Third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses Third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses include renewal commissions, management fee rebates and distribution costs (12b-1 and marketing support) paid to brokers and independent financial advisors. See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1 , "Accounting Policies - Revenue Recognition" for additional details. While the terms used for these types of expenses vary by geography, they are all expense items that are closely linked to the value of AUM and the revenue earned by Invesco from AUM. Since the company has been deemed to be the principal in the third-party arrangements, the company must reflect these expenses gross of operating revenues under U.S. GAAP. Management believes that the deduction of third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses from operating revenues in the computation of net revenues (and by calculation, net revenue yield on AUM) and the related computation of adjusted operating income (and by calculation, adjusted operating margin) appropriately reflects the nature of these expenses as revenue-sharing activities, as these costs are passed through to external parties who perform functions on behalf of, and distribute, the company managed funds. Further, these expenses vary extensively by geography due to the differences in distribution channels. The net presentation assists in identifying the revenue contribution generated by the business, removing distortions caused by the differing distribution channel fees and allowing for a fair comparison with U.S. peer investment managers and within Invesco own investment units. Additionally, management evaluates net revenue yield 54 Table of Contents on AUM, which is equal to net revenues divided by average AUM during the reporting period. This financial measure is an indicator of the basis point net revenues we receive for each dollar of AUM we manage and is useful when evaluating the company performance relative to industry competitors and within the company for capital allocation purposes. (3) CIP See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 20 - Consolidated Investment Products for a detailed analysis of the impact to the company Consolidated Financial Statements from the consolidation of CIP. The reconciling items add back the management and performance fees earned by Invesco from the consolidated products and remove the revenues and expenses recorded by the consolidated products that have been included in the U.S. GAAP Consolidated Statements of Income. Management believes that the consolidation of investment products may impact a reader's analysis of our underlying results of operations and could result in investor confusion or the production of information about the company by analysts or external credit rating agencies that is not reflective of the underlying results of operations and financial condition of the company. Accordingly, management believes that it is appropriate to adjust operating revenues, operating income and net income for the impact of CIP in calculating the respective net revenues, adjusted operating income and adjusted net income. CIP Revenue: $ in millions, except per share data 2013 2012 2011 2010 2009 Management fees earned from CIP, eliminated upon consolidation 27.0 38.6 46.8 45.3 8.0 Performance fees earned from CIP, eliminated upon consolidation 11.3 2.4 0.5 Other revenues recorded by CIP (0.4 ) (0.3 ) (2.0 ) CIP related adjustments in arriving at net revenues 37.9 41.0 47.3 45.0 6.0 (4) Acquisition/disposition related adjustments Acquisition/disposition related adjustments include transaction and integration expenses, costs related to legal settlements of pre-acquisition matters, intangible asset amortization, including amortization related to the write-off of related management contract intangible assets, changes in estimates of contingent earn-out liabilities booked from prior acquisitions, employee severance expenses associated with the cessation of activities related to a previous acquisition, amortization of prepaid compensation related to the 2006 acquisition of W.L. Ross & Co., tax cash flow benefits resulting from tax amortization of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, and all related tax effects. While finite-lived intangible assets are amortized under U.S. GAAP, there is no amortization charge on goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles. In certain qualifying situations, these can be amortized for tax purposes, generally over a 15-year period, as is the case in the U.S. These cash flows (in the form of reduced taxes payable) represent tax benefits that are not included in the Consolidated Statements of Income absent an impairment charge or the disposal of the related business. The company receives these cash flow benefits but does not anticipate a sale or impairment of these assets in the foreseeable future, and therefore the deferred tax liability recognized under U.S. GAAP is not expected to be used either through a credit in the Consolidated Statements of Income or through settlement of tax obligations. In addition, the results of the discontinued operations of Atlantic Trust have been excluded in arriving at adjusted net income attributable to common shareholders, which is the basis of calculating adjusted diluted EPS. Accordingly, the company's non-GAAP financial measures reflect only the continuing business of Invesco. Management believes this presentation assists in evaluating the ongoing business performance and aids comparability with peer companies that may not have similar discontinued operations. Transaction and integration expenses reflect the legal, regulatory, advisory, valuation, integration-related employee incentive awards and other professional or consulting fees, general and administrative costs, including travel costs related to transactions and the costs of temporary staff involved in executing the transaction, and the post-closing costs of integrating the acquired business into the company existing operations, including incremental costs associated with achieving synergy savings. Additionally, transaction and integration expenses include legal costs related to the defense of legal challenges to auction rate preferred securities redemptions with respect to various closed-end funds included in a prior acquisition. See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 18 - Commitments and Contingencies for additional information related to this matter. 55 Table of Contents Management believes it is useful to investors and other users of our Consolidated Financial Statements to adjust for the transaction and integration charges, tax cash flow benefits and other acquisition/disposition related adjustments, as noted above, in arriving at adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin and adjusted diluted EPS, as this will aid comparability of our results period to period, and aid comparability with peer companies that may not have similar acquisition and disposition related charges. See table below for a reconciliation of acquisition/disposition related items: $ in millions 2013 2012 2011 2010 2009 Acquisition/disposition related: Employee compensation expense 2.4 15.0 20.0 20.0 Transaction and integration expense 3.2 8.2 29.4 150.0 10.8 Intangible amortization expense 15.4 25.5 35.5 21.8 4.1 Change in contingent consideration estimates (2.3 ) (13.2 ) (3.8 ) Other acquisition-related item 2.0 Adjustments to operating income 23.0 31.4 66.7 188.0 34.9 Gain on sale of CLO management contracts (8.3 ) Taxation: Taxation on transaction and integration (1.3 ) (3.1 ) (11.2 ) (46.9 ) (1.9 ) Taxation on amortization (1.5 ) (2.6 ) (4.4 ) (2.9 ) (0.3 ) Deferred taxation 21.3 20.1 21.1 15.2 8.3 Taxation on change in contingent consideration estimates 1.3 Taxation on gain on sale of CLO management contracts 2.5 Taxation on other acquisition-related items (0.8 ) (Income)/loss from discontinued operations, net of taxes (64.5 ) (18.1 ) (9.9 ) (6.6 ) 0.8 Adjustments to net income attributable to common shareholders (23.8 ) 21.9 62.3 148.1 41.8 (5) Market movement on deferred compensation plan liabilities Certain deferred compensation plan awards involve a return to the employee linked to the appreciation (depreciation) of specified investments, typically the funds managed by the employee. Invesco hedges economically the exposure to market movements by holding these investments on its balance sheet. U.S. GAAP requires the appreciation (depreciation) in the compensation liability to be expensed over the award vesting period in proportion to the vested amount of the award as part of compensation expense. The full value of the investment appreciation (depreciation) is immediately recorded below operating income in other gains and losses. This creates a timing difference between the recognition of the compensation expense and the investment gain or loss impacting net income attributable to common shareholders and diluted EPS which will reverse over the life of the award and net to zero at the end of the multi-year vesting period. During periods of high market volatility these timing differences impact compensation expense, operating income and operating margin in a manner which, over the life of the award, will ultimately be offset by gains and losses recorded below operating income on the Consolidated Statements of Income. The non-GAAP measures exclude the mismatch created by differing U.S. GAAP treatments of the market movement on the liability and the investments. Since these plans are hedged economically, management believes it is useful to reflect the offset ultimately achieved from hedging the investment market exposure in the calculation of adjusted operating income (and by calculation, adjusted operating margin) and adjusted net income (and by calculation, adjusted diluted EPS), to produce results that will be more comparable period to period. The related fund shares will have been purchased on or around the date of grant, eliminating any ultimate cash impact from market movements that occur over the vesting period. Additionally, dividend income from investments held to hedge economically deferred compensation plans is recorded as dividend income and as compensation expense on the company Consolidated Statements of Income on the record dates. This dividend income is passed through to the employee participants in the plan and is not retained by the company. The non-GAAP measures exclude this dividend income and related compensation expense. 56 Table of Contents (6) Other reconciling items Each of these other reconciling items has been adjusted from U.S. GAAP to arrive at the company's non-GAAP financial measures for the reasons either outlined in the paragraphs above, due to the unique character and magnitude of the reconciling item, or because the item represents a continuation of a reconciling item adjusted from U.S. GAAP in a prior period. $ in millions 2013 2012 2011 2010 2009 Other non-GAAP adjustments: Investment management fees accrual adjustment (a) 4.3 Third party distribution, service and advisory expenses - European infrastructure initiative (b) 2.7 15.3 Adjustments to net revenues 7.0 15.3 European infrastructure initiative: (b) Employee compensation expense 1.6 5.6 7.6 Marketing expense 0.2 1.6 Property, office and technology expense 2.3 5.8 5.9 General and administrative expense 6.7 7.3 5.3 Capitalized software development write-off (c) 11.7 Termination of stadium naming rights (d) (10.4 ) U.K. FSCS levy (e) 0.4 15.3 Fund accounting reimbursement costs (f) (0.3 ) 8.9 Litigation settlement costs (g) 3.6 Adjustments to operating income 29.5 35.6 12.1 24.2 Foreign exchange hedge amortization (h) (0.6 ) 0.8 Payment to an investment trust (i) 31.9 Senior notes call premium (j) 23.5 Litigation settlement credit (g) (45.0 ) Taxation: Taxation on investment management fees accrual adjustment (a) (1.1 ) Taxation on European infrastructure initiative (b) (2.8 ) (7.6 ) (1.9 ) Taxation on capitalized software development write-off (c) (4.3 ) Taxation on termination of stadium naming rights (d) 4.0 Taxation on U.K. FSCS levy (e) (0.1 ) (4.3 ) Taxation on fund accounting reimbursement costs (f) 0.1 (2.9 ) Taxation on litigation settlement credit (g) 15.6 Taxation on foreign exchange hedge amortization (h) 0.2 (0.2 ) Taxation on payment to an investment trust (i) (12.1 ) Taxation on senior notes call premium (j) (5.8 ) Adjustments to net income attributable to common shareholders 40.7 46.3 (15.2 ) 17.0 a. During the three months ended December 31, 2013, the company reduced a management fee revenue accrual by $4.3 million to reflect a multi-year true-up. Inclusion of this true-up in the company non-GAAP financial information would depress the derived metric of net revenue yield on AUM from continuing operations, an important metric calculated from a non-GAAP financial measure which is often contemplated by users of the company financial information to evaluate the company with industry peers. The true-up is not indicative of a trend in future net revenue yield on AUM; therefore, it is not included in management evaluation of the results of the business. On this basis, the amount is added back to management fees to arrive at net revenue. 57 Table of Contents b. European infrastructure transformational initiative: The company has outsourced its European transfer agency and has made certain structural changes to product and distribution platforms. Expenses incurred related to the European infrastructure activities are excluded in arriving at the non-GAAP financial information. In connection with the initiative, operational process changes resulted in an accounting adjustment recognizing additional distribution expense in the years ended December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2013. c. Property, office and technology expenses includes a charge of $11.7 million in the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2013 related to the write-off of capitalized IT software development costs. d. Included within marketing expenses in the year ended December 31, 2011 is a credit of $10.4 million related to the termination of naming rights to the Denver Broncos stadium. e. Included within general and administrative expenses in the year ended December 31, 2010 was a charge of $15.3 million relating to a levy from the U.K. Financial Services Compensation Scheme. An additional $0.4 million charge was recorded in the year ended December 31, 2011 reflecting revised estimates of the levy. f. Included within general and administrative expenses in the year ended December 31, 2010 is a charge of $8.9 million representing reimbursement costs from the correction of historical foreign exchange allocations in the fund accounting process that impacted the reporting of fund performance in certain funds. A $0.3 million credit was recorded in the year ended December 31, 2011 reflecting the final amount reimbursed. g. Included within other gains and losses, net in the year ended December 31, 2011 is a credit of $45.0 million related to the settlement of litigation arising from the 2007 departure of certain investment professionals to a competitor. Included within general and administrative expenses are legal fees associated with the litigation of $3.6 million. h. Included within other gains and losses, net is the mark-to-market of foreign exchange put option contracts intended to provide protection against the impact of a significant decline in the Pound Sterling/U.S. Dollar foreign exchange rate. These contracts provide coverage through March 25, 2014. The adjustment from U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP earnings removes the impact of market volatility; therefore, the company's non-GAAP results include only the amortization of the cost of the contracts during the contract period. i. On December 31, 2013, at the time of creating a new trust company subsidiary to continue operating the company institutional trust activities immediately following the disposition of Atlantic Trust, the company made a $31.9 million payment to a managed investment trust, which resulted in the subsequent termination of an outstanding support agreement. This expense was recorded in other gains/(losses) in the company Consolidated Statement of Income during the year ended December 31, 2013. j. Other gains and losses, net included a charge of $23.5 million in the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2012 related to the call premiums on the redemption of the $333.5 million principal amount of 5.375% senior notes due February 27, 2013 and the $197.1 million principal amount of the 5.375% senior notes due December 15, 2014. Balance Sheet Discussion A summary of the balance sheet impact of CIP is presented below. The impact is illustrated in the tables immediately below by a column which shows the dollar-value change in the consolidated figures, as caused by the consolidation of CIP. For example, the impact of CIP on accounts receivable and investments for the year ended December 31, 2013 were reductions of $3.4 million and $55.3 million , respectively. This indicates that the consolidation of CIP reduced accounts receivable and investments by these amounts, reflecting the elimination upon consolidation of the underlying net interests in CIP held by the company. The majority of the company CIP are CLO-related. The collateral assets of the CLOs are held solely to satisfy the obligations of the CLOs. The company has no right to the benefits from, nor does it bear the risks associated with, the collateral assets held by the CLOs, beyond the company minimal direct investments in, and management fees generated from, CLOs. If the company were to liquidate, the collateral assets would not be available to the general creditors of the company, and as a result, the company does not consider them to be company assets. Likewise, if the CLOs were to liquidate, their investors would have no recourse to the general credit of the company. The company therefore does not consider this debt to be a company liability. As demonstrated by the balance sheet data that follows in this section and in the "Liquidity and Capital Resources" section, inclusion of the long-term debt of consolidated investment products within liquidity measures, such as debt-to-equity measures, causes the company to appear far more indebted than is the case. 58 Table of Contents Summary of Balance Sheet Impact of CIP December 31, 2013 December 31, 2012 $ in millions Impact of CIP Consolidated Total Impact of CIP Consolidated Total ASSETS Cash and cash equivalents 1,331.2 835.5 Unsettled fund receivables 932.4 550.1 Accounts receivable (3.4 ) 500.8 (4.4 ) 449.4 Investments (55.3 ) 839.7 (66.6 ) 610.7 Assets of CSIP 108.5 Assets of CIP: Cash and cash equivalents of CIP 583.6 583.6 287.8 287.8 Accounts receivable of CIP 58.3 58.3 84.1 84.1 Investments of CIP 4,734.7 4,734.7 4,550.6 4,550.6 Assets held for policyholders 1,416.0 1,153.6 Prepaid assets 101.4 99.9 Other assets 174.7 146.8 Deferred tax asset, net 7.4 38.4 Property and equipment, net 350.8 349.6 Intangible assets, net 1,263.7 1,287.7 Goodwill 6,867.3 7,048.2 Total assets 5,317.9 19,270.5 4,851.5 17,492.4 LIABILITIES Accrued compensation and benefits 676.4 609.8 Accounts payable and accrued expenses 763.1 (8.9 ) 626.4 Liabilities of CIP: Debt of CIP 4,181.7 4,181.7 3,899.4 3,899.4 Other liabilities of CIP 461.8 461.8 104.3 104.3 Policyholder payables 1,416.0 1,153.6 Unsettled fund payables 882.0 552.5 Long-term debt 1,588.6 1,186.0 Deferred tax liabilities, net 323.6 311.4 Total liabilities 4,643.5 10,293.2 3,994.8 8,443.4 EQUITY Equity attributable to common shareholders: Common shares 98.1 98.1 Additional paid-in-capital 6,100.8 6,141.0 Treasury shares (1,700.4 ) (1,382.9 ) Retained earnings 12.5 3,361.9 21.2 2,801.3 Retained earnings appropriated for investors in CIP 104.3 104.3 128.8 128.8 Accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax (12.7 ) 427.9 (20.9 ) 530.5 Total equity attributable to common shareholders 104.1 8,392.6 129.1 8,316.8 Equity attributable to nonredeemable noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities 570.3 584.7 727.6 732.2 Total equity 674.4 8,977.3 856.7 9,049.0 Total liabilities and equity 5,317.9 19,270.5 4,851.5 17,492.4 59 Table of Contents Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents increased by $495.7 million from $835.5 million at December 31, 2012 to $1,331.2 million at December 31, 2013 . See Cash Flows in the following section within this Management's Discussion and Analysis for additional discussion regarding the movements in cash flows during the periods. See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1 , Accounting Policies - Cash and Cash Equivalents, regarding requirements to retain liquid resources in certain jurisdictions. Unsettled fund receivables and payables Unsettled fund receivables increased by $382.3 million from $550.1 million at December 31, 2012 to $932.4 million at December 31, 2013 , due primarily to higher transaction activity between funds and investors in late December 2013 when compared to late December 2012 in our UITs, together with U.K. and cross-border funds. In the company's capacity as sponsor of UITs, the company records receivables from brokers, dealers, and clearing organizations for unsettled sell trades of securities and UITs in addition to receivables from customers for unsettled sell trades of UITs. In our U.K. and cross-border operations, unsettled fund receivables are created by the normal settlement periods on transactions initiated by certain clients. The presentation of the unsettled fund receivables and substantially offsetting payables ( $882.0 million at December 31, 2013 up from $552.5 million at December 31, 2012 ) at trade date reflects the legal relationship between the underlying investor and the company. Investments As of December 31, 2013 we had $839.7 million in investments. Included in investments are $233.8 million of seed money investments in affiliated funds used to seed funds as we launch new products, and $249.7 million of investments related to assets held for deferred compensation plans, which are also held primarily in affiliated funds. Seed investments increased by $120.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2013 , due primarily to funding of seed money investments and positive market activity and were partially offset by seed money redemptions. Investments held to hedge deferred compensation awards increased by $36.2 million during the year, primarily due to additional investments in affiliated funds to hedge economically new employee plan awards. Included in investments are $308.2 million in equity method investments in our Chinese and Indian joint ventures and in certain of the company private equity partnerships, real estate partnerships and other co-investments ( December 31, 2012 : $228.2 million ). The increase of $80.0 million in equity method investments was primarily driven by an increase of $91.4 million in our joint venture investments that included the 2013 purchase of a 49% interest in Religare Invesco Asset Management. and additional capital contributed to one of our Chinese joint ventures. The increase also includes current year retained earnings, net of distributions, and an $11.2 million valuation reduction due to foreign exchange rate movement, primarily attributable to the decline of the value of the Indian rupee against the U.S. dollar. Equity method investments also increased $47.1 million due to capital calls in co-investments, including $25.6 million into real estate funds, $15.3 million due to earnings and valuation adjustments and $5.5 million due to the de-consolidation of a fund previously consolidated under ASC 810, which was triggered by a change in ownership of the general partner of the fund. The increases in partnership investments were offset by distributions and capital returns of $40.7 million during the period, negative foreign exchange rate movement and the consolidation of two of our partnership funds. Assets of CSIP Assets of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Products (CSIP) consist of cash, investments and other assets of consolidated majority-held sponsored investment products. At December 31, 2013, CSIP assets include $93.2 million in investments, $12.7 million in cash and cash equivalents, and $2.6 million in accounts receivable and other assets (December 31, 2012: none). See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 1 , "Accounting Policies," and Note 19 , "Consolidated Sponsored Investment Products," for additional information. Assets held for policyholders and policyholder payables One of our subsidiaries, Invesco Perpetual Life Limited, is an insurance company that was established to facilitate retirement savings plans in the U.K. The entity holds assets that are managed for its clients on its balance sheet with an equal and offsetting liability. The increase in the balance of these accounts from $1,153.6 million at December 31, 2012 , to $1,416.0 million at December 31, 2013 , was the result of an increase in the market values of these assets and liabilities together with foreign exchange movements. 60 Table of Contents Intangible assets, net Intangible assets reflect a net decrease of $24.0 million from $1,287.7 million at December 31, 2012 , to $1,263.7 million at December 31, 2013 . The decrease in intangible assets, net is due to amortization of $17.1 million , foreign exchange movements of $4.7 million and the sale of $2.2 million of intangible assets in relation to the Atlantic Trust disposal. Goodwill Goodwill decreased from $7,048.2 million at December 31, 2012 , to $6,867.3 million at December 31, 2013 . The decrease is due to foreign exchange movements of $ 106.4 million and $74.5 million from the sale of Atlantic Trust at December 31, 2013. See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 6 , "Goodwill," for an analysis of the change in goodwill balances between periods. The company's annual goodwill impairment review is performed as of October 1 of each year. As a result of that analysis, the company determined that no impairment existed at that date. See Critical Accounting Policies - Goodwill for additional details of the company's goodwill impairment analysis process. Long-term debt Long-term debt increased from $1,186.0 million at December 31, 2012 , to $1,588.6 million at December 31, 2013 , an increase of $ 402.6 million . During the fourth quarter of 2013, the company issued senior notes with aggregate principal amounts of $600.0 million at 4.000% due January 30, 2024 and $400.0 million at 5.375% due November 30, 2043. Of the total net proceeds, $699.4 million was used to repay the amount outstanding on the credit facility with the remaining to be used for general corporate purposes. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our capital structure, together with available cash balances, cash flows generated from operations, existing capacity under our credit facility and further capital market activities, if necessary, should provide us with sufficient resources to meet present and future cash needs, including operating, debt and other obligations as they come due and anticipated future capital requirements. Material changes in the company's capital structure over the last three years include: 2013 : During the fourth quarter of 2013, the company issued senior notes with aggregate principal amounts of $600.0 million at 4.000% due January 30, 2024 and $400.0 million at 5.375% due November 30, 2043. Of the total net proceeds, $699.4 million was used to repay the amount outstanding on the credit facility with the remaining to be used for general corporate purposes. During 2013, we repurchased 13.9 million common shares in open market transactions utilizing $470.5 million in cash under the company's board-approved open market share repurchase program. Additionally, the company amended its $1.25 billion unsecured credit facility to extend the maturity to 2018. 2012: In April of 2012 the company repaid the $215.1 million 5.625% senior notes utilizing borrowing from the company's credit facility and existing cash on hand. In November, the company issued an initial aggregate principal amount of $600.0 million of 3.125% senior notes due in November 2022. The net proceeds from the issuance were used to repay the $333.5 million 5.375% note due February 2013 and $197.1 million 5.375% note due December of 2014. In December, the company exercised the make-whole call option of these two notes paying a premium of $23.0 million to retire the debt early. The remaining proceeds from the issuance were used for general corporate purposes. During 2012, we repurchased 11.1 million common shares in open market transactions utilizing $265.0 million in cash under the company's board approved open market share repurchase program. 2011: During 2011, the company repurchased 18.8 million common shares for $436.5 million under the company's board-approved open market share repurchase program. Our capital management priorities have evolved with the growth and success of our business and include: reinvestment in the business; moderate annual growth of dividends (as further discussed in the "Dividends" section below); share repurchase; and establishment of an approximate $1 billion cash buffer in excess of regulatory requirements. These priorities are executed in a manner consistent with our desire to maintain a strong, investment-grade credit rating. As of the date of this Report, Invesco held credit ratings of A-/Positive and A3/Stable from Standard & Poor's Ratings Services ("S&P") and Moody's respectively. Furthermore, S&P considers our risk management to be strong. S&P rates companies' enterprise risk 61 Table of Contents management capabilities on a scale of Fair, Adequate, Strong, and Excellent. Our ability to continue to access the capital markets in a timely manner depends on a number of factors, including our credit ratings, the condition of the global economy, investors willingness to purchase our securities, interest rates, credit spreads and the valuation levels of equity markets. If we are unable to access capital markets in a timely manner, our business could be adversely impacted. See also Item 1A - "Risk Factors," for more detailed discussion on reliance on credit ratings. Certain of our subsidiaries are required to maintain minimum levels of capital. These and other similar provisions of applicable law may have the effect of limiting withdrawals of capital, repayment of intercompany loans and payment of dividends by such entities. A sub-group of Invesco subsidiaries, including all of our regulated EU subsidiaries, is subject to consolidated capital requirements under applicable European Union (EU) directives, and capital is maintained within this sub-group to satisfy these regulations. These requirements mandate the retention of liquid resources in those jurisdictions, which we meet in part by holding cash and cash equivalents. This retained cash can be used for general business purposes in the European sub-group or in the countries where it is located. Due to the capital restrictions, the ability to transfer cash between certain jurisdictions may be limited. In addition, transfers of cash between international jurisdictions may have adverse tax consequences. At December 31, 2013 , the European sub-group had cash and cash equivalent balances of $632.3 million ( December 31, 2012 : $528.3 million ). We are in compliance with all regulatory minimum net capital requirements. As of December 31, 2013 , the company's minimum regulatory capital requirement was $282 million . The total amount of non-U.S. cash and cash equivalents was $740.5 million at December 31, 2013 ( December 31, 2012 : $662.9 million ). In addition, the company is required to hold cash deposits with clearing organizations or to otherwise segregate cash to maintain compliance with federal and other regulations in connection with its UIT broker dealer entity. At December 31, 2013 , these cash deposits totaled $11.3 million ( December 31, 2012 : $11.3 million ). The consolidation of $4.8 billion and $4.3 billion of total assets and long-term debt of certain CLO products as of December 31, 2013 , respectively, did not impact the company liquidity and capital resources. The collateral assets of the CLOs are held solely to satisfy the obligations of the CLOs. The company has no right to the benefits from, nor does it bear the risks associated with, the collateral assets held by the CLOs, beyond the company minimal direct investments in, and management fees generated from, these products, which are eliminated upon consolidation. If the company were to liquidate, the collateral assets would not be available to the general creditors of the company, and as a result, the company does not consider them to be company assets. Likewise, if the CLOs were to liquidate, their investors would have no recourse to the general credit of the company. The company therefore does not consider this debt to be an obligation of the company.

Selected balance sheet information is reflected in the table below: Excluding CIP (Non-GAAP) (1) Including CIP (U.S. GAAP) $ in millions December 31, 2013 December 31, 2012 December 31, 2011 December 31, 2013 December 31, 2012 December 31, 2011 Cash and cash equivalents 1,331.2 835.5 727.4 1,331.2 835.5 727.4 Investments of CIP 4,734.7 4,550.6 6,629.0 Total assets (1) 13,952.6 12,640.9 12,329.2 19,270.5 17,492.4 19,347.0 Long-term debt 1,588.6 1,186.0 1,284.7 1,588.6 1,186.0 1,284.7 Long-term debt of CIP 4,181.7 3,899.4 5,512.9 Long-term debt / Long-term debt plus CIP debt 1,588.6 1,186.0 1,284.7 5,770.3 5,085.4 6,797.6 Total liabilities (1) 5,649.7 4,448.6 4,541.0 10,293.2 8,443.4 10,209.4 Total equity (1) 8,302.9 8,192.3 7,788.2 8,977.3 9,049.0 9,137.6 Debt/Equity % (1,2) 19.1 % 14.5 % 16.5 % 64.3 % 56.2 % 74.4 % ____________ (1) The balance sheet line items excluding CIP are non-GAAP financial measures. To calculate total assets excluding CIP at December 31, 2013 , use U.S. GAAP total assets of $19,270.5 million ( 2012 : $17,492.4 million ; 2011 : $19,347.0 million ) and subtract total assets of CIP of $5,317.9 million ( 2012 : $4,851.5 million ; 2011 : $7,017.8 million ). To calculate total liabilities excluding CIP at December 31, 2013 , use U.S. GAAP total liabilities of $10,293.2 million ( 2012 : $8,443.4 million ; 2011 : 62 Table of Contents $10,209.4 million ) and subtract total liabilities of CIP of $4,643.5 million ( 2012 : $3,994.8 million ; 2011 : $5,668.4 million ). To calculate total equity excluding CIP at December 31, 2013 , use U.S. GAAP total equity of $8,977.3 million ( 2012 : $9,049.0 million ; 2011 : $9,137.6 million ) and subtract total equity of CIP of $674.4 million ( 2012 : $856.7 million ; 2011 : $1,349.4 million ). See the "Balance Sheet Discussion" section for a fully expanded balance sheet illustrating the impact of consolidation of investment products for 2013 and 2012 . (2) The debt-to-equity ratio excluding CIP is a non-GAAP financial measure. The debt-to-equity ratio is calculated as long-term debt divided by total equity for the balance sheet excluding CIP and long-term debt plus long-term debt of CIP divided by equity for the balance sheet including CIP. Management believes that it is important to illustrate for users of our Consolidated Financial Statements that calculating a balance sheet measure, such as the debt-to-equity ratio, including the impact of CIP causes the company to appear far more indebted than is the case. As disclosed above, the debt of CIP is not the company's debt, nor do the noteholders of the CIP debt have any recourse to the company. Cash Flows Discussion The ability to consistently generate free cash flow from operations in excess of dividend payments, share repurchases, capital expenditures, and ongoing operating expenses is one of our company's fundamental financial strengths. Operations continue to be financed from current earnings and borrowings. Our principal uses of cash, other than for operating expenses, include dividend payments, capital expenditures, acquisitions, purchase of our shares in the open market and investments in certain new investment products. Cash flows of CIP (discussed in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 20 , Consolidated Investment Products ) are reflected in Invesco's cash provided by or used in operating activities, investing activities and financing activities. Cash held by CIP is not available for general use by Invesco, nor is Invesco cash available for general use by its CIP. Accordingly, the table below presents the consolidated total cash flows of the company and separately presents the impact to the cash flows from CIP. The impact is illustrated in the tables immediately below by a column which shows the dollar-value change in the consolidated figures, as caused by the consolidation of CIP. For example, the impact of CIP on net income for the year ended December 31, 2013 was an addition of $36.0 million . This indicates that the consolidation of CIP increased consolidated net income by $36.0 million . Also as illustrated in the table below, the sum of the operating, investing and financing cash flows of CIP offsets to a zero impact to the company's change in cash and cash equivalent balances from period to period. The cash flows of CIP do not form part of the company cash flow management processes, nor do they form part of the company significant liquidity evaluations and decisions for the reasons noted. The discussion that follows the table focuses on the company cash flows. 63 Table of Contents Summary of Cash Flow Statement Impact of CIP December 31, 2013 December 31, 2012 December 31, 2011 $ in millions Impact of CIP Invesco Ltd.

Although some receipts and payments are seasonal, particularly bonus payments, in general, after allowing for the change in cash held by CIP, our operating cash flows move in the same direction as our operating income. During 2013 , cash provided by operating activities decreased $39.1 million to $780.2 million from $819.3 million in 2012 . As shown in the tables above, the impact of CIP to cash used in operating activities was $284.1 million of cash used during 2013 compared to $52.8 million of cash used during 2012 . Excluding the impact of CIP, cash generated by operations was $1,064.3 million in 2013 compared to $872.1 million in 2012 , an increase of $192.2 million . The $192.2 million increase in cash provided by operations in 2013 when compared to 2012 is attributable to a higher net income from continuing operations. The increase has been partially offset by the lower realization in 2013 of receivable balances into cash, when compared to 2012. This includes the realization into cash in 2012 of a $45.0 million litigation related receivable recorded in the December 31, 2011 balance sheet. During the year ended December 31, 2012 , cash provided by operations, excluding the impact of CIP, increased by $69.3 million when compared to 2011. Cash provided by operations in 2012 benefited from the realization of receivable balances into cash that were above the level experienced in 2011. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities totaled $239.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 ( 2012 : net cash used $82.4 million ). As shown in the tables above, the impact of CIP on investing activities, including investment purchases, sales and returns of capital, was $32.7 million used ( 2012 : $77.3 million contributed ). Excluding the impact of CIP cash flows, net cash used in investing activities was $207.2 million ( 2012 : net cash used of $159.7 million ). Net cash inflows during the year included net cash proceeds of $137.0 million collected from the sale of Atlantic Trust completed on December 31, 2013. Cash inflows also include collected proceeds of $301.0 million from sales and returns of capital of investments ( 2012 : $184.0 million ). During the year ended December 31, 2013 , the company purchased available-for-sale investments, other investments and CSIP investments of $555.1 million ( 2012 : $224.2 million ). Net investment purchases and sales, increased by $220.1 million to $292.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to $72.2 million in 2012 due to an increase in seed money and CSIP transactions during 2013. During the year ended December 31, 2012 net investments included $16.4 million due to the sale of CLO management contracts. During the year ended December 31, 2013 the company had capital expenditures of $88.2 million ( 2012 : $99.3 million ). Our capital expenditures related principally in each year to technology initiatives, including enhancements to platforms from which we maintain our portfolio management systems and fund accounting systems, improvements in computer hardware and software desktop products for employees, new telecommunications products to enhance our internal information flow, and back-up disaster recovery systems. Also, in each year, a portion of these costs related to leasehold improvements made to the various buildings and workspaces used in our offices. These projects have been funded with proceeds from our operating cash flows. Net cash used in investing activities totaled $82.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 ( 2011 : net cash generated of $348.1 million ). As shown in the tables above, CIP, including investment purchases, sales and returns of capital, contributed $77.3 million ( 2011 : $486.5 million contributed ). Excluding CIP cash flows, net cash used in investing activities was $159.7 million ( 2011 : net cash used of $138.4 million ). Investing activities in 2012 included acquisition related payments totaling $37.2 million as compared to $31.7 million in 2011, The 2012 business acquisition payments related to the final earn-out arrangements from the 2006 acquisitions of W.L. Ross & Co. and Invesco Powershares. Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities totaled $59.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 ( 2012 : $645.9 million ). As shown in the tables above, the impact of CIP on financing activities provided cash of $316.8 million during the year ( 2012 : cash used of $24.5 million ). Excluding the impact of the CIP, financing activities used cash of $376.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2013 ( 2012 : cash used of $621.4 million ). 65 Table of Contents Financing cash outflows during the year ended December 31, 2013 included $379.7 million of dividend payments for the dividends declared in January, April, July and November 2013 ( 2012 : dividends paid of $289.0 million ) and the purchase of treasury shares through market transactions totaling $470.5 million ( 2012 : $265.0 million ). Financing cash inflows during 2013 included net cash proceeds of $981.5 million received upon the completion of the issuance of senior notes with aggregate principal amounts of $600.0 million at 4.000% due January 30, 2024 and $400.0 million at 5.375% due November 30, 2043. The proceeds were used, in part, to repay the outstanding balance of $586.5 million on the credit facility. Other financing cash inflows include cash received from the exercise of options of $17.9 million ( 2012 : $23.0 million ) and excess tax benefits from share-based compensation of $21.6 million ( 2012 : $12.7 million ). Financing cash flows during the year ended December 31, 2012 included the repayment of the $215.1 million 5.625% senior notes utilizing borrowing from the company's credit facility and existing cash on hand. In addition, during 2012, the company issued an initial aggregate principal amount of $600.0 million of 3.125% senior notes due November 2022. The net proceeds from the issuance were used to repay the $333.5 million 5.375% note due February 2013 and $197.1 million 5.375% note due December of 2014. Dividends Invesco declares and pays dividends on a quarterly basis in arrears. The 2013 quarterly dividend was $0.225 per Invesco Ltd. common share. On January 30, 2014 , the company declared a fourth quarter 2013 cash dividend, which will be paid on March 7, 2014 , to shareholders of record as of February 20, 2014 with an ex-dividend date of February 18, 2014 . The total dividend attributable to the 2013 fiscal year of $0.90 per share represented a 30.4% increase over the total dividend attributable to the 2012 fiscal year of $0.69 per share. The declaration, payment and amount of any future dividends will be declared by our board of directors and will depend upon, among other factors, our earnings, financial condition and capital requirements at the time such declaration and payment are considered. The board has a policy of managing dividends in a prudent fashion, with due consideration given to profit levels, overall debt levels, and historical dividend payouts. Share Repurchase Plan On October 11, 2013, the board of directors authorized an additional $1.5 billion for the existing share repurchase program with no stated expiration date. During the year ended December 31, 2013 , the company repurchased 13.9 million shares in the market at a cost of $470.5 million (three months ended December 31, 2013 : 10.1 million shares at a cost of $350.0 million ; year ended December 31, 2012 : 11.1 million shares at a cost of $265.0 million ). Separately, an aggregate of 2.4 million shares were withheld on vesting events during the year ended December 31, 2013 to meet employees' withholding tax obligations ( December 31, 2012 : 2.1 million ). The fair value of these shares withheld at the respective withholding dates was $64.9 million ( December 31, 2012 : $48.9 million ). Approximately $1,496.5 million remained authorized under the company's share repurchase plan at December 31, 2013 ( December 31, 2012 : $467.0 million ). Long-term debt Our long-term debt at December 31, 2013 was $ 1,588.6 million ( December 31, 2012 : $ 1,186.0 million ) and was comprised of the following: $ in millions December 31, 2013 December 31, 2012 Floating rate credit facility expiring December 17, 2018 586.5 Unsecured Senior Notes*: $600 million 3.125% - due November 30, 2022 599.6 599.5 $600 million 4.000% - due January 30, 2024 595.8 $400 million 5.375% - due November 30, 2043 393.2 Long-term debt 1,588.6 1,186.0 66 Table of Contents For the year ended December 31, 2013 , the company's weighted average cost of debt was 2.49% (year ended December 31, 2012 : 3.16% ).

Of the total net proceeds, $699.4 million was used to repay the amount outstanding on the credit facility with the remaining to be used for general corporate purposes. During the second quarter of 2012, the company redeemed the $215.1 million principal amount of 5.625% senior notes due April 17, 2012. During the fourth quarter of 2012, the company issued an initial aggregate principal amount of $600.0 million of 3.125% senior notes with a maturity of November 30, 2022. The proceeds from the debt were used to redeem the $333.5 million principal amount of 5.375% senior notes due February 27, 2013 and the $197.1 million principal amount of the 5.375% senior notes due December 15, 2014. On December 17, 2013, the company amended and restated its unsecured $1.25 billion credit agreement to, among other matters, provide for a term of five years. The amended and restated facility is now scheduled to expire on December 17, 2018. Financial covenants under the credit agreement include: (i) the quarterly maintenance of a debt/EBITDA leverage ratio, as defined in the credit agreement, of not greater than 3.25:1.00, (ii) a coverage ratio (EBITDA, as defined in the credit agreement/interest payable for the four consecutive fiscal quarters ended before the date of determination) of not less than 4.00:1.00. As of December 31, 2013 , we were in compliance with our financial covenants. At December 31, 2013 , our leverage ratio was 1.05 :1.00 ( December 31, 2012 : 0.99:1.00), and our interest coverage ratio was 35.49 :1.00 ( December 31, 2012 : 23.61:1.00). The coverage ratios, as defined in our credit facility, were as follows during 2013 and 2012 : 2013 2012 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Leverage Ratio 1.22 1.11 1.02 1.05 1.03 1.08 1.04 0.99 Interest Coverage Ratio 26.29 29.44 33.16 35.49 22.06 22.61 23.86 23.61 The December 31, 2013 , coverage ratio calculations are as follows: 2013 $ millions Total Q4 Q3 Q2 Q1 Net income attributable to common shareholders 940.3 287.4 228.1 202.6 222.2 Net income/(loss) attributable to common shareholders arising from CIP 8.7 (1.1 ) 9.4 3.5 (3.1 ) Tax expense 373.3 111.7 92.1 80.9 88.6 Amortization/depreciation/impairment 100.1 34.1 21.8 21.9 22.3 Interest expense 44.6 15.2 9.7 10.0 9.7 Share-based compensation expense 133.1 30.1 33.6 35.9 33.5 Unrealized gains and losses from investments, net * (17.4 ) (3.7 ) (3.7 ) 1.4 (11.4 ) EBITDA ** 1,582.7 473.7 391.0 356.2 361.8 Adjusted debt ** $1,655.2 Leverage ratio (Debt/EBITDA - maximum 3.25:1.00) 1.05 Interest coverage (EBITDA/Interest Expense - minimum 4.00:1.00) 35.49 ____________ * Adjustments for unrealized gains and losses from investments, as defined in our credit facility, may also include non-cash gains and losses on investments to the extent that they do not represent anticipated future cash receipts or expenditures. ** EBITDA and Adjusted debt are non-GAAP financial measures; however management does not use these measures for anything other than these debt covenant calculations. The calculation of EBITDA above (a reconciliation from net income attributable to common shareholders) is defined by our credit agreement, and therefore net income attributable to common shareholders is the most appropriate GAAP measure from which to reconcile to EBITDA. The calculation of Adjusted debt is defined in our credit facility and equals total debt of $1,588.6 million plus $30.9 million in letters of credit and a $35.7 million bank overdraft on an unsettled fund account, which was settled in January 2014. 67 Table of Contents The discussion that follows identifies risks associated with the company's liquidity and capital resources. The Executive Overview of this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section contains a broader discussion of the company's overall approach to risk management. Credit and Liquidity Risk Capital management involves the management of the company's liquidity and cash flows. The company manages its capital by reviewing annual and projected cash flow forecasts and by monitoring credit, liquidity and market risks, such as interest rate and foreign currency risks (as discussed in Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk ), through measurement and analysis. The company is primarily exposed to credit risk through its cash and cash equivalent deposits, which are held by external firms. The company invests its cash balances in its own institutional money market products, as well as with external high credit-quality financial institutions. These arrangements create exposure to concentrations of credit risk. Credit Risk Credit risk is the risk that one party to a financial instrument will cause a financial loss for the other party by failing to discharge an obligation. The company is subject to credit risk in the following areas of its business: All cash and cash equivalent balances are subject to credit risk, as they represent deposits made by the company with external banks and other institutions. As of December 31, 2013 , our maximum exposure to credit risk related to our cash and cash equivalent balances is $1,331.2 million . See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 21 , Related Parties, for information regarding cash and cash equivalents invested in affiliated money market funds. Certain subsidiaries of the company accept deposits and place deposits with other institutions on behalf of our customers. As of December 31, 2013 , our exposure to credit risk related to these transactions is $2.9 million . The company does not utilize credit derivatives or similar instruments to mitigate the maximum exposure to credit risk. The company does not expect any counterparties to its financial instruments to fail to meet their obligations. Liquidity Risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the company will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with its financial liabilities. The company is exposed to liquidity risk through its $1,588.6 million in total debt. The company actively manages liquidity risk by preparing cash flow forecasts for future periods, reviewing them regularly with senior management, maintaining a committed credit facility, scheduling significant gaps between major debt maturities and engaging external financing sources in regular dialog. Effects of Inflation Inflation can impact our organization primarily in two ways. First, inflationary pressures can result in increases in our cost structure, especially to the extent that large expense components such as compensation are impacted. To the degree that these expense increases are not recoverable or cannot be counterbalanced through pricing increases due to the competitive environment, our profitability could be negatively impacted. Secondly, the value of the assets that we manage may be negatively impacted when inflationary expectations result in a rising interest rate environment. Declines in the values of these AUM could lead to reduced revenues as management fees are generally calculated based upon the size of AUM. Off Balance Sheet Commitments See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 18 , Commitments and Contingencies - Off Balance Sheet Commitments, for more information regarding undrawn capital commitments and support agreements. 68 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations We have various financial obligations that require future cash payments. The following table outlines the timing of payment requirements related to our commitments as of December 31, 2013 : $ in millions Total (4,5,6) Within 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More Than 5 Years Long-term debt (1) 1,588.6 1,588.6 Estimated interest payments on long-term debt (1) 1,063.8 64.3 128.5 128.5 742.5 Operating leases (2) 524.5 65.2 129.3 98.7 231.3 Purchase obligations (3) 186.5 81.8 35.2 22.7 46.8 Total 3,363.4 211.3 293.0 249.9 2,609.2 ____________ (1) Long-term debt includes $1,588.6 million of fixed rate debt. Fixed interest payments are reflected in the table above in the periods they are due, and include any issuance discounts. The table above includes the company's debt; debt of CIP is excluded from the table above, as the company is not obligated for these amounts. See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 20 , Consolidated Investment Products," for additional information. (2) Operating leases reflect obligations for leased building space and other assets. See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 13 , Operating Leases for sublease information. (3) In the ordinary course of business, Invesco enters into contracts or purchase obligations with third parties whereby the third parties provide services to or on behalf of Invesco. Purchase obligations included in the contractual obligations table above represent fixed-price contracts, which are either non-cancelable or cancelable with a penalty. At December 31, 2013 , the company's obligations primarily reflect standard service contracts for portfolio, market data, office-related services and third-party marketing and promotional services. In addition, the company is a party to certain variable-price contractual arrangements (e.g. contingent future payments based on AUM levels, number of accounts, transaction volume, etc.) for which the company is reimbursed by affiliated funds and as such are not included in the table above. Purchase obligations are recorded as liabilities in the company's Consolidated Financial Statements when services are provided. (4) The company has capital commitments into co-invested funds that are to be drawn down over the life of the partnership as investment opportunities are identified. At December 31, 2013 , the company's undrawn capital and purchase commitments were $152.5 million . These are not included in the above table. See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 18 , Commitments and Contingencies for additional details. (5) Due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2013 , the company is unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities. Therefore, $16.8 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 15 - Taxation for a discussion regarding income taxes. (6) In addition to the contractual obligations in the table above, we periodically make contributions to defined benefit pension and postretirement medical plans. For the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 we contributed $15.3 million and $13.0 million , respectively, to these plans. In 2014, we expect to contribute $15.9 million to our defined benefit pension plans and $2.2 million to our postretirement medical plan. See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 12 , Retirement Benefit Plans for detailed benefit pension and postretirement plan information. The company has various other compensation and benefit obligations, including bonuses, commissions and incentive payments payable, defined contribution plan matching contribution obligations, and deferred compensation arrangements, that are excluded from the table above. 69 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our significant accounting policies are disclosed in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1 , Accounting Policies." The accounting policies and estimates that we believe are the most critical to an understanding of our results of operations and financial condition are those that require complex management judgment regarding matters that are highly uncertain at the time policies were applied and estimates were made. These accounting policies and estimates are discussed below; however, the additional accounting policy detail in the footnote previously referenced is important to the discussion of each of the topics. Different estimates reasonably could have been used in the current period that would have had a material effect on these Consolidated Financial Statements, and changes in these estimates are likely to occur from period-to-period in the future. Taxation We operate in several countries and several states and other taxing jurisdictions through our various subsidiaries, and must allocate our income, expenses, and earnings under the various laws and regulations of each of these taxing jurisdictions. Accordingly, our provision for income taxes represents our total estimate of the liability that we have incurred for doing business each year in all of our locations. Annually we file tax returns that represent our filing positions within each jurisdiction and settle our return liabilities. Each jurisdiction has the right to audit those returns and may take different positions with respect to income and expense allocations and taxable earnings determinations. Because the determinations of our annual provisions are subject to judgments and estimates, it is possible that actual results will vary from those recognized in our Consolidated Financial Statements. As a result, it is likely that additions to, or reductions of, income tax expense will occur each year for prior reporting periods as actual tax returns and tax audits are settled. Deferred tax assets, net of any associated valuation allowance, have been recognized based on management's belief that taxable income of the appropriate character, more likely than not, will be sufficient to realize the benefits of these assets over time. In the event that actual results differ from our expectations, or if our historical trends of positive operating income changes, we may be required to record a valuation allowance on some or all of these deferred tax assets, which may have a significant effect on our financial condition and results of operations. The company utilizes a specific recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the Consolidated Financial Statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The prescribed two-step process for evaluating a tax position involves first determining whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing authorities. If it is, the second step then requires a company to measure this tax position benefit as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The company recognizes any interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits on the Consolidated Statements of Income as components of income tax expense. Goodwill Our goodwill impairment testing conducted during 2013 and 2012 indicated that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value, indicating that step two of the goodwill impairment test was not necessary; however, the company cannot predict the occurrence of future events that might adversely affect the reported value of goodwill that totaled $6,867.3 million and $7,048.2 million at December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012 , respectively. Such events include, but are not limited to, strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions, the impact of the economic environment on the company's AUM, or any other material negative change in AUM and related management fees. The October 1, 2013 annual goodwill impairment test was performed using a consistent methodology to that used for the 2012 annual impairment test, with assumptions updated for current market conditions, including the company's updated forecasts for changes in AUM due to market gains and long-term net flows and the corresponding changes in revenue and expenses. Market gains are based upon historical returns of the S&P 500 index, treasury bond returns and treasury bill returns, as applicable to the company's AUM mix on the testing date. The most sensitive of these assumptions are the estimated cash flows and the use of a weighted average cost of capital as the discount rate to determine present value. The most significant changes in assumptions from 2012 related to a decrease in the equity risk premium and an increase in the risk free rate (30-year Treasury rate), which resulted in a discount rate of 13.6% for the October 1, 2013 analysis (2012: 14.4%). The discount rates used are estimates of the weighted average cost of capital for the investment management sector reflecting the overall industry risks associated with future cash flows and have been calculated consistently across the various tests dates. While the company believes all assumptions utilized in our assessment are reasonable and appropriate, changes in these estimates could produce different fair value amounts and therefore different goodwill impairment assessments. 70 Table of Contents Intangible Assets Where evidence exists that the underlying arrangements have a high likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost to the company, the intangible asset is assigned an indefinite life and reviewed for impairment on an annual basis. Definite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable (i.e. the carrying amount exceeds the sum of the fair value of the intangible). In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period over which definite-lived intangible assets will contribute to the company's cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets, or the reclassification of an indefinite-lived intangible asset to a definite-lived intangible asset, could have a significant impact on the company's amortization expense from continuing operations, which was $15.4 million , $25.5 million and $35.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , respectively. Intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested for impairment annually as of October 1 or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. The impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of an intangible asset with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. Fair value is generally determined using an income approach where estimated future cash flows are discounted to arrive at a single present value amount. The income approach includes inputs that require significant management judgment, including AUM growth rates, product mix, effective fee rates, pre-tax profit margins, effective tax rates and discount rates. The most relevant of these assumptions to the determination of the estimated fair value are the AUM growth rate and discount rate. Changes in these estimates could produce different fair value amounts and therefore different impairment conclusions. In 2013 and 2012 , annual impairment reviews of indefinite-lived intangible assets determined that no impairment existed at the respective review dates, the classifications of indefinite-lived and definite-lived remain appropriate, and no changes to the expected lives of the definite-lived intangible assets were required. Investments Most of our investments are carried at fair value on our balance sheet with the periodic mark-to-market recorded either in accumulated other comprehensive income in the case of available-for-sale investments, or directly to earnings, in the case of trading assets. Since assumptions are made in determining the fair values of investments for which active markets do not exist, the actual value that may be realized upon the sale or other disposition of these investments could differ from the current carrying values. Fair value calculations are also required in association with our quarterly impairment testing of investments. The accuracy of our other-than-temporary impairment assessments is dependent upon the extent to which we are able to accurately determine fair values. Of our $839.7 million in total investments at December 31, 2013 , those most susceptible to impairment include $233.8 million of seed money investments in our affiliated funds. Seed money investments are held in Invesco managed funds with the purpose of providing capital to the funds during their development periods. These investments are recorded at fair value using quoted market prices in active markets; there is no modeling or additional information needed to arrive at the fair values of these investments. The value of investments may decline for various reasons. The market price may be affected by general market conditions which reflect prospects for the economy as a whole or by specific information pertaining to an industry or individual company. Such declines require further investigation by management, which considers all available evidence to evaluate the realizable value of the investment, including, but not limited to, the following factors: The probability that the company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of a debt security not impaired at acquisition; The length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than cost; The financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, including any specific events which may influence the operations of the issuer; The intent and ability of the company to retain its investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value; The decline in the security's value due to an increase in market interest rates or a change in foreign exchange rates since acquisition; Determination that the security is not realizable; or An adverse change in estimated cash flows of a beneficial interest. Our other-than-temporary impairment analysis of seed money holdings includes a review of the market returns required for each fund portfolio to enable us to recover our original investment. As part of the review, we analyze several scenarios to project the anticipated recovery period of our original investments based on one-, three-, and five-year historical index returns and historical trends in the equity markets. We also analyze the absolute amount of any loss to date, the trend of the losses, and percent declines 71 Table of Contents in values of the seed money investments. Along with intent and ability to hold, all of these scenarios are considered as part of our other-than-temporary impairment analysis of seed money holdings. CIP Assessing if an entity is a variable interest entity (VIE) or voting interest entity (VOE) involves judgment and analysis on a structure-by-structure basis. Factors included in this assessment include the legal organization of the entity, the company's contractual involvement with the entity and any related party or de facto agent implications of the company's involvement with the entity. Generally, limited partnership entities where the general partner does not have substantive equity investment at risk and where the other limited partners do not have substantive (greater than 50%) rights to remove the general partner or to dissolve the limited partnership are VIEs. Determining if the company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE also requires significant judgment, as the calculation of expected losses and residual returns (for investment products other than CLOs) involves estimation and probability assumptions. For CLOs, there is judgment involved to assess if the company has the power to direct the activities that most significantly affect the CLOs economic results and to assess if the company's interests could be deemed significant. If current financial statements are not available for consolidated VIEs or VOEs, estimation of investment valuation is required, which includes assessing available quantitative and qualitative data. Significant changes in these estimates could impact the reported value of the investments held by CIP and the related offsetting equity attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and the other gains and losses of CIP, net, and related offsetting gains and losses attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities, net, amounts on the Consolidated Statements of Income. As of December 31, 2013 , the company consolidated VIEs that held investments of $4,277.7 million ( December 31, 2012 : $3,983.9 million ) and VOE fund investments of $512.2 million ( December 31, 2012 : $607.9 million). As circumstances supporting estimates and factors change, the determination of VIE and primary beneficiary status may change, as could the determination of the necessity of consolidation of VOEs. Estimation is involved when determining investment and debt valuation for certain CIP; however, changes in the fair values of these amounts are largely offset by noncontrolling interests. Contingencies Contingencies arise when we have a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event that is both probable and reasonably estimable. We must from time to time make material estimates with respect to legal and other contingencies. The nature of our business requires compliance with various laws and regulations, as well as various contractual obligations, and exposes us to a variety of legal proceedings and matters in the ordinary course of business. While the outcomes of matters such as these are inherently uncertain and difficult to predict, we maintain reserves reflected in accounts payable and accrued expenses, as appropriate, for identified losses that are, in our judgment, probable and reasonably estimable. We expense any related legal fees as they are incurred. Management's judgment is based on the advice of legal counsel, ruling on various motions by the applicable court, review of the outcome of similar matters, if applicable, and review of guidance from governmental and other regulatory authorities, if applicable. Contingent consideration payable in relation to a business acquisition is recorded as of the acquisition date as part of the fair value transferred in exchange for the acquired business.
