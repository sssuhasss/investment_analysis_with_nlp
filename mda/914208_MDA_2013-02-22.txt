Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Executive Overview The following executive overview summarizes the significant trends affecting our results of operations and financial condition for the periods presented. This overview and the remainder of this management's discussion and analysis supplements, and should be read in conjunction with, the Consolidated Financial Statements of Invesco Ltd. and its subsidiaries (collectively, the company or Invesco ) and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. During 2012 global equity markets produced strong positive returns as evidenced by the returns of the S&P 500 index, which was up over 13%, the Nikkei 225 index, which increased almost 23% in the year and the MSCI Emerging Market index which gained over 15% in 2012. The markets recovered from the significant volatility and negative sentiment experienced during 2011 as fears over the solvency of peripheral European sovereigns and the fiscal situation in the U.S. subsided. The table below summarizes the year ended December 31 returns based on price appreciation of several major market indices for 2012 , 2011 , and 2010 : Year ended December 31, Index 2012 2011 2010 S&P 500 13.4% 0.0% 12.8% FTSE 100 5.8% (5.6)% 9.0% Nikkei 225 22.9% (17.3)% (3.0%) MSCI Emerging Markets 15.2% (20.4)% 16.4% Throughout 2012, Invesco continued to deliver strong, long-term investment performance, maintained its focus on its clients, and enhanced its profile in the industry. As a global investment management firm dedicated to delivering investment excellence to our clients, Invesco is committed to further strengthening and enhancing our best-in-class risk management approach. A key factor in Invesco's ability to weather the economic storms of the past three years was our integrated approach to risk management. Invesco's enterprise risk management (ERM) approach is embedded in its management processes across the organization. Broadly, our approach includes two governance structures - one for investments and another for business risk. Investment risk oversight is supported by the Global Performance Measurement and Risk group and the investment teams. Business risk oversight is supported by the Corporate Risk Management Committee and related committees. Our Global Performance Measurement and Risk group provides senior management and the Board with insight into core investment risks, while our Corporate Risk Management Committee facilitates a focus on strategic, operational and other key business risks. Further, business component, functional, and geographic risk management committees maintain an ongoing risk assessment process that provides a bottom-up perspective on the specific risk areas existing in various domains of our business. A key value of a robust enterprise risk management process is facilitating the flow of information and insight across the organization and applying that information to more effectively managing risk. Through this regular and consistent risk communication, the Board has reasonable assurance that all material risks of the company are being addressed and that the company is propagating a risk-aware culture in which effective risk management is sewn into the fabric of the business. As a result of our efforts in this area, S&P has designated our enterprise risk management rating as "strong." In addition, we benefited from our long-term efforts to ensure a diversified base of assets under management. One of Invesco's core strengths, and a key differentiator for the company within the industry, is our broad diversification across client domiciles, asset classes and distribution channels. Our geographical diversification recognizes growth opportunities in different parts of the world. This broad diversification enables Invesco to withstand different market cycles and take advantage of growth opportunities in various markets and channels. 23 Table of Contents Presentation of Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The company provides investment management services to, and has transactions with, various private equity, real estate, fund-of-funds, collateralized loan obligation products (CLOs), and other investment entities sponsored by the company for the investment of client assets in the normal course of business. The company serves as the investment manager, making day-to-day investment decisions concerning the assets of the products. Certain of these entities are consolidated under variable interest or voting interest entity consolidation guidance. See Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1, Accounting Policies and Note 20 , Consolidated Investment Products, for additional details. The majority of the company's consolidated investment product balances are CLO-related. The collateral assets of the CLOs are held solely to satisfy the obligations of the CLOs. The company has no right to the benefits from, nor does it bear the risks associated with, the collateral assets held by the CLOs, beyond the company's minimal direct investments in, and management and performance fees generated from, the CLOs. If the company were to liquidate, the collateral assets would not be available to the general creditors of the company, and as a result, the company does not consider them to be company assets. Additionally, the investors in the CLOs have no recourse to the general credit of the company for the notes issued by the CLOs. The company therefore does not consider this debt to be a company liability. The impact of consolidation of investment products is so significant to the presentation of the company financial statements (but not to the underlying financial condition or results of operations of the company) that the company has elected to deconsolidate these products in its non-GAAP disclosures. The following discussion therefore combines the results presented under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) with the company non-GAAP presentation. There are four distinct sections within this Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations after the Assets Under Management discussion: Results of Operations (years ended December 31, 2012 compared to December 31, 2011 compared to December 31, 2010 ); Schedule of Non-GAAP Information; Balance Sheet Discussion; and Liquidity and Capital Resources. Each of the financial statement summary sections (Results of Operations, Balance Sheet Discussion, and Liquidity and Capital Resources) begins with a table illustrating the impact of the consolidation of investment products relative to the company's consolidated totals. The impact is illustrated by a column which shows the dollar-value change in the consolidated figures, as caused by the consolidation of investment products. For example, the impact of consolidated investment products on operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2012 was $ (41.0) million . This indicates that the consolidation of investment products reduced consolidated revenues by this amount, reflecting the elimination upon their consolidation of the operating revenues earned by Invesco for managing these investment products. The narrative that follows each of these sections separately provides discussion of the underlying financial statement activity for the company, before consolidation of investment products, as well as of the financial statement activity of consolidated investment products. Additionally, wherever a non-GAAP measure is referenced, a disclosure will follow in the narrative or in the note referring the reader to the Schedule of Non-GAAP Information, where additional details regarding the use of the non-GAAP measure by the company are disclosed, along with reconciliations of the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures to the non-GAAP measures. To further enhance the readability of the Results of Operations section, separate tables for each of the revenue, expense, and non-operating income/expense sections of the income statement introduce the narrative that follows, providing a section-by-section review of the company income statements for the periods presented. 24 Table of Contents Summary Operating Information Summary operating information for 2012 , 2011 and 2010 is presented in the table below. $ in millions, other than per share amounts, percentages and AUM Year ended December 31, U.S. GAAP Financial Measures Summary 2012 2011 2010 Operating revenues $4,177.0 $4,092.2 $3,487.7 Operating income $871.5 $898.1 $589.9 Operating margin 20.9 % 21.9 % 16.9 % Net income attributable to common shareholders $677.1 $729.7 $465.7 Diluted EPS $1.49 $1.57 $1.01 Debt/equity ratio including consolidated investment products (%) 56.2 % 74.4 % 76.7 % Non-GAAP Financial Measures Summary Net revenues (1) $2,959.0 $2,898.4 $2,521.1 Adjusted operating income (2) $1,045.1 $1,068.9 $897.7 Adjusted operating margin (2) 35.3 % 36.9 % 35.6 % Adjusted net income attributable to common shareholders (3) $776.7 $781.6 $639.7 Adjusted diluted EPS (3) $1.71 $1.68 $1.38 Debt/equity ratio excluding consolidated investment products(%) (4) 14.5 % 16.5 % 16.9 % Assets Under Management Ending AUM (billions) $687.7 $625.3 $616.5 Average AUM (billions) $664.4 $634.3 $532.3 _________ (1) Net revenues is a non-GAAP financial measure.

Long-term performance in our equities capabilities, as measured by the percentage of AUM ahead of benchmark and ahead of peer median, is generally strong with some pockets of outstanding performance. Within our equity asset class, U.K. and Global Ex U.S. and Emerging Markets have had strong relative performance, with 87% or more of assets beating their peer group and benchmark over three- and five-year periods. U.S. Value funds reflect strong performance with 99% and 94%, respectively, of assets beating benchmarks and peers on a five-year basis. Within our fixed income asset class, Stable Value products have achieved excellent long-term performance with 100% of AUM ahead of benchmarks and peers on a one-, three-, and five-year basis.

Peer group rankings are sourced from a widely-used third party ranking agency in each fund's market (Lipper, Morningstar, IMA, Russell, Mercer, eVestment Alliance, SITCA) and asset-weighted in USD. Rankings are as of prior quarter-end for most institutional products and preceding month-end for Australian retail funds due to their late release by third parties. Rankings for the most representative fund in each GIPS composite are applied to all products within each GIPS composite. Excludes passive products, closed-end funds, private equity limited partnerships, non-discretionary direct real estate, unit investment trusts fund-of-funds with component funds managed by Invesco, stable value building block funds and CLOs. Certain funds and products were excluded from the analysis because of limited benchmark or peer group data. Had these been available, results may have been different. These results are preliminary and subject to revision. Performance assumes the reinvestment of dividends. Past performance is not indicative of future results and may not reflect an investor's experience. 26 Table of Contents Assets Under Management The company's rolling presentation of AUM from period to period (on the following pages) illustrates long-term inflows and outflows separately from the net flows into institutional money market funds. Long-term inflows and the underlying reasons for the movements in this line item include investments from new clients, existing clients adding new accounts/funds or contributions/subscriptions into existing accounts/funds, and new funding commitments into private equity funds. We present net flows into institutional money market funds separately because shareholders of those funds typically use them as short-term funding vehicles and because their flows are particularly sensitive to short-term interest rate movements. The discussion below includes presentation of AUM as Passive and Active. Passive AUM includes ETFs, UITs, non-fee earning leverage, foreign exchange overlays and other passive mandates. Active AUM is total AUM less Passive AUM. There are numerous drivers of AUM inflows and outflows, including individual investor decisions to change investment preferences, fiduciaries making broad asset allocation decisions on behalf of advised clients and reallocation of investments within portfolios. We are not a party to these asset allocation decisions, as the company does not generally have access to the underlying investor's decision-making process, including their risk appetite or liquidity needs. Therefore, the company is not in a position to provide meaningful information regarding the drivers of inflows and outflows. AUM at December 31, 2012 were $687.7 billion ( December 31, 2011 : $625.3 billion ; December 31, 2010 : $616.5 billion ). During the year ended December 31, 2012 , net long-term inflows increased AUM by $12.4 billion , while positive market movements increased AUM by $48.8 billion . We experienced net inflows in institutional money market funds of $0.1 billion , increases in AUM of $2.8 billion due to changes in foreign exchange rates, and net outflows from dispositions of $ 1.7 billion during the year ended December 31, 2012 . During the year ended December 31, 2011 , net inflows increased AUM by $19.2 billion and negative market movements decreased AUM by $15.3 billion. We experienced net inflows in institutional money market funds of $5.3 billion, offset by decreases in AUM of $0.4 billion due to changes in foreign exchange rates during the year ended December 31, 2011 . During the year ended December 31, 2010 , net inflows increased AUM by $5.5 billion and positive market movements increased AUM by $43.9 billion. We experienced net outflows in institutional money market funds of $15.5 billion and increases in AUM of $1.6 billion due to changes in foreign exchange rates during the year ended December 31, 2010 . Acquisitions added $121.5 billion of AUM in 2010, including $114.6 billion of AUM added at June 1, 2010 with the acquisition of Morgan Stanley's retail asset management business, including Van Kampen Investments (the acquired business or the acquisition ). Average AUM during the year ended December 31, 2012 were $664.4 billion , compared to $634.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2011 and $532.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010 . Net inflows during the year ended December 31, 2012 included net long-term inflows of passive AUM of $11.1 billion and active net long-term inflows of $1.3 billion . Net flows were driven by net inflows into both our retail and institutional distribution channels of $10.4 billion and $0.3 billion , respectively, primarily in the fixed income and balanced asset classes, while our equity asset class experienced net outflows of $9.3 billion. Net inflows during the year ended December 31, 2011 included net long-term inflows of passive AUM of $17.5 billion and active net long-term AUM inflows of $1.7 billion. Net flows in 2011 were driven by positive net inflows of $9.1 billion into our retail and $8.9 billion into institutional distribution channels, primarily in the fixed asset class, while our equity asset class experienced net outflows of $7.9 billion. Market gains and losses/reinvestment of AUM includes the net change in AUM resulting from changes in market values of the underlying investments from period to period and reinvestment of client dividends. As discussed in the Executive Overview section of this Management Discussion and Analysis, global equity markets produced strong returns during the year ended December 31, 2012 , contrasting with overall declines experienced in the year ending December 31, 2011. Of the $ 48.8 billion increase in AUM resulting from market gains during the year ended December 31, 2012 , $33.3 billion of this increase was due to the change in value of our equity asset class. Our fixed income, balanced, and alternatives asset classes were also positively impacted by the change in market valuations during the period. Of the total decrease in AUM resulting from market losses during the year ended December 31, 2011 , $14.8 billion was due to the change in value of our equity asset class, decreasing in line with equity markets globally. Of the $43.9 billion increase in AUM resulting from market increases during the year ended December 31, 2010 , $33.4 billion of this increase was due to the change in value of our equity asset class, in line with increases in the S&P 500 and the FTSE 100 indices of 12.8% and 9.0%, respectively, during that period. Foreign exchange rate movements in our AUM result from the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates from period to period as non-U.S. Dollar denominated AUM is translated into U.S. Dollars, the reporting currency of the company. The impact of the change in foreign exchange rates in the year ended December 31, 2012 was driven primarily by the strengthening of the Pound Sterling relative to the U.S. Dollar, which was reflected in the translation of our Pound Sterling-based AUM into U.S. Dollars, the strengthening of the Canadian Dollar relative to the U.S. Dollar, which was reflected in the translation of our Canadian Dollar-based AUM into U.S. Dollars, and the strengthening of the Euro relative to the U.S. Dollar, which was reflected in the translation 27 Table of Contents of our Euro-based AUM into U.S. Dollars. This was partly offset by the weakening of the Japanese Yen relative to the U.S. Dollar, which was reflected in the translation of our Yen-based AUM into U.S. Dollars. The impact of the change in foreign exchange rates in the year ended December 31, 2011 was driven primarily by the strengthening of the Japanese Yen relative to the U.S. Dollar, partially offset by the weakening of the Pound Sterling, Canadian Dollar and Euro relative to the U.S. Dollar. The impact of the change in foreign exchange rates at December 31, 2010 was driven by the strengthening of the Canadian Dollar and Japanese Yen relative to the U.S. Dollar, offset by the weakening of the Pound Sterling and the Euro. The table below illustrates the spot foreign exchange rates for translation into the U.S. Dollar, the reporting currency of the company, at December 31, 2012 , 2011 , and 2010 : December 31, 2012 December 31, 2011 December 31, 2010 Pound Sterling ($ per ) 1.625 1.555 1.565 Canadian Dollar (CAD per $) 0.996 1.018 0.994 Japan ( per $) 86.520 76.950 81.080 Euro ($ per Euro) 1.319 1.299 1.342 Net revenue yield on AUM decreased 1.2 basis points to 44.5 basis points in the year ended December 31, 2012 from the year ended December 31, 2011 level of 45.7 basis points. Excluding performance fees, the net revenue yield decreased 1.5 basis points to 43.6 basis points in the year ended December 31, 2012 from the year ended December 31, 2011 level of 45.1 basis points. Changes in our AUM mix significantly impact our net revenue yield. For example, on an asset class basis, our equity AUM generally earn a higher net revenue rate than money market AUM. The tables that follow also analyze AUM into active and passive style. Passive AUM generally earn a lower effective fee rate than active asset classes. At December 31, 2012 , passive AUM were $114.0 billion , representing 16.6% of total AUM at that date; whereas at December 31, 2011 , passive AUM were $96.3 billion, representing 15.4% of our total AUM at that date. In the year ended December 31, 2012 , the net revenue yield on passive AUM was 9.3 basis points compared to 10.8 basis points in the year ended December 31, 2011 , a reduction of 1.5 basis points. The net revenue yield (before performance fees) on active AUM has been more stable, reducing from 50.8 basis points in the year ended December 31, 2011 to 50.4 basis points in the year ended December 31, 2012 . The higher proportion of passive AUM combined with the lower yield earned by passive AUM resulted in the majority of the overall yield reduction experienced in 2012 when compared to 2011. The increase in passive AUM includes the movements in the Powershares QQQ Nasdaq-100 index tracking fund. The Powershares QQQ fund AUM increased to $30.4 billion at December 31, 2012 compared to $25.6 billion at December 31, 2011, an increase in passive AUM of $4.8 billion. The revenue yield for Invesco on this product is less than 1 basis point, reimbursing Invesco for the portfolio trading services provided to the fund, and flows into and out of this product therefore have a significant impact on the overall net revenue yield and are a significant factor in the year-on-year yield reduction. Although net revenue yield reduced on a year-on-year basis, this trend reversed during the second half of 2012 due to improving equity markets as well as net inflows in the balanced asset class, including strong net AUM flows in our Continental European business. The balanced asset class includes the Invesco Balanced Risk Allocation strategy range of products. AUM for this strategy reached $18.7 billion as at December 31, 2012 compared to $5.2 billion at December 31, 2011, an increase of $13.5 billion during the year. These active AUM inflows assisted in stabilizing the active and passive AUM mix and contributed to a net revenue yield before performance fees of 44.4 basis points in the final quarter of 2012 compared to the 43.6 basis points recorded for the year ended December 31, 2012 . Gross revenue yield on AUM decreased 1.7 basis points to 63.2 basis points in the year ended December 31, 2012 from the year ended December 31, 2011 level of 64.9 basis points. Management does not consider gross revenue yield, the most comparable U.S. GAAP-based measure to net revenue yield, to be a meaningful effective fee rate measure. The numerator of the gross revenue yield measure, operating revenues, excludes the management fees earned from consolidated investment products; however, the denominator of the measure includes the AUM of these investment products. Therefore, the gross revenue yield measure is not considered representative of the company's true effective fee rate from AUM. See Schedule of Non-GAAP Information for a reconciliation of operating revenues (gross revenues) to net revenues. 28 Table of Contents Changes in AUM were as follows: $ in billions Total AUM Active Passive Total AUM Active Passive Total AUM Active Passive 2012 2012 2012 2011 2011 2011 2010 2010 2010 January 1 625.3 529.0 96.3 616.5 535.7 80.8 459.5 406.5 53.0 Long-term inflows 164.0 106.6 57.4 177.6 106.3 71.3 154.7 84.6 70.1 Long-term outflows (151.6 ) (105.3 ) (46.3 ) (158.4 ) (104.6 ) (53.8 ) (149.2 ) (83.4 ) (65.8 ) Long-term net flows 12.4 1.3 11.1 19.2 1.7 17.5 5.5 1.2 4.3 Net flows in institutional money market funds 0.1 0.1 5.3 5.3 (15.5 ) (15.5 ) Market gains and losses/reinvestment 48.8 41.8 7.0 (15.3 ) (13.2 ) (2.1 ) 43.9 36.3 7.6 Acquisitions/dispositions, net (1.7 ) (1.7 ) 121.5 107.1 14.4 Foreign currency translation 2.8 3.2 (0.4 ) (0.4 ) (0.5 ) 0.1 1.6 0.1 1.5 December 31 687.7 573.7 114.0 625.3 529.0 96.3 616.5 535.7 80.8 Average long-term AUM 595.4 485.2 110.2 566.0 474.7 91.3 463.5 393.8 69.7 Average institutional money market AUM 69.0 69.0 68.3 68.3 68.8 68.8 Average AUM 664.4 554.2 110.2 634.3 543.0 91.3 532.3 462.6 69.7 Gross revenue yield on AUM (1) 63.2bps 73.9bps 9.3bps 64.9bps 74.0bps 10.8bps 66.0bps 74.3bps 10.8bps Gross revenue yield on AUM before performance fees (1) 62.3bps 72.9bps 9.3bps 64.3bps 73.3bps 10.8bps 65.5bps 73.8bps 10.8bps Net revenue yield on AUM (2) 44.5bps 51.6bps 9.3bps 45.7bps 51.6bps 10.8bps 47.4bps 52.9bps 10.8bps Net revenue yield on AUM before performance fees (2) 43.6bps 50.4bps 9.3bps 45.1bps 50.8bps 10.8bps 46.9bps 52.3bps 10.8bps ____________ (1) Gross revenue yield on AUM is equal to annualized total operating revenues divided by average AUM, excluding joint venture (JV) AUM. Our share of the average AUM in 2012 for our JVs in China was $3.0 billion ( 2011 : $3.3 billion , 2010 : $3.6 billion ). It is appropriate to exclude the average AUM of our JVs for purposes of computing gross revenue yield on AUM, because the revenues resulting from these AUM are not presented in our operating revenues. Under U.S. GAAP, our share of the pre-tax earnings of the JVs is recorded as equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates on our Consolidated Statements of Income. (2) Net revenue yield on AUM is equal to annualized net revenues divided by average AUM.

distribution channel from which the AUM originated. Retail AUM arose from client investments into funds available to the public with shares or units. Institutional AUM originated from individual corporate clients, endowments, foundations, government authorities, universities, or charities. Private Wealth Management AUM arose from high net worth client investments. (2) Asset classes are descriptive groupings of AUM by common type of underlying investments. (3) See Part I, Item 1, Business - Objectives by Asset Class for a description of the investment objectives included within the Alternatives asset class. (4) Ending Money Market AUM includes $69.4 billion in institutional money market AUM and $3.9 billion in retail money market AUM. (5) Client domicile disclosure groups AUM by the domicile of the underlying clients. (6) Net flows in Asia in 2010 were driven by an inflow of $15.8 billion in the three months ended June 30, 2010 and an outflow of $18.6 billion in the three months ended December 31, 2010 related to a passive mandate in Japan which was a post-close direct consequence of the acquired business. 35 Table of Contents Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2012 compared to December 31, 2011 compared to December 31, 2010 The company provides investment management services to, and has transactions with, various private equity, real estate, fund-of-funds, collateralized loan obligation products (CLOs), and other investment entities sponsored by the company for the investment of client assets in the normal course of business. The company serves as the investment manager, making day-to-day investment decisions concerning the assets of the products. Certain of these entities are consolidated under variable interest or voting interest entity consolidation guidance. See Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1, Accounting Policies and Note 20 , Consolidated Investment Products, for additional details. The majority of the company's consolidated investment products balances are CLO-related. The collateral assets of the CLOs are held solely to satisfy the obligations of the CLOs. The company has no right to the benefits from, nor does it bear the risks associated with, the collateral assets held by the CLOs, beyond the company's minimal direct investments in, and management fees generated from, the CLOs. If the company were to liquidate, the collateral assets would not be available to the general creditors of the company, and as a result, the company does not consider them to be company assets. Additionally, the investors in the CLOs have no recourse to the general credit of the company for the notes issued by the CLOs. The company therefore does not consider this debt to be a company liability. To assist in the comparisons, the discussion that follows will separate the impact of consolidated investment products from the overall consolidated results of operations. The discussion includes the use of non-GAAP financial measures. See Schedule of Non-GAAP Information for additional details and reconciliations of the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures to the non-GAAP measures.

The income statements of foreign currency subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars, the reporting currency of the company, using average foreign exchange rates. The impact of foreign exchange rate movements decreased operating revenues by $20.8 million , equivalent to 0.5% of total operating revenues, during the year ended December 31, 2012 when compared to the year ended December 31, 2011 ($74.9 million increase in 2011 as compared to 2010, or 1.8% of 2011 total operating revenues). Additionally, our revenues are directly influenced by the level and composition of our AUM. Therefore, movements in global capital market levels, net new business inflows (or outflows) and changes in the mix of investment products between asset classes and geographies may materially affect our revenues from period to period. The returns from most global capital markets increased in the year ended December 31, 2012 . These market value increases, combined with net new business inflows, contributed to a net increase in AUM of $ 62.4 billion during the year. Operating revenues increased by 2.1% in the year ended December 31, 2012 to $4,177.0 million (year ended December 31, 2011 : $4,092.2 million ). Net revenues increased by 2.1% in in the year ended December 31, 2012 to $2,959.0 million (year ended December 31, 2011 : $2,898.4 million ). Operating revenues increased by 17.3% in the year ended December 31, 2011 to $4,092.2 million (year ended December 31, 2010: $3,487.7 million). Net revenues increased by 15.0% in in the year ended December 31, 2011 to $2,898.4 million (year ended December 31, 2010: $2,521.1 million). Net revenues are operating revenues less third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses (adjusted for third party distribution expense related to the European infrastructure initiative), plus our proportional share of net revenues from joint venture arrangements, plus management and performance fees earned from, less other revenues recorded by, consolidated investment products. See Schedule of Non-GAAP Information for additional important disclosures regarding the use of net revenues. The company acquired Morgan Stanley's retail asset management business, including Van Kampen Investments (the acquired business or the acquisition ) on June 1, 2010. The operating results for the year ended December 31, 2011 include the results of the acquisition for the entire year, while the operating results for the year ended December 31, 2010 include results of the acquired business from the purchase date of June 1, 2010 through December 31, 2010. The integration of the acquired business was largely completed at the end of 2010; as such, accurate segregated revenue and expense information for the acquired business is not available, resulting in the inability of the company to quantify the impact of the acquisition on operating revenues and expenses in the detailed variance discussion that follows. As part of the acquisition-related U.S. mutual fund product alignment, certain 1 year and 2 year fee waivers were agreed between the company and the fund boards which reduced the company annual 37 Table of Contents management fees by approximately $30 million commencing June 1, 2011. These fee waivers began to cease during mid-2012. Investment Management Fees Investment management fees are derived from providing professional services to manage client accounts and include fees earned from retail mutual funds, unit trusts, investment companies with variable capital (ICVCs), exchange-traded funds, investment trusts and institutional and private wealth management advisory contracts. Investment management fees for products offered in the retail distribution channel are generally calculated as a percentage of the daily average asset balances and therefore vary as the levels of AUM change resulting from inflows, outflows and market movements. Investment management fees for products offered in the institutional and private wealth management distribution channels are calculated in accordance with the underlying investment management contracts and also vary over contractually determined periods in relation to the level of client assets managed. Investment management fees increased by $98.4 million ( 3.1% ) in the year ended December 31, 2012 , to $3,236.9 million (year ended December 31, 2011 : $3,138.5 million ). This compares to a 4.7% increase in average AUM and a 5.2% increase in average long-term AUM. As discussed above, the net revenue yield is lower in the year ended December 31, 2012 when compared to the year ended December 31, 2011 due to changes in the composition of our AUM. The weighting of AUM flows into passive products has lowered the overall AUM net revenue yield. In addition, as mentioned above, management fees were reduced commencing in June 2011 due to acquisition integration-related U.S. mutual fund mergers. Some of these fee waiver agreements lapsed in mid-2012 benefiting revenue in the second half of 2012. See the company's disclosures regarding the changes in AUM and revenue yields during the year ended December 31, 2012 in the Assets Under Management section above for additional information regarding the movements in AUM. The impact of foreign exchange rate movements decreased investment management fees by $17.9 million (18.2% of the increase) during the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2011 . Investment management fees increased by $417.6 million (15.3%) in the year ended December 31, 2011, to $3,138.5 million (year ended December 31, 2010: $2,720.9 million). The increase compares to a 19.2% increase in average AUM and a 22.1% increase in average long-term AUM. As discussed above in the Assets Under Management section, the mix of our AUM asset classes changed partly due to the AUM acquired through acquisitions, and partly due to market value changes and investor flows such that the revenue yield on our average AUM was lower in 2011 when compared to 2010. The percentage increase in investment management fees is therefore lower than the percentage increase in average AUM and average long-term AUM. The lower yield also reflects the acquisition-related U.S. mutual fund fee waivers that commenced in June 2011. Foreign exchange rate movements accounted for $67.2 million (16.1%) of the increase in investment management fees during the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2010. Service and Distribution Fees Service fees are generated through fees charged to cover several types of expenses, including fund accounting fees and other maintenance costs for mutual funds, unit trusts and ICVCs, and administrative fees earned from closed-ended funds. Service fees also include transfer agent fees, which are fees charged to cover the expense of processing client share purchases and redemptions, call center support and client reporting. U.S. distribution fees include 12b-1 fees earned from certain mutual funds to cover allowable sales and marketing expenses for those funds and also include asset-based sales charges paid by certain mutual funds for a period of time after the sale of those funds. Distribution fees typically vary in relation to the amount of client assets managed. Generally, retail products offered outside of the U.S. do not generate a separate distribution fee; the quoted management fee rate is inclusive of these services. In the year ended December 31, 2012 , service and distribution fees decreased by $8.7 million ( 1.1% ) to $771.6 million (year ended December 31, 2011 : $780.3 million ) due primarily to decreases in transfer agency fees of $4.9 million and administration and custodial fees of $2.3 million. The impact of foreign exchange rate movements decreased service and distribution fees by $1.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2012 . The fee reductions are attributable to the fund mergers and fee waivers associated with the U.S. mutual fund product realignment, the continued conversion of B-share fee structures to class A-shares that generate a lower annual service fee, and other changes in the AUM mix as a larger percentage of AUM charges no or lower distribution fees during the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2011 . In the year ended December 31, 2011, service and distribution fees increased by $134.8 million (20.9%) to $780.3 million (year ended December 31, 2010: $645.5 million) primarily due to the acquisition and due to the increase in average AUM during the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2010. 38 Table of Contents Performance Fees Performance fee revenues are generated on certain management contracts when performance hurdles are achieved. Such fee revenues are recorded in operating revenues as of the performance measurement date, when the contractual performance criteria have been met and when the outcome of the transaction can be measured reliably in accordance with Method 1 of ASC Topic 605-20-S99, Revenue Recognition - Services - SEC Materials. Cash receipt of earned performance fees occurs after the measurement date. The performance measurement date is defined in each contract in which incentive and performance fee revenue agreements are in effect. We have performance fee arrangements that include monthly, quarterly and annual measurement dates. Given the uniqueness of each transaction, performance fee contracts are evaluated on an individual basis to determine if revenues can and should be recognized. Performance fees are not recorded if there are any future performance contingencies. If performance arrangements require repayment of the performance fee for failure to perform during the contractual period, then performance fee revenues are recognized no earlier than the expiration date of these terms. Performance fees will fluctuate from period to period and may not correlate with general market changes, since most of the fees are driven by relative performance to the respective benchmark rather than by absolute performance. Of our $687.7 billion in AUM at December 31, 2012 , approximately $47.3 billion or 6.9% , could potentially earn performance fees. In the year ended December 31, 2012 , performance fees increased by $20.9 million ( 55.1% ) to $58.8 million (year ended December 31, 2011 : $37.9 million ). The performance fees generated in 2012 arose primarily due to products managed by Atlantic Trust ($17.4 million), the Bank Loan group ($16.5 million), Invesco Perpetual ($12.7 million) and the European Real Estate group ($7.9 million). In the year ended December 31, 2011, performance fees increased by $11.8 million (45.2%) to $37.9 million (year ended December 31, 2010: $26.1 million). The performance fees generated in 2011 arose primarily due to products managed by the European Real Estate group ($11.9 million), Atlantic Trust ($11.9 million), Invesco Perpetual ($5.3 million) and the U.S. private equity business ($4.5 million). The performance fees generated in 2010 arose primarily due to products managed by the European Real Estate group ($4.3 million), Invesco Perpetual ($3.4 million), and Atlantic Trust ($11.8 million). Other Revenues Other revenues include fees derived from our UIT operations, transaction commissions earned upon the sale of new investments into certain of our funds, and fees earned upon the completion of transactions in our direct real estate and private equity asset groups. Real estate transaction fees are derived from commissions earned through the buying and selling of properties. Private equity transaction fees include commissions associated with the restructuring of, and fees from providing advice to, portfolio companies held by the funds. These transaction fees are recorded in our financial statements on the date when the transactions are legally closed. Other revenues also include the revenues of consolidated investment products. In its capacity as sponsor of UITs, the company earns other revenues related to transactional sales charges resulting from the sale of UIT products and from the difference between the purchase or bid and offer price of securities temporarily held to form new UIT products. These revenues are recorded as other revenues net of concessions to dealers who distribute UITs to investors. In the year ended December 31, 2012 , other revenues decreased by $25.8 million ( 19.0% ) to $109.7 million (year ended December 31, 2011 : $135.5 million ). The impact of foreign exchange rate movements accounted for $1.0 million ( 3.9% ) of the decrease in other revenues during the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2011 . After allowing for foreign exchange rate changes, the decrease in other revenues was $24.8 million. The decrease in other revenues include decreases in transaction commissions of $14.8 million, UIT revenues of $5.5 million, mutual funds front end fees of $2.3 million and other revenues of $2.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to the year ended December 31, 2011 . Transaction commissions in 2011 included increased commissions generated by our private equity group as mentioned in the 2011 comparative below. In the year ended December 31, 2011, other revenues increased by $40.3 million (42.3%) to $135.5 million (year ended December 31, 2010: $95.2 million). Other revenues included an increase of $15.3 million in UIT revenues reflecting a full year of the acquisition, higher real estate acquisition and disposition fees of $11.5 million, due to increased real estate fund property activity, an $11.3 million increase in transaction commissions generated by our private equity group, and an increase in mutual funds front end fees of $1.3 million, offset by a $0.7 million decline in other revenues during the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2010. The impact of foreign exchange rate movements accounted for $1.4 million (3.5%) of the increase in other revenues during the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2010. 39 Table of Contents Third-Party Distribution, Service and Advisory Expenses Third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses include periodic renewal commissions paid to brokers and independent financial advisors for their continuing oversight of their clients' assets, over the time they are invested, and are payments for the servicing of client accounts. The revenues from our U.S. retail operations include 12b-1 distribution fees, which are passed through to brokers who sell the funds as third-party distribution expenses along with marketing support distribution costs. Both the revenues and the costs are dependent on the underlying AUM of the brokers' clients. Renewal commissions are calculated based upon a percentage of the AUM value. Third-party distribution expenses also include the amortization of upfront commissions paid to broker-dealers for sales of fund shares with a contingent deferred sales charge (a charge levied to the investor for client redemption of AUM within a certain contracted period of time). The distribution commissions are amortized over the redemption period. Also included in third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses are sub-transfer agency fees that are paid to third parties for processing client share purchases and redemptions, call center support and client reporting. Third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses may increase or decrease at a rate different from the rate of change in service and distribution fee revenues due to the inclusion of distribution, service and advisory expenses for the U.K. and Canada, where the related revenues are recorded as investment management fee revenues, as noted above. Third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses increased by $29.3 million ( 2.3% ) in the year ended December 31, 2012 to $1,311.8 million (year ended December 31, 2011 : $1,282.5 million ). The impact of foreign exchange rate movements decreased third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses by $6.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2011 . After allowing for foreign exchange rate changes, the increase in third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses was $35.4 million. The increase includes increases in renewal commissions of $22.8 million, distribution fees of $10.7 million, transfer agent fees of $7.4 million and administration fees of $0.9 million. The increases are offset by decreases in sub advisory fees of $3.3 million and external commissions of $3.1 million. As part of the outsourcing of the U.K. transfer agency, operational process changes resulted in an accounting adjustment recognizing additional distribution expense of $15.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2012, which is included in the $10.7 million increase noted above. This additional expense is attributable to periods prior to 2012. Third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses increased by $228.7 million (21.7%) in the year ended December 31, 2011 to $1,282.5 million (year ended December 31, 2010: $1,053.8 million), which is consistent with the increase in investment management and service and distribution fee revenues, reflecting the impact of the acquired business. Foreign exchange rate movements accounted for $24.7 million (10.8%) of the increase in third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses during the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2010. Proportional share of revenues, net of third-party distribution expenses, from joint venture investments Management believes that the addition of our proportional share of revenues, net of third-party distribution expenses, from joint venture arrangements should be added to operating revenues to arrive at net revenues, as it is important to evaluate the contribution to the business that our joint venture arrangements are making. See Schedule of Non-GAAP Information for additional disclosures regarding the use of net revenues. The company's most significant joint venture arrangement is our 49% investment in Invesco Great Wall Fund Management Company Limited (the Invesco Great Wall joint venture). Our proportional share of revenues, net of third-party distribution expenses, from joint venture investments decreased by $3.9 million ( 9.4% ) to $37.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 (year ended December 31, 2011 : $41.4 million ). The decrease moved in line with our share of the Invesco Great Wall joint venture's average AUM for the year ended December 31, 2012 , which was $3.0 billion compared to $3.3 billion at the year ended December 31, 2011 . The 1.9% decrease in our proportional share of revenues, net of third-party distribution expenses, from joint venture investments to $41.4 million in 2011 (year ended December 31, 2010: $42.2 million), was driven by the decline in average AUM of the Invesco Great Wall joint venture. Our share of the Invesco Great Wall joint venture's average AUM for the year ended December 31, 2011, was $3.3 billion, a 8.3% decline in average AUM from $3.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010. Management and performance fees earned from consolidated investment products Management believes that the consolidation of investment products may impact a reader's analysis of our underlying results of operations and could result in investor confusion or the production of information about the company by analysts or external credit rating agencies that is not reflective of the underlying results of operations and financial condition of the company. Accordingly, management believes that it is appropriate to adjust operating revenues for the impact of consolidated investment products in calculating net revenues. As management and performance fees earned by Invesco from the consolidated products are eliminated upon consolidation of the investment products, management believes that it is appropriate to add these operating revenues back in the calculation of net revenues. See Schedule of Non-GAAP Information for additional disclosures regarding the use of net 40 Table of Contents revenues. Management and performance fees earned from consolidated investment products decreased by $6.3 million to $41.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2012 (year ended December 31, 2011 : $47.3 million ). The decrease is primarily due to the impact of funds deconsolidated during the year ended December 31, 2012 . Operating Expenses The main categories of operating expenses are as follows: Variance Years ended December 31, 2012 vs 2011 2011 vs 2010 $ in millions 2012 2011 2010 $ Change % Change $ Change % Change Employee compensation 1,297.7 1,246.2 1,114.9 51.5 4.1 % 131.3 11.8 % Third-party distribution, service and advisory 1,311.8 1,282.5 1,053.8 29.3 2.3 % 228.7 21.7 % Marketing 103.0 86.0 78.5 17.0 19.8 % 7.5 9.6 % Property, office and technology 277.6 254.6 238.4 23.0 9.0 % 16.2 6.8 % General and administrative 307.2 295.4 262.2 11.8 4.0 % 33.2 12.7 % Transaction and integration 8.2 29.4 150.0 (21.2 ) (72.1 )% (120.6 ) (80.4 )% Total operating expenses 3,305.5 3,194.1 2,897.8 111.4 3.5 % 296.3 10.2 % The table below sets forth these expense categories as a percentage of total operating expenses and operating revenues, which we believe provides useful information as to the relative significance of each type of expense. $ in millions 2012 % of Total Operating Expenses % of Operating Revenues 2011 % of Total Operating Expenses % of Operating Revenues 2010 % of Total Operating Expenses % of Operating Revenues Employee compensation 1,297.7 39.3 % 31.1 % 1,246.2 39.0 % 30.5 % 1,114.9 38.5 % 32.0 % Third-party distribution, service and advisory 1,311.8 39.7 % 31.4 % 1,282.5 40.2 % 31.3 % 1,053.8 36.4 % 30.2 % Marketing 103.0 3.1 % 2.5 % 86.0 2.7 % 2.1 % 78.5 2.7 % 2.3 % Property, office and technology 277.6 8.4 % 6.6 % 254.6 8.0 % 6.2 % 238.4 8.2 % 6.8 % General and administrative 307.2 9.3 % 7.3 % 295.4 9.2 % 7.2 % 262.2 9.0 % 7.5 % Transaction and integration 8.2 0.2 % 0.2 % 29.4 0.9 % 0.7 % 150.0 5.2 % 4.3 % Total operating expenses 3,305.5 100.0 % 79.1 % 3,194.1 100.0 % 78.0 % 2,897.8 100.0 % 83.1 % During the year ended December 31, 2012 , operating expenses increased by $111.4 million ( 3.5% ) to $3,305.5 million (year ended December 31, 2011 : $3,194.1 million ). Excluding transaction and integration, all expense categories increased in 2012 when compared to 2011. The impact of foreign exchange rate movements offset the increase in operating expenses by $22.9 million , or 0.7% of total operating expenses, during the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2011 . During the year ended December 31, 2011, operating expenses increased by $296.3 million (10.2%) to $3,194.1 million (year ended December 31, 2010: $2,897.8 million). As discussed above, the acquisition occurred on June 1, 2010, which increased expenses across all categories, except transaction and integration expenses, which decreased during the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2010. The impact of foreign exchange rate movements accounted for $61.8 million (20.9%) of the increase in operating expenses, and was 1.9% of total operating expenses, during the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2010. 41 Table of Contents Employee Compensation Employee compensation includes salary, cash bonuses and share-based payment plans designed to attract and retain the highest caliber employees. Employee staff benefit plan costs and payroll taxes are also included in employee compensation. Employee compensation increased $51.5 million ( 4.1% ) to $1,297.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2012 (year ended December 31, 2011 : $1,246.2 million ). The impact of foreign exchange rate movements offset the increase in employee compensation by $10.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2011 . After allowing for foreign exchange rate changes, the increase in employee compensation was $62.4 million. Direct compensation increased $68.7 million and includes increases in share-based costs of $22.8 million and other deferred compensation costs of $13.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2012 when compared to the year ended December 31, 2011 . The increase in share-based and deferred cash compensation costs in 2012 includes the impact of a previous change in our vesting service period from three to four years, which results in 2012 being the first year with four award tranches being expensed, as compared to three award tranches in previous years. The change accounts for approximately $18 million of the increase in share-based and other deferred compensation expense. The increase in deferred cash compensation also includes $8.1 million from the appreciation of the deferred liability as the return to the employee is linked to specific investments, typically the funds managed by the employee. The remaining increase in share-based and deferred compensation costs reflects the increased use of deferred awards for staff retention purposes. Other changes in direct compensation were an increase in sales commissions of $17.0 million, a $4.6 million increase in bonuses linked to performance fee revenues, $6.4 million increase in base salaries and a $4.1 million reduction in annual cash bonuses during the year ended December 31, 2012 when compared to the year ended December 31, 2011 . The increase in direct compensation expense was partly offset by decreases in staff benefits and related expense of $6.3 million that included a $15.0 million reduction in amortization of prepaid compensation related to the 2006 acquisition of W.L. Ross & Co., which was fully amortized as of September 30, 2011. The reduced amortization expense was partly offset by a $2.9 million increase in staff medical insurance and a $4.5 million increase in staff relocation costs during the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2011 . Staff related expenses in 2012 included termination costs of $18.9 million. Employee compensation increased $131.3 million (11.8%) to $1,246.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 (year ended December 31, 2010: $1,114.9 million). The impact of foreign exchange rate movements accounted for $26.5 million (20.2%) of the increase in employee compensation expenses for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2010. After allowing for foreign exchange rate changes, the increase in employee compensation was $104.8 million. The compensation increase from 2010 to 2011 includes the incremental impact of the acquisition. Base salaries and variable compensation increased $94.2 million. Staff related costs, principally payroll taxes and termination costs, increased $15.0 million. Staff benefits expense decreased by $2.5 million due to a $5.0 million reduction in the prepaid compensation amortization expenses in the year ended December 31, 2011 when compared to the year ended December 31, 2010 related to the 2006 acquisition of W.L. Ross & Co. This prepaid compensation was fully amortized as of September 30, 2011. Also included in compensation expenses during the year ended December 31, 2011 are share-based costs which decreased $1.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2010. Headcount at December 31, 2012 was 6,128 (years ended December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010 : 6,162 and 5,617 respectively). The 2011 increase in headcount, as compared to 2010 , was primarily driven by the insourcing of our Hyderabad, India, facility. Third-Party Distribution, Service and Advisory Expenses Third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses are discussed above in the operating and net revenues section. Marketing Marketing expenses include the cost of direct advertising of our products through trade publications, television and other media, and public relations costs, such as the marketing of the company's products through conferences or other sponsorships, and the cost of marketing-related employee travel. Marketing expenses increased by $17.0 million ( 19.8% ) in the year ended December 31, 2012 to $103.0 million (year ended December 31, 2011 : $86.0 million ). The impact of foreign exchange rate movements offset the increase in marketing expenses by $1.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2011 . After allowing for foreign exchange rate changes, the increase in marketing expenses was $18.1 million. 42 Table of Contents The increase during the year ended December 31, 2012 includes increases in corporate sponsorships of $7.8 million, driven by the 2011 termination of the company's sponsorship and naming rights commitments related to a sports stadium in Denver, Colorado, which resulted in a marketing expense reduction of $13.4 million recognized in that year. Other marketing expenses increases were advertising expense of $4.8 million, driven by advertising campaigns as we focused on brand awareness, client event expenses of $3.1 million, sales literature and research of $1.2 million and other marketing costs of $1.2 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2011 . Marketing expenses increased by $7.5 million (9.6%) in the year ended December 31, 2011 to $86.0 million (year ended December 31, 2010: $78.5 million). The increase in marketing includes the impact of the acquisition. Additionally, the increase during the year ended December 31, 2011 includes an increase in advertising expense of $15.1 million as our U.S. retail business launched an advertising program focusing on re-branding after the acquisition. The full year expense in 2011 of the acquisition-related additional sales force resulted in an increase in travel expense of $3.2 million and increase in other marketing costs of $2.5 million. These increases were partly offset by a decrease in marketing expense of $13.4 million due to the reversal of a cumulative deferred credit, as well as a reduction in recurring costs, from the termination of our sponsorship and naming rights commitments related to a sports stadium in Denver, Colorado, a decrease in client event costs of $0.9 million, and a decrease in sales literature and research of $0.9 million, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2010. The impact of foreign exchange rate movements accounted for $2.1 million (28.0%) of the increase in marking expense during the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2010. Property, Office and Technology Property, office and technology expenses include rent and utilities for our various leased facilities, depreciation of company-owned property, capitalized software and computer equipment costs, minor non-capitalized computer equipment and software purchases and related maintenance payments, and costs related to externally provided operations, technology, and other back office management services. Property, office and technology costs increased by $23.0 million ( 9.0% ) to $277.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2012 (year ended December 31, 2011 : $254.6 million ). The impact of foreign exchange rate movements offset the increase in property, office and technology expenses by $2.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2011 . After allowing for foreign exchange rate movements, the increase was $25.5 million. Property and office expenses increased $7.1 million compared to 2011 , due to increases in depreciation of $4.7 million and rent expense of $3.3 million. The depreciation increase is largely attributable to leasehold improvements as both our Houston and Toronto offices have renovated leased space during the last 12 months. The increase in rent expense includes a $1.7 million exit charge for leased space, related to consolidation of office space. Technology and communications expenses increased $18.4 million over the comparable 2011 period. The increase reflects an ongoing investment in portfolio management and client engagement technology initiatives that resulted in increases in software and hardware expenses of $9.5 million, together with increased outsourced administration costs of $7.3 million as the U.K and European transfer agency transitions to a third party provider. At year-end, the U.K. transfer agency outsourcing is complete, and the European outsourcing is scheduled for completion in mid-2013. Property, office and technology costs increased by $16.2 million (6.8%) to $254.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 (year ended December 31, 2010: $238.4 million). The impact of foreign exchange rate movements accounted for $4.9 million (30.2%) of the increase in property, office and technology expenses during the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2010. After allowing for foreign exchange, property and office expenses increased $14.8 million over the comparable 2010 period, due to an increase of $11.5 million in property management fees, service charges and rent expense related to new properties associated with business acquisitions, and increases of $2.1 million in depreciation expense and $1.2 million in other property costs. Technology and communications expenses decreased $3.5 million due to decreases in outsourced administration expenses of $12.9 million , partly due to the Hyderabad internalization, a decrease in telephone and communication line expenses of $1.8 million and a decrease in programming and consulting expenses of $1.0 million, offset by increases in depreciation and maintenance expenses of $11.7 million and hardware and software purchases of $0.5 million, during the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2010. General and Administrative General and administrative expenses include professional services costs, such as information service subscriptions, consulting fees, professional insurance costs, audit, tax and legal fees, non-marketing related employee travel expenditures, recruitment and training costs, and the amortization of certain intangible assets. General and administrative expenses increased by $11.8 million ( 4.0% ) to $307.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2012 43 Table of Contents (year ended December 31, 2011 : $295.4 million ). The impact of foreign exchange rate movements offset the increase in general and administrative expenses by $2.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2011 . After allowing for foreign exchange rate movements, the increase was $14.1 million. The increase in general and administrative expense is largely due to increased expenses of our consolidated investment products, which includes increases in legal and fund launch costs, of $18.5 million. General and administrative expenses also includes acquisition related contingent consideration adjustments with a $2.3 million credit in 2012 compared to a $13.2 million credit in 2011. These reduction in the amounts credited in 2012 versus 2011 resulted in an increase in general and administrative expenses of $10.9 million in 2012. Offsetting these expense increases was a $12.8 million decrease in intangible amortization expense and a $5.2 million reduction in mutual fund expenses. The decrease in intangible amortization in 2012 reflects the write down of certain management contract intangibles in 2011 and the completion in mid-2012 of amortization of brand intangibles related to the acquired business. General and administrative expenses increased by $33.2 million (12.7%) to $295.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 (year ended December 31, 2010: $262.2 million). Increases in general and administrative expenses include the impact of the acquisition. Professional services expenses increased $8.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2010 due to increases in consultant fees of $9.2 million, contractor and recruitment fees of $5.6 million, information services of $4.5 million, legal fees of $3.1 million (including legal fees associated with settlement litigation arising from the 2007 departure of certain investment professionals to a competitor of $3.6 million), and other professional services of $1.2 million. Travel expenses increased $11.1 million, driven by higher levels of business activity, and mutual fund expenses increased $7.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2010. Expenditure related tax increases, including U.K. value added tax (VAT), resulted in an additional $4.5 million of irrecoverable VAT expense during the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2010, as VAT rates increased in the U.K. These increases are offset by reduced regulatory fees of $13.3 million relating to a levy from the U.K. Financial Services Compensation Scheme in 2010 of $15.3 million to cover claims resulting from failures of non-affiliated investment firms, professional insurance costs of $1.0 million, accounting services of $0.6 million and directors fees and expenses of $0.4 million. Included in general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2010 was $8.9 million representing fund reimbursement costs from the correction of historical foreign exchange allocations. Other net decreases of $2.1 million in general and administrative expenses consist of a reduction in acquisition-related contingent consideration payable, gains on disposal of property, plant and equipment and fund reimbursement costs on trade corrections, offset by an increase in intangible amortization expense due to the acquisitions and that includes a write down of certain management contract intangibles. The impact of foreign exchange rate movements accounted for $3.6 million (10.8%) of the increase in general and administrative costs during the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2010. Transaction and integration Transaction and integration expenses include acquisition-related charges incurred during the periods to effect a business combination, including legal, regulatory, advisory, valuation, integration-related employee incentive awards and other professional or consulting fees, general and administrative costs, including travel costs related to the transaction and the costs of temporary staff involved in executing the transaction, and post-closing costs of integrating the acquired business into the company's existing operations. Additionally, transaction and integration expenses include legal costs related to the defense of auction rate preferred securities complaints raised in the pre-acquisition period with respect to various closed-end funds included in the acquisition. See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 19 , Commitments and Contingencies for additional information. Transaction and integration charges were $8.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2012 (year ended December 31, 2011 : $29.4 million ) and largely relate to the business acquired in 2010. Transaction and integration expenses during the year ended December 31, 2012 primarily relate to the final round of open-ended fund mergers and include professional services and shareholder communications costs, as well as updates in sales literature. Transaction and integration charges were $29.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 (year ended December 31, 2010:$150.0 million) related to the integration of acquired businesses. Transaction and integration expenses during the year ended December 31, 2011 include $19.9 million of professional services and other costs, principally legal, proxy solicitation, consultancy and insurance, $4.9 million of property and office, $2.8 million of employee compensation costs, $1.4 million of technology and communication costs and $0.4 million of marketing and client services. Transaction and integration expenses for the year ended December 31, 2010 include $39.1 million of staff costs, $53.4 million of technology contractor and related costs, and $57.5 million of professional services, principally legal, proxy solicitation, consultancy and insurance. Operating Income, Adjusted Operating Income, Operating Margin and Adjusted Operating Margin Operating income decreased by $26.6 million ( 3.0% ) to $871.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2012 (year ended 44 Table of Contents December 31, 2011 : $898.1 million ). Operating margin (operating income divided by operating revenues), decreased from 21.9% in the year ended December 31, 2011 to 20.9% in the year ended December 31, 2012 . The decrease in operating income and margin resulted from a lower relative increase in operating revenues ( 2.1% ) than in operating expenses ( 3.5% ) during the period. Adjusted operating income, decreased by $23.8 million ( 2.2% ) to $1,045.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2012 from $1,068.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 . Adjusted operating margin decreased to 35.3% in the year ended December 31, 2012 from 36.9% in the year ended December 31, 2011 . See Schedule of Non-GAAP Information for a reconciliation of operating revenues to net revenues, a reconciliation of operating income to adjusted operating income and additional important disclosures regarding net revenues, adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin. Operating income increased by $308.2 million (52.2%) to $898.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 (year ended December 31, 2010: $589.9 million). Operating margin (operating income divided by operating revenues), increased from 16.9% in the year ended December 31, 2010 to 21.9% in the year ended December 31, 2011. The increase in operating income and margin resulted from a greater relative increase in operating revenues (17.3%) than in operating expenses (10.2%) during the period. Adjusted operating income, increased by $171.2 million (19.1%) to $1,068.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 from $897.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2010. Adjusted operating margin increased to 36.9% in the year ended December 31, 2011 from 35.6% in the year ended December 31, 2010. Other Income and Expenses The main categories of other income and expenses, and the dollar and percentage changes between periods are as follows: Variance Years ended December 31, 2012 vs 2011 2011 vs 2010 $ in millions 2012 2011 2010 $ Change % Change $ Change % Change Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates 29.7 30.5 40.2 (0.8 ) (2.6 )% (9.7 ) (24.1 )% Interest and dividend income 9.8 11.0 10.4 (1.2 ) (10.9 )% 0.6 5.8 % Interest income of consolidated investment products 258.5 307.2 240.9 (48.7 ) (15.9 )% 66.3 27.5 % Other gains/(losses) of consolidated investment products, net (97.7 ) (138.9 ) 114.0 41.2 (29.7 )% (252.9 ) N/A Interest expense (52.3 ) (61.8 ) (58.6 ) 9.5 (15.4 )% (3.2 ) 5.5 % Interest expense of consolidated investment products (168.3 ) (187.0 ) (118.6 ) 18.7 (10.0 )% (68.4 ) 57.7 % Other gains and losses, net 8.3 49.0 15.6 (40.7 ) (83.1 )% 33.4 214.1 % Total other income and expenses (12.0 ) 10.0 243.9 (22.0 ) (220.0 )% (233.9 ) (95.9 )% Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates decreased by $0.8 million ( 2.6% ) to $29.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2012 (year ended December 31, 2011 : $30.5 million ). The decrease in equity in earnings is driven by the declines in our pre-tax earnings of our joint venture investments in China of $3.4 million, offset by the increase of $2.6 million in our share of the market-driven valuation changes in the underlying holdings of certain partnership investments, which includes our investment in Invesco Mortgage Capital Inc. Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates decreased by $9.7 million (24.1%) to $30.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 (year ended December 31, 2010: $40.2 million). Included in equity in earnings from affiliates is our share of the income from our joint ventures in China, which declined by $2.4 million to $21.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 from $23.9 million earned during the year ended December 31, 2010. Declines in equity in earnings from our joint ventures are due to declines in revenues that are in turn attributable to lower average AUM in those entities during the year. Earnings from our affiliate in Poland increased by $0.2 million to $1.3 million in year ended December 31, 2011 from $1.1 million earned in the year ended December 31, 2010. The remainder of the variance is due to our share of the market-driven valuation changes in the underlying holdings of certain partnership investments which decreased by $7.4 million to $7.7 million earned in the year ended December 31, 2011 from $15.1 million earned during the year ended December 31, 2010. 45 Table of Contents Interest and dividend income and interest expense Interest and dividend income decreased by $1.2 million ( 10.9% ) to $9.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2012 (year ended December 31, 2011 : $11.0 million ). The decrease in interest and dividend income is largely due to a decrease in investment income and interest earned on cash and cash equivalents of $1.1 million. The remaining $0.1 million decrease is due to reduction of dividend income on investments held to hedge economically deferred compensation plans. This dividend income is passed through to employee participants in the deferred compensation plans. Interest expense decreased by $9.5 million ( 15.4% ) to $52.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2012 (year ended December 31, 2011 : $61.8 million ) primarily due to the retirement of the $215.1 million 5.625% Senior Notes in April 2012. Lower borrowing costs versus the comparative period also contributed to lower interest for the period. Interest and dividend income increased by $0.6 million (5.8%) to $11.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 (year ended December 31, 2010: $10.4 million). The year ended December 31, 2011 includes dividend income of $4.9 million on investments held to hedge economically deferred compensation plans (December 31, 2010: $2.7 million). The increase in dividend income of $2.2 million is offset by the decreases in investment income and interest earned on cash and cash equivalents of $1.6 million resulting from lower average cash and cash equivalent balances during the year ended December 31, 2011. Interest expense increased by $3.2 million (5.5%) to $61.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 (year ended December 31, 2010: $58.6 million). Higher average debt balances were partly offset by lower average cost of debt during the year ended December 31, 2011. Other gains and losses, net Other gains and losses, net were a net gain of $8.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2012 as compared to a net gain of $49.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 . Included within other gains and losses in the year ended December 31, 2012 is a net gain of $19.7 million resulting from the appreciation of investments held for our deferred compensation plans, a gain on the sale of CLO management contracts of $ 8.3 million , net realized gains from seed and other investments of $5.0 million and a $3.7 million gain on an acquisition-related loan note held to hedge the company's net interest in certain consolidated investment products. These gains were offset by a fourth-quarter charge of $23.5 million related to the call premiums on the redemption of the $333.5 million principal amount of 5.375% Senior Notes due February 27, 2013 and the $197.1 million principal amount of the 5.375% Senior Notes due December 15, 2014. A net loss of $2.5 million was also recorded in 2012 related to the mark-to-market of 12-month foreign exchange put option contracts intended to provide protection against the impact of a significant decline in the Pound Sterling/U.S Dollar foreign exchange rate. We incurred $0.8 million in other-than-temporary impairment charges related to seed money investments during the year ended December 31, 2012 (year ended December 31, 2011 : $0.9 million) and an impairment charge of $1.9 million related to a cost method investment. In the year ended December 31, 2012 , we experienced $ 0.3 million in net foreign exchange gains (year ended December 31, 2011 : $0.6 million in net foreign exchange losses) on the revaluation of intercompany foreign currency denominated loans into the various functional currencies of our subsidiaries. Other gains and losses, net were a net gain of $49.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to a net gain of $15.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2010. Included within other gains and losses in the year ended December 31, 2011 is a credit of $45.0 million related to the settlement of litigation arising from the 2007 departure of certain investment professionals to a competitor. Also included in other gains and losses is a net loss of $2.6 million as a result of the deprecation of assets held for our deferred compensation plans (year ended December 31, 2010: a net gain of $14.2 million), together with $8.1 million of net realized gains from seed investments (year ended December 31, 2010: $9.2 million net realized gains). The 2011 other gains and losses also included $0.9 million in other-than-temporary impairment charges related to other seed money in affiliated funds (year ended December 31, 2010: $6.6 million). In the year ended December 31, 2011, we incurred $0.6 million in net foreign exchange losses (year ended December 31, 2010: $0.2 million in net foreign exchange losses) on the revaluation of intercompany foreign currency denominated loans into the various functional currencies of our subsidiaries. Non-operating income and expense of consolidated investment products Interest income of consolidated investment products results from interest generated by the collateral assets held by consolidated CLOs, which is used to satisfy the interest expenses of the notes issued by the consolidated CLOs and other CLO operating expense requirements, including the payment of the management and performance fees to the company as investment manager. See Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 20 , Consolidated Investment Products, for additional details. In the year ended December 31, 2012 , interest income of consolidated investment products decreased by $48.7 million ( 15.9% ) to $258.5 million (year ended December 31, 2011 : $307.2 million ) primarily due to the deconsolidation of certain CLO products, as well as the impact of certain CLOs entering their amortization period. Interest expense of consolidated investment products 46 Table of Contents decreased by $18.7 million ( 10.0% ) to $168.3 million (year ended December 31, 2011 : $187.0 million ) primarily due to CLO deconsolidation. Included in other gains/(losses) of consolidated investment products, net, are realized and unrealized gains and losses on the underlying investments and debt of consolidated investment products. In the year ended December 31, 2012 , other gains and losses of consolidated investment products were a net loss of $97.7 million , as compared to a net loss of $138.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 . The net loss in the 2012 period is primarily associated with real estate investments and increases in the market values of the long-term debt of CLOs that more than offset gains in the market values of investments held by CLOs. In the year ended December 31, 2011, interest income of consolidated investment products increased by $66.3 million (27.5%) to $307.2 million (year ended December 31, 2010: $240.9 million) reflecting the acquisition and higher interest rates on variable rate asset collateral held by the CLOs. Interest expense of consolidated investment products increased by $68.4 million (57.7%) to $187.0 million (year ended December 31, 2010: $118.6 million) reflecting the acquisition and higher variable interest rates on outstanding principal balances of CLO notes in 2011. In the year ended December 31, 2011 other gains and losses of consolidated investment products were a net loss of $138.9 million, as compared to a net gain of $114.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2010. The net loss in the 2011 period is primarily due to losses in CLO investments and long-term debt which more than offset gains in the market value of investments held by consolidated private equity funds. The net gain in the 2010 period is primarily due to changes in market values of investments held by consolidated private equity funds. Net impact of consolidated investment products and related noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities As illustrated in the Summary of Income Statement Impact of Consolidated Investment Products table at the beginning of this Results of Operations section, the consolidation of investment products during the year ended December 31, 2012 resulted in a decrease to net income of $100.5 million before attribution to noncontrolling interests. Invesco invests in only a portion of these products, and as a result this net loss is offset by noncontrolling interests of $89.8 million , resulting in a net decrease in net income of the company of $10.7 million . The consolidation of investment products during the year ended December 31, 2011 resulted in a decrease to net income of $87.4 million before attribution to noncontrolling interests. This net loss is offset by noncontrolling interests of $107.6 million, resulting in a net increase in net income of the company of $20.2 million. The consolidation of investment products during the year ended December 31, 2010 resulted in an increase to net income of $180.7 million before attribution to noncontrolling interests. This net income is offset by noncontrolling interests of $170.9 million, resulting in a net increase in net income of the company of $9.8 million. Noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities represent the profit or loss amounts attributed to third party investors in consolidated investment products. Movements in amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities on the company's Consolidated Statements of Income generally offset the gains and losses, interest income and interest expense of consolidated investment products. Additionally, consolidated investment products represent less than 1% of the company's AUM. Therefore, the net gains or losses of consolidated investment products is not indicative of the performance of the company's aggregate assets under management. Income Before Taxes Total income before taxes includes income before taxes of consolidated investment products. Consolidated investment products are taxed at the investor level and not at the product entity level; therefore, there is no tax provision reflected in the net impact of consolidated investment products. Accordingly, the table included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 16, "Taxation," illustrating the division of income/(losses) before taxes between U.S. and Foreign is formatted such that the income before taxes of consolidated investment products is separately stated. The commentary below discusses disparities between U.S. and Foreign income before taxes in the Taxation footnote and U.S. and Foreign operating revenues in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 18, "Geographic Information." Total U.S. income before taxes of $545.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 includes income before taxes of consolidated investment products of $59.7 million , which primarily consists of income from consolidated private equity partnerships. U.S. income before taxes from consolidated investment products decreased $33.3 million ( 35.8% ) from 2011 due primarily to lower gains generated by these private equity partnerships. Excluding consolidated investment products, U.S. income before taxes in 2012 decreased $0.9 million ( 0.2% ). Income before taxes in 2012 had a small decrease, contrary to the 4.9% increase in U.S. operating revenues, due primarily to a legal settlement gain recognized in 2011, as discussed above. 47 Table of Contents Total Foreign income before taxes of $314.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 includes losses before taxes of consolidated investment products of $160.2 million , which primarily consists of losses from consolidated CLOs and Japanese real estate partnerships. Foreign consolidated investment product pre-tax losses totaled $160.2 million in 2012 compared to pre-tax losses of $180.4 million in 2011 primarily due to lower losses on investments held by the Company's consolidated CLOs in 2012. Excluding consolidated investment products, foreign income before taxes decreased by $34.6 million ( 6.8% ). Foreign income in 2012 decreased more significantly than the 0.8% decrease in foreign operating revenues due to increased foreign expenses incurred in 2012, such as the $15.3 million additional distribution fee recorded in the U.K., as discussed above, and expenses incurred in connection with the outsourcing of the European transfer agency. Total U.S. income before taxes of $579.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 (December 31, 2010: $271.0 million ) includes income before taxes of consolidated investment products of $93.0 million (December 31, 2010: $97.2 million ). The 180% increase in U.S. income before taxes excluding consolidated investment products is primarily attributable to the inclusion of the full year of the acquisition of Morgan Stanley's retail asset management business, which occurred on June 1, 2010. Income before taxes increased in 2011 more significantly than the increase in operating revenues from the year-ended December 31, 2010, due to the $150.0 million of transaction and integration costs that lowered income before taxes in 2010. U.S. income before taxes of consolidated investment products primarily consists of income from consolidated private equity partnerships and totaled $93.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, a decrease of $4.2 million ( 4% ) from 2010. Total Foreign income before taxes of $328.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 (December 31, 2010: $562.8 million ) includes losses before taxes of consolidated investment products of $180.4 million (December 31, 2010: income before taxes of consolidated investment products of $83.5 million ). The 6.2% increase in Foreign income before taxes excluding consolidated investment products is driven by a 11.9% increase in Foreign operating revenues during the period. Foreign income/(losses) before taxes of consolidated investment products primarily consists of income/(losses) from consolidated collateralized loan obligations (CLOs) and Japanese real estate partnerships. The change in foreign losses before taxes from consolidated investment products is primarily due to market-driven losses incurred by the company's consolidated CLOs in 2011, whereas gains were recorded by the consolidated CLOs in 2010. CLO losses in 2011 were primarily driven by losses on long-term debt issued by the CLOs and losses on asset collateral held by the CLOs. Losses on long-term debt were primarily due to narrower spread valuation assumptions on debt issued by certain CLOs and lower default rates. CLO pretax income in 2010 was primarily driven by strong interest income on variable rate asset collateral held by the CLOs. Income Tax Expense Our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2012 increased to 31.7% (year ended December 31, 2011: 31.5%) due a smaller impact from losses in non-controlling interests in consolidated entities in 2012 versus 2011. The inclusion of non-controlling interests increased our effective tax rate by 3.0% in 2012 and 3.3% in 2011. The remainder of the rate movement was primarily due to changes in the mix of pre-tax income. The 2011 rate reflects a favorable impact from the release of a provision for uncertain tax positions as a result of the statute of limitation closing. Our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased to 31.5% (year ended December 31, 2010:23.6%) due to losses in non-controlling interests in 2011 versus income in 2010. The inclusion of non-controlling interests in consolidated entities increased our effective tax rate by 3.3% in 2011 and decreased it by 6.1% in 2010. The remainder of the rate movement was primarily due to changes in the mix of pre-tax income and favorable adjustments to reconcile our tax provisions to reflect actual tax returns filed, partially offset by a smaller benefit from the release of provisions for uncertain tax positions in 2011 versus 2010. The 2010 rate also included non-deductible transaction and integration costs related to the acquired business. Schedule of Non-GAAP Information We are presenting the following non-GAAP performance measures: net revenue (and by calculation, net revenue yield on AUM), adjusted operating income (and by calculation, adjusted operating margin), adjusted net income attributable to common shareholders (and by calculation, adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS)). We believe these non-GAAP measures provide greater transparency into our business and allow more appropriate comparisons with industry peers. Management uses these performance measures to evaluate the business, and they are consistent with internal management reporting. The most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures are operating revenues (and by calculation, gross revenue yield on AUM), operating income (and by calculation, operating margin), net income (and by calculation, diluted EPS). Each of these measures is discussed more fully below. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered as substitutes for any measures derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. Additional reconciling items may be added in the future to these non-GAAP measures if deemed appropriate. The following are reconciliations of operating revenues, operating income (and by calculation, operating margin), and net income attributable to common shareholders (and by calculation, diluted EPS) on a U.S. GAAP basis to net revenues, adjusted operating 48 Table of Contents income (and by calculation, adjusted operating margin), and adjusted net income attributable to common shareholders (and by calculation, adjusted diluted EPS): $ in millions, except per share data 2012 2011 2010 2009 2008 Operating revenues, U.S. GAAP basis 4,177.0 4,092.2 3,487.7 2,627.3 3,307.6 Third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses (1) (1,311.8 ) (1,282.5 ) (1,053.8 ) (737.0 ) (927.8 ) Third-party distribution expense related to the European infrastructure initiative (6) 15.3 Proportional share of net revenues from joint venture arrangements (2) 37.5 41.4 42.2 44.7 57.3 Management fees earned from consolidated investment products eliminated upon consolidation (3) 38.6 46.8 45.3 8.0 6.2 Performance fees earned from consolidated investment products eliminated upon consolidation (3) 2.4 0.5 Other revenues recorded by consolidated investment products (3) (0.3 ) (2.0 ) (5.4 ) Net revenues 2,959.0 2,898.4 2,521.1 1,941.0 2,437.9 Operating income, U.S. GAAP basis 871.5 898.1 589.9 484.3 747.8 Proportional share of operating income from joint venture investments (2) 15.7 19.2 22.9 28.4 39.7 Transaction and integration charges (4) 8.2 29.4 150.0 10.8 Amortization of acquisition-related prepaid compensation (4) 15.0 20.0 20.0 20.0 Amortization of other intangibles (4) 29.6 42.2 30.3 12.6 13.3 Change in contingent consideration estimates (4) (2.3 ) (13.2 ) (3.8 ) Compensation expense related to market valuation changes in deferred compensation plans (5) 14.3 5.8 9.3 Consolidation of investment products (3) 72.5 60.3 54.9 9.5 5.3 Third-party distribution expense related to the European infrastructure initiative (6) 15.3 Other reconciling items (8) 20.3 12.1 24.2 Adjusted operating income 1,045.1 1,068.9 897.7 565.6 826.1 Operating margin* 20.9 % 21.9 % 16.9 % 18.4 % 22.6 % Adjusted operating margin** 35.3 % 36.9 % 35.6 % 29.1 % 33.9 % Net income attributable to common shareholders, U.S. GAAP basis 677.1 729.7 465.7 322.5 481.7 Transaction and integration charges, net of tax (4) 5.1 18.2 103.1 8.9 Amortization of acquisition-related prepaid compensation (4) 15.0 20.0 20.0 20.0 Amortization of other intangibles, net of tax (4) 27.0 37.8 27.4 12.3 13.0 Change in contingent consideration estimates (4) (2.3 ) (13.2 ) (2.5 ) Deferred compensation plan market valuation changes and dividend income less compensation expense, net of tax (5) (7.4 ) 2.5 (5.3 ) Deferred income taxes on goodwill and intangible assets (4) 26.0 27.0 21.1 14.4 12.4 Consolidation of investment products (3) 10.7 (20.2 ) (6.8 ) Gain on sale of management contracts, net of tax (7) (5.8 ) Third-party distribution expense related to the European infrastructure initiative, net of tax (6) 11.6 Other reconciling items (8) 34.7 (15.2 ) 17.0 Adjusted net income attributable to common shareholders 776.7 781.6 639.7 378.1 527.1 Average shares outstanding - diluted 453.8 464.7 463.2 423.6 399.1 Diluted EPS $1.49 $1.57 $1.01 $0.76 $1.21 Adjusted diluted EPS*** $1.71 $1.68 $1.38 $0.89 $1.32 ____________ * Operating margin is equal to operating income divided by operating revenues. ** Adjusted operating margin is equal to adjusted operating income divided by net revenues. *** Adjusted diluted EPS is equal to adjusted net income divided by the weighted average shares outstanding amount used in the calculation of diluted EPS. 49 Table of Contents (1) Third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses Third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses include renewal commissions, management fee rebates and distribution costs (12b-1 and marketing support) paid to brokers and independent financial advisors. See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1 , "Accounting Policies, Revenue Recognition" for additional details. While the terms used for these types of expenses vary by geography, they are all expense items that are closely linked to the value of AUM and the revenue earned by Invesco from AUM. Since the company has been deemed to be the principal in the third-party arrangements, the company must reflect these expenses gross of operating revenues under U.S. GAAP. Management believes that the deduction of third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses from operating revenues in the computation of net revenues (and by calculation, net revenue yield on AUM) and the related computation of adjusted operating income (and by calculation, adjusted operating margin) appropriately reflects the nature of these expenses as revenue-sharing activities, as these costs are passed through to external parties who perform functions on behalf of, and distribute, the company managed funds. Further, these expenses vary extensively by geography due to the differences in distribution channels. The net presentation assists in identifying the revenue contribution generated by the business, removing distortions caused by the differing distribution channel fees and allowing for a fair comparison with U.S. peer investment managers and within Invesco own investment units. Additionally, management evaluates net revenue yield on AUM, which is equal to net revenues divided by average AUM during the reporting period. This financial measure is an indicator of the basis point net revenues we receive for each dollar of AUM we manage and is useful when evaluating the company performance relative to industry competitors and within the company for capital allocation purposes. (2) Proportional share of net revenues and operating income from joint venture investments The company has two joint venture investments in China. The Invesco Great Wall joint venture is one of the largest Sino-foreign managers of equity products in China, with AUM of approximately $6.4 billion as of December 31, 2012 . The company has a 49.0% interest in Invesco Great Wall. The company also has a 50% joint venture with Huaneng Capital Services to access private equity investment opportunities in power generation in China through Huaneng Invesco WLR Investment Consulting Company Ltd. Enhancing our operations in China is one effort that we believe could improve our competitive position over time. Accordingly, we believe that it is appropriate to evaluate the contribution of our joint venture investments to the operations of the business. Management believes that the addition of our proportional share of revenues, net of distribution expenses, from joint venture investments in the computation of net revenues and the addition of our proportional share of operating income in the related computations of adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin also provide useful information to investors and other users of the company's financial statements, as management considers it appropriate to evaluate the contribution of its joint ventures to the operations of the business. It is also consistent with the presentation of AUM and net flows (where our proportional share of the ending balances and related activity are reflected) and therefore provides a more meaningful calculation of net revenue yield on AUM. (3) Consolidated investment products See Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 20 - Consolidated Investment Products for a detailed analysis of the impact to the company Consolidated Financial Statements from the consolidation of investment products. The reconciling items add back the management and performance fees earned by Invesco from the consolidated products and remove the revenues and expenses recorded by the consolidated products that have been included in the U.S. GAAP Consolidated Statements of Income. Management believes that the consolidation of investment products may impact a reader's analysis of our underlying results of operations and could result in investor confusion or the production of information about the company by analysts or external credit rating agencies that is not reflective of the underlying results of operations and financial condition of the company. Accordingly, management believes that it is appropriate to adjust operating revenues, operating income and net income for the impact of consolidated investment products in calculating the respective net revenues, adjusted operating income and adjusted net income. The reconciling items add back the management and performance fees earned by Invesco from the consolidated products and remove the operating and non-operating income and expenses recorded by the consolidated products that have been included in the U.S. GAAP Consolidated Statements of Income. 50 Table of Contents (4) Acquisition-related reconciling items Acquisition-related adjustments include transaction and integration expenses and intangible asset amortization related to acquired assets, amortization of prepaid compensation related to the 2006 acquisition of W.L. Ross & Co., and tax cash flow benefits resulting from tax amortization of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. Transaction and integration expenses reflect the legal, regulatory, advisory, valuation, integration-related employee incentive awards and other professional or consulting fees, general and administrative costs, including travel costs related to transactions and the costs of temporary staff involved in executing the transaction, and the post closing costs of integrating the acquired business into the company existing operations including incremental costs associated with achieving synergy savings. Transaction and integration expenses include legal costs related to the defense of auction rate preferred securities complaints raised in the pre-acquisition period with respect to various closed-end funds included in the acquisition. See Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 19 - Commitments and Contingencies for additional information. Additionally, acquisition-related reconciling items include changes in estimates of contingent earn-out liabilities booked from prior acquisitions, which is offset in the period by increased amortization related to the write-off of related management contract intangible assets. The U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP reconciling items also include acquisition-related amortization charges related to previous business combinations. The tax benefit is recorded on a portion of the intangible amortization expense that does not generate a cash tax benefit. Management believes it is useful to investors and other users of our financial statements to adjust for the transaction and integration charges and the amortization expenses in arriving at adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin and adjusted diluted EPS, as this will aid comparability of our results period to period, and aid comparability with peer companies that may not have similar acquisition-related charges. While finite-lived intangible assets are amortized under U.S. GAAP, there is no amortization charge on goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles. In certain qualifying situations, these can be amortized for tax purposes, generally over a 15-year period, as is the case in the U.S. These cash flows (in the form of reduced taxes payable) represent tax benefits that are not included in the Consolidated Statements of Income absent an impairment charge or the disposal of the related business. We believe it is useful to include these tax cash flow benefits in arriving at the adjusted diluted EPS measure. The company receives these cash flow benefits but does not anticipate a sale or impairment of these assets in the foreseeable future, and therefore the deferred tax liability recognized under U.S. GAAP is not expected to be used either through a credit in the Consolidated Statements of Income or through settlement of tax obligations. (5) Market movement on deferred compensation plan liabilities Certain deferred compensation plan awards involve a return to the employee linked to the appreciation (depreciation) of specified investments, typically the funds managed by the employee. Invesco hedges economically the exposure to market movements by holding these investments on its balance sheet. U.S. GAAP requires the appreciation (depreciation) in the compensation liability to be expensed over the award vesting period in proportion to the vested amount of the award as part of compensation expense. The full value of the investment appreciation (depreciation) is immediately recorded below operating income in other gains and losses. This creates a timing difference between the recognition of the compensation expense and the investment gain or loss impacting net income attributable to common shareholders and diluted EPS which will reverse over the life of the award and net to zero at the end of the multi-year vesting period. During periods of high market volatility these timing differences impact compensation expense, operating income and operating margin in a manner which, over the life of the award, will ultimately be offset by gains and losses recorded below operating income on the Consolidated Statements of Income. The non-GAAP measures exclude the mismatch created by differing U.S. GAAP treatments of the market movement on the liability and the investments. Since these plans are hedged economically, management believes it is useful to reflect the offset ultimately achieved from hedging the investment market exposure in the calculation of adjusted operating income (and by calculation, adjusted operating margin) and adjusted net income (and by calculation, adjusted diluted EPS), to produce results that will be more comparable period to period. The related fund shares will have been purchased on or around the date of grant, eliminating any ultimate cash impact from market movements that occur over the vesting period. Additionally, dividend income from investments held to hedge economically deferred compensation plans is recorded as dividend income and as compensation expense on the company Consolidated Statements of Income on the record dates. This dividend income is passed through to the employee participants in the plan and is not retained by the company. The non-GAAP measures exclude this dividend income and related compensation expense. 51 Table of Contents (6) Third party distribution expense related to the European infrastructure initiative As part of the outsourcing of the U.K. transfer agency, as discussed below in footnote 8, "Other reconciling items," operational process changes resulted in an accounting adjustment recognizing additional distribution expense of $15.3 million ($11.6 million, net of tax) in the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2012. This additional expense is attributable to periods prior to 2012. For the reasons outlined below, this expense has been excluded in arriving at our non-GAAP results. (7) Gain on sale of management contracts Included in other gains and losses, net in 2012 is a gain of $8.3 million ($5.8 million, net of tax) related to the sale of the management contracts for certain European collateralized loan obligation products (CLOs). To aid comparability of our results period to period, and aid comparability with peer companies that may not have similar disposition-related gains, this gain and the associated taxation have been excluded in arriving at the company's non-GAAP results. The company's tax income provision included a taxation charge of $2.5 million related to this gain. (8) Other reconciling items European infrastructure transformational initiative: As announced in 2011, the company is outsourcing its European transfer agency and is making certain structural changes to product and distribution platforms. Expenses incurred related to the European infrastructure activities are excluded in arriving at the non-GAAP financial information. For the year ended December 31, 2012, this adjustment includes $5.6 million (December 31, 2011: $7.6 million) in compensation expenses, primarily due to severance costs ; $7.3 million (December 31, 2011: $5.3 million) in general and administrative costs, primarily related to professional contractor services and mutual fund costs; $1.6 million (December 31, 2011: none)in marketing costs and $5.8 million (December 31, 2011: $5.9 million) of property and technology costs. The company's income tax provision included tax benefits related to these items of $3.8 million in the the year ended December 31, 2012 (December 31, 2011: $1.9 million). Included within other gains and losses, net during 2012 is a loss of $2.5 million related to the mark-to-market of four foreign exchange put option contracts, purchased in the second quarter 2012, intended to provide protection against the impact of a significant decline in the pound sterling/U.S. dollar foreign exchange rate. The cost to the company of these contracts was $2.5 million at their inception date, which represents the company's maximum exposure to loss from the contracts over the 12-month cumulative contract period, and contract maturity ranges from September 25, 2012 to June 25, 2013. The adjustment from U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP earnings for the year ended December 31, 2012 is a $0.8 million credit that removes the impact of market volatility; therefore, the company's non-GAAP results include only the amortization of the cost of the contracts during the contract period. The related non-GAAP adjustment to the company's income tax provision during 2012 is a charge of $0.2 million. Other gains and losses, net included a charge of $23.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2012 related to the call premiums on the redemption of the $333.5 million principal amount of 5.375% Senior Notes due February 27, 2013 and the $197.1 million principal amount of the 5.375% Senior Notes due December 15, 2014. The company's income tax provision included a taxation charge of $5.8 million related to the charge. Included within other gains and losses, net in the year ended December 31, 2011 is a credit of $45.0 million related to the settlement of litigation arising from the 2007 departure of certain investment professionals to a competitor. Included within general and administrative expenses are legal fees associated with this litigation of $3.6 million. The company's income tax provision included a taxation charge of $15.6 million related to the settlement credit, net of legal fees. Included within marketing expenses in the year ended December 31, 2011 is a credit of $10.4 million related to the termination of naming rights to the Denver Broncos stadium. The company's income tax provision included a taxation charge of $4.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 relating to the credit. Included within general and administrative expenses in the year ended December 31, 2010 was a charge of $15.3 million relating to a levy from the U.K. Financial Services Compensation Scheme.The company's tax provision included tax benefits of $4.3 million relating to this charge. An additional $0.4 million charge was recorded in the year ended December 31, 2011 reflecting revised estimates of the levy. The company's tax provision included tax benefits of $0.1 million relating to this revision. 52 Table of Contents Included within general and administrative expenses in the year ended December 31, 2010 is a charge of $8.9 million representing reimbursement costs from the correction of historical foreign exchange allocations in the fund accounting process that impacted the reporting of fund performance in certain funds. The company income tax provision includes tax benefits of $2.9 million relating to this charge. A $0.3 million credit was recorded in the year ended December 31, 2011 reflecting the final amount reimbursed, together with an associated $0.1 million tax charge. Management believes that the exclusion of these items, due to their unique character and magnitude, from net income provides useful information to investors, as this view is consistent with how management evaluates the performance of the business. Exclusion of these items will aid in comparability of our results from period to period and the comparability of our results with those of peer investment managers. Balance Sheet Discussion A summary of the balance sheet impact of consolidated investment products is presented below. The majority of the company consolidated investment products ("CIP") are CLO-related. The collateral assets of the CLOs are held solely to satisfy the obligations of the CLOs. The company has no right to the benefits from, nor does it bear the risks associated with, the collateral assets held by the CLOs, beyond the company minimal direct investments in, and management fees generated from, CLOs. If the company were to liquidate, the collateral assets would not be available to the general creditors of the company, and as a result, the company does not consider them to be company assets. Conversely, if the CLOs were to liquidate, their investors would have no recourse to the general credit of the company. The company therefore does not consider this debt to be a company liability.

See Cash Flows in the following section within this Management's Discussion and Analysis for additional discussion regarding the movements in cash flows during the periods. See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1 , Accounting Policies - Cash and Cash Equivalents, regarding requirements to mandate the retention of liquid resources in certain jurisdictions. Unsettled fund receivables and payables Unsettled fund receivables increased by $105.7 million from $444.4 million at December 31, 2011 to $550.1 million at December 31, 2012 , due primarily to higher transaction activity between funds and investors in late December 2012 when compared to late December 2011 in our offshore funds. In the company's capacity as sponsor of UITs, the company records receivables from brokers, dealers, and clearing organizations for unsettled sell trades of securities and UITs in addition to receivables from customers for unsettled sell trades of UITs. In our U.K. and offshore activities, unsettled fund receivables are created by the normal settlement periods on transactions initiated by certain clients. The presentation of the unsettled fund receivables and substantially offsetting 54 Table of Contents payables ( $552.5 million at December 31, 2012 up from $439.6 million at December 31, 2011 ) at trade date reflects the legal relationship between the underlying investor and the company. Investments (current and non-current) As of December 31, 2012 we had $610.7 million in investments, of which $363.9 million were current investments and $246.8 million were non-current investments. Included in current investments are $113.4 million of seed money investments in affiliated funds used to seed funds as we launch new products, and $213.5 million of investments related to assets held for deferred compensation plans, which are also held primarily in affiliated funds. Seed investments increased by $ 49.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2012 , due primarily due to seed purchases for our balanced-risk and various global strategy funds, offset by net disposals of seed money investments. Investments held to hedge deferred compensation awards increased by $ 29.1 million during the year, primarily due to additional investments in affiliated funds to hedge economically new employee plan awards. Included in non-current investments are $228.2 million in equity method investments in our Chinese joint ventures and in certain of the company private equity partnerships, real estate partnerships and other investments ( December 31, 2011 : $193.1 million). The increase of $ 35.1 million in equity method investments was primarily driven by an increase of $42.8 million due to capital calls in co-investments, including real estate investments of $28.7 million and private equity funds of $14.1 million, and an increase of $16.6 million due to earnings and valuation gains of partnership investments. The increases in partnership investments are offset by distributions and capital returns of $20.3 million during the period. The value of the joint venture investments has increased by $3.6 million during the period as a result of current year earnings of $14.1 million, $2.5 million in positive impact of foreign exchange rate movements, offset by dividends paid of $13.0 million. Assets held for policyholders and policyholder payables One of our subsidiaries, Invesco Perpetual Life Limited, is an insurance company that was established to facilitate retirement savings plans in the U.K. The entity holds assets that are managed for its clients on its balance sheet with an equal and offsetting liability. The decrease in the balance of these accounts from $1,243.5 million at December 31, 2011 , to $1,153.6 million at December 31, 2012 , was the result of foreign exchange movements and a third party transfer of administration contracts to another provider, offset by the increase in the market values of these assets and liabilities. Intangible assets, net Intangible assets reflect a net decrease of $35.1 million from $1,322.8 million at December 31, 2011 , to $1,287.7 million at December 31, 2012 . The decrease in intangible assets, net is due to amortization of $29.6 million, $3.0 million adjustment for the sale of CLO management contracts and foreign exchange movements of $2.5 million. Goodwill Goodwill increased from $6,907.9 million at December 31, 2011 , to $7,048.2 million at December 31, 2012 due to foreign exchange movements of $ 123.0 million and the final earn-out adjustments related to the 2006 acquisitions of W.L. Ross & Co. and Invesco PowerShares of $17.3 million . See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 7 , "Goodwill," for an analysis of the change in goodwill balances between periods. The company's annual goodwill impairment review is performed as of October 1 of each year. As a result of that analysis, the company determined that no impairment existed at that date. See Critical Accounting Policies - Goodwill for additional details of the company's goodwill impairment analysis process. Total debt In April 2012 the company repaid the $215.1 million of 5.625% Senior Notes that were recorded as current debt as of December 31, 2011. As at December 31, 2012 there is no current portion of total debt. The non-current portion of our total debt increased from $1,069.6 million at December 31, 2011 , to $1,186.0 million at December 31, 2012 , an increase of $116.4 million. During the fourth quarter of 2012 the company issued an initial aggregate principal amount of $600.0 million 3.125% Senior Notes that mature on November 30, 2022. The proceeds of this issuance were then partly used to redeem the $333.5 million principal amount of 5.375% Senior Notes scheduled to mature on February 27, 2013 and the $197.1 million principal amount of 5.375% Senior Notes scheduled to mature on December 15, 2014. During 2012 the company also made net borrowings on the credit facility of $47.5 million, increasing the outstanding balance as of December 31, 2012 to $586.5 million. These balances exclude any debt of consolidated investments products. 55 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Our capital structure, together with available cash balances, cash flows generated from operations, existing capacity under our credit facility and further capital market activities, if necessary, should provide us with sufficient resources to meet present and future cash needs, including operating, debt and other obligations as they come due and anticipated future capital requirements. We have reduced our leverage at December 31, 2012 , from a year ago, as illustrated by the change in our debt-to-equity ratios in the table below. Material changes in the company's capital structure over the last three years include: 2012: In April of 2012 the company repaid the $215.1 million 5.625% senior notes utilizing borrowing from the company's credit facility and existing cash on hand. In November, the company issued an initial aggregate principal amount of $600.0 million of 3.125% senior notes due in November 2022. The net proceeds from the issuance were used to repay the $333.5 million 5.375% note due February 2013 and $197.1 million 5.375% note due December of 2014. In December, the company exercised the make-whole call option of these two notes paying a premium of $23.0 million to retire the debt early. The remaining proceeds from the issuance were used for general corporate purposes. During 2012 , we repurchased 11.1 million common shares in open market transactions utilizing $265.0 million in cash under the company's board approved open market share repurchase program. 2011: During 2011, the company repurchased 18.8 million common shares for $436.5 million under the company's board approved open market share repurchase program. On June 3, 2011, the company amended and restated its three-year unsecured $1.25 billion credit agreement to, among other matters, provide for a term of five years. The amended and restated facility is now scheduled to expire on June 3, 2016 . 2010: During 2010, the company issued 30.9 million shares of new equity, in the form of common and non-voting common equivalent preferred shares (with economic rights identical to common stock, other than no right to vote such shares) to Morgan Stanley in conjunction with the close of the acquisition of Morgan Stanley's retail asset management business. (The shares were subsequently sold to unrelated third parties). We used a combination of existing cash balances and $650.0 million credit facility borrowing to satisfy the $770.0 million cash consideration related to the acquisition. The company also repurchased 9.4 million common shares for $192.2 million during the year under the company's board approved open market share repurchase program. Our capital management priorities have evolved with the growth and success of our business and include: Reinvestment in the business; Steady annual growth of dividends (as illustrated and further discussed in the "Dividends" section below); Share repurchase; and Establishment of an approximate $1 billion cash buffer in excess of regulatory requirements. These priorities are executed in a manner consistent with our desire to maintain a strong, investment-grade credit rating. As of the date of this Report, Invesco holds credit ratings of A-/Stable and A3/Stable from S&P and Moody's respectively. Furthermore, S&P considers our risk management to be strong. Standard & Poor's rates companies' enterprise risk management capabilities on a scale of Fair, Adequate, Strong, and Excellent. Our ability to continue to access the capital markets in a timely manner depends on a number of factors, including our credit ratings, the condition of the global economy, investors willingness to purchase our securities, interest rates, credit spreads and the valuation levels of equity markets. If we are unable to access capital markets in a timely manner, our business could be adversely impacted. See also Part I, Item 1A - "Risk Factors," for more detailed discussion on reliance on credit ratings. The consolidation of $4.2 billion and $4.0 billion of total assets and long-term debt of certain CLO products as of December 31, 2012 , respectively, did not impact the company liquidity and capital resources. The collateral assets of the CLOs are held solely to satisfy the obligations of the CLOs. The company has no right to the benefits from, nor does it bear the risks associated with, the collateral assets held by the CLOs, beyond the company minimal direct investments in, and management fees generated from, these products, which are eliminated upon consolidation. If the company were to liquidate, the collateral assets would not be available to the general creditors of the company, and as a result, the company does not consider them to be company assets. Conversely, if the CLOs were to liquidate, their investors would have no recourse to the general credit of the company. The company therefore does not consider this debt to be an obligation of the company. See Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 20 , Consolidated Investment Products, for additional details. See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1 , Accounting Policies - Cash and Cash Equivalents, regarding requirements to mandate the retention of liquid resources in certain jurisdictions. 56 Table of Contents Selected balance sheet information is reflected in the table below: Excluding Consolidated Investment Products (CIP)(Non-GAAP) (1) Including Consolidated Investment Products (CIP)(U.S. GAAP) December 31, 2012 December 31, 2011 December 31, 2010 December 31, 2012 December 31, 2011 December 31, 2010 $ in millions Cash and cash equivalents 835.5 727.4 740.5 835.5 727.4 740.5 Investments of CIP 4,550.6 6,629.0 7,206.0 Total assets (1) 12,640.9 12,329.2 12,505.1 17,492.4 19,347.0 20,444.1 Current maturities of total debt 215.1 215.1 Long-term debt 1,186.0 1,069.6 1,315.7 1,186.0 1,069.6 1,315.7 Long-term debt of CIP 3,899.4 5,512.9 5,865.4 Total debt / Total debt plus CIP debt 1,186.0 1,284.7 1,315.7 5,085.4 6,797.6 7,181.1 Total liabilities (1) 4,448.6 4,541.0 4,731.2 8,443.4 10,209.4 11,083.2 Total equity (1) 8,192.3 7,788.2 7,773.9 9,049.0 9,137.6 9,360.9 Debt/Equity % (1) (2) 14.5 % 16.5 % 16.9 % 56.2 % 74.4 % 76.7 % ____________ (1) The balance sheet line items excluding consolidated investment products are non-GAAP financial measures. To calculate total assets excluding CIP at December 31, 2012, use U.S. GAAP total assets of $17,492.4 million (2011: $19,347.0 million ; 2010: $20,444.1 million ) and subtract total assets of CIP of $4,851.5 million (2011: $7,017.8 million ; 2010: $7,939.0 million). To calculate total liabilities excluding CIP at December 31, 2012, use U.S. GAAP total liabilities of $8,443.4 million (2011: $10,209.4 million ; 2010: $11,083.2 million ) and subtract total liabilities of CIP of $3,994.8 million (2011: $5,668.4 million ; 2010: $6,352.0 million). To calculate total equity excluding CIP at December 31, 2012, use U.S. GAAP total equity of $9,049.0 million (2011: $9,137.6 million ; 2010: $9,360.9 million ) and subtract total equity of CIP of $856.7 million (2011: $1,349.4 million ; 2010: $1,587.0 million). See the "Balance Sheet Discussion" section for a fully expanded balance sheet illustrating the impact of consolidation of investment products for 2012 and 2011. (2) The debt-to-equity ratio excluding CIP is a non-GAAP financial measure. The debt-to-equity ratio is calculated as total debt divided by total equity for the balance sheet excluding CIP and total debt plus long-term debt of CIP divided by equity for the balance sheet including CIP. Management believes that it is important to illustrate for users of our financial statements that calculating a balance sheet measure, such as the debt-to-equity ratio, including the impact of CIP causes the company to appear far more indebted than is the case. As disclosed above, the debt of CIP is not the company's debt, nor do the noteholders of the CIP debt have any recourse to the company. Cash Flows Discussion The ability to consistently generate cash from operations in excess of capital expenditures and dividend payments is one of our company's fundamental financial strengths. Operations continue to be financed from current earnings and borrowings. Our principal uses of cash, other than for operating expenses, include dividend payments, capital expenditures, acquisitions, purchase of our shares in the open market and investments in certain new investment products. Cash flows of consolidated investment products (discussed in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 20 , Consolidated Investment Products ) are reflected in Invesco's cash provided by or used in operating activities, investing activities and financing activities. Cash held by consolidated investment products is not available for general use by Invesco, nor is Invesco cash available for general use by its consolidated investment products. Accordingly, the table below presents the consolidated total cash flows of the company and separately presents the impact to the cash flows from the consolidation of investment products. The cash flows of consolidated investment products do not form part of the company cash flow management processes, nor do they form part of the company significant liquidity evaluations and decisions for the reasons noted. The discussion that follows the table focuses on the company cash flows. 57 Table of Contents Summary of Cash Flow Statement Impact of Consolidated Investment Products December 31, 2012 December 31, 2011 December 31, 2010 $ in millions Impact of Consolidated Investment Products Invesco Ltd.

Although some receipts and payments are seasonal, particularly bonus payments, in general, after allowing for the change in cash held by consolidated investment products, our operating cash flows move in the same direction as our operating income. During 2012 , cash provided by operating activities decreased $145.5 million to $819.3 million from $964.8 million in 2011 . As shown in the tables above, the impact of consolidated investment products to cash provided by operating activities was $52.8 million of cash used during 2012 compared to $162.0 million of cash generated during 2011 . The sum of the operating, investing and financing cash flows of consolidated investment products offsets to a zero impact to the company's change in cash and cash equivalent balances from period to period. Excluding the impact of consolidated investment products, cash generated by operations was $872.1 million in 2012 compared to $802.8 million in 2011 . The $872.1 million of cash provided by operations in 2012 included net purchases of trading investments of $7.2 million and the use of $388.3 million of cash to pay the annual staff bonuses, related payroll taxes, payroll taxes on annual share award vesting, and annual pension contributions. Similarly the $802.8 million of cash provided by operations in 2011 included net purchases of trading investments of $11.0 million and the use of $383.1 million of cash to pay the annual staff bonuses, related payroll taxes, payroll taxes on annual share award vesting, and annual pension contributions. The $69.3 million increase in cash provided by operations in 2012 when compared to 2011 is attributable to changes in operating assets and liabilities, principally the realization in 2012 of receivable balances into cash that are above the level experienced in 2011. This includes the realization into cash in 2012 of a $45.0 million litigation related receivable recorded in the December 31, 2011 balance sheet. Excluding the net purchase of trading investments and the impact of consolidated investment products, cash generated from other operating activities in 2011 improved by $152.2 million from $661.6 million in 2010 to $813.8 million in 2011. This reflects improved operating income together with the timing differences on staff bonus and other staff compensation related payments. The acquisition also had an impact on the 2011 to 2010 comparison, as 2011 included a full year of the acquired business while 2010 included the acquisition from June 1 forward. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities totaled $82.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 ( 2011 : net cash generated $348.1 million ). As shown in the tables above, the impact of consolidated investment products on investing activities, including investment purchases, sales and returns of capital, was $77.3 million contributed ( 2011 : $486.5 million contributed ). Excluding the impact of consolidated investment product cash flows, net cash used in investing activities was $159.7 million ( 2011 : net cash used of $138.4 million ). During the year ended December 31, 2012 , excluding the impact of consolidated investment products, the company purchased available-for-sale investments and other investments of $224.2 million ( 2011 : $181.8 million ) and had capital expenditures of $99.3 million ( 2011 : $107.0 million ). These cash outflows were partly offset from collected proceeds of $184.0 million from sales and returns of capital of investments, excluding the impact of consolidated investment products ( 2011 : $169.5 million ). Our capital expenditures related principally in each year to technology initiatives, including enhancements to platforms from which we maintain our portfolio management systems and fund accounting systems, improvements in computer hardware and software desktop products for employees, new telecommunications products to enhance our internal information flow, and back-up disaster recovery systems. Also, in each year, a portion of these costs related to leasehold improvements made to the various buildings and workspaces used in our offices. These projects have been funded with proceeds from our operating cash flows. During the year ended December 31, 2012 , business acquisition related payments were $37.2 million , compared to $31.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2011 . The 2012 payments related to the final earn-out arrangements from the 2006 acquisitions of W.L. Ross & Co. and Invesco Powershares. The sale of CLO management contracts contributed $16.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2012 . Net cash provided by investing activities totaled $348.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 (2010: net cash used of $337.8 million). As shown in the tables above, consolidated investment products, including investment purchases, sales and returns of capital, contributed $ 486.5 million (2010: $502.2 million contributed). Excluding these consolidated investment product cash flows, net cash used in investing activities was $138.4 million (2010: net cash used of $840.0 million). Investing activities in 2010 included acquisition related payments totaling $775.9 million, as compared to 2011, which reflected acquisition payments totaling $31.7 million. 59 Table of Contents In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2011 , excluding the impact of consolidated investment products, the company purchased available-for-sale investments and other investments of $181.8 million ( 2010 : $109.1 million) and had capital expenditures of $107.0 million ( 2010 : $89.6 million). These cash outflows were partly offset from collected proceeds of $169.5 million from sales and returns of capital of investments in 2011 ( 2010 : $134.6 million), excluding the impact of consolidated investment products. The increase in capital expenditure cash outflows in 2011 when compared to 2010 was primarily related to technology and computer hardware needed for the acquired business. During the years ended December 31 , 2012, 2011 and 2010 , our capital divestitures were not significant relative to our total fixed assets. Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities totaled $645.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 ( 2011 : $1,322.1 million ). As shown in the tables above, the impact of consolidated investment products on financing activities used cash of $24.5 million during the year ( 2011 : $648.5 million ). Excluding the impact of the consolidated investment products, financing activities used cash of $621.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2012 ( 2011 : cash used of $673.6 million ). Financing cash outflows during the year ended December 31, 2012 included $289.0 million of dividend payments for the dividends declared in January, April, July and November 2012 ( 2011 : dividends paid of $220.9 million ) and the purchase of treasury shares through market transactions totaling $265.0 million ( 2011 : $436.5 million ). Financing cash inflows during 2012 included net cash borrowings of $47.5 million ( 2011 : repayment, $31.0 million ) on the company's credit facility bringing the balance to $586.5 million as of December 31, 2012 , cash received from the exercise of options of $23.0 million ( 2011 : $12.4 million ) and excess tax benefits cash inflows from share-based compensation of $12.7 million ( 2011 : $14.7 million ). Other financing cash flows during the year ended December 31, 2012 included the repayment of the $215.1 million 5.625% senior notes utilizing borrowing from the company's credit facility and existing cash on hand. In addition, the company issued an initial aggregate principal amount of $600 million of 3.125% senior notes due November 2022. The net proceeds from the issuance were used to repay the $333.5 million 5.375% note due February 2013 and $197.1 million 5.375% note due December of 2014. Net cash used in financing activities totaled $1,322.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 (2010: $65.9 million). As shown in the tables above, the financing activities of the consolidated investment products used cash of $648.5 million during the year (2010: $280.2 million). Excluding the impact of the consolidated investment products, financing activities used cash of $673.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2011 (2010: cash provided $214.3 million). Other financing cash flows during the year ended December 31, 2011 included $220.9 million of dividend payments for the dividends declared in January, April, July and October 2011 ( 2010 : dividends paid of $197.9 million), the purchase of treasury shares through market transactions totaling $436.5 million ( 2010 : $192.2 million), cash inflows from the exercise of options of $12.4 million ( 2010 : $19.6 million), and excess tax benefits cash inflows from share-based compensation of $14.7 million ( 2010 : $14.8 million). In addition, to provide the cash funding needed to complete the business acquisition in late May 2010, $650.0 million was borrowed from the company's $1,250.0 million credit facility. The balance on the facility at December 31, 2010 was $570.0 million as $80.0 million of cash generated from operating activities was utilized to partially repay the initial amount borrowed. Dividends Invesco declares and pays dividends on a quarterly basis in arrears. The 2012 quarterly dividend was $0.1725 per Invesco Ltd. common share. On January 31, 2013 , the company declared a fourth quarter 2012 cash dividend, which will be paid on March 8, 2013 , to shareholders of record as of February 21, 2013 . The total dividend attributable to the 2012 fiscal year of $0.69 per share represented an 40.8% increase over the total dividend attributable to the 2011 fiscal year of $0.49 per share. The declaration, payment and amount of any future dividends will be declared by our board of directors and will depend upon, among other factors, our earnings, financial condition and capital requirements at the time such declaration and payment are considered. The board has a policy of managing dividends in a prudent fashion, with due consideration given to profit levels, overall debt levels, and historical dividend payouts. 60 Table of Contents Share Repurchase Plan On April 23, 2008, the board of directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to $1.5 billion with no stated expiration date. During the year ended December 31, 2012 , the company repurchased 11.1 million shares in the market at a cost of $265.0 million (three months ended December 31, 2012 : 3.0 million shares at a cost of $75.0 million ; year ended December 31, 2011 : 18.8 million shares at a cost of $436.5 million ). Separately, an aggregate of 2.1 million shares were withheld on vesting events during the year ended December 31, 2012 to meet employees' withholding tax obligations ( December 31, 2011 : 3.1 million ). The fair value of these shares withheld at the respective withholding dates was $48.9 million ( December 31, 2011 : $76.6 million ). Approximately $467 million remained authorized under the company's share repurchase plan at December 31, 2012 ( December 31, 2011 : $732 million ). Debt Our total indebtedness at December 31, 2012 was $ 1,186.0 million ( December 31, 2011 : $ 1,284.7 million ) and was comprised of the following: $ in millions December 31, 2012 December 31, 2011 Unsecured Senior Notes: 5.625% - due April 17, 2012 215.1 5.375% - due February 27, 2013 333.5 5.375% - due December 15, 2014 197.1 3.125% - due November 30, 2022 599.5 Floating rate credit facility expiring June 3, 2016 586.5 539.0 Total debt 1,186.0 1,284.7 Less: current maturities of total debt (215.1 ) Long-term debt 1,186.0 1,069.6 For the year ended December 31, 2012 , the company's weighted average cost of debt was 3.16% (year ended December 31, 2011 : 3.50% ). Total debt decreased from $1,284.7 million at December 31, 2011 , to $ 1,186.0 million at December 31, 2012 . During the second quarter of 2012, the company redeemed the $215.1 million principal amount of 5.625% Senior Notes due April 17, 2012. During the fourth quarter of 2012, the company issued an initial aggregate principal amount of $600.0 million of 3.125% senior notes with a maturity of November 30, 2022. The proceeds from the new debt were used to redeem the $333.5 million principal amount of 5.375% Senior Notes due February 27, 2013 and the $197.1 million principal amount of the 5.375% Senior Notes due December 15, 2014. On May 24, 2010, the company terminated its $500.0 million credit facility and entered into a new $1.25 billion credit facility maturing on May 23, 2013. On June 3, 2011, the company amended and restated its unsecured $1.25 billion credit agreement to, among other matters, provide for a term of five years. The amended and restated facility is now scheduled to expire on June 3, 2016. Financial covenants under the credit agreement include: (i) the quarterly maintenance of a debt/EBITDA leverage ratio, as defined in the credit agreement, of not greater than 3.25:1.00 through June 30, 2014 , and not greater than 3.00:1.00 thereafter, (ii) a coverage ratio (EBITDA, as defined in the credit agreement/interest payable for the four consecutive fiscal quarters ended before the date of determination) of not less than 4.00:1.00. As of December 31, 2012 , we were in compliance with our financial covenants. At December 31, 2012 , our leverage ratio was 0.99 :1.00 ( December 31, 2011 : 1.01:1.00), and our interest coverage ratio was 23.61 :1.00 ( December 31, 2011 : 20.93:1.00). The coverage ratios, as defined in our credit facility, were as follows during 2012 and 2011 : 2012 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Leverage Ratio 1.03 1.08 1.04 0.99 Interest Coverage Ratio 22.06 22.61 23.86 23.61 2011 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Leverage Ratio 1.27 1.33 1.13 1.01 Interest Coverage Ratio 17.35 18.89 19.78 20.93 61 Table of Contents The December 31, 2012 , coverage ratio calculations are as follows: Q4 Q3 Q2 Q1 $ millions Total 2012 2012 2012 2012 Net income attributable to common shareholders 677.1 158.7 170.6 153.9 193.9 Net income/(loss) attributable to Consolidated Investment Products 10.7 (2.4 ) 11.1 6.2 (4.2 ) Tax expense 272.2 62.1 74.2 62.3 73.6 Amortization/depreciation 95.0 22.5 21.6 26.6 24.3 Interest expense 52.3 12.7 12.6 13.4 13.6 Share-based compensation expense 136.4 33.5 35.9 37.0 30.0 Unrealized gains and losses from investments, net* (9.1 ) (0.2 ) (6.3 ) 4.5 (7.1 ) EBITDA** 1,234.6 286.9 319.7 303.9 324.1 Adjusted debt** $1,221.5 Leverage ratio (Debt/EBITDA - maximum 3.25:1.00) 0.99 Interest coverage (EBITDA/Interest Expense - minimum 4.00:1.00) 23.61 ____________ * Adjustments for unrealized gains and losses from investments, as defined in our credit facility, include non-cash gains and losses on investments to the extent that they do not represent anticipated future cash receipts or expenditures. ** EBITDA and Adjusted debt are non-GAAP financial measures; however management does not use these measures for anything other than these debt covenant calculations. The calculation of EBITDA above (a reconciliation from net income attributable to common shareholders) is defined by our credit agreement, and therefore net income attributable to common shareholders is the most appropriate GAAP measure from which to reconcile to EBITDA. The calculation of adjusted debt is defined in our credit facility and equals total debt of $1,186.0 million plus $35.5 million in letters of credit. The discussion that follows identifies risks associated with the company's liquidity and capital resources. The Executive Overview of this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains a broader discussion of the company's overall approach to risk management. Credit and Liquidity Risk Capital management involves the management of the company's liquidity and cash flows. The company manages its capital by reviewing annual and projected cash flow forecasts and by monitoring credit, liquidity and market risks, such as interest rate and foreign currency risks (as discussed in Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk ), through measurement and analysis. The company is primarily exposed to credit risk through its cash and cash equivalent deposits, which are held by external firms. The company invests its cash balances in its own institutional money market products, as well as with external high credit-quality financial institutions; however, we have chosen to limit the number of firms with which we invest. These arrangements create exposure to concentrations of credit risk. Credit Risk Credit risk is the risk that one party to a financial instrument will cause a financial loss for the other party by failing to discharge an obligation. The company is subject to credit risk in the following areas of its business: All cash and cash equivalent balances are subject to credit risk, as they represent deposits made by the company with external banks and other institutions. As of December 31, 2012 , our maximum exposure to credit risk related to our cash and cash equivalent balances is $835.5 million . See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 21 , Related Parties, for information regarding cash and cash equivalents invested in affiliated money market funds. Certain trust subsidiaries of the company accept deposits and place deposits with other institutions on behalf of our customers. As of December 31, 2012 , our exposure to credit risk related to these transactions is $3.1 million . The company does not utilize credit derivatives or similar instruments to mitigate the maximum exposure to credit risk. The company does not expect any counterparties to its financial instruments to fail to meet their obligations. 62 Table of Contents Liquidity Risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the company will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with its financial liabilities. The company is exposed to liquidity risk through its $1,186.0 million in total debt. The company actively manages liquidity risk by preparing cash flow forecasts for future periods, reviewing them regularly with senior management, maintaining a committed credit facility, scheduling significant gaps between major debt maturities and engaging external financing sources in regular dialog. Effects of Inflation Inflation can impact our organization primarily in two ways. First, inflationary pressures can result in increases in our cost structure, especially to the extent that large expense components such as compensation are impacted. To the degree that these expense increases are not recoverable or cannot be counterbalanced through pricing increases due to the competitive environment, our profitability could be negatively impacted. Secondly, the value of the assets that we manage may be negatively impacted when inflationary expectations result in a rising interest rate environment. Declines in the values of these AUM could lead to reduced revenues as management fees are generally calculated based upon the size of AUM. Off Balance Sheet Commitments See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 19 , Commitments and Contingencies - Off Balance Sheet Commitments, for more information regarding undrawn capital commitments and support agreements. Contractual Obligations We have various financial obligations that require future cash payments. The following table outlines the timing of payment requirements related to our commitments as of December 31, 2012 : $ in millions Total (5)(6) Within 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More Than 5 Years Total debt (1) 1,186.0 586.5 599.5 Estimated interest payments on total debt (1) 187.6 18.8 37.5 37.5 93.8 Operating leases (2) 571.5 68.5 134.5 110.2 258.3 Defined benefit pension and postretirement medical obligations (3) 130.9 10.6 24.2 26.5 69.6 Purchase obligations (4) 114.7 57.2 16.7 3.5 37.3 Total 2,190.7 155.1 212.9 764.2 1,058.5 ____________ (1) Total debt includes $ 599.5 million of fixed rate debt. Fixed interest payments are reflected in the table above in the periods they are due, and include any issuance discounts. The credit facility, $586.5 million outstanding at December 31, 2012 , provides for borrowings of various maturities. Interest is payable based upon LIBOR, Prime, Federal Funds or other bank-provided rates in existence at the time of each borrowing. As these payments are variable and based on fluctuating market conditions, they are not included in the table above. The table above includes the company's debt. Debt of consolidated investment products is excluded from the table above, as the company is not obligated for these amounts. See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data -Note 20 , Consolidated Investment Products," for additional information. (2) Operating leases reflect obligations for leased building space and other assets. See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 14 , Operating Leases for sublease information. (3) Expected future contributions to defined benefit plans of $ 130.9 million are estimated for the next five years, and are comprised of $ 102.4 million related to pension plans and $ 28.5 million related to a postretirement medical plan. See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 13 , Retirement Benefit Plans for detailed benefit pension and postretirement plan information. The company has various other compensation and benefit obligations, including bonuses, commissions and incentive payments payable, defined contribution plan matching contribution obligations, and deferred compensation arrangements, that are excluded from the table above. 63 Table of Contents (4) In the ordinary course of business, Invesco enters into contracts or purchase obligations with third parties whereby the third parties provide services to or on behalf of Invesco. Purchase obligations included in the contractual obligations table above represent fixed-price contracts, which are either non-cancelable or cancelable with a penalty. At December 31, 2012 , the company's obligations primarily reflected standard service contracts for portfolio, market data, office-related services and third-party marketing and promotional services. In addition, the company is a party to certain variable-price contractual arrangements (eg. contingent future payments based on AUM levels, number of accounts, transaction volume, etc.) for which the company is reimbursed by affiliated funds and as such are not included in the table above. Purchase obligations are recorded as liabilities in the company's financial statements when services are provided. (5) The company has capital commitments into co-invested funds that are to be drawn down over the life of the partnership as investment opportunities are identified. At December 31, 2012 , the company's undrawn capital and purchase commitments were $209.3 million . These are not included in the above table. See Note 19 , Commitments and Contingencies for additional details. (6) Due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2012 , the company is unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities. Therefore, $22.6 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 16 - Taxation for a discussion on income taxes. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our significant accounting policies are disclosed in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1 , Accounting Policies to our Consolidated Financial Statements. The accounting policies and estimates that we believe are the most critical to an understanding of our results of operations and financial condition are those that require complex management judgment regarding matters that are highly uncertain at the time policies were applied and estimates were made. These accounting policies and estimates are discussed below; however, the additional accounting policy detail in the footnote previously referenced is important to the discussion of each of the topics. Different estimates reasonably could have been used in the current period that would have had a material effect on these financial statements, and changes in these estimates are likely to occur from period-to-period in the future. Taxation. We operate in several countries and several states through our various subsidiaries, and must allocate our income, expenses, and earnings under the various laws and regulations of each of these taxing jurisdictions. Accordingly, our provision for income taxes represents our total estimate of the liability that we have incurred for doing business each year in all of our locations. Annually we file tax returns that represent our filing positions within each jurisdiction and settle our return liabilities. Each jurisdiction has the right to audit those returns and may take different positions with respect to income and expense allocations and taxable earnings determinations. Because the determinations of our annual provisions are subject to judgments and estimates, it is possible that actual results will vary from those recognized in our financial statements. As a result, it is likely that additions to, or reductions of, income tax expense will occur each year for prior reporting periods as actual tax returns and tax audits are settled. Net deferred tax assets have been recognized based on management's belief that taxable income of the appropriate character, more likely than not, will be sufficient to realize the benefits of these assets over time. In the event that actual results differ from our expectations, or if our historical trends of positive operating income changes, we may be required to record a valuation allowance on some or all of these deferred tax assets, which may have a significant effect on our financial condition and results of operations. The company utilizes a specific recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The prescribed two-step process for evaluating a tax position involves first determining whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing authorities. If it is, the second step then requires a company to measure this tax position benefit as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The company recognizes any interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits on the Consolidated Statements of Income as components of income tax expense. Goodwill. Our goodwill impairment testing conducted during 2012 and 2011 indicated that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value, indicating that step two of the goodwill impairment test was not necessary; however, the company cannot predict the occurrence of future events that might adversely affect the reported value of goodwill that totaled $7,048.2 million and $6,907.9 million at December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011 , respectively. Such events include, but are not limited to, strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions, the impact of the economic environment on the company's AUM, or any other material negative change in AUM and related management fees. 64 Table of Contents The October 1, 2012 annual goodwill impairment test was performed using a consistent methodology to that used for the 2011 annual impairment test, with assumptions updated for current market conditions, including the company's updated forecasts for changes in AUM due to market gains and long-term net flows and the corresponding changes in revenue and expenses. Market gains are based upon historical returns of the S&P 500 index, treasury bond returns and treasury bill returns, as applicable to the company's AUM mix on the testing date. The most sensitive of these assumptions are the estimated cash flows and the use of a weighted average cost of capital as the discount rate to determine present value. The most significant change in assumptions from 2011 related to a decrease in the market risk premium, which resulted in a discount rate of 14.4% for the October 1, 2012 analysis (2011: 16.0%). The discount rates used are estimates of the weighted average cost of capital for the investment management sector reflecting the overall industry risks associated with future cash flows and have been calculated consistently across the various tests dates. A 45% decline in fair value or more than a 650 basis point increase in the discount rate assumption used during our October 1, 2012 goodwill impairment analysis would be required to cause the carrying value of the reporting unit to be in excess of the fair value, thus triggering step two of the goodwill impairment test. The second step could have resulted in an impairment loss for goodwill. While the company believes all assumptions utilized in our assessment are reasonable and appropriate, changes in these estimates could produce different fair value amounts and therefore different goodwill impairment assessments. Intangible Assets. Where evidence exists that the underlying arrangements have a high likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost to the company, the intangible asset is assigned an indefinite life and reviewed for impairment on an annual basis. Definite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable (i.e. the carrying amount exceeds the sum of the fair value of the intangible). In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period over which definite-lived intangible assets will contribute to the company's cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets, or the reclassification of an indefinite-lived intangible asset to a definite-lived intangible asset, could have a significant impact on the company's amortization expense, which was $29.6 million , $42.2 million and $30.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively. Intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested for impairment annually as of October 1 or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. The impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of an intangible asset with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. Fair value is generally determined using an income approach where estimated future cash flows are discounted to arrive at a single present value amount. The income approach includes inputs that require significant management judgment, including AUM growth rates, product mix, effective fee rates, pre-tax profit margins, effective tax rates and discount rates. The most relevant of these assumptions to the determination of the estimated fair value are the AUM growth rate and discount rate. Changes in these estimates could produce different fair value amounts and therefore different impairment conclusions. In 2012 and 2011 , annual impairment reviews of indefinite-lived intangible assets determined that no impairment existed at the respective review dates, the classifications of indefinite-lived and definite-lived remain appropriate and no changes to the expected lives of the definite-lived intangible assets were required. Investments. Most of our investments are carried at fair value on our balance sheet with the periodic mark-to-market recorded either in accumulated other comprehensive income in the case of available-for-sale investments or directly to earnings in the case of trading assets. Since assumptions are made in determining the fair values of investments for which active markets do not exist, the actual value that may be realized upon the sale or other disposition of these investments could differ from the current carrying values. Fair value calculations are also required in association with our quarterly impairment testing of investments. The accuracy of our other-than-temporary impairment assessments is dependent upon the extent to which we are able to accurately determine fair values. Of our $610.7 million in total investments at December 31, 2012 , those most susceptible to impairment include $113.4 million of seed money investments in our affiliated funds. Seed money investments are held in Invesco managed funds with the purpose of providing capital to the funds during their development periods. These investments are recorded at fair value using quoted market prices in active markets; there is no modeling or additional information needed to arrive at the fair values of these investments. The value of investments may decline for various reasons. The market price may be affected by general market conditions which reflect prospects for the economy as a whole or by specific information pertaining to an industry or individual company. Such declines require further investigation by management, which considers all available evidence to evaluate the realizable value of the investment, including, but not limited to, the following factors: The probability that the company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of a debt security not impaired at acquisition; The length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than cost; The financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, including any specific events which may influence the operations of the issuer; 65 Table of Contents The intent and ability of the company to retain its investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value; The decline in the security's value due to an increase in market interest rates or a change in foreign exchange rates since acquisition; Determination that the security is not realizable; or An adverse change in estimated cash flows of a beneficial interest. Our other-than-temporary impairment analysis of seed money holdings includes a review of the market returns required for each fund portfolio to enable us to recover our original investment. As part of the review, we analyze several scenarios to project the anticipated recovery period of our original investments based on one-, three-, and five-year historical index returns and historical trends in the equity markets. We also analyze the absolute amount of any loss to date, the trend of the losses, and percent declines in values of the seed money investments. Along with intent and ability to hold, all of these scenarios are considered as part of our other-than-temporary impairment analysis of seed money holdings. Consolidated Investment Products. Assessing if an entity is a variable interest entity (VIE) or voting interest entity (VOE) involves judgment and analysis on a structure-by-structure basis. Factors included in this assessment include the legal organization of the entity, the company's contractual involvement with the entity and any related party or de facto agent implications of the company's involvement with the entity. Generally, limited partnership entities where the general partner does not have substantive equity investment at risk and where the other limited partners do not have substantive (greater than 50%) rights to remove the general partner or to dissolve the limited partnership are VIEs. Determining if the company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE also requires significant judgment, as the calculation of expected losses and residual returns (for investment products other than CLOs) involves estimation and probability assumptions. For CLOs, there is judgment involved to assess if the company has the power to direct the activities that most significantly effect the CLOs economic results and to assess if the company's interests could be deemed significant. If current financial statements are not available for consolidated VIEs or VOEs, estimation of investment valuation is required, which includes assessing available quantitative and qualitative data. Significant changes in these estimates could impact the reported value of the investments held by consolidated investment products and the related offsetting equity attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and the other gains and losses of consolidated investment products, net, and related offsetting gains and losses attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities, net, amounts on the Consolidated Statements of Income. As of December 31, 2012 the company consolidated VIEs that held investments of $3,983.9 million ( December 31, 2011 : $5,725.1 million ) and VOE fund investments of $607.9 million ( December 31, 2011 : $903.8 million ). As circumstances supporting estimates and factors change, the determination of VIE and primary beneficiary status may change, as could the determination of the necessity of consolidation of VOEs. Contingencies. Contingencies arise when we have a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event that is both probable and reasonably estimable. We must from time to time make material estimates with respect to legal and other contingencies. The nature of our business requires compliance with various state and federal or national statutes, as well as various contractual obligations, and exposes us to a variety of legal proceedings and matters in the ordinary course of business. While the outcomes of matters such as these are inherently uncertain and difficult to predict, we maintain reserves reflected in other current and other non-current liabilities, as appropriate, for identified losses that are, in our judgment, probable and reasonably estimable. Management's judgment is based on the advice of legal counsel, ruling on various motions by the applicable court, review of the outcome of similar matters, if applicable, and review of guidance from state or federal agencies, if applicable. Contingent consideration payable in relation to a business acquisition is recorded as of the acquisition date as part of the fair value transferred in exchange for the acquired business.
