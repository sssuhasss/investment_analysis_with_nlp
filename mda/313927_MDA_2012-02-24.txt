ITEM 7 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with the Company consolidated financial statements. OVERVIEW The Company develops, manufactures markets and sells a broad range of consumer and specialty products. It recognizes revenues and profits from selling its products under a variety of brands to supermarkets, drug stores and mass merchandisers that sell the products to consumers. The Company also sells its products to industrial customers and distributors. The Company focuses its marketing efforts principally on its eight power brands. These well-recognized brand names include ARM & HAMMER, (used in multiple product categories such as baking soda, carpet deodorization and laundry detergent), TROJAN condoms, XTRA laundry detergent, OXICLEAN pre-wash laundry additive, NAIR depilatories, FIRST RESPONSE home pregnancy and ovulation test kits, ORAJEL oral analgesics and SPINBRUSH battery-operated toothbrushes. The Company business is divided into three primary segments, Consumer Domestic, Consumer International and Specialty Products. The Consumer Domestic segment includes the eight power brands and other household and personal care products such as SCRUB FREE, KABOOM and ORANGE GLO cleaning products, FELINE PINE Cat Litter, ANSWER home pregnancy and ovulation test kits, ARRID antiperspirant, CLOSE-UP and AIM toothpastes and SIMPLY SALINE Nasal Saline Moisturizer. The Consumer International segment primarily sells a variety of personal care products, some of which use the same brand names as our domestic product lines, in international markets, including Canada, France, Australia, the United Kingdom, Mexico, Brazil and China. The Specialty Products segment is the largest U.S. producer of sodium bicarbonate, which it sells together with other specialty inorganic chemicals for a variety of industrial, institutional, medical and food applications. This segment also sells a range of animal nutrition and specialty cleaning products. In 2011, the Consumer Domestic, Consumer International and Specialty Products segments represented approximately 72%, 19% and 9%, respectively, of the Company net sales. Economic Conditions As has been the case for the past few years, uncertainty about global economic conditions has affected demand for many products. Specific factors affecting demand include rates of unemployment, consumer confidence, health care costs, fuel and other energy costs and other economic factors that affect consumer spending behavior. While the Company products generally are consumer staples that should be less vulnerable to decreases in discretionary spending than other products, the Company products have become subject to increasing price competition as recessionary conditions continue. Moreover, some of our products, such as laundry additives and battery-operated toothbrushes, are more likely to be affected by consumer decisions to control spending. Some of our customers, including mass merchandisers, supermarkets, drugstores, convenience stores, wholesale clubs, pet specialty stores and dollar stores have experienced declining financial performance, which could affect their ability to pay amounts due to us on a timely basis or at all. In response, we continue to regularly conduct a review of the financial strength of our key customers. As appropriate, we modify customer credit limits, which may have an adverse impact on future sales. We also continue to regularly conduct a similar review of our suppliers to assess both their financial viability and the importance of their products to our operations. Where appropriate, we will seek to identify alternate sources of materials and services. To date, we have not experienced a material adverse impact from economic conditions affecting our customers or suppliers. However, a continued economic decline that adversely affects our suppliers and customers could adversely affect our operations and sales. In addition, many of our customers sell products under their own private label brands that compete with products that we sell. As consumers look for opportunities to decrease discretionary spending during current 30 Table of Contents difficult economic times, some of our customers have discontinued or reduce distribution of our products to encourage those consumers to purchase our customers less expensive private label products. To offset any adverse effect on our business that results when customers discontinue or reduce distribution of our products or take actions to increase shelf space for their private label products, we focus our efforts on improving distribution with other customers. While these efforts have generally been effective, our results could be adversely affected if these efforts are not effective. Commodity Prices Following raw material price increases in 2010, prices for commodities continued to increase in 2011. As a result, the cost of surfactants, diesel fuel, corrugated paper and oil-based raw and packaging materials used in the household and specialty products businesses were all higher on average in 2011 than 2010. Additional increases in the prices of certain raw materials could materially impact the Company costs and financial results if the Company is unable to pass such costs along in the form of price increases to its customers. Recent Developments New Manufacturing Facility During the first quarter of 2011, the Company announced its decision to relocate a portion of its Green River, Wyoming operations to a newly leased site in Victorville, California in the first half of 2012. Specifically, the Company will be relocating its cat litter manufacturing operations and distribution center to this southern California site to be closer to transportation hubs and its West Coast customers. The site will also produce liquid laundry detergent products and is expandable to meet future business needs. The Company sodium bicarbonate operations and other consumer product manufacturing will remain at the Green River facility. The Company invested approximately $11 million in the Victorville site in 2011. The Company anticipates that, in connection with the opening of the Victorville site and changes anticipated at the Green River facility, its total capital expenditures will be approximately $35 million and it will incur approximately $7 million in transition expenses. The transition expenses include anticipated severance costs and accelerated depreciation of equipment at the Company Green River facility and one-time project expenses. The Company has recorded approximately $3.6 million in transition expenses in 2011. These expenditures are recorded in the Consumer Domestic segment. Two-for-one stock split On June 1, 2011, the Company effected a two-for-one stock split of the Company Common Stock in the form of a 100% stock dividend. All applicable amounts in the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock split. BATISTE Acquisition On June 28, 2011, the Company acquired the BATISTE dry shampoo brand from Vivalis, Limited ( BATISTE Acquisition ) for cash consideration of $64.8 million. The Company paid for the acquisition from available cash. BATISTE annual sales are approximately $20.0 million. The BATISTE brand is managed principally within the Consumer International segment. New Corporate Office Building On July 20, 2011, the Company entered into a 20 year lease for a new corporate headquarters building that will be constructed in Ewing, New Jersey (approximately 10 miles from the Company existing corporate headquarters in Princeton, New Jersey) to meet office space needs for the foreseeable future. Based on current 31 Table of Contents expectations that the facility will be completed and occupied beginning in early 2013, the lease will expire in 2033. The Company lease commitment is approximately $116 million over the lease term. In conjunction with its lease of the new headquarters building, the Company will be vacating three leased facilities adjacent to its current Princeton headquarters facility. Based on certain clauses in the lease, for financial statement reporting purposes, the Company is considered the owner during the construction period, and recorded $17.4 million in construction in progress assets with a corresponding offset in other long-term liabilities. Share Repurchase Authorization On August 4, 2011, the Company Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $300 million of the Company Common Stock. Any purchases may be made from time to time in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise, subject to market conditions, corporate and legal requirements and other factors. There is no expiration date on the stock repurchase authorization, and the Company is not obligated to acquire any specific number of shares. The Company purchased 1.8 million shares at a cost of $80.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2011. New Joint Venture On September 22, 2011, the Company, together with FMC Corporation and TATA Chemicals, formed an operating joint venture, Natronx Technologies LLC ( Natronx ). The Company has a one-third ownership interest in Natronx, and its investment is accounted for under the equity method. The joint venture will engage in the manufacturing and marketing of sodium-based, dry sorbents for air pollution control in electric utility and industrial boiler operations. The sorbents, primarily sodium bicarbonate and trona, are used by coal-fired utilities to remove harmful pollutants, such as acid gases, in flue-gas treatment processes. Natronx intends to invest approximately $60 million to construct a 450,000 ton per year facility in Wyoming to produce trona sorbents by the fourth quarter of 2012, the cost of which will be equally shared among all members. The joint venture started business in the fourth quarter of 2011and the Company has made an initial investment of approximately $3 million as of December 31, 2011 and is committed to investing upwards of an additional $17 million in 2012. Commercial Paper Notes In the third quarter of 2011, the Company entered into an agreement with two banks to establish a commercial paper program (the Program ). Under the Program, the Company may issue notes from time to time up to an aggregate principal amount outstanding at any given time of $500 million. The maturities of the notes will vary but may not exceed 397 days. The notes will be sold under customary terms in the commercial paper market and will be issued at a discount to par or, alternatively, will be sold at par and will bear varying interest rates based on a fixed or floating rate basis. The interest rates will vary based on market conditions and the ratings assigned to the notes by the credit rating agencies at the time of issuance. Subject to market conditions, the Company intends to utilize the Program as its primary short-term borrowing facility and does not intend to sell unsecured commercial paper notes in excess of the available amount under the revolving credit agreement. If, for any reason, the Company is unable to access the commercial paper market, the revolving credit agreement ( Credit Agreement ) would be utilized to meet the Company short-term liquidity needs. The Company recently amended the Credit Agreement to support the Program. Total combined borrowing under both the Credit Agreement and the Program may not exceed $500 million. Additionally the Credit Agreement was also extended through August 4, 2016. The Company did not issue any commercial paper notes in 2011. As a result of the Program, the Company terminated its accounts receivable securitization facility as the notes issued under the Program bear a lower interest rate than notes issued under the securitization facility. Information Systems Upgrade The Company upgraded its information systems at its subsidiary in Canada effective October 1, 2011. A similar upgrade was implemented at its U.S. operations as of January 1, 2012 and currently is scheduled to be 32 Table of Contents implemented at certain other subsidiaries during 2012. The Company estimates that sales in the fourth quarter of 2011 increased by approximately $9 million due to orders from customers in advance of the U.S. implementation. As a result of the upgrade, the Company eliminated the one month reporting lag of the three subsidiaries whose fiscal year ended November 30 th to be consistent with the fiscal calendar of the Company and its other subsidiaries. Due to the elimination of the reporting lag, 13 fiscal months of financial results are included in 2011 results for those affected subsidiaries. The implementation of the new information system will enable the Company to timely consolidate these results. The elimination of this previously existing reporting lag is considered a change in accounting principle. The Company believes this change is preferable because it provides more current information to the users of the financial statements and eliminates the need to track and reconcile material intervening transactions. The Company has determined that the impact of the extra month is not material to its financial statements and as such has not retrospectively adjusted prior year amounts. The manner in which the change was recorded increased 2011 annual net sales by $14.3 million or 0.6% and had a negligible impact on net income of this year. No historical trends were impacted. If the change had been made retrospectively, net sales in 2010 and 2009 would have been (lower) / higher by $(1.0) and $4.8 million respectively, and net income would have been higher by $0.1 and $1.1 million respectively. In 2012, the Company is changing its 4 week 4 week 5 week quarterly reporting calendar to a month-end quarterly calendar. This change is also the result of the upgrade of its information systems. This change will eliminate differences in the number of days in the first and fourth quarters of the year, when the Company provides year-over-prior year period comparisons beginning in 2013. The impact of the change in the quarterly reporting calendar will not be material for 2012. Brazil Chemical Business The Company is exploring strategic options for its chemical business in Brazil. The business, which has annual revenues of approximately $40 million, markets sodium bicarbonate, dairy products and other chemicals in Brazil. The net assets associated with a portion of this business have been classified as held for sale for financial statement reporting purposes as of December 31, 2011. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The Company Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. By their nature, these judgments are subject to uncertainty. They are based on the Company historical experience, its observation of trends in industry, information provided by its customers and information available from other outside sources, as appropriate. The Company significant accounting policies and estimates are described below. Revenue Recognition and Promotional and Sales Return Reserves Virtually all of the Company revenue represents sales of finished goods inventory and is recognized when delivered or picked up by our customers. The reserves for consumer and trade promotion liabilities and sales returns are established based on our best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date. Promotional reserves are provided for sales incentives, such as coupons to consumers, and sales incentives provided to customers (such as slotting, cooperative advertising, incentive discounts based on volume of sales and other arrangements made directly with customers). All such costs are netted against sales. Slotting costs are recorded when the product is delivered to the customer. Cooperative advertising costs are recorded when the customer places the advertisement for the Company products. Discounts relating to price reduction arrangements are recorded when the related sale takes place. Costs 33 Table of Contents associated with end-aisle or other in-store displays are recorded when product that is subject to the promotion is sold. The Company relies on historical experience and forecasted data to determine the required reserves. For example, the Company uses historical experience to project coupon redemption rates to determine reserve requirements. Based on the total face value of Consumer Domestic coupons redeemed over the past several years, if the actual rate of redemptions were to deviate by 0.1% from the rate for which reserves are accrued in the financial statements, an approximately $2.1 million difference in the reserve required for coupons would result. With regard to other promotional reserves and sales returns, the Company uses experience-based estimates, customer and sales organization inputs and historical trend analysis in arriving at the reserves required. If the Company estimates for promotional activities and sales returns were to change by 10% the impact to promotional spending and sales return accruals would be approximately $5.7 million. While management believes that its promotional and sales returns reserves are reasonable and that appropriate judgments have been made, estimated amounts could differ materially from actual future obligations. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, the Company reduced promotion liabilities by approximately $8.2 million, $6.8 million and $7.8 million, respectively, based on a change in estimate as a result of actual experience and updated information. These adjustments are immaterial relative to the amount of trade promotion expense incurred annually by the Company. Impairment of goodwill, trademarks and other intangible assets and property, plant and equipment Carrying values of goodwill, trademarks and other indefinite lived intangible assets are reviewed periodically for possible impairment . The Company impairment review is based on a discounted cash flow approach that requires significant judgment with respect to unit volume, revenue and expense growth rates, and the selection of an appropriate discount rate. Management uses estimates based on expected trends in making these assumptions. With respect to goodwill, impairment occurs when the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the discounted present value of cash flows for that reporting unit. For trademarks and other intangible assets, an impairment charge is recorded for the difference between the carrying value and the net present value of estimated future cash flows, which represents the estimated fair value of the asset. Judgment is required in assessing whether assets may have become impaired between annual valuations. Indicators such as unexpected adverse economic factors, unanticipated technological change, distribution losses, or competitive activities and acts by governments and courts may indicate that an asset has become impaired. There were no intangible impairment charges for the three year period ended December 31, 2011. Property, plant and equipment and other long-lived assets are reviewed whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate possible impairment . The Company impairment review is based on an undiscounted cash flow analysis at the lowest level at which cash flows of the long-lived assets are largely independent of other groups of Company assets and liabilities. The analysis requires management judgment with respect to changes in technology, the continued success of product lines, and future volume, revenue and expense growth rates. The Company conducts annual reviews to identify idle and underutilized equipment, and reviews business plans for possible impairment implications. Impairment occurs when the carrying value of the asset exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows. When an impairment is indicated, the estimated future cash flows are then discounted to determine the estimated fair value of the asset and an impairment charge is recorded for the difference between the carrying value and the net present value of estimated future cash flows. The Company recognized charges related to plant impairment and equipment obsolescence, which occurs in the ordinary course of business during the three year period, ended December 31, 2011 as follows: For the Year Ended December 31, (In millions) 2011 2010 2009 Segments: Consumer Domestic $ 1.9 $ 0.6 $ 3.2 Consumer International 0.2 0.0 0.0 Specialty Products 1.0 3.1 6.9 Total $ 3.1 $ 3.7 $ 10.1 34 Table of Contents The 2011 Consumer Domestic charge is a result of the idling of equipment. The 2011 Specialty Products charge in 2011 is associated with the Company decision to explore strategic options for the specialty chemical business in Brazil. In 2010, the Company recorded a plant asset impairment charge of approximately $3.1 million, representing the carrying value of certain assets associated with its Brazil subsidiary. The charge is a result of a reduction in forecasted sales volume which has negatively impacted projected profitability. The charge is included in cost of sales in the Specialty Products Division segment. In 2009, the Company recorded a plant asset impairment charge of approximately $6.9 million, representing the carrying value of certain assets, associated with one of its international subsidiaries. The Company measured the impairment charges using the discounted cash flow method. This subsidiary manufactures some products that compete with imports priced in U.S. dollars. As the dollar has weakened, it has been necessary to lower prices in the local currency to stay competitive, leading to negative cash flows, which is the key input under the discounted cash flow method. The charge is included in cost of sales in the Specialty Products Division segment. The other charges in 2010 are due to the idling of certain equipment. The $3.2 million charge recorded in the Consumer Domestic segment in 2009 is primarily a result of a lack of acceptance of certain products by our key customers that resulted in a decline of forecasted future cash flows and reduced profitability. The estimates and assumptions used in connection with impairment analyses are consistent with the business plans and estimates that the Company uses to manage its business operations. Nevertheless, future outcomes may differ materially from management estimates. If the Company products fail to achieve estimated volume and pricing targets, market conditions unfavorably change or other significant estimates are not realized, then the Company revenue and cost forecasts may not be achieved, and the Company may be required to recognize additional impairment charges. Inventory valuation When appropriate, the Company writes down the carrying value of its inventory to the lower of cost or market (net realizable value, which reflects any costs to sell or dispose). The Company identifies any slow moving, obsolete or excess inventory to determine whether an adjustment is required to establish a new carrying value. The determination of whether inventory items are slow moving, obsolete or in excess of needs requires estimates and assumptions about the future demand for the Company products, technological changes, and new product introductions. In addition, the Company allowance for obsolescence may be impacted by the reduction of the number of stock keeping units ( SKUs ). The Company evaluates its inventory levels and expected usage on a periodic basis and records adjustments as required. Adjustments to inventory to reflect a reduction in net realizable value were $4.7 million at December 31, 2011, and $6.1 million at December 31, 2010. Valuation of pension and postretirement benefit costs The Company pension costs relate solely to its international operations. Both pension and postretirement benefit costs are developed from actuarial valuations. Inherent in benefit cost valuations are key assumptions provided by the Company to its actuaries, including the discount rate and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Material changes in the Company international pension and domestic/international postretirement benefit costs may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions as well as fluctuations in plan assets. The discount rate is subject to change each year, consistent with changes in applicable high-quality, long-term corporate bond indices. Based on the expected duration of the benefit payments for the Company pension plans and postretirement plans, the Company refers to an applicable index and expected term of benefit payments to select a discount rate at which it believes the pension benefits could be effectively settled. The Company weighted average discount rate for its international pension plans as of December 31, 2011 is 4.73% as compared to 5.32% used at December 31, 2010. Based on the published rate as of December 31, 2011 that matched estimated cash flows for the plans, the Company used a discount rate of 4.25% for its domestic postretirement plan as compared to 5.20% used at December 31, 2010. The expected long-term rate of return on international pension plan assets is selected by taking into account a historical trend, the expected duration of the projected benefit obligation for the plans, the asset mix of the plans, and known economic and market conditions at the time of valuation. Based on these factors, the 35 Table of Contents Company weighted average expected long-term rate of return for assets of its pension plans for 2011 was 5.87%, compared to 5.76% used in 2010. A 50 basis point change in the expected long-term rate of return would result in approximately $0.3 million change in pension expense for 2012. As noted above, changes in assumptions used by management may result in material changes in the Company pension and postretirement benefit costs. In 2011, other comprehensive income reflected a $7.7 million increase in its remaining pension plan obligations and a $2.3 million increase for postretirement benefit plans. The changes are primarily related to the change in discount rates for all plans. The Company made cash contributions of approximately $4.8 million to its pension plans in 2011. The Company estimates it will be required to make cash contributions to its pension plans of approximately $3.6 million in 2012 to offset 2012 benefit payments and administrative costs in excess of investment returns. Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized to reflect the future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Management provides a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets for amounts which are not considered more likely than not to be realized. The liabilities relate to tax return positions that, although supportable by the Company, may be challenged by the tax authorities and do not meet the minimum recognition threshold required under applicable accounting guidance for the related tax benefit to be recognized in the income statement. The Company adjusts this liability as a result of changes in tax legislation, interpretations of laws by courts, rulings by tax authorities, changes in estimates and the expiration of the statute of limitations. Many of the judgments involved in adjusting the liability involve assumptions and estimates that are highly uncertain and subject to change. In this regard, settlement of any issue, or an adverse determination in litigation, with a taxing authority could require the use of cash and result in an increase in our annual tax rate. Conversely, favorable resolution of an issue with a taxing authority would be recognized as a reduction to our annual tax rate. New Accounting Pronouncements There have been no accounting pronouncements issued but not yet adopted by the Company which are expected to have a material impact on the Company financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Accounting pronouncements adopted during the periods presented resulted in changes to disclosures but did not have a material impact on the Company financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 36 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2011, 2010 AND 2009 The discussion of results of operations at the consolidated level presented below is followed by a more detailed discussion of results of operations by segment. The discussion of the Company consolidated results of operations and segment operating results is presented on a historical basis for the years ending December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009. The segment discussion also addresses certain product line information. The Company operating units are consistent with its reportable segments. Consolidated results 2011 compared to 2010 Net Sales Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2011 were $2,749.3 million, $160.1 million or approximately 6.2% above 2010 net sales. The components of the net sales increase are the following: Net Sales Consolidated December 31, 2011 Product volumes sold 3.9 % Pricing 0.2 % Foreign exchange rate fluctuations 1.0 % Change in customer delivery arrangements (0.2 %) Acquired product lines (1) 1.3 % Divested product lines (2) (0.1 %) Discontinued product line (0.8 %) Change in fiscal calendar 0.6 % Sales in anticipation of information systems upgrade 0.3 % Net Sales increase 6.2 % (1) On June 28, 2011, the Company acquired the BATISTE dry shampoo product line. The Company acquired the SIMPLY SALINE product line on June 4, 2010, and the FELINE PINE product line on December 21, 2010. Net sales of the acquired product lines subsequent to the acquisition are included in the Company results. (2) Product lines divested include the BRILLO and certain LAMBERT KAY product lines, which were divested in the first quarter of 2010. The volume change reflects increased sales of consumer products sold in the Consumer Domestic and Consumer International segments. Specialty Product segment ( SPD ) volumes were unchanged. Pricing had minimal impact on total net sales, as favorable pricing for SPD was offset by the unfavorable pricing for Consumer Domestic and Consumer International. Sales in the fourth quarter of 2011 benefited from a timing shift in customer buying patterns from the first quarter of 2012 to the fourth quarter of 2011 in advance of the January 1, 2012 information system implementation in the United States. The impact on Income before Income Taxes on these sales was not material. The discontinued product line reflects the Company decision in late 2010 to cease a foreign subsidiary sale of a certain chemical product line. The impact of the discontinued product line on Income before Income Taxes was not material. Other components of the net sales increase reflect the Company change in delivery arrangements with certain customers at the beginning of the second quarter of 2010, which resulted in a reduction in net sales due to a transportation allowance for a customer pick-up program. Previously, the cost to ship product was included in cost of sales. Operating Costs The Company gross profit was $1,214.5 million in 2011, a $56.7 million increase as compared to 2010. The gross profit increase was primarily attributable to higher sales volumes, contributions from the acquired 37 Table of Contents product lines, slightly favorable pricing, the effect of cost reduction programs and favorable foreign exchange rates, partially offset by higher commodity costs and $3 million of charges associated with the decision to explore strategic alternatives for the chemical business in Brazil. Price increases for detergent and condoms mitigated a portion of the significant increases in the cost of resins, surfactants and latex. The 2010 gross profit includes charges for environmental remediation, asset impairment and plant shutdown costs of $7.6 million at the Company Brazil subsidiary. Gross margin decreased 50 basis points to 44.2% as compared to 44.7% in 2010. This decrease is principally due to higher commodity costs, an unfavorable product mix and higher trade promotion spending, partially offset by manufacturing cost reduction projects. Marketing expense for 2011 was $354.1 million, an increase of $16.1 million as compared to 2010. Marketing spending primarily was in support of the Company eight power brands, as well as expenses of the recently acquired product lines, BATISTE and FELINE PINE, and the effect of exchange rates. Marketing expenses as a percentage of sales was 12.9% in 2011 as compared to 13.1% in 2010. This reduction is due to a shift toward higher trade promotion spending, which is included in net sales. Selling, general and administrative expenses ( SG&A ) were $367.8 million in 2011, a decrease of $7.0 million as compared to 2010. SG&A in 2010 included a $24 million charge related to the transfer and settlement of the Company U.S. pension plan obligations. Several components of the Company SG&A were higher in 2011 than in 2010, including higher legal expenses in 2011 related in part to the Company response to an FTC subpoena and defense of a related lawsuit, higher research and development expenses, transition and amortization expense related to the product lines acquired in 2010 and 2011 and the effect of foreign exchange rates, partially offset by lower incentive compensation costs and a gain on the sale of certain LAMBERT KAY product lines in 2010. Other Income and Expenses In 2011, equity in earnings of affiliates was $10.0 million as compared to $5.0 million in 2010. The increase is due to higher equity income from the Company Armand Products Company joint venture primarily as a result of lower costs of a key raw material. Other expense was approximately $1.2 million in 2011 as compared to other expense of $4.6 million in 2010, which reflects the 2010 write-off of approximately $4.5 million of unamortized deferred financing costs associated with the Company prepayment of variable and subordinated debt. (See the Liquidity and capital resources below in this Management Discussion and Analysis for further information.) Interest expense for 2011 decreased $19.1 million compared to 2010. The decline was due to lower average debt outstanding as a result of the Company repayment of debt at the end of 2010, refinancing of its bond debt and the reversal of interest accruals following the settlement of a state tax audit. The 2010 amount includes a $3.0 million reversal of interest accruals associated with certain tax reserves following the settlement of an Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) audit and the lapse of applicable statues of limitations, which was offset by a $4.3 million charge associated with the termination of the Company interest rate collar and interest swap agreements. Investment earnings of $1.9 million were higher than in 2010 due to interest received on a federal tax refund and higher investment returns primarily at the Company international subsidiaries. Taxation The 2011 tax rate was 37.4% as compared to 35.3% in 2010. The effective tax rate for 2011 included a charge for the establishment of a valuation allowance of approximately $13 million against the deferred tax assets of the Company Brazilian subsidiary, offset by a deferred income tax benefit of approximately $6 million relating to New Jersey corporate tax reform legislation enacted in April 2011. The effective tax rate 38 Table of Contents for 2010 included a benefit from an increase in the U.S. manufacturing tax deduction and the reversal of approximately $4.1 million associated with certain tax liabilities following the settlement of an IRS audit and the lapse of applicable statutes of limitations. Consolidated results 2010 compared to 2009 Net Sales Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2010 were $2,589.2 million, $68.3 million or approximately 2.7% above 2009 net sales. The components of the net sales increase are the following: Net Sales Consolidated December 31, 2010 Product volumes sold 5.5 % Pricing and sales mix (2.5 %) Foreign exchange rate fluctuations 1.1 % Change in customer delivery arrangements and allowances (0.9 %) Acquired product lines (1) 0.5 % Divested product lines (2) (1.0 %) Net Sales increase 2.7 % (1) On June 4, 2010, the Company acquired the SIMPLY SALINE product line, and in late December 2010, acquired the FELINE PINE product line. Net sales of the acquired product lines subsequent to the acquisition are included in the Company results. (See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for further information.) (2) Product lines divested include the BRILLO and certain LAMBERT KAY product lines, which were divested in the first quarter of 2010, and ancillary products divested in the third quarter of 2009 that initially were acquired in connection with the Company acquisition of the ORAJEL brand of products from Del Laboratories, Inc., a subsidiary of Coty, Inc., in October 2008 (the Orajel Acquisition ). The reductions resulting from pricing and sales mix primarily reflect higher trade promotion and slotting costs in support of new product launches. At the beginning of the second quarter of 2010, the Company changed delivery arrangements with certain customers, which resulted in a reduction in net sales due to a transportation allowance for a customer pick-up program. Previously, the cost to ship product was included in cost of sales. Operating Costs The Company gross profit was $1,157.8 million in 2010, a $56.8 million increase as compared to 2009. The gross profit increase was attributable to higher sales volumes and lower manufacturing conversion costs, partially as a result of cost efficiencies derived from the Company new manufacturing facility in York, Pennsylvania, a reduction in costs associated with the shutdown of the Company manufacturing and warehouse facility in North Brunswick, New Jersey in 2009; a contribution from the SIMPLY SALINE business, which was acquired late in the second quarter of 2010; and favorable foreign exchange rates. Partially offsetting the gross profit improvement were higher trade promotion and slotting costs, higher commodity costs, the net effect of the divested and acquired product lines, and the change in customer delivery arrangements. The 2010 gross profit includes charges for environmental remediation, asset impairment and plant shutdown of $7.6 million at a Company international subsidiary. The gross profit in 2009 reflected an asset impairment charge and an environmental remediation charge of approximately $6.0 million also at the Company international subsidiary. Gross margin increased 100 basis points to 44.7% as compared to 43.7% in 2009. This increase is principally due to the reduction in costs related to the North Brunswick plant shutdown, manufacturing efficiencies in the new plant in York, Pennsylvania, and the change in customer delivery arrangements, partially offset by higher trade spending and commodity costs. 39 Table of Contents Marketing expenses for 2010 were $338.0 million, a decrease of $15.7 million or 4.4% as compared to 2009. Marketing spending primarily was in support of the Company eight power brands. Funds from the reduction in marketing expenses were primarily used to increase trade promotion expenses (reflected in net sales) due to competitive pricing activity. Selling, general and administrative expenses ( SG&A ) were $374.8 million in 2010, an increase of $20.3 million as compared to 2009. The increase in SG&A in 2010 includes the approximate $24.0 million expense related to the transfer and settlement of the U.S. Pension Plan obligations. The increase also is attributable to the effect of foreign exchange rates, higher selling costs in support of higher sales, costs associated with a global information system upgrade project and higher legal expenses partially offset by lower incentive compensation costs and the $1.0 million gain on the sale of certain LAMBERT KAY product lines during the first quarter of 2010. The consolidated statement of income for 2009 reflects the $20.0 million pre-tax gain, net of legal expenses, recognized by the Company in connection with the settlement of its litigation against Abbott Laboratories, Inc. (see Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for further information). Other Income and Expenses In 2010, equity in earnings of affiliates was $5.0 million as compared to $12.1 million in 2009. The decrease is due to lower equity income from the Company Armand Products Company joint venture due to lower pricing resulting from increased competitive activity and higher raw material costs. Other expense was approximately $4.6 million in 2010 as compared to other income of $1.5 million in 2009, which is primarily attributable to the write-off of approximately $4.5 million of unamortized deferred financing costs associated with the Company prepayment of variable and subordinated debt. (See Liquidity and capital resources below in this Management Discussion and Analysis for further information.) Interest expense for 2010 decreased $7.8 million compared to 2009. The decline was due to the reversal of interest accruals of approximately $3.0 million associated with certain tax reserves following the settlement of an IRS audit and the lapse of applicable statutes of limitations, lower interest rates compared to the prior year, and lower average debt outstanding, partially offset by a charge of $4.6 million relating to the termination of the Company interest rate collar and interest rate swap agreements. This termination was due to the Company repayment of its variable rate debt in the fourth quarter of 2010. (See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for further information.) Investment earnings of $0.6 million were lower due to a significant decline in interest rates. Taxation The 2010 tax rate was 35.3% as compared to 37.9% in 2009. The effective tax rate for 2010 included a benefit from an increase in the U.S. manufacturing tax deduction and the reversal of approximately $4.1 million associated with certain tax liabilities following the settlement of an IRS audit and the lapse of applicable statutes of limitations. Segment results for 2011, 2010 and 2009 The Company operates three reportable segments: Consumer Domestic, Consumer International and Specialty Products Division ( SPD ). These segments are determined based on differences in the nature of products and organizational and ownership structures. The Company also has a Corporate segment. Segment Products Consumer Domestic Household and personal care products Consumer International Primarily personal care products SPD Specialty chemical products 40 Table of Contents The Corporate segment income consists of equity in earnings of affiliates. The Company had 50% ownership interests in Armand Products Company ( Armand ) and The ArmaKleen Company ( ArmaKleen ) as of December 31, 2011. The Company equity in earnings of Armand and ArmaKleen for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, is included in the Corporate segment. In September 2011, the Company formed an operating joint venture, Natronx, in which it has a one-third ownership. The Company equity in Natronx operating results is also included in the Corporate segment. Some of the subsidiaries that are included in the Consumer International segment manufacture and sell personal care products to the Consumer Domestic segment. These sales are eliminated from the Consumer International segment results set forth below. Segment sales and income before taxes and minority interest for each of the three years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 were as follows: (In millions) Consumer Domestic Consumer International SPD Corporate Total Net Sales (1) 2011 $ 1,979.1 $ 509.1 $ 261.1 $ 0.0 $ 2,749.3 2010 1,886.1 444.0 259.1 0.0 2,589.2 2009 1,881.7 393.7 245.5 0.0 2,520.9 Income Before Income Taxes (2) 2011 $ 386.0 $ 68.9 $ 29.7 $ 10.0 $ 494.6 2010 341.9 52.6 18.8 5.0 418.3 2009 325.6 38.6 16.0 12.0 392.2 (1) Intersegment sales from Consumer International to Consumer Domestic, which are not reflected in the table, were $5.2 million, $3.6 million and $3.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. (2) In determining Income before Income Taxes, interest expense, investment earnings, and other income (expense) were allocated among the segments based upon each segment relative operating profit. Product line revenues for external customers for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 were as follows: (In millions) 2011 2010 2009 Household Products $ 1,295.0 $ 1,207.4 $ 1,196.4 Personal Care Products 684.1 678.7 685.3 Total Consumer Domestic 1,979.1 1,886.1 1,881.7 Total Consumer International 509.1 444.0 393.7 Total SPD 261.1 259.1 245.5 Total Consolidated Net Sales $ 2,749.3 $ 2,589.2 $ 2,520.9 41 Table of Contents Consumer Domestic 2011 compared to 2010 Consumer Domestic net sales in 2011 were $1,979.1 million, an increase of $93.0 million or 4.9% compared to net sales of $1,886.1 million in 2010. The components of the net sales change are the following: Net Sales Consumer Domestic December 31, 2011 Product volumes sold 4.4 % Pricing (0.7 %) Change in customer delivery arrangements (0.3 %) Acquired product lines (1) 1.3 % Divested product lines (2) (0.2 %) Sales in anticipation of information systems upgrade 0.4 % Net Sales increase 4.9 % (1) On June 4, 2010, the Company acquired the SIMPLY SALINE product line, and in late December 2010, acquired the FELINE PINE product line. Net sales of acquired product lines subsequent to the acquisition are included in the Company segment results. (See Note 6 to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report for further information.) (2) Product lines divested included the BRILLO and certain LAMBERT KAY product lines, which were divested in the first quarter of 2010. Higher sales of ARM & HAMMER liquid and powder laundry detergent, XTRA liquid laundry detergent, ARM & HAMMER SUPER SCOOP cat litter, and sales of acquired product lines were offset by lower sales of OXICLEAN laundry additive, ARM & HAMMER Dental Care and other toothpaste products. Consumer Domestic Income before Income Taxes for 2011 was $386.0 million, a $44.2 million increase as compared to 2010. The 2011 increase is due to the impact of higher product volumes sold, the net effect of acquisitions and divestitures, and lower allocated interest expense, partially offset by higher commodity costs and higher trade promotion expenses. In addition, the 2011 increase reflects lower SG&A, primarily because 2010 SG&A included a charge related to the settlement of the Company U.S. pension plan obligations. 2010 compared to 2009 Consumer Domestic net sales in 2010 were $1,886.1 million, an increase of $4.3 million or 0.2% compared to net sales of $1,881.7 million in 2009. The components of the net sales change are the following: Net Sales Consumer Domestic December 31, 2010 Product volumes sold 5.6 % Pricing and sales mix (3.5 %) Change in customer delivery arrangements and allowances (1.2 %) Acquired product lines (1) 0.6 % Divested product lines (2) (1.3 %) Net Sales increase 0.2 % (1) On June 4, 2010, the Company acquired the SIMPLY SALINE product line, and in late December 2010, acquired the FELINE PINE product line. Net sales of acquired product lines subsequent to the acquisition are included in the Company segment results. (See Note 6 to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report for further information.) 42 Table of Contents (2) Product lines divested included the BRILLO and certain LAMBERT KAY product lines, which were divested in the first quarter of 2010, and ancillary products divested in the third quarter of 2009 that initially were acquired in connection with the Orajel Acquisition. Higher sales of ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry detergent, ARM & HAMMER SUPER SCOOP cat litter, TROJAN condoms and KABOOM bathroom cleaner were offset by lower sales of XTRA liquid laundry detergent, OXICLEAN laundry additive, SPINBRUSH toothbrushes, ARM & HAMMER powder detergent, ARRID antiperspirant and other oral care products. Consumer Domestic Income before Income Taxes for 2010 was $341.9 million, a $16.2 million increase as compared to 2009. The 2010 increase is due to the impact of higher product volumes sold, cost efficiencies derived from the Company new manufacturing facility in York, Pennsylvania, lower costs associated with the North Brunswick, New Jersey plant and warehouse shutdown in 2009, lower manufacturing costs, lower marketing costs, lower SG&A costs and lower allocated interest expense, partially offset by higher trade promotion and slotting expenses and higher SG&A costs primarily related to the settlement of the U.S. Pension Plan obligations. Consumer International 2011 compared to 2010 Consumer International net sales in 2011 were $509.1 million, an increase of $65.1 million or 14.7% as compared to 2010. The components of the net sales change are the following: Net Sales Consumer International December 31, 2011 Product volumes sold 4.3 % Pricing (0.2 %) Foreign exchange rate fluctuations 5.4 % Acquired product lines (1) 2.0 % Divested products (2) (0.1 %) Change in fiscal calendar (3) 3.3 % Net Sales increase 14.7 % (1) On June 28, 2011, the Company acquired the BATISTE dry shampoo product line Net sales of this product line subsequent to the acquisition are included in the Company segment results. (See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for further information.) (2) Product lines divested included the BRILLO and certain LAMBERT KAY product lines, which were divested in the first quarter of 2010. (3) Beginning in 2012, the Company quarterly periods changed to a calendar year reporting basis. To facilitate this change, the fourth quarter of 2011 included an additional period of reporting for those three subsidiaries outside of North America that used to report one month prior to period presented. This change resulted in increasing 2011 net sales by $14.3 million or 3.3% and had a nominal impact on net income for the year. Higher sales volumes in Canada, Australia, and Mexico, as well as higher U.S. exports, contributed to the sales increase. Consumer International income before income taxes was $68.9 million in 2011, an increase of $16.3 million compared to 2010. Higher profits are attributable to the higher sales volume, the effect of foreign exchange rates and lower allocated interest expense, partially offset by unfavorable pricing and sales mix and higher shipping costs. The additional fiscal period did not have a material effect on income before taxes. 43 Table of Contents 2010 compared to 2009 Consumer International net sales in 2010 were $444.0 million, an increase of $50.3 million or 12.8% as compared to 2009. The components of the net sales change are the following: Net Sales Consumer International December 31, 2010 Product volumes sold 8.3 % Pricing and sales mix (1.2 %) Foreign exchange rate fluctuations 5.9 % Acquired product lines (1) 0.1 % Divested products (2) (0.3 %) Net Sales increase 12.8 % (1) On June 4, 2010, the Company acquired the SIMPLY SALINE product line. Net sales of this product line subsequent to the acquisition are included in the Company segment results. (See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for further information.) (2) Product lines divested included the BRILLO and certain LAMBERT KAY product lines, which were divested in the first quarter of 2010, and ancillary products divested in the third quarter of 2009 that initially were acquired in connection with the Orajel Acquisition. Higher unit volumes were generated in Canada, Australia, France, the United Kingdom and Brazil. Consumer International income before income taxes was $52.6 million in 2010, an increase of $14.0 million compared to 2009. Higher profits are attributable to the higher sales volume and favorable exchange rates on U.S. dollar purchases of inventory and the translation of foreign financial statements to U.S. dollars, partially offset by higher SG&A and marketing costs. Specialty Products 2011 compared to 2010 Specialty Products net sales were $261.1 million for 2011, an increase of $2.0 million, or 0.8% as compared to 2010. The components of the net sales change are the following: Net Sales SPD December 31, 2011 Product volumes sold (0.3 %) Pricing 7.7 % Foreign exchange rate fluctuations 0.8 % Divested product lines (1) (0.1 %) Discontinued product line (7.7 %) Sales in anticipation of information systems upgrade 0.4 % Net Sales increase 0.8 % (1) Product lines divested include the BRILLO product line, which was divested in the first quarter of 2010. The pricing increase in 2011 reflects higher sales prices in response to raw material increases primarily in the animal nutrition and performance products businesses. The sales volume decrease reflects lower U.S. exports. The discontinued product line reflects the Company decision in late 2010 to cease a foreign subsidiary sale of a certain chemical product line. 44 Table of Contents Specialty Products Income before Income Taxes for 2011 was $29.7 million, an increase of $10.9 million as compared to 2010. The increase in income in 2011 reflects the profits on higher net sales and lower allocated interest expense partially offset by higher raw material costs. Income before taxes in 2011 also includes $3.0 million in charges associated with the Company decision to exit the chemical business in Brazil. Income before Taxes in 2010 includes expenses of $9.7 million associated with an increase in environmental reserves of $4.9 million and an impairment and plant shutdown charge of $4.8 million, both related to the Company Brazilian subsidiary. Cost of sales in 2010 includes $7.6 million of these charges and SG&A includes the remaining $2.1 million. 2010 compared to 2009 Specialty Products net sales were $259.1 million for 2010, an increase of $13.6 million, or 5.6% as compared to 2009. The components of the net sales change are the following: Net Sales Specialty Products Division December 31, 2010 Product volumes sold 0.3 % Pricing and sales mix 3.4 % Foreign exchange rate fluctuations 2.2 % Divested product lines (1) (0.3 %) Net Sales increase 5.6 % (1) Product lines divested include the BRILLO product line, which was divested in the first quarter of 2010. The pricing and sales mix increase in 2010 reflects higher sales prices in response to raw material increases primarily in the animal nutrition business. Product volume increases were realized in the animal nutrition business. Specialty Products Income before Income Taxes for 2010 was $18.8 million, an increase of $2.8 million as compared to 2009. The increase in income in 2010 reflects the profits on higher net sales and a favorable foreign exchange rate associated with the Brazilian Real. Income before taxes in 2010 also includes expenses of $9.7 million associated with an increase in environmental reserves of $4.9 million and an impairment and plant shutdown charge of $4.8 million, both related to the Company Brazilian subsidiary. Cost of sales includes $7.6 million of these charges and SG&A includes the remaining $2.1 million. In 2009 these items totaled approximately $9.9 million. Liquidity and capital resources As of December 31, 2011, the Company had $251.4 million in cash, approximately $500 million available under its revolving credit facility and commercial paper program, and a commitment increase feature under the Credit Agreement that enables the Company to borrow up to an additional $500 million, subject to lending commitments and certain conditions as described in the Credit Agreement. To enhance the safety of its cash resources, the Company invests its cash primarily in prime money market funds. As of December 31, 2011, the amount of cash and cash equivalents, included in the Company consolidated cash, that was held by foreign subsidiaries was approximately $113 million. If these funds are needed for operations in the U.S. the Company will be required to accrue and pay taxes in the U.S. to repatriate these funds. However, the Company intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside the U.S. and the Company current plans do not indicate a need to repatriate them to fund operations in the U.S. In the third quarter of 2011, the Company entered into an agreement with two banks to establish a commercial paper program (the Program ). The details of the program are discussed in more detail in the section under Recent Developments. 45 Table of Contents The current economic environment presents risks that could have adverse consequences for the Company liquidity. (See Economic conditions could adversely affect our business under Risk Factors in Item 1A.) The Company does not anticipate that current economic conditions will adversely affect its ability to comply with the financial covenants in its principal credit facilities because the Company currently is, and anticipates that it will continue to be, in compliance with the minimum interest coverage ratio requirement and the maximum leverage ratio requirement under the Credit Agreement. These financial ratios are discussed in more detail in this section under Certain Financial Covenants. On February 7, 2011, the Board of Directors increased the Company regular quarterly dividend from $0.085 per share to $0.17 per share, equivalent to an annual dividend rate of $0.68 per share, commencing with the dividend payable on March 1, 2011. The higher dividend raised the annualized dividend payout from approximately $49 million to approximately $97 million. On February 1, 2012, the Board of Directors again increased the Company regular quarterly dividend from $0.17 per share to $0.24 per share, equivalent to an annual dividend rate of $0.96 per share, commencing with the dividend payable on March 1, 2012 to stockholders of record at the close of business on February 21, 2012. The higher dividend raises the Company annualized dividend payout from approximately $97 million to approximately $137 million. On August 3, 2011, the Company Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $300 million of the Company Common Stock. The details of the program are discussed in detail in the section under Recent Developments. The Company anticipates that its cash from operations, together with its current borrowing capacity, will be sufficient to meet its capital expenditure program costs, which are expected to be approximately $70 to 75 million in 2012, fund its stock buy-back program to the extent implemented by management, and pay dividends at the latest approved rate and meet its contractual obligation to contribute upwards of an additional $17 million to Natronx for additional capital development. Included in the estimated capital expenditures for 2012 is $11 million for the Company global information systems upgrade project and $24 million for completing a West Coast manufacturing and distribution facility in Victorville, California. Specifically, the Company will be relocating its cat litter manufacturing operations and a distribution center from its Green River, Wyoming facility. The new site also will include a liquid laundry production line. The Company plans to invest a total of approximately $35 million in capital expenditures and incur approximately $7 million in transition expenses in connection with the opening of the Victorville site and costs associated with anticipated changes at the Green River facility. The transition expenses include anticipated severance costs and accelerated depreciation of equipment at the Company Green River facility and one-time project expenses. As a result of the 2010 refinancing activities, the Company did not have any mandatory debt payments in 2011 and will not have any in 2012. Cash may be used for acquisitions that would complement the Company existing product lines or geographic markets. Net Debt The Company had outstanding total debt of $252.3 million and cash of $251.4 million at December 31, 2011, resulting in net debt of $0.9 million at December 31, 2011. This compares to total debt of $339.7 million and cash of $189.2 million, resulting in net debt of $150.5 million at December 31, 2010. Net debt is defined as cash less total debt. Cash Flow Analysis Year Ending December 31, (In millions) 2011 2010 2009 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 437.8 $ 428.5 $ 400.9 Net cash used in investing activities $ (147.8 ) $ (180.4 ) $ (104.1 ) Net cash used in financing activities $ (226.5 ) $ (503.7 ) $ (58.3 ) 46 Table of Contents Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities The Company net cash provided by operating activities in 2011 increased $9.3 million to $437.8 million as compared to 2010. The increase was primarily due to higher net income, higher deferred income taxes primarily due to bonus depreciation on capital additions and a decrease in working capital (exclusive of cash). For the year ended December 31, 2011, the components of working capital that significantly affected operating cash flow are as follows: Accounts receivable increased $35.3 million due to the timing of customer shipments. Inventories increased $9.0 million primarily due to increases in raw material costs and build-up of inventories to address expected higher customer orders in anticipation of the information systems upgrade. Accounts payable and other accrued expenses increased $27.4 million primarily due to the timing of payments and higher marketing accruals, offset by lower incentive and profit sharing accruals. Income taxes payable increased $19.1 million due to the timing of payments and higher earnings. Net Cash Used in Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities during 2011 was $147.8 million, reflecting the $64.8 million acquisition of the BATISTE brand, $4.3 million of oral care technology license acquisitions, $3.2 million investment in Natronx, and $76.6 million of property, plant and equipment expenditures partially offset by $1.6 million in payments received on outstanding notes receivable, and state government grants of $1.7 million received in connection with the York, Pennsylvania facility. Net Cash Used in Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities during 2011 was $226.5 million, principally reflecting the repayment of $90.0 million in borrowings under the Company former accounts receivable securitization facility, $97.4 million to pay cash dividends and $80.2 million of treasury stock purchases. Cash used in financing activities also was partially offset by proceeds of and tax benefits from stock option exercises, aggregating $39.2 million and international borrowings of $2.6 million. Certain Financial Covenants Consolidated EBITDA (referred to below as Adjusted EBITDA ) is a component of the financial covenants contained in, and is defined in, the Company Credit Agreement. Financial covenants include a leverage ratio (total debt to Adjusted EBITDA) and an interest coverage ratio (Adjusted EBITDA to total interest expense), which if not met, could result in an event of default and trigger the early termination of the Credit Agreement. Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities, which is determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The Company leverage ratio for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 was 0.5, which is below the maximum of 3.25 permitted under the Credit Agreement, and the interest coverage ratio for the twelve months ending December 31, 2011 was 65.3, which is above the minimum of 3.00 permitted under the Credit Agreement. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for further information relating to the Credit Agreement. The reconciliation of Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities (the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure) to Adjusted EBITDA for 2011 is as follows: (In millions) Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities $ 437.8 Interest paid 9.2 Current Income Tax Provision 125.6 Excess Tax Benefit on Stock Options Exercised 12.1 Change in Working Capital and Other Liabilities 11.0 Adjustments for Significant Acquisitions / Dispositions net 3.9 Adjusted EBITDA (per Credit Agreement) $ 599.6 47 Table of Contents Commitments as of December 31, 2011 The table below summarizes the Company material contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2011. Payments Due by Period (In millions) Total 2012 2013 to 2014 2015 to 2016 After 2016 Short & Long-Term Debt 3.35% Senior Note $ 250.0 $ 0.0 $ 0.0 $ 250.0 $ 0.0 250.0 0.0 0.0 250.0 0.0 Interest on Fixed Rate Debt (1) 33.6 8.4 16.8 8.4 0.0 Lease Obligations 210.4 24.1 40.2 26.8 119.3 Other Long-Term Liabilities Letters of Credit and Performance Bonds (2) 4.1 4.1 0.0 0.0 0.0 Pension Contributions (3) 3.6 3.6 0.0 0.0 0.0 Purchase Obligations (4) 130.6 76.4 52.0 2.2 0.0 Total $ 632.3 $ 116.6 $ 109.0 $ 287.4 $ 119.3 (1) Represents interest on the Company 3.35% senior notes due in 2015. (2) Letters of credit with several banks guarantee payment for items such as insurance claims in the event of the Company insolvency and one year of rent on a warehouse. Performance Bonds are principally for required municipal property improvements. (3) Pension contributions are based on actuarial assessments of government regulated employer funding requirements. These requirements are not projected beyond one year since they fluctuate with the change in plan assets, assumptions and demographics. (4) The Company has outstanding purchase obligations with suppliers at the end of 2011 for raw, packaging and other materials and services in the normal course of business. These purchase obligation amounts represent only those items which are based on agreements that are enforceable and legally binding, and do not represent total anticipated purchases. The Company has excluded from the table above uncertain tax liabilities due to the uncertainty of the amount per period of payment. As of December 31, 2011, the Company has gross uncertain tax liabilities, including interest, of $13.8 million (see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report). Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company does not have off-balance sheet financing or unconsolidated special purpose entities. OTHER ITEMS Market risk Concentration of Risk In each of the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, net sales to the Company largest customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its affiliates were 23%, 23% and 22% respectively, of the Company total consolidated net sales. 48 Table of Contents Interest Rate Risk The Company has significantly reduced its interest rate risk as a result of its refinancing activities in 2010. The Company had outstanding total debt at December 31, 2011 of $252.3 million, of which $249.7 million carries a fixed rate of interest at 3.35% and $2.6 million of short term debt has variable interest rates. Should the Company need to use its revolving credit facility, it would consider entering into hedge agreements to mitigate the interest rate risk, if conditions warrant. Diesel Fuel Hedge The Company uses independent freight carriers to deliver its products. These carriers charge the Company a basic rate per mile that is subject to a mileage surcharge for diesel fuel price increases. During 2011, the Company entered into hedge agreements with financial counterparties. Under the hedge agreements, the Company agreed to pay a fixed price per gallon of diesel fuel determined at the time the agreements were executed and to receive a floating rate payment reflecting the variable common carriers mileage surcharge. The floating rate payment is determined on a monthly basis based on the average price of the Department of Energy Diesel Fuel Index price during the applicable month and is designed to offset any increase or decrease in fuel surcharge payments that the Company pays to it common carriers. The agreements cover approximately 35% of the Company diesel fuel requirements for 2011 and 33% of the Company total 2012 diesel fuel requirements. The Company uses the hedge agreements to mitigate the volatility of diesel fuel prices and related fuel surcharges, and not to speculate in the future price of diesel fuel. These agreements qualify for hedge accounting . Therefore, changes in the fair value of diesel fuel hedge agreements are recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income on the balance sheet. Foreign Currency The Company is subject to exposure from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily U.S. Dollar/Euro, U.S. Dollar/British Pound, U.S. Dollar/Canadian Dollar, U.S. Dollar/Mexican Peso, U.S. Dollar/Australian Dollar, U.S. Dollar/Brazilian Real and U.S. Dollar/Chinese Yuan. The Company, from time to time, enters into forward exchange contracts to reduce the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations related to anticipated but not yet committed intercompany sales or purchases denominated in the U.S. dollar, Canadian dollar, British pound and Euro. Certain of the Company subsidiaries entered into forward exchange contracts to protect the Company from the risk that, due to changes in currency exchange rates, it would be adversely affected by net cash outflows. The face value of the unexpired contracts as of December 31, 2011 totaled U.S. $30.3 million. All of these contracts were designated as hedges and qualified for hedge accounting and as a result, changes in fair values from these contracts were recorded in Other Comprehensive Income during the year ended December 31, 2011. Equity Derivatives The Company has entered into equity derivative contracts covering its own stock in order to minimize its liability, resulting from changes in quoted fair values of Company stock, to participants under its Executive Deferred Compensation Plan who have investments under that plan in a notional Company stock fund. The contracts are settled in cash. Since the equity derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting, the Company is required to mark the agreements to market throughout the life of the agreements and record changes in fair value in the consolidated statement of income.
