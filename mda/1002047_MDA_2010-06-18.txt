Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the financial statements and the related notes set forth under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data . The following discussion also contains trend information and other forward looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. The Risk Factors set forth in Item 1. Business are hereby incorporated into the discussion by reference. 36 Table of Contents Overview Revenues for fiscal 2010 were $3.9 billion, up $0.5 billion, or 15%, from fiscal 2009. Improved revenue performance in fiscal 2010 was the result of improvements in product, software entitlements and maintenance and service revenues. Revenues in fiscal 2009 were negatively impacted by a $128.7 million settlement with the General Services Administration (GSA). The dispute regarded our discounting practices and compliance with the price reduction provisions of GSA contracts between August 1997 and February 2005. Gross profit margins increased during fiscal 2010 due largely to reductions in product materials cost, partially offset by a decrease in the overall average selling prices of our products, as well as an increase in our SEM and services revenues mix relative to product revenues. In addition, our gross profit margin in fiscal 2009 was negatively impacted by the GSA settlement. During fiscal 2010, sales and marketing, research and development, and general and administrative expenses totaled $2.1 billion, up 10% from fiscal 2009 and reflected the impact of an increase in incentive compensation and commissions expense related to our stronger sales and operating profit performance, as well as having 53 weeks in fiscal 2010 compared to 52 weeks in fiscal 2009. During fiscal 2010, we entered into a merger agreement with Data Domain, Inc., which was subsequently terminated on July 8, 2009. In accordance with the agreement, we received a $57.0 million termination fee, which, when netted against $15.9 million of incremental third-party costs we incurred relating to the terminated merger transaction, resulted in net proceeds of $41.1 million. Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of such statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements. Our estimates are based on historical experience and other assumptions that we consider to be appropriate in the circumstances. However, actual future results may vary from our estimates. We believe that the following accounting policies are significantly affected by critical accounting estimates and that they are both highly important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require difficult management judgments and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain. Note 2 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. Certain of these significant accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies. We believe the accounting policies described below are the ones that most frequently require us to make estimates and judgments and therefore are critical to the understanding of our results of operations. Revenue Recognition, Reserves and Allowances We apply the provisions of the accounting guidance for software revenue recognition to our product sales, both hardware and software, because our software is essential to the performance of our hardware. We recognize revenue when: Persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists: It is our customary practice to have a purchase order and/or contract prior to recognizing revenue on an arrangement from our end users, customers, value-added resellers, or distributors. Delivery has occurred: Our product is physically delivered to our customers, generally with standard transfer terms such as FOB origin. We typically do not allow for restocking rights with any of our value-added resellers or distributors. Products shipped with acceptance criteria or return rights are not recognized as revenue until all criteria are achieved. If undelivered products or services exist that are essential to the functionality of the delivered product in an arrangement, delivery is not considered to have occurred. 37 Table of Contents The fee is fixed or determinable: Arrangements with payment terms extending beyond our standard terms, conditions and practices are not considered to be fixed or determinable. Revenue from such arrangements is recognized at the earlier of customer payment or when the fees become due and payable. We typically do not allow for price-protection rights with any of our value-added resellers or distributors. Collection is probable: If there is considerable doubt surrounding the credit worthiness of a customer at the outset of an arrangement, the associated revenue is deferred and recognized upon cash receipt. Our multiple element arrangements include our systems and one or more of the following undelivered software-related elements: software entitlements and maintenance, premium hardware maintenance and storage review services. Our software entitlements and maintenance entitle our customers to receive unspecified product upgrades and enhancements on a when-and-if-available basis, bug fixes, and patch releases. Premium hardware maintenance services include contracts for technical support and minimum response times. Revenues from software entitlements and maintenance, premium hardware maintenance services and storage review services are recognized ratably over the contractual term, generally from one to three years. We also offer extended service contracts (which extend our standard parts warranty and may include premium hardware maintenance) at the end of the warranty term; revenues from these contracts are recognized ratably over the contract term. We typically sell professional services separately from any of our other revenue elements, either on a time and materials basis or for fixed price standard projects; we recognize revenue for these services as they are performed. Revenue from hardware installation services is recognized in the period the services are delivered. For arrangements with multiple elements, we recognize as revenue the difference between the total arrangement price and the greater of fair value or stated price for any undelivered elements ( the residual method ). For our undelivered software-related elements, we determine fair value of these undelivered elements based on vendor-specific objective evidence ( VSOE ) of fair value, which for us consists of the prices charged when these services are sold separately. To determine the fair value of these elements, we analyze both the selling prices when elements are sold separately as well as the concentrations of those prices. We believe those concentrations have been sufficient to enable us to establish VSOE of fair value for the undelivered elements. If VSOE cannot be obtained to establish fair value of the undelivered elements, it is required that revenue from the entire arrangement be initially deferred and recognized ratably over the period these elements are delivered. For purposes of presentation in the statement of operations, once fair value has been determined for our undelivered bundled elements, we allocate revenue first to software entitlements and maintenance, based on VSOE of its fair value, with the remainder allocated to other service revenues. We record reductions to revenue for estimated sales returns at the time of shipment. Sales returns are estimated based on historical sales returns, current trends, and our expectations regarding future experience. We monitor and analyze the accuracy of sales returns estimates by reviewing actual returns and adjust them for future expectations to determine the adequacy of our current and future reserve needs. Our reserve levels have been sufficient to cover actual returns and have not required material changes in subsequent periods. While we currently have no expectations for significant changes to these reserves, if actual future returns and allowances differ from past experience, additional allowances may be required. We also maintain a separate allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses based on our assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts and the aging of the accounts receivable. We analyze accounts receivable and historical bad debts, customer concentrations, customer solvency, current economic and geographic trends, and changes in customer payment terms and practices when evaluating the adequacy of our current and future allowance. In circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer inability to meet its financial obligations to us, a specific allowance for bad debt is estimated and recorded, which reduces the recognized receivable to the estimated amount we believe will ultimately be collected. We monitor and analyze the accuracy of our allowance for doubtful accounts estimate by reviewing past collectibility and adjusting it for future expectations to determine the adequacy of our current and future allowance. Our reserve levels have generally been sufficient to cover credit losses. Our allowance for doubtful accounts as of April 30, 2010 was $1.6 million, compared to $3.1 million as of April 24, 2009. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. 38 Table of Contents Inventory Valuation and Purchase Order Accruals Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market (which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis). We perform an excess and obsolete analysis of our inventory based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. We adjust the inventory value based on estimated excess and obsolete inventories determined primarily by future demand forecasts. Although we strive for accuracy in our forecasts of future product demand, any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory commitments and on our reported results. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected, additional write-downs and other charges against earnings may be required. If actual market conditions are more favorable, we may realize higher gross profits in the period when the written-down inventory is sold. Historically, our inventory reserves have been sufficient to cover any excess and obsolete exposure and have not required material adjustments in subsequent periods. In the normal course of business we make commitments to our third party contract manufacturers to manage lead times and meet product forecasts, and to other parties to purchase various key components used in the manufacture of our products. We establish accruals for estimated losses on purchased components for which we believe it is probable that they will not be utilized in future operations. To the extent that such forecasts are not achieved, our commitments and associated accruals may change. We are subject to a variety of federal, state, local, and foreign environmental regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge, and disposal of hazardous chemicals used in the manufacture of our products, which may require design changes or recycling of products we manufacture. We will continue to monitor our compliance with these regulations, which may require us to incur higher costs, and adversely impact our operating results. Valuation of Goodwill and Intangibles Purchased intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives unless these lives are determined to be indefinite. In-process research and development is capitalized at fair value and classified as indefinite-lived assets until completion or abandonment and is subject to periodic review for impairment. Accordingly, the allocation of acquisition cost to identifiable intangible assets has a significant impact on our future operating results. The allocation process requires extensive use of estimates and assumptions, including estimates of future cash flows expected to be generated by the acquired assets. Should conditions be different than management assessment, material write-downs of the fair value of intangible assets may be required. We periodically review the estimated remaining useful lives of our intangible assets. A reduction in the estimate of remaining useful life could result in accelerated amortization expense or a write-down in future periods. As such, any future write-downs of these assets would adversely affect our operating results. We perform an annual review of the valuation of goodwill in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or more often if indicators of impairment exist. Triggering events for impairment reviews may be indicators such as adverse industry or economic trends, restructuring actions, lower projections of profitability, or a sustained decline in our market capitalization. Evaluations of possible impairment and, if applicable, adjustments to carrying values require us to estimate, among other factors, future cash flows, useful lives, and fair market values of our reporting units and assets. When we conduct our evaluation of goodwill, the fair value of goodwill is assessed using valuation techniques that require significant management judgment. Should conditions be different from management last assessment, significant write-downs of goodwill may be required, which would adversely affect our operating results. In fiscal 2010 we performed such evaluation and found no impairment of goodwill. Restructuring Reserves We recognize a liability for restructuring costs when the liability is incurred. The restructuring accruals are based upon management estimates at the time they are recorded. These estimates can change depending upon changes in facts and circumstances subsequent to the date the original liability was recorded. The main components of our restructuring charges are workforce reduction, intangibles and fixed assets write-offs and non-cancelable lease costs related to excess facilities. Severance-related charges are accrued when it is determined that a liability has been incurred, which is generally when individuals have been notified of their termination dates and expected severance payments. We record contract cancellation costs when contracts are terminated. The decision to eliminate 39 Table of Contents excess facilities results in charges for lease termination fees and future commitments to pay lease charges, net of estimated future sublease income. We recognize charges for elimination of excess facilities when we have vacated the premises. Intangible asset write-offs consist of impairment of acquired intangible assets related to our decision to cease the development and availability of specific products. Fixed assets write-offs primarily consist of equipment, software and furniture associated with excess facilities being eliminated, and are based on an estimate of the amounts and timing of future cash flows related to the expected future remaining use and ultimate sale or disposal of the equipment and furniture. Our estimates involve a number of risks and uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control, including future real estate market conditions and our ability to successfully enter into subleases or lease termination agreements with terms as favorable as those assumed when arriving at our estimates. We regularly evaluate a number of factors to determine the appropriateness and reasonableness of our restructuring accruals, including the various assumptions noted above. If actual results differ significantly from our estimates, we may be required to adjust our restructuring accruals in the future. Product Warranties Estimated future warranty costs are expensed as a cost of product revenues when revenue is recognized, based on estimates of the costs that may be incurred under our warranty obligations including material, distribution and labor costs. Our accrued liability for estimated future warranty costs is included in other accrued liabilities and other long-term obligations on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Factors that affect our warranty liability include the number of installed units, estimated material costs, estimated distribution costs and estimated labor costs. We periodically assess the adequacy of our warranty accrual and adjust the amount as considered necessary. Stock-Based Compensation We account for stock-based compensation using the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of each option grant on the date of grant. Our option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price volatility, expected term, and forfeiture rate. Any changes in these highly subjective assumptions significantly impact stock-based compensation expense. Loss Contingencies We are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the course of business. We consider the likelihood of the loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss in determining loss contingencies. An estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. We regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted. Fair Value Measurements and Impairments All of our available-for-sale investments and nonmarketable securities are subject to periodic impairment review. Investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be other-than-temporary. This determination requires significant judgment. For publicly traded investments, impairment is determined based upon the specific facts and circumstances present at the time, including factors such as current economic and market conditions, the credit rating of the security issuer, the length of time an investment fair value has been below our carrying value, and our ability and intent to hold investments to maturity or for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value. If an investment decline in fair value, caused by factors other than changes in interest rates, is deemed to be other-than-temporary, we reduce its carrying value to its estimated fair value, as determined based on quoted market prices, liquidation values or other metrics. For investments in publicly held companies, we recognize an impairment charge when the decline in the fair value of our investment is below its cost basis and is judged to be other-than-temporary. The ultimate value realized on these investments is subject to market price volatility until they are sold. 40 Table of Contents Pursuant to the accounting guidance for fair value measurement and its subsequent updates, fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (i.e., the exit price ) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The accounting guidance establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring the use of observable market data when available. Observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on active market data. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the best information available in the circumstances. The fair value hierarchy is broken down into the three input levels summarized below: Level 1 Valuations are based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities, and readily accessible by us at the reporting date. Examples of assets and liabilities utilizing Level 1 inputs are certain money market funds, U.S. Treasuries and trading securities with quoted prices on active markets. Level 2 Valuations based on inputs other than the quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly in active markets. Examples of assets and liabilities utilizing Level 2 inputs are U.S. government agency bonds, corporate bonds, commercial paper, certificates of deposit and over-the-counter derivatives. Level 3 Valuations based on unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require us to develop our own assumptions. Examples of assets and liabilities utilizing Level 3 inputs are cost method investments, auction rate securities (ARS) and the Primary Fund. We measure our available-for-sale securities at fair value on a recurring basis. Available-for-sale securities include U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. government agency bonds, corporate bonds, commercial paper, ARSs, money market funds and certificates of deposit. Where possible, we utilize quoted market prices to measure and such items are classified as Level 1 in the hierarchy. When quoted market prices for identical assets are unavailable, varying valuation techniques are used. Such assets are classified as Level 2 or Level 3 in the hierarchy. We classify items in Level 2 if investments are valued using observable inputs to quoted market prices, benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency. We classify items in Level 3 if investments are valued using a pricing model, based on unobservable inputs in the market or that require us to develop our own assumptions. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the investment. We are also exposed to market risk relating to our available-for-sale investments due to uncertainties in the credit and capital markets. The fair value of our investments may change significantly due to events and conditions in the credit and capital markets. These securities/issuers could be subject to review for possible downgrade. Any downgrade in these credit ratings may result in an additional decline in the estimated fair value of our investments. We monitor and evaluate the accounting for our investment portfolio on a quarterly basis for additional other-than-temporary impairment charges. We actively review current investment ratings, company specific events, and general economic conditions in managing our investments and determining whether there is a significant decline in fair value that is other-than-temporary. As of April 30, 2010 and April 24, 2009, our short-term and long-term investments in marketable securities have been classified as available-for-sale and are carried at fair value. Available-for-sale investments with original maturities of greater than three months at the date of purchases are classified as short-term investments as these investments generally consist of marketable securities that are intended to be available to meet current cash requirements. Currently, all marketable securities held by us are classified as available-for-sale and our entire ARS portfolio is classified as long-term investments. Our ARS portfolio consists of securities with long-term nominal maturities which, in accordance with investment policy guidelines, had credit ratings of AAA and Aaa at the time of purchase. During fiscal 2008, we reclassified all of our investments in ARS from short-term investments to long-term investments as we believed our ability to liquidate these investments in the next twelve months was uncertain. Based on an analysis of the fair value and marketability of these investments, we recorded temporary impairment charges of approximately $3.3 million during fiscal 2010, partially offset by $0.7 million in unrealized gains within other comprehensive income (loss). 41 Table of Contents During fiscal 2009, we recorded temporary impairment charges of approximately $7.0 million, partially offset by $0.3 million in unrealized gains within other comprehensive income (loss). In addition, during fiscal 2009, we recorded an other-than-temporary impairment loss of $2.1 million due to a significant decline in the estimated fair values of certain of our ARS related to credit quality risk and rating downgrades. The valuation models used to estimate the fair value of our ARS included numerous assumptions such as assessments of the underlying structure of each security, expected cash flows, discount rates, credit ratings, workout periods, and overall capital market liquidity. These assumptions, assessments and the interpretations of relevant market data are subject to uncertainties, are difficult to predict and require significant judgment. The use of different assumptions, or applying different judgments to inherently subjective matters and changes in future market conditions could result in significantly different estimates of fair value. There is no assurance as to when the market for auction rate securities will stabilize. The fair value of our ARS could change significantly based on market conditions and continued uncertainties in the credit markets. If these uncertainties continue or if these securities experience credit rating downgrades, we may incur additional temporary impairment related to our auction rate securities portfolio. We will continue to monitor the fair value of our ARS and relevant market conditions and will record additional temporary or other-than-temporary impairments if future circumstances warrant such charges. As a result of the bankruptcy filing of Lehman Brothers, which occurred during fiscal 2009, we recorded an other-than-temporary impairment charge of $11.8 million on our corporate bonds related to investments in Lehman Brothers securities and approximately $9.3 million on our investments in the Primary Fund that held Lehman Brothers investments. During fiscal 2010, we sold our remaining holdings of Lehman Brothers bonds and the Primary Fund made multiple distributions of its assets to its investors, and as of April 30, 2010, we recovered our recorded investment, with the exception of $0.2 million, for which we recognized an additional loss. As of April 30, 2010, we no longer had any direct or indirect investments related to Lehman Brothers and have recognized all related losses in our statement of operations. During fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, recognized gains and losses on available-for-sale investments were not material. Management determines the appropriate classification of investments at the time of purchase and reevaluates the classification at each reporting date. The fair value of our marketable securities, including those included in cash equivalents and long-term investments, was $3,605.2 million and $2,596.6 million as of April 30, 2010 and April 24, 2009, respectively. To determine the fair value of nonmarketable investments, we use the most recent information available to us, including new financings or estimates of current fair value, as well as through traditional valuation techniques. It is our policy to review the fair value of these investments on a regular basis to determine whether the investments in these companies are other-than-temporarily impaired. In the case of privately-held companies, this evaluation is based on information that we request from these companies. If we believe the carrying value of an investment is in excess of fair value, and this difference is other-than-temporary, it is our policy to write down the investment to fair value. The carrying value of our investments in privately-held companies was $1.4 million and $3.9 million as of April 30, 2010 and April 24, 2009, respectively. During fiscal 2010 and 2009, we recorded $3.4 million of gains and $6.3 million of net impairment charges in our consolidated statements of operations, respectively, for our investments in privately-held companies, and adjusted the carrying amount of those investments to fair value, as we deemed the decline in the value of these assets to be other-than-temporary. Income Taxes The determination of our tax provision is subject to judgments and estimates due to the complexity of the tax law that we are subject to in several tax jurisdictions. Earnings derived from our international business are generally taxed at rates that are lower than U.S. rates, resulting in a lower effective tax rate than the U.S. statutory tax rate of 35.0%. The ability to maintain our current effective tax rate is contingent on existing tax laws in both the United States and the respective countries in which our international subsidiaries are located. Future changes in domestic or international tax laws could affect the continued realization of the tax benefits we are currently receiving. In addition, a decrease in the percentage of our total earnings from international business or a change in the mix of international business among particular tax jurisdictions could increase our overall effective tax rate. 42 Table of Contents We account for income taxes by recognizing deferred tax assets and liabilities for the effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. We reduce deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. Tax attributes related to the exercise of employee stock options are not realized until they result in a reduction of taxes payable. We do not include unrealized stock option attributes as components of our gross deferred tax assets and corresponding valuation allowance disclosures. We have provided a valuation allowance of $28.3 million as of April 30, 2010, compared to $28.0 million as of April 24, 2009 and $28.6 million as of April 25, 2008, on certain of our deferred tax assets. The changes in valuation allowance in fiscal 2010 and 2009 were primarily related to changes in the blended state tax rates. The tax effected amounts of gross unrealized net operating loss and business tax credit carryforwards, net of their corresponding valuation allowance at April 30, 2010 are $358.6 million. We recognize tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions by applying a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We recognize the tax liability for uncertain income tax positions on income tax returns based on a two-step process. The first step is to determine whether it is more likely than not that each income tax position would be sustained upon audit. The second step is to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the amount that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority. Estimating these amounts requires us to determine the probability of various possible outcomes. We evaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on the consideration of several factors, including changes in facts or circumstances, changes in applicable tax law, settlement of issues under audit and new exposures. If we later determine that our exposure is lower or that the liability is not sufficient to cover our revised expectations, we adjust the liability and effect a related change in our tax provision during the period in which we make such determination. New Accounting Standards See Note 4 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a full description of new accounting pronouncements, including the respective expected dates of adoption and effects on results of operations and financial condition. 43 Table of Contents Results of Operations The following table sets forth certain Consolidated Statements of Operations data as a percentage of net revenues for the periods indicated: Year Ended April 30, April 24, April 25, 2010 2009 2008 Revenues: Product 60.6 % 63.2 % 67.9 % Software entitlements and maintenance 17.3 18.2 14.7 Service 22.1 22.4 17.4 GSA settlement (3.8 ) Net revenues 100.0 100.0 100.0 Cost of revenues: Cost of product 24.8 29.6 28.4 Cost of software entitlements and maintenance 0.3 0.3 0.3 Cost of service 10.8 11.7 10.4 Gross profit 64.1 58.4 60.9 Operating expenses: Sales and marketing 32.9 34.8 32.6 Research and development 13.6 14.6 13.7 General and administrative 6.1 6.0 5.2 Restructuring and other charges 0.1 1.6 Acquisition related income, net (1.0 ) Total operating expenses 51.7 57.0 51.5 Income from operations 12.4 1.4 9.4 Other income (expenses), net: Interest income 0.9 1.7 2.0 Interest expense (1.9 ) (1.9 ) (0.2 ) Other income (expenses), net (1.0 ) 0.4 Total other income (expenses), net (1.0 ) (1.2 ) 2.2 Income before income taxes 11.4 0.2 11.6 Provision for (benefit from) income taxes 1.2 (1.7 ) 2.2 Net income 10.2 % 1.9 % 9.4 % Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations Net Revenues Our net revenues for fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008 were as follows (in millions, except percentages): Year Ended April 30, 2010 April 24, 2009 % Change April 25, 2008 % Change Net revenues $ 3,931.4 $ 3,406.4 15 % $ 3,303.2 3 % Net revenues increased by $525.0 million, or 15%, in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 and by $103.2 million, or 3% in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008. The increase in our net revenues for fiscal 2010 was primarily related to an increase in product revenues, while the increase in fiscal 2009 was due to increases in software entitlements and 44 Table of Contents maintenance (SEM) and services revenues, partially offset by decreases in product revenues. Additionally, net revenues for fiscal 2009 were negatively impacted by the $128.7 million GSA settlement. Sales through our indirect channels represented 69%, 69% and 63% of net revenues for fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The indirect channel mix for 2009 would have been 3% higher if not for the impact of the GSA settlement. The following table sets forth sales to customers, who are distributors, who accounted for 10% or more of revenues (in millions, except percentages): Year Ended April 30, % of April 24, % of April 25, % of 2010 Revenues 2009 Revenues 2008 Revenues Arrow $ 550.7 14 % $ 360.3 11 % < 10 % < 10 % Avnet 444.0 11 % 356.4 10 % < 10 % < 10 % Product Revenues (in millions, except percentages): Year Ended April 30, 2010 April 24, 2009 % Change April 25, 2008 % Change Product revenues $ 2,381.1 $ 2,152.7 11 % $ 2,242.5 (4 )% Product revenues increased by $228.4 million, or 11%, in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009, and decreased by $89.8 million, or 4% in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008. Our configured systems comprise bundled hardware and software products. Configured systems unit volume increased by 19% in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009, with the largest increase in low-end systems, and increased by 14% in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008, reflecting an increase in low-end systems, partially offset by decreases in mid-range and high-end systems. During fiscal 2010, high-end, midrange and low-end systems generated approximately 23%, 56% and 21% of configured systems revenues, respectively, compared to approximately 24%, 55% and 21%, respectively in fiscal 2009, and approximately 25%, 59% and 16%, respectively, in fiscal 2008. Overall average selling prices (ASPs) declined in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 due primarily to a shift in mix towards low-end systems, as well as lower ASPs per unit in midrange and low-end systems. ASPs declined in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008, due primarily to lower ASPs in all systems ranges and a shift in mix towards low-end systems. In addition, our net add-on hardware, software and other product revenues accounted for an $88.5 million increase in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 and a $102.4 million increase in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 due to customers increasing the capacity of their storage systems. Our systems are highly configurable to respond to customer requirements in the open systems storage markets that we serve. This wide variation in customer configurations can significantly impact revenues, cost of revenues, and gross profit performance. Price changes, unit volumes, customer mix and product configuration can also impact revenues, cost of revenues and gross profit performance. Disks are a significant component of our storage systems. Industry disk pricing continues to fall every year, and we pass along those price decreases to our customers while working to maintain relatively constant profit margins on our disk drives. While our sales price per terabyte continues to decline, improved system performance, increased capacity and software to manage this increased capacity have an offsetting impact on product revenues.

These increases were the result of an increase in the 45 Table of Contents aggregate contract value of the installed base under SEM contracts, which is recognized as revenue ratably over the terms of the underlying contracts. Service Revenues (in millions, except percentages): Year Ended April 30, 2010 April 24, 2009 % Change April 25, 2008 % Change Service revenues $ 870.5 $ 764.1 14 % $ 573.8 33 % Service revenues include hardware maintenance, professional services and educational and training services. Service revenues increased by $106.4 million, or 14%, in fiscal 2010, compared to fiscal 2009 and by $190.3 million, or 33% in fiscal 2009, compared to fiscal 2008. Service maintenance contract revenues increased 20% in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 and increased 35% in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008, as a result of an increase in the installed base of service contracts and the timing of recognition of the related revenue. Professional services and educational and training services revenues increased 4% for fiscal 2010, compared to fiscal 2009, and increased 32% in fiscal 2009, compared to fiscal 2008.

Revenues by Geographic Area (in millions, except percentages): Year Ended April 30, 2010 April 24, 2009 % Change April 25, 2008 % Change Americas (United States, Canada and Latin America)* $ 2,208.1 $ 1,805.2 22 % $ 1,829.4 (1 )% Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) 1,329.1 1,213.3 11 % 1,083.8 12 % Asia Pacific and Japan (APAC) 394.2 387.9 1 % 390.0 (0 )% Net revenues $ 3,931.4 $ 3,406.4 $ 3,303.2 * Sales to the United States accounted for 89%, 90% and 91% of Americas revenues in fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Revenues from the Americas geographic area increased by $402.9 million in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009, due to an increase in gross revenues of $531.6 million and the negative impact in fiscal 2009 of the $128.7 million GSA settlement. Sales to Germany accounted for 11% of net revenues in each of fiscal 2010 and 2009, and less than 10% of net revenues in fiscal 2008. No other single foreign country accounted for ten percent or more of net revenues in any of the years presented. Cost of Revenues Our cost of revenues consists of three elements: (1) cost of product revenues, which includes the costs of manufacturing and shipping of our storage systems, amortization of purchased intangible assets, inventory write-downs, and warranty costs; (2) cost of software maintenance and entitlements, which includes the costs of providing software entitlements and maintenance and third party royalty costs, and (3) cost of service, which reflects costs 46 Table of Contents associated with providing support center activities for hardware, global support partnership programs, professional services and educational and training services. Our gross profits are impacted by a variety of factors including pricing and discount practices, channel sales mix, revenue mix and product material costs. Service gross profit is also typically impacted by factors such as changes in the size of our installed base of products, as well as the timing of support service initiations and renewals, and incremental investments in our customer support infrastructure. If our shipment volumes, product and services mix, average selling prices and pricing actions that impact our gross profit are adversely affected, whether by economic uncertainties or for other reasons, our gross profit could decline. Cost of Product Revenues (in millions, except percentages): Year Ended April 30, 2010 April 24, 2009 % Change April 25, 2008 % Change Cost of product revenues $ 976.4 $ 1,007.6 (3 )% $ 938.4 7 % Cost of product revenues decreased by $31.2 million, or 3%, in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 as a result of lower materials costs, warranty costs and demonstration equipment reserves, partially offset by higher unit volume. Cost of product revenues increased by $69.2 million, or 7%, in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008, primarily due to increased materials cost as a result of increased unit volume and higher per unit costs in all products ranges. The decrease in cost of product revenues in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 reflected a decrease in materials costs of $9.9 million despite an increase in total units shipped. Our material costs were favorably impacted in fiscal 2010 by lower average per unit materials costs in our midrange and low-end systems due to favorable materials pricing, which we expect to continue. These favorable impacts were offset by higher unit volume and higher average per unit materials costs in our high-end systems. In addition, our cost of product revenues were favorably impacted in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 as a result of a decrease of $11.3 million in warranty costs and $8.6 million in reserves for evaluation equipment due to higher than anticipated sales of such equipment to customers. Cost of product revenues were negatively impacted in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 as a result of approximately $9.7 million of incremental inventory writedowns. Cost of product revenues represented 41% of product revenue for 2010 compared to 47% for 2009, and 42% in fiscal 2008. The overall reduction of costs as a percentage of revenues in fiscal 2010 was the result of per unit materials cost reductions outpacing sales price reductions. The increase in materials costs as a percentage of revenues in fiscal 2009 reflected higher per unit materials costs compared to the prior year. Cost of product revenues increased (decreased) due to the following: Year % Change Year % Change Fiscal 2009 to Fiscal 2008 to Fiscal 2010 Fiscal 2009 Materials costs 1 % 6 % Excess and obsolete inventory (2 ) 1 Warranty (1 ) Other (1 ) Total change (3 )% 7 % Cost of Software Entitlements and Maintenance Revenues (in millions, except percentages): Year Ended April 30, 2010 April 24, 2009 % Change April 25, 2008 % Change Cost of software entitlements and maintenance revenues $ 12.3 $ 9.2 34 % $ 8.6 7 % 47 Table of Contents Cost of SEM revenues increased due to the following: Year % Change Year % Change Fiscal 2009 to Fiscal 2008 to Fiscal 2010 Fiscal 2009 Field service engineering costs 29 % 30 % Royalties 5 (23 ) Total change 34 % 7 % Cost of SEM revenues increased by $3.1 million, or 34%, in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 and increased by $0.6 million, or 7%, in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 due to an increase in field service engineering costs. Cost of SEM revenues represented 2% of SEM revenues for each of the fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Cost of Service Revenues (in millions, except percentages): Year Ended April 30, 2010 April 24, 2009 % Change April 25, 2008 % Change Cost of service revenues $ 423.5 $ 399.7 6 % $ 342.8 17 % Cost of service revenues increased by $23.8 million, or 6%, in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 due to increased commissions and incentive compensation plan expenses, as well as an increase in service and support purchased from third parties, and increased by $56.9 million, or 17%, in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 due to increases in professional support engineer costs, support center activities, and global service partnership programs. Costs represented 49%, 52% and 60%, respectively, of service revenues for fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008. The decrease in service cost of revenues as a percentage of service revenue was primarily due to improved productivity. Operating Expenses Sales and Marketing, Research and Development, and General and Administrative Expenses Compensation costs comprise the largest component of operating expenses. Included in compensation costs are salaries and related benefits, stock-based compensation costs and employee incentive compensation plan costs. Compensation costs included in operating expenses increased approximately $108.6 million, or 11%, during fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009, primarily due to (i) a $75.6 million increase in employee incentive compensation due to stronger operating profit performance, (ii) a $16.4 million increase in stock based compensation, and (iii) a $16.5 million increase in salaries, benefits and other compensation related costs. In addition, sales and marketing expenses reflected an increase in commissions expense of $60.7 million during fiscal 2010, reflecting stronger sales performance compared to fiscal 2009. Compensation costs included in operating expenses increased approximately $111.4 million, or 12%, during fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008, primarily due to (i) an $113.1 million increase in salaries, benefits and other compensation related costs, reflecting an increase in average headcount and (ii) a $7.3 million increase in employee incentive compensation, partially offset by a $9.0 million decrease in stock-based compensation expense.

In December 2008, we announced our decision to cease the development and availability of SnapMirror for Open Systems (SMOS), which was originally acquired through our acquisition of Topio in fiscal 2007. As part of this decision, we also announced the closure of our engineering facility in Haifa, Israel. These restructuring activities resulted in restructuring charges in fiscal 2009 totaling $51.5 million of severance-related amounts and other charges attributable to the termination of approximately 450 regular positions, abandoned excess facilities, charges relating to non-cancelable lease costs, (which are net of expected sublease income); contract cancellation charges; outplacement expenses; fixed assets and intangibles write-offs; as well as $2.9 million of other charges to support our restructuring initiatives. In fiscal 2010, we recorded additional charges of $2.5 million primarily related to adjustments to future lease commitments and employee severance costs associated with our fiscal 2009 restructuring plan. In recording the facility lease restructuring reserve, we made certain estimates and assumptions related to the (i) time period over which the relevant buildings would remain vacant, (ii) sublease terms, and (iii) sublease rates. Fiscal 2002 Restructuring Plan As of April 30, 2010, we had $0.5 million remaining in facility restructuring reserves established as part of a restructuring in fiscal 2002 related to future lease commitments on exited facilities, net of expected sublease income. We reevaluate our estimates and assumptions periodically and make adjustments as necessary based on the time period over which the facilities will be vacant, expected sublease terms, and expected sublease rates. As of April 30, 2010, the remaining balance of the restructuring reserve related to the fiscal 2009 and 2002 restructuring plans consisted of approximately $4.1 million of facilities-related lease payments, which we expect to be substantially paid by January 2013. See Note 13 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our restructuring activities.

(Data Domain) under which we would acquire Data Domain in a stock and cash transaction. On July 8, 2009, Data Domain Board of Directors terminated the merger agreement and pursuant to the terms of the agreement, Data Domain paid us a $57.0 million termination fee. We incurred $15.9 million of incremental third-party costs relating to the terminated merger transaction during the same period, resulting in net proceeds of $41.1 million recorded in the consolidated statement of operations during fiscal 2010. During fiscal 2010, we paid $1.2 million of acquisition related expenses related to the acquisition of Bycast Inc. (see Note 20 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements). Other Income and Expense Interest Income (in millions, except percentages): Year Ended April 30, 2010 April 24, 2009 % Change April 25, 2008 % Change Interest income $ 31.2 $ 57.6 (46 )% $ 64.6 (11 )% The decrease in interest income for fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009, and in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008, was primarily due to lower market yields on our cash and investment portfolio. In fiscal 2009, this yield decline was partially offset by an increase in our cash and investment balances due to the issuance of the Convertible Notes (the Note ), (see Note 10 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements). Interest Expense (in millions, except percentages): Year Ended April 30, 2010 April 24, 2009 % Change April 25, 2008 % Change Interest expense $ (74.1 ) $ (63.4 ) 17 % $ (8.0 ) 693 % Interest expense increased $10.7 million for fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009, primarily due to interest expense on our 1.75% Notes, issued on June 10, 2008, which were outstanding for the full year ended April 30, 2010 but only a partial period in the prior year. During fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009, we recognized approximately $50.8 million and $41.0 million, respectively, in incremental non-cash interest expense from the amortization of debt discount and issuance costs relating to our Notes. The coupon interest expense related to the Notes was $22.5 million and $19.4 million, respectively, for fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009. The increase in interest expense in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 was primarily due to interest expense and amortization of debt issuance costs on our Notes, partially offset by lower interest expense related to the reduced outstanding balance on our secured credit agreement we entered into with JPMorgan in October 2007.

Other expenses included $5.3 in net losses on foreign currency transactions and related hedging activities, partially offset by other income of $2.9 million. 51 Table of Contents Other income (expense), net in fiscal 2009 included a net impairment loss related to our investments in privately held companies of $6.3 million, an other-than-temporary impairment charge on our available-for-sale investments related to direct and indirect investments in Lehman Brothers securities of $21.1 million, and an other-than-temporary decline in the value of our ARS of $2.1 million. Other expenses included $5.0 in net exchange losses from foreign currency transactions and related hedging activities, partially offset by other income of $1.4 million. Other income (expense), net in fiscal 2008 consisted primarily of a gain of $13.6 million related to the sale of shares of Blue Coat common stock, partially offset by a net impairment of $1.0 million for our investments in privately-held companies.

Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2010 was 10.4%, compared to an effective tax benefit of 681.5% for fiscal 2009 and an effective tax rate of 19.1% for fiscal 2008. Our effective tax rate reflects our corporate legal entity structure and the global nature of our business with a significant amount of our profits generated and taxed in foreign jurisdictions at rates below the U.S. statutory tax rate. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2010 was favorably impacted by the geographic mix of profits. The tax benefit rate for fiscal 2009 reflected losses generated in the U.S. during that period that were partially offset by profits generated in foreign tax jurisdictions where the tax rates were below the U.S. statutory rate. The effective tax rate of 10.4% in fiscal 2010 included a benefit of $105.3 million, or 23.5 percentage points, related to foreign income tax rates that are lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35%, a benefit of $7.8 million, or 1.7 percentage points, related to research and development tax credits, a benefit of $2.6 million, or 0.6 percentages points, related to stock-based compensation, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of $2.6 million, or 0.6 percentage points, related to state income taxes. The effective tax benefit of 681.5% for fiscal 2009 included the benefit of $51.0 million, or 616.8 percentage points, related to foreign income tax rates that are lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35%, a benefit of $9.2 million, or 111.1 percentage points, related to research and development tax credits, a benefit of $7.9 million, or 95.5 percentage points, related to state income taxes, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of $10.2 million, or 122.9 percentage points, related to stock-based compensation. The effective tax rate of 19.1% for fiscal 2008 included a benefit of $67.6 million, or 17.7 percentage points, related to foreign income tax rates that are lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate, a benefit of $4.7 million, or 1.2 percentage points, related to research and development tax credits, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of $11.02 million, or 2.9 percentages points, related to stock-based compensation, and $2.2 million, or 0.6 percentage points, related to state income taxes. Liquidity and Capital Resources The following sections discuss our principal liquidity requirements, as well as our sources and uses of cash flows on our liquidity and capital resources. The principal objectives of our investment policy are the preservation of principal and maintenance of liquidity. We attempt to mitigate default risk by investing in high-quality investment grade securities, limiting the time to maturity and by monitoring the counter-parties and underlying obligors closely. We believe our cash equivalents and short-term investments are liquid and accessible. We are not aware of any significant deterioration in the fair value of our cash equivalents or investments from the values reported as of April 30, 2010. 52 Table of Contents Liquidity Sources, Cash Requirements Our principal sources of liquidity as of April 30, 2010 consisted of approximately $3.7 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments and cash we expect to generate from operations. Cash, cash equivalents and investments consist of the following: April 30, 2010 April 24, 2009 Cash and cash equivalents $ 1,705.0 $ 1,494.2 Short-term investments 2,019.0 1,110.1 Long-term investments and restricted cash 72.8 127.3 Total cash, cash equivalents and investments $ 3,796.8 $ 2,731.6 Our principal liquidity requirements are primarily to meet our working capital needs, support ongoing business activities, research and development, capital expenditure needs, investment in critical or complementary technologies, and to service our debt and synthetic leases. Key factors that could affect our cash flows include changes in our revenue mix and profitability, as well as our ability to effectively manage our working capital, in particular, accounts receivable and inventories. Based on our current business outlook, we believe that our sources of cash will satisfy our working capital needs, capital expenditures, investment requirements, stock repurchases, contractual obligations, commitments, interest payments on our Notes and other liquidity requirements associated with operations and meet our cash requirements for at least the next 12 months. However, in the event our liquidity is insufficient, we may be required to further curtail spending and implement additional cost saving measures and restructuring actions. In light of the current economic and market conditions, we cannot be certain that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above current levels or that we will be able to obtain additional financing, if necessary, on satisfactory terms, if at all. Our contractual obligations as of April 30, 2010 are summarized below in the Contractual Obligations tables. Our investment portfolio, including auction rate securities has been and will continue to be exposed to market risk due to trends in the credit and capital markets. However, we are not dependent on liquidating these investments in the next twelve months in order to meet our liquidity needs. We continue to closely monitor current economic and market events to minimize our market risk on our investment portfolio. Based on our ability to access our cash and short-term investments, our expected operating cash flows, and our other potential sources of cash, we do not anticipate that the lack of liquidity of these investments will impact our ability to fund working capital needs, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other cash requirements. We intend to and believe that we have the ability to hold these investments until the market recovers. If current market conditions deteriorate, we may be required to record additional charges to earnings in future periods. Capital Expenditure Requirements We expect to fund our capital expenditures, including our commitments related to facilities and equipment operating leases, over the next few years through existing cash, cash equivalents, investments and cash generated from operations. The timing and amount of our capital requirements cannot be precisely determined at this time and will depend on a number of factors including future demand for products, product mix, changes in the network storage industry, hiring plans and our decisions related to financing our facilities requirement. We expect that our existing facilities and those being developed in Sunnyvale, California; RTP, North Carolina; and worldwide are adequate for our requirements over at least the next two years and that additional space will be available as needed. Acquisition Related Requirements On April 6, 2010, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Bycast Inc. for approximately $80 million in cash. The merger was completed on May 13, 2010. 53 Table of Contents Cash Flows As of April 30, 2010, compared to April 24, 2009, our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments increased by $1.1 billion to $3.7 billion. The increase in cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments was primarily a result of cash provided by operating activities and issuances of common stock related to employee stock option exercises and employee stock purchase plan, partially offset by capital expenditures. We derive our liquidity and capital resources primarily from our cash flow from operations and from working capital. Days sales outstanding as of April 30, 2010 decreased to 37 days, compared to 46 days as of April 24, 2009, primarily due to improvements in shipment linearity and collections performance. Working capital increased by $0.9 billion to $2.6 billion as of April 30, 2010, compared to $1.8 billion as of April 24, 2009, primarily due to an increase in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1.1 billion. Cash Flows from Operating Activities During fiscal 2010 and 2009, we generated cash flows from operating activities of $975.0 million and $889.2 million, respectively. The primary sources of cash from operations in fiscal 2010 consisted of net income of $400.4 million, adjusted by non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $159.8 million and depreciation and amortization expense of $166.0 million. Significant changes in assets and liabilities impacting operating cash flows in fiscal 2010 included an increase in deferred revenue of $176.7 million, and an increase in accrued compensation and other current liabilities of $53.2 million. The primary sources of cash from operations in fiscal 2009 consisted of net income of $64.6 million, adjusted by non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $140.8 million, depreciation and amortization expense of $170.5 million and a deferred tax provision of $124.6 million. Significant changes in assets and liabilities impacting operating cash flows in fiscal 2009 included a decrease in accounts receivable of $128.7 million, an increase in deferred revenue of $219.3 million, and an increase in other current liabilities of $128.7 million related to the GSA settlement. We expect that cash provided by operating activities may fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors, including fluctuations in our operating results, shipment linearity, accounts receivable collections performance, inventory and supply chain management, tax benefits from stock-based compensation, and the timing and amount of compensation and other payments. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Capital expenditures for fiscal 2010 were $135.6 million, which included the purchase of fifteen acres of land in Bangalore, India for approximately $28.5 million, compared to $289.6 million in fiscal 2009. We paid $860.3 million for net purchases and redemptions of short-term investments in fiscal 2010, compared to $116.8 million in fiscal 2009. In addition, in fiscal 2009 we reclassified $598.0 million of cash equivalents related to the Primary Fund to short-term investments. Cash Flows from Financing Activities We received $219.9 million and $696.6 million from financing activities in fiscal 2010 and 2009, respectively. Proceeds from employee equity award plans, net of shares withheld for taxes were $197.1 million in fiscal 2010, compared to $85.9 million in fiscal 2009. In fiscal 2010, we received $14.2 million from the settlement of a Note hedge with Lehman Brothers. In fiscal 2009, we issued $1.265 billion of convertible notes, received proceeds of $163.1 million for sale of related common stock warrants, and paid $254.9 million for purchase of related note hedges, made repayments of $172.6 million against our Secured Credit Agreement and the Term Loan and repurchased 17.0 million shares of common stock for a total of $400.0 million. Net proceeds from the issuance of common stock related to employee participation in employee equity award programs have historically been a significant component of our liquidity. The extent to which our employees exercise stock options or participate in our ESPP program generally increases or decreases based upon changes in the market price of our common stock. As a result, our cash flow resulting from the issuance of common stock in connection with these programs and related tax benefits will vary. 54 Table of Contents Stock Repurchase Program At April 30, 2010, $1.1 billion remained available for future repurchases under plans approved as of that date. The stock repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time. Convertible Notes As of April 30, 2010, we had $1.265 billion principal amount of 1.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2013 (See Note 10 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements). The Notes will mature on June 1, 2013, unless earlier repurchased or converted. As of April 30, 2010, the Notes have not been repurchased or converted. We also have not received any shares under the related Note hedges or delivered cash or shares under the related warrants. Credit Facility Effective December 22, 2009, we terminated our senior unsecured credit agreement as further discussed in Note 10 of the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. Contractual Obligations The following summarizes our contractual obligations at April 30, 2010 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods (in millions): 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Thereafter Total Contractual Obligations: Office operating lease payments $ 26.7 $ 22.3 $ 17.8 $ 15.1 $ 13.0 $ 20.4 $ 115.3 Real estate lease payments(1) 3.6 3.6 129.5 136.7 Less: sublease income (5.8 ) (0.8 ) (0.6 ) (0.4 ) (0.2 ) (7.8 ) Equipment operating lease payments 24.3 10.7 4.6 0.4 40.0 Purchase commitments with contract manufacturers(2) 139.4 3.6 3.6 1.2 0.2 148.0 Other purchase obligations(3) 49.4 10.2 3.4 0.3 63.3 1.75% Convertible notes(4) 22.1 22.1 22.1 1,276.1 1,342.4 Total by period $ 259.7 $ 71.7 $ 180.4 $ 1,292.7 $ 13.0 $ 20.4 $ 1,837.9 Uncertain tax positions(5) 122.4 Total Contractual Obligations $ 1,960.3 Other Commercial Commitments: Letters of credit $ 4.1 $ 0.4 $ $ $ $ 0.6 $ 5.1 Some of the figures we include in this table are based on management estimates and assumptions about these obligations, including their duration, the possibility of renewal or termination, anticipated actions by management and third parties and other factors. Because these estimates and assumptions are necessarily subjective, our actual future obligations may vary from those reflected in the table. (1) Included in real estate lease payments pursuant to four financing arrangements with BNP Paribas LLC (BNPPLC) are (i) lease commitments of $3.6 million in each of the fiscal years 2011 and 2012; and $2.4 million in fiscal 2013, which are based on either the LIBOR rate at April 30, 2010 plus a spread or a fixed rate for terms of five years, and (ii) at the expiration or termination of the lease, a supplemental payment obligation equal to our minimum guarantee of $127.1 million in the event that we elect not to purchase or arrange for sale of the buildings. (2) Contract manufacturer commitments consist of obligations for on hand inventories and non-cancelable purchase order with our contract manufacturer. We record a liability for firm, noncancelable, and nonreturnable 55 Table of Contents purchase commitments for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts, which is consistent with the valuation of our excess and obsolete inventory. As of April 30, 2010, the liability for these purchase commitments in excess of future demand was approximately $3.8 million and is recorded in other current liabilities. (3) Purchase obligations represent an estimate of all open purchase orders and contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business, other than commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers, for which we have not received the goods or services. Purchase obligations do not include contracts that may be cancelled without penalty. Although open purchase orders are considered enforceable and legally binding, the terms generally allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to the delivery of goods or performance of services. (4) Included in these amounts are obligations related to the $1.265 billion principal amount of 1.75% Notes due 2013 (see Note 10 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements). Estimated interest payments for the Notes are $77.4 million for fiscal 2011 through fiscal 2014. (5) As of April 30, 2010, our liability for uncertain tax positions was $122.4 million, which due to the uncertainty of the timing of future payments, are presented in the total column on a separate line in this table. As of April 30, 2010, we have four leasing arrangements (Leasing Arrangements 1, 2, 3 and 4) with BNPPLC which requires us to lease certain of our land to BNPPLC for a period of 99 years and to lease approximately 0.6 million square feet of office space for our headquarters in Sunnyvale, which had an original cost of $149.6 million. Under these leasing arrangements, we pay BNPPLC minimum lease payments, which vary based on LIBOR plus a spread or a fixed rate on the costs of the facilities on the respective lease commencement dates. We make payments for each of the leases for a term of five years. We have the option to renew each of the leases for two consecutive five-year periods upon approval by BNPPLC. Upon expiration (or upon any earlier termination) of the lease terms, we must elect one of the following options: (i) purchase the buildings from BNPPLC at cost; (ii) if certain conditions are met, arrange for the sale of the buildings by BNPPLC to a third party for an amount equal to at least 85% of the costs (residual guarantee), and be liable for any deficiency between the net proceeds received from the third party and such amounts; or (iii) pay BNPPLC supplemental payments for an amount equal to at least 85% of the costs (residual guarantee), in which event we may recoup some or all of such payments by arranging for a sale of each or all buildings by BNPPLC during the ensuing two-year period. The following table summarizes the costs, the residual guarantee, the applicable LIBOR plus spread or fixed rate at April 30, 2010 and the date we began to make payments for each of our leasing arrangements (in millions): LIBOR Plus Lease Leasing Residual Spread or Commencement Arrangements Cost Guarantee Fixed Rate Date Term 1 $ 48.5 $ 41.2 3.99 % January 2008 5 years 2 $ 80.0 $ 68.0 1.08 % December 2007 5 years 3 $ 10.5 $ 8.9 3.97 % December 2007 5 years 4 $ 10.6 $ 9.0 3.99 % December 2007 5 years All leases require us to maintain specified financial covenants with which we were in compliance as of April 30, 2010. Such financial covenants include a maximum ratio of Total Debt to Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization and a minimum amount of Unencumbered Cash and Short-Term Investments. Our failure to comply with these financial covenants could result in a default under the leases which, subject to our right and ability to exercise our purchase option, would give BNPPLC the right to, among other things, (i) terminate our possession of the leased property and require us to pay lease termination damages and other amounts as set forth in the lease agreements, or (ii) exercise certain foreclosure remedies. If we were to exercise our purchase option, or be required to pay lease termination damages, these payments would significantly reduce our available liquidity, which could constrain our operating flexibility. As of April 30, 2010, we estimated that the fair value of the properties under synthetic lease was $36.9 million less than their aggregate residual guarantees. We are accruing for this deficiency over the remaining terms of the respective leases. 56 Table of Contents We may from time to time terminate one or more of our leasing arrangements and repay amounts outstanding in order to meet our operating or other objectives. Legal Contingencies On September 5, 2007, we filed a patent infringement lawsuit in the Eastern District of Texas seeking compensatory damages and a permanent injunction against Sun Microsystems. On October 25, 2007, Sun Microsystems filed a counter claim against us in the Eastern District of Texas seeking compensatory damages and a permanent injunction. On October 29, 2007, Sun filed a second lawsuit against us in the Northern District of California asserting additional patents against us. The Texas court granted a joint motion to transfer the Texas lawsuit to the Northern District of California on November 26, 2007. On March 26, 2008, Sun filed a third lawsuit in federal court that extends the patent infringement charges to storage management technology we acquired in January 2008. In January 2010, Oracle acquired Sun. The three lawsuits are currently in the discovery and motion phase and no trial dates have been set, so we are unable at this time to determine the likely outcome of these various patent litigations. In addition, as we are unable to reasonably estimate the amount or range of the potential settlement, no accrual has been recorded as of April 30, 2010. In addition, we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims which have arisen or may arise in the normal course of business. While the outcome of these legal matters is currently not determinable, we do not believe that any current litigation or claims will have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow, operating results, or financial condition. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements During the ordinary course of business, we provide standby letters of credit or other guarantee instruments to third parties as required for certain transactions initiated either by us or our subsidiaries. As of April 30, 2010, our financial guarantees of $5.1 million that were not recorded on our balance sheet consisted of standby letters of credit related to workers compensation, a customs guarantee, a corporate credit card program, foreign rent guarantees and surety bonds, which were primarily related to self-insurance. We use derivative instruments to manage exposures to foreign currency risk. Our primary objective in holding derivatives is to reduce the volatility of earnings and cash flows associated with changes in foreign currency. The program is not designated for trading or speculative purposes. Currently, we do not enter into any foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge exposures related to firm commitments or nonmarketable investments. Our major foreign currency exchange exposures and related hedging programs are described below: We utilize monthly foreign currency forward and options contracts to hedge exchange rate fluctuations related to certain foreign monetary assets and liabilities. We use currency forward contracts to hedge exposures related to forecasted sales denominated in certain foreign currencies. These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges and in general closely match the underlying forecasted transactions in duration. As of April 30, 2010, our notional fair value of foreign exchange forward and foreign currency option contracts totaled $484.2 million. We do not believe that these derivatives present significant credit risks, because of the short term maturity of the outstanding contracts at any point in time, the counterparties to the derivatives consist of major financial institutions, and we manage the notional amount of contracts entered into with any one counterparty. Other than the risk associated with the financial condition of the counterparties, our maximum exposure related to foreign currency forward and option contracts is limited to the premiums paid. See Note 12 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for more information related to our hedging activities. In the ordinary course of business, we enter into recourse lease financing arrangements with third-party leasing companies and from time to time provide guarantees for a portion of other financing arrangements under which we could be called upon to make payments to the third-party funding companies in the event of nonpayment by end-user customers. See Note 18 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for more information related to these financing arrangements. 57 Table of Contents We enter into indemnification agreements with third parties in the ordinary course of business. Generally, these indemnification agreements require us to reimburse losses suffered by the third party due to various events, such as lawsuits arising from patent or copyright infringement. These indemnification obligations are considered off-balance sheet arrangements under accounting guidance. We have commitments related to four lease arrangements with BNPPLC for approximately 0.6 million square feet of office space for our headquarters in Sunnyvale, California (as further described above under Contractual Obligations ). We have evaluated our accounting for these leases as required by guidance on accounting for variable interest entities and have determined the following: BNPPLC is a leasing company for BNP Paribas in the United States. BNPPLC is not a special purpose entity organized for the sole purpose of facilitating the leases to us. The obligation to absorb expected losses and receive expected residual returns rests with the parent, BNP Paribas. Therefore, we are not the primary beneficiary of BNPPLC as we do not absorb the majority of BNPPLC expected losses or expected residual returns; and BNPPLC has represented in the related closing agreements that the fair value of the property leased to us by BNPPLC is less than half of the total of the fair values of all assets of BNPPLC, excluding any assets of BNPPLC held within a silo. Further, the property leased to NetApp is not held within a silo. The definition of held within a silo means that BNPPLC has obtained funds equal to or in excess of 95% of the fair value of the leased asset to acquire or maintain its investment in such asset through nonrecourse financing or other contractual arrangements, the effect of which is to leave such asset (or proceeds thereof) as the only significant asset of BNPPLC at risk for the repayment of such funds. Accordingly, under current accounting guidance, we are not required to consolidate either the leasing entity or the specific assets that we lease under the BNPPLC lease. Our future minimum lease payments and residual guarantees under these real estate leases will amount to a total of $136.7 million as discussed in above in Contractual Obligations .
