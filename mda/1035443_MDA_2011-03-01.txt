ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties regarding events, conditions, and financial trends that may affect our future plans of operation, business strategy, results of operations, and financial position. A number of important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those included within or contemplated by such forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, those described under Item 1. Business in this annual report on Form 10-K. We do not undertake any responsibility to update any of these factors or to announce publicly any revisions to any of the forward-looking statements contained in this or any other document, whether as a result of new i nformation, future events, or otherwise. Overview We are a Maryland corporation formed in October 1994 that has elected to be taxed as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. We are the largest owner and preeminent REIT focused principally on cluster development through the ownership, operation, management, selective acquisition, development, and redevelopment of properties containing life science laboratory space. We are the leading provider of high-quality, environmentally sustainable real estate, technical infrastructure, and services to the broad and diverse life science industry. Client tenants include institutional (universities and independent not-for-profit institutions), pharmaceutical, biotechnology, medical device, product, service, and government agencies. Our primary business objective is to maximize stockholder value by providing our stockholders with the greatest possible total return based on a multi - -faceted platform of internal and external growth. Our operating platform is based on the principle of clustering, with assets and operations located adjacent to life science entities driving growth and technological advances within each cluster. As of December 31, 2010, we had 167 properties approximating 13.7 million rentable square feet consisting of 162 properties approximating 13.2 million rentable square feet (including spaces undergoing active redevelopment) and five properties undergoing ground-up development approximating an additional 475,818 rentable square feet. Our operating properties were approximately 94.3% leased as of December 31, 2010. Our primary sources of revenues are rental income and tenant recoveries from leases of our properties. The comparability of financial data from period to period is affected by the timing of our property acquisition, development, and redevelopment activities. In 2010, we: Executed 142 leases for 2,744,000 rentable square feet, including 712,000 rentable square feet of redevelopment and development space; Reported occupancy of operating properties at approximately 94%, and occupancy of operating and redevelopment properties at approximately 89% as of December 31, 2010; Repaid eight secured loans approximating $119 million, retired substantially all $240 million of 8% Unsecured Convertible Notes, and repurchased approximately $83 million of 3.7% Unsecured Convertible Notes; Acquired seven properties in various markets aggregating approximately 980,000 rentable square feet for an aggregate purchase price of $318 million; Repaid debt with proceeds from sales of one property and land parcels for an aggregate sales price of $290 million at an aggregate gain of $59 million; Completed the redevelopment of multiple spaces at nine properties aggregating 303,000 rentable square feet; Completed the ground-up development of three properties aggregating 553,000 rentable square feet; Commenced the ground-up development of two fully leased properties aggregating approximately 220,000 rentable square feet pursuant to long term leases; and Obtained final zoning approval for Alexandria Center at Kendall Square located in East Cambridge, Massachusetts, an 11.3-acre development with 1.9 million rentable square feet of life science and other space. In January 2011, we extended the maturity date and increased commitments on our unsecured credit facility from $1.9 billion to $2.25 billion; and In February 2011, we closed on an unsecured term loan for $250 million maturing in January 2015 assuming we exercise our sole right to extend the maturity date by 11 months. 43 Table of Contents 2010 demonstrated the strength and durability of our core operations providing life science laboratory space to the broad and diverse life science industry. Our core operating results were relatively steady for the year ended December 31, 2010, during the continuing extraordinary and unprecedented United States and worldwide economic, financial, banking and credit market crisis, significant worldwide economic recession, and the drastic decline in consumer confidence and the consumer driven economy. The economic, financial and banking environment, and consumer confidence have improved since the depth of the crisis in the fourth quarter of 2008 and first quarter of 2009. Even with the recent improvements, we remain cautious regarding the economic, financial and banking environment. We intend to continue to focus on the completion of our existing active redevelopment projects aggregating approximately 755,463 rentable square feet and our existing active development projects aggregating approximately an additional 475,818 rentable square feet. Additionally, we intend to continue with preconstruction activities for certain land parcels for future ground-up development in order to preserve and create value for these projects. These important preconstruction activities add significant value to our land for future ground-up development and are required for the ultimate vertical construction of the buildings. We also intend to be very careful and prudent with any future decisions to add new projects to our active ground-up developments. Future ground-up development projects will likely require significant pre-leasing from high-quality and/or creditworthy entities. We also intend to continue to reduce debt as a percentage of our overall capital structure over a multi-year period. During this period, we may also extend and/or refinance certain debt maturities. We expect the source of funds for construction activities and repayment of outstanding debt to be provided over several years by opportunistic sales of real estate, joint ventures, cash flows from operations, new secured or unsecured debt and the issuance of additional equity securities, as appropriate. As of December 31, 2010, we had identified one asset as held for sale, which has been classified in discontinued operations. As of December 31, 2010, we had 167 properties containing approximately 13.7 million rentable square feet of life science laboratory space including approximately 755,463 rentable square feet of space undergoing a permanent change in use to life science laboratory space through redevelopment. Our operating properties were approximately 94.3% leased as of December 31, 2010. In addition, as of December 31, 2010, our asset base contained properties undergoing ground-up development approximating 475,818 rentable square feet. The following table is a summary of our properties as of December 31, 2010 (dollars in thousands): Rentable Square Feet Number of Annualized Occupancy Markets Operating Redevelopment Development Total Properties Base Rent (1) Percentage (1)(2) California San Diego 2,043,199 419,722 123,430 2,586,351 36 $ 63,569 93.1 % California San Francisco Bay 1,879,290 255,388 2,134,678 22 67,098 95.8 Greater Boston 3,250,589 210,660 3,461,249 38 121,277 93.6 NYC/New Jersey/Suburban Philadelphia 747,292 747,292 9 33,747 85.8 Southeast 713,221 30,000 97,000 840,221 13 15,484 93.4 Suburban Washington, D.C. 2,458,299 95,081 2,553,380 32 53,327 95.8 Washington Seattle 997,205 997,205 12 34,461 97.5 International 342,394 342,394 4 8,995 100.0 Subtotal 12,431,489 755,463 475,818 13,662,770 166 $ 397,958 94.3 % Discontinued Operations/ Held for Sale 21,000 21,000 1 Total 12,452,489 755,463 475,818 13,683,770 167 (1) Annualized base rent means the annualized fixed base rental amount in effect as of December 31, 2010 (using rental revenue computed on a straight-line basis in accordance with GAAP). Represents annualized base rent related to our operating rentable square feet. (2) Occupancy percentages relate to our operating properties. Including spaces undergoing redevelopment, occupancy as of December 31, 2010 was 88.9%. 44 Table of Contents Our primary sources of revenue are rental income and tenant recoveries (consisting of reimbursement of real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, repairs and maintenance, and other operating expenses from certain tenants) from leases of our properties. The comparability of financial data from period to period is affected by the timing of our property acquisition, development, and redevelopment activities. Of the 167 properties owned as of December 31, 2010, we acquired seven properties and commenced the ground-up development of one property in 2010, we commenced the ground-up development of one property in 2009, we acquired two properties in 2008, and we acquired 135 properties and commenced the ground-up development of 21 properties prior to 2008. As a result of these acquisitions and ground-up development projects, as well as our ongoing redevelopment and leasing activiti es, there have been significant increases in total revenues and expenses, including significant increases in total revenues and expenses for 2010 as compared to 2009 as well as 2009 as compared to 2008. Our operating expenses generally consist of real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, common area, and other operating expenses. Leasing For the year ended December 31, 2010, we executed a total of 142 leases for approximately 2,744,000 rentable square feet at 71 different properties (excluding month-to-month leases). Of this total, approximately 1,778,000 rentable square feet related to new or renewal leases of previously leased space and approximately 966,000 rentable square feet related to developed, redeveloped, or previously vacant space. Of the 966,000 rentable square feet, approximately 712,000 rentable square feet were related to our development or redevelopment programs, with the remaining approximately 254,000 rentable square feet related to previously vacant space. Rental rates for these new or renewal leases were on average approximately 4.9% higher on a GAAP basis than rental rates for expiring leases. As of December 31, 2010, approximately 96% of our leases (on a rentable square footage basis) were triple net leases, requiring tenants to pay substantially all real estate taxes and insurance, common area, and other operating expenses (including increases thereto) in addition to base rent. Additionally, approximately 93% of our leases (on a rentable square footage basis) provided for the recapture of certain capital expenditures, and approximately 91% of our leases (on a rentable square footage basis) contained effective annual rent escalations that were either fixed or indexed based on the consumer price index or another index. The following table summarizes information with respect to the lease expirations at our properties as of December 31, 2010: Year of Lease Expiration Number of Leases Expiring Rentable Square Footage of Expiring Leases Percentage of Aggregate Total Rentable Square Feet Annualized Base Rent of Expiring Leases (per rentable square foot) 2011 91 (1) 1,776,897 (1) 13.3 % $30.33 2012 78 1,399,663 10.6 32.01 2013 77 1,306,609 9.9 29.09 2014 57 1,234,908 9.3 29.02 2015 47 1,020,681 7.7 30.92 2016 24 1,105,862 8.3 31.51 2017 18 800,687 6.0 34.46 2018 13 879,238 6.6 39.16 2019 7 399,250 3.0 35.98 2020 15 812,915 6.1 40.33 (1) Excludes five month-to-month leases for approximately 23,000 rentable square feet. Of the 1.8 million rentable square feet expiring in 2011 as of December 31, 2010, approximately 523,000 rentable square feet was leased as of, or subsequent to, December 31, 2010, and approximately 392,000 rentable square feet was targeted for redevelopment. Our revenues are derived primarily from rental payments and reimbursement of operating expenses under our leases. If a tenant experiences a downturn in its business or other types of financial distress, it may be unable to make timely payments under its lease. Also, if tenants decide not to renew their leases or terminate early, we may not be able to re-lease the space. Even if tenants decide to renew or lease space, the terms of renewals or new leases, including the cost of any tenant improvements, concessions, and lease commissions, may be less favorable to us than current lease terms. Consequently, we could lose the cash flow from the affected properties, which could negatively impact our business. We may have to divert cash flow generated by other properties to meet our mortgage payments, if any, or to pay other expenses related to owning the affected properties.nt> 45 Table of Contents Value-added projects Construction in progress included the following value-added projects as of December 31, 2010 (dollars in thousands): Value-Added Projects Book Value Square Footage Active redevelopment $ 248,651 755,463 Active development 134,758 475,818 Preconstruction 563,800 3,014,000 Projects in China 66,786 547,000 Projects in India 31,541 426,000 Total $ 1,045,536 5,218,281 Our redevelopment, development, preconstruction, and certain real estate projects in China and India are classified as construction in progress. We are required to capitalize interest and other direct project costs during the period an asset is undergoing activities to prepare it for its intended use. Capitalization of interest and other direct project costs cease after a project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use. Additionally, should activities necessary to prepare an asset for its intended use cease, interest, taxes, insurance, and certain other direct project costs related to these assets would be expensed as incurred. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. When construction activities cease and the asset is ready for its intended use, the asset is transferred out of construction in progress and classified as rental properties, net or land held for future development. A key component of our business model includes our value-added redevelopment and development programs. These programs are focused on providing high-quality, generic and reusable life science laboratory space to meet the real estate requirements of a wide range of clients in the life science industry. Upon completion, each value-added project is expected to generate significant revenues and cash flows. Our redevelopment and development projects are generally in locations that are highly desirable to life science entities which we believe results in higher occupancy levels, longer lease terms, and higher rental income and returns. Redevelopment projects consist of the permanent change in use of office, warehouse, and shell space into generic life science laboratory space, including the conversion of single tenancy space to multi-tenancy space or visa versa. Our incremental investment in redevelop ment projects for the conversion of non-laboratory space to laboratory space generally range from $75 to $150 per square foot depending on the nature of the existing building improvements and laboratory design. Development projects consist of the ground-up development of generic and reusable life science laboratory facilities. We anticipate execution of new active development projects for aboveground vertical construction of new laboratory space generally only with significant pre-leasing. As of December 31, 2010, our estimated cost to complete was approximately $145 per rentable square foot, or $110 million in aggregate, for the 755,463 rentable square feet undergoing a permanent change in use to life science laboratory space through redevelopment. As of December 31, 2010, our estimated cost to complete was approximately $146 per rentable square foot, or $70 million in aggregate for the 475,818 rentable square feet undergoing ground-up development. We also have certain significant value-added projects undergoing important and substantial preconstruction activities to bring these assets to their intended use. Preconstruction activities include entitlements, permitting, design, site work, and other activities prior to commencement of vertical construction of aboveground shell and core improvements. Our objective also includes advancement of preconstruction efforts to reduce the time to deliver projects to prospective tenants. These critical activities add significant value for future ground-up development and are required for the ultimate vertical construction of buildings. Ultimately, these land parcels will provide valuable opportunities for new ground-up construction projects. The projects will provide high-quality facilities for the life science industry and will generate significant revenue and cash flows for th e Company. See Item 2. Properties for additional information and tables summarizing our properties undergoing redevelopment, development, and preconstruction activities as of December 31, 2010. A component of our business model also includes projects in Asia which primarily represent development opportunities and projects in China and India focused on life science laboratory space for our current client tenants and other life science relationship clients. These projects focus on real estate investments with targeted returns on investment greater than returns expected in the United States. We have two development projects in China. One development project is located in South China where a two-building project aggregating approximately 275,000 rentable square feet is under construction. The second development project is located in North China where a two-building project aggregating approximately 272,000 rentable square feet is under construction. Additionally, we have 426,000 square feet undergoing construction in India. During 2011, we expect to incur app roximately $55 to $65 million in construction in Asia. 46 Table of Contents Our success with our redevelopment, development, and preconstruction projects depends on many risks that may adversely affect our business, including those associated with: negative worldwide economic, financial, and banking conditions; worldwide economic recession, lack of confidence, and/or high structural unemployment; financial, banking, and credit market conditions; the seizure or illiquidity of credit markets; national, local, and worldwide economic conditions; delays in construction; budget overruns; lack of availability and/or increasing costs of materials; commodity pricing of building materials and supplies; financing availability; changes in the life sciences, financial, and banking industries; adverse developments concerning the life science industry and/or our life science client tenants; volatility in interest rates; labor availability and/or strikes; uncertainty of leasing; timing of the commencement of rental payments; changes in local submarket conditions; delays or denials of entitlements or permits; and other property development uncertainties. In addition, redevelopment, development, and preconstruction activities, regardless of whether they are ultimately successful, typically require a substantial portion of management time and attention. This may distract management from focusing on other operational activities. If we are unable to complete redevelopment, development, and preconstruction projects successfully, our business may be adversely affected. Critical accounting policies Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our significant accounting policies are described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. The preparation of these financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. We base these estimates, judgments, and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Changes in estimates could affect our financial position and specific items in our results of operations that are used by our stockholders, potential investors, indus try analysts and lenders in their evaluation of our performance. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. REIT compliance We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code. Qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the Internal Revenue Code to our operations and financial results, and the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control. We believe that our current organization and method of operation comply with the rules and regulations promulgated under the Internal Revenue Code to enable us to qualify, and continue to qualify, as a REIT. However, it is possible that we have been organized or have operated in a manner that would not allow us to qualify as a REIT, or that our future operations could cause us to fail to qualify. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, then we will be required to pay federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on our taxable income at regular corporate rates. If we lose our REIT status, then our net earnings available for investment or distribution to our stockholders will be significantly reduced for each of the years involved and we will no longer be required to make distributions to our stockholders. 47 Table of Contents Rental properties, net, land held for future development, and construction in progress We recognize assets acquired (including the intangible value to above or below market leases, acquired in-place leases, tenant relationships, and other intangible assets or liabilities), liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in an acquired entity at their fair value as of the acquisition date. The value of tangible assets acquired is based upon our estimation of value on an as if vacant basis. The value of acquired in-place leases includes the estimated carrying costs during the hypothetical lease-up period and other costs that would have been incurred to execute similar leases, considering market conditions at the acquisition date of the acquired in-place lease. We assess the fair value of tangible and intangible assets based on numerous factors, including estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and capitalization ra tes and available market information. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including the historical operating results, known trends, and market/economic conditions that may affect the property. We also recognize the fair values of assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in acquisitions of less than a 100% interest when the acquisition constitutes a change in control of the acquired entity. In addition, acquisition-related costs and restructuring costs are expensed as incurred. The values allocated to land improvements, buildings, building improvements, tenant improvements, and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis using an estimated life of 20 years for land improvements, the shorter of the term of the respective ground lease or 40 years for buildings and building improvements, the respective lease term for tenant improvements, and the estimated useful life for equipment. The values of acquired above and below market leases are amortized over the lives of the related leases and recorded as either an increase (for below market leases) or a decrease (for above market leases) to rental income. The values of acquired in-place leases are classified as leasing costs, included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, and amortized over the remaining terms of the related leases. Discontinued operations A property is classified as held for sale when all of the following criteria for a plan of sale have been met: (1) management, having the authority to approve the action, commits to a plan to sell the property; (2) the property is available for immediate sale in its present condition, subject only to terms that are usual and customary; (3) an active program to locate a buyer, and other actions required to complete the plan to sell, have been initiated; (4) the sale of the property is probable and is expected to be completed within one year; (5) the property is being actively marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value; and (6) actions necessary to complete the plan of sale indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn. When all of these criteria have been met, the property is classified as held for sale, its operations, including any interest expense directly attributable to it, are classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of income and amounts for all prior periods presented are reclassified from continuing operations to discontinued operations. Depreciation of assets ceases upon designation of a property as held for sale. Impairment of long-lived assets Long-lived assets to be held and used, including our rental properties, land held for future development, construction in progress, and intangibles are individually evaluated for impairment when conditions exist which may indicate that the carrying amount of a long-lived asset may not be recoverable. The carrying amount of a long-lived asset to be held and used is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. Impairment indicators for long-lived assets to be held and used, including our rental properties, land held for future development, and construction in progress are assessed by project and include, but are not limited to, significant fluctuations in estimated net operating income, occupancy changes, construction costs, estimated completion dates, rental rates, and other market factors. We assess the expected undiscounted cash flows based upon numerous factors, including, but not limited to, construction costs, available market information, historical operating results, known trends, and market/economic conditions that may affect the property and our assumptions about the use of the asset, including, if necessary, a probability-weighted approach if multiple outcomes are under consideration. Upon determination that an impairment has occurred, a write-down is recorded to reduce the carrying amount to its estimated fair value. 48 Table of Contents We use a held for sale impairment model for our properties classified as held for sale. The held for sale impairment model is different from the held and used impairment model whereby under the held for sale impairment model, an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of the long-lived asset classified as held for sale exceeds its fair value less cost to sell. Because of these two different models, it is possible for a long-lived asset previously classified as held and used to result in the recognition of an impairment charge upon classification as held for sale. Capitalization of costs We are required to capitalize direct construction and development costs, including predevelopment costs, interest, property taxes, insurance, and other costs directly related and essential to the acquisition, development, redevelopment, or construction of a project. Capitalization of construction, development, and redevelopment costs is required while activities are ongoing to prepare an asset for its intended use. Costs incurred after a project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use are expensed as incurred. Should development, redevelopment, or construction activity cease, interest, property taxes, insurance, and certain other costs would no longer be eligible for capitalization and would be expensed as incurred. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. We also capitalize costs directly related and essential to our leasing activities. These costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the related leases. Costs related to unsuccessful leasing opportunities are expensed as incurred. Accounting for investments We hold equity investments in certain publicly traded companies and privately held entities primarily involved in the life science industry. All of our investments in publicly traded companies are considered available for sale and are recorded at fair value. Fair value has been determined based upon the closing price as of each balance sheet date, with unrealized gains and losses shown as a separate component of total equity. The classification of each investment is determined at the time each investment is made, and such determination is reevaluated at each balance sheet date. The cost of each investment sold is determined by the specific identification method, with net realized gains included in other income. Investments in privately held entities are generally accounted for under the cost method when our interest in the entity is so minor that we have virtually no influence over the entities operating and financial policies. Certain investments in privately held entities are accounted for under the equity method when our interest in the entity is not deemed so minor that we have virtually no influence over the entities operating and financial policies. Under the equity method of accounting, we record our investment initially at cost and adjust the carrying amount of the investment to recognize our share of the earnings or losses of the investee subsequent to the date of our investment. Additionally, we limit our ownership percentage in the voting stock of each individual entity to less than 10%. Individual investments are evaluated for impairment when changes in conditions exist that may indicate an impairment exists. The factors that we consider in making these assessments include, but are not limited to, market prices, market conditions, available financing, prospects for favorable or unfavorable clinical trial results, new product initiatives, and new collaborative agreements. If there are no identified events or changes in circumstances that would have an adverse effect on our cost method investments, we do not estimate its fair value. For all of our investments, if a decline in the fair value of an investment below the carrying value is determined to be other-than-temporary, such investment is written down to its estimated fair value with a non-cash charge to current earnings. We use significant other observable inputs and significant unobservab le inputs to determine the fair value of privately held entities. Interest rate hedge agreements We are exposed to certain risks arising from both our business operations and economic conditions. We principally manage our exposures to a wide variety of business and operational risks through management of our core business activities. We manage economic risks, including interest rate, liquidity, and credit risk primarily by managing the amount, sources, and duration of our debt funding and the use of interest rate hedge agreements. Specifically, we enter into interest rate hedge agreements to manage exposures that arise from business activities that result in the payment of future known and uncertain cash amounts, the value of which are determined by interest rates. Our interest rate hedge agreements are used to manage differences in the amount, timing, and duration of our known or expected cash payments principally related to our borrowings based on the London Interbank O ffered Rate ( LIBOR ). We do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes and currently all of our derivatives are designated as hedges. Our objectives in using interest rate hedge agreements are to add stability to interest expense and to manage our exposure to interest rate movements in accordance with our interest rate risk management strategy. Interest rate swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable rate amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making fixed rate payments over the life of the interest rate swap agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount. Interest rate cap agreements designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable rate amounts from a counterparty if interest rates rise above the strike rate on the contract in exchange for an up-front premium. 49 Table of Contents In July 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act was enacted, representing an overhaul of the framework for regulation of U.S. financial markets. The Dodd-Frank Act calls for various regulatory agencies, including the SEC and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission, to establish regulations for implementation of many of the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, and we anticipate that these new regulations will provide additional clarity regarding the extent of the impact of this legislation on us. We expect to be able to continue to use interest rate hedge agreements, including interest rate swap and cap agreements, to hedge a portion of our exposure to variable interest rates. However, the costs of doing so may be increased as a result of the new legislation. We may also incur additional costs associated with our compliance with the new regulations and anticipated additional reporting and disclosure oblig ations. While we are not able to assess the full impact of the Dodd-Frank Act until all the implementing regulations have been adopted, based on the information available to us at this time, we do not believe provisions of the regulations implementing the Dodd-Frank Act will have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We record our interest rate hedge agreements on the consolidated balance sheets at their estimated fair values with an offsetting adjustment reflected as unrealized gains/losses in accumulated other comprehensive income in total equity. The accounting for changes in fair value (i.e., gains or losses) of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and further, on the type of hedging relationship. For those derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments, a company must designate the hedging instrument, based up on the exposure being hedged, as a fair value hedge, cash flow hedge, or a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation. Our interest rate hedge agreements are considered cash flow hedges as they are designated and qualify as hedges of the exposure to variability in ex pected future cash flows. Hedge accounting generally provides for the matching of the timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging instrument with the recognition of the changes in the earnings effect of the hedged forecasted transactions in a cash flow hedge. All of our interest rate hedge agreements meet the criteria to be deemed highly effective in reducing our exposure to variable interest rates. We formally document all relationships between interest rate hedge agreements and hedged items, including the method for evaluating effectiveness and the risk strategy. We make an assessment at the inception of each interest rate hedge agreement and on an ongoing basis to determine whether these instruments are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows associated with the hedged items. The ineffective portion of each interest rate hedge agreement is immediately recognized in earnings. While we intend to continue to meet the conditions for such hedge accounting, if hedges did not qualify as highly effective, the changes in the fair values of the derivatives used as hedges would be reflected in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate hedge agreements is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analyses on the expected cash flows of each derivative. These analyses reflect the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity, and uses observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves and implied volatilities (also referred to as significant other observable inputs ). The fair values of our interest rate swap agreements are determined using the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future fixed cash payments and the discounted expected variable cash receipts. The variable cash receipts are based on an expectation of future interest rates (forward curves) derived from observable market interest rate curves. The fair value of our interest rate cap agreement is determined using the market standard methodology of discounting the future expected cash receipts that would occur if variable interest rates rise above the strike rate of the interest rate cap agreement. The variable interest rate used in the calculation of projected receipts on the interest rate cap agreement is based on an expectation of future interest rates derived from observable market interest rate curves and volatilities. The fair value calculation also includes an amount for risk of non-performance using significant unobservable inputs such as estimates of current credit spreads to evaluate the likelihood of default, which we have determined to be insignificant to the overall fair value of our interest rate hedge agreements. In adjusting the fair value of our interest rate hedge agreements for the effect of non-performance risk, we have considered any applicable credit enhancements such as collateral postings, thresholds, mutual puts, and guarantees. These methods of assessing fa ir value result in a general approximation of value, and such value may never be realized. 50 Table of Contents Recognition of rental income and tenant recoveries Rental income from leases with scheduled rent increases, free rent, incentives, and other rent adjustments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the respective lease terms. We include amounts currently recognized as income, and expected to be received in later years, in deferred rent in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Amounts received currently, but recognized as income in future years, are included as unearned rent in accounts payable, accrued expenses, and tenant security deposits in our consolidated balance sheets. We commence recognition of rental income at the date the property is ready for its intended use and the tenant takes possession of or controls the physical use of the property. Tenant recoveries related to reimbursement of real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, repairs and maintenance, and other operating expenses are recognized as revenue in the period the applicable expenses are incurred. We maintain an allowance for estimated losses that may result from the inability of our tenants to make payments required under the terms of the lease. If a tenant fails to make contractual payments beyond any allowance, we may recognize additional bad debt expense in future periods equal to the amount of unpaid rent and unrealized deferred rent. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, we had no allowance for doubtful accounts. Impact of recently issued accounting standards In December 2010, the FASB issued an Accounting Standard Update ( ASU ) to address implementation issues associated with pro forma revenue and earnings disclosure requirements for material business combinations. The new guidance clarified that if comparative financial statements are presented, an entity should present the pro forma disclosures as if the business combination occurred at the beginning of the prior annual period when preparing the pro forma financial information. Additionally, entities must provide additional disclosures describing the nature and amount of material, nonrecurring pro forma adjustments. The ASU is effective for business combinations consummated in periods beginning after December 15, 2010, and shall be applied prospectively as of the date of adoption. In January 2010, the FASB issued an ASU to address implementation issues associated with the accounting for decreases in the ownership of a subsidiary. The new guidance clarified the scope of the entities covered by the guidance related to accounting for decreases in the ownership of a subsidiary and specifically excluded in-substance real estate or conveyances of oil and gas mineral rights from the scope. Additionally, the new guidance expands the disclosures required for a business combination achieved in stages and deconsolidation of a business or nonprofit activity. The new guidance became effective for interim and annual periods ending on or after December 31, 2009 and must be applied on a retrospective basis to the first period that an entity adopted the new guidance related to noncontrolling interests. The adoption of this new ASU did not have an impact on our conso lidated financial statements. Results of operations Comparison of the year ended December 31, 2010 to the year ended December 31, 2009 Rental revenues increased by $0.4 million, or 0.1%, to $368.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $368.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Rental revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009 included additional rental income aggregating $18.5 million related to a modification of a lease for a property in South San Francisco, California. Excluding the additional rental income, rental revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010 increased by $18.9 million, or 5%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2009 as a result of rental revenues from properties acquired, placed in service, or redeveloped during the periods after January 1, 2009, including the delivery and completion of a ground-up development of a 308,000 rentable square foot science park in New York City during the fourth quarter of 2010, the delivery and compl etion of a ground-up development of a 130,000 rentable square foot building in the San Francisco market in the third quarter of 2010, the delivery and completion of a ground-up development of a 115,000 rentable square foot building in the Seattle market in the first quarter of 2010, and increases in rental rates related to renewed and/or re-leased space. 51 Table of Contents Tenant recoveries increased by $10.3 million, or 10%, to $113.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $103.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase resulted primarily from tenant recoveries from properties acquired, placed in service, or redeveloped during the periods after January 1, 2009, including the delivery and completion of a ground-up development of a 308,000 rentable square foot science park in New York City during the fourth quarter of 2010, the delivery and completion of a ground-up development of a 130,000 rentable square foot building in the San Francisco Bay market in the third quarter of 2010, and the delivery and completion of a ground-up development of a 115,000 rentable square foot building in the Seattle market in the first quarter of 2010. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, approximately 96% of our leases (on a rentable square footage basis) were triple net leases, requiring tenants to pay substantially all real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, common area, and other operating expenses (including increases thereto) in addition to base rent. Other income for the year ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 of $5.2 million and $11.9 million, respectively, represents construction management fees, interest, investment income, and storage income. Other income for the year ended December 31, 2009 included a $7.2 million cash receipt related to real estate acquired in November 2007. Excluding the $7.2 million cash receipt, other income for the year ended December 31, 2010 remained consistent with other income for the year ended December 31, 2009 at approximately 1% of total revenues. Rental operating expenses increased by $10.0 million, or 8%, to $132.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $122.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase resulted primarily from rental operating expenses (primarily payroll, property taxes, and utilities) from properties acquired, placed in service, or redeveloped during the periods after January 1, 2009, including the delivery and completion of a ground-up development of a 308,000 rentable square foot science park in New York City during the fourth quarter of 2010, the delivery and completion of a ground-up development of a 130,000 rentable square foot building in the San Francisco Bay market in the third quarter of 2010, and the delivery and completion of a ground-up development of a 115,000 rentable square foot building in the Seattle market in the first quarter of 2010. The m ajority of the increase in rental operating expenses is recoverable from tenants through tenant recoveries. General and administrative expenses decreased by $1.9 million, or 5%, to $34.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $36.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The decrease resulted primarily from a decrease in stock compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the year ended December 31, 2009. As a percentage of total revenues, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2010 and the year ended December 31, 2009 remained consistent at approximately 7% to 8% of total revenues. Interest expense decreased by $12.6 million, or 15%, to $69.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $82.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The decrease resulted from a decrease in total indebtedness and a decrease in the weighted average interest rate on our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan, including the impact of our interest rate hedge agreements, partially offset by an increase in interest associated with our 8.00% Unsecured Convertible Notes which were issued in April 2009. The weighted average interest rate on our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan, including the impact of our interest rate hedge agreements, decreased from approximately 4.1% as of December 31, 2009 to approximately 2.8% as of December 31, 2010. We have entered into certain interest rate hedge agreements to hedge a port ion of our exposure primarily related to variable interest rates associated with our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan (see Liquidity and Capital Resources Principal Liquidity Needs Interest Rate Hedge Agreements ). Depreciation and amortization increased by $8.8 million, or 7%, to $126.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $117.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase resulted primarily from depreciation associated with the properties acquired, placed in service, or redeveloped during the periods after January 1, 2010, including the delivery and completion of a ground-up development of a 308,000 rentable square foot science park in New York City during the fourth quarter of 2010, the delivery and completion of a ground-up development of a 130,000 rentable square foot building in the San Francisco market in the third quarter of 2010, and the delivery and completion of a ground-up development of a 115,000 rentable square foot building in the Seattle market in the first quarter of 2010. 52 Table of Contents During the year ended December 31, 2010, we recognized losses on early extinguishment of debt of approximately $45.2 million, comprised of losses of approximately $2.4 million recognized in December 2010 related to the repurchase, in privately negotiated transactions, of approximately $82.8 million of our 3.70% Unsecured Convertible Notes for approximately $84.6 million in cash, and losses of approximately $41.5 million and $1.3 million recognized in June 2010 and July 2010, respectively, related to the retirement of substantially all $240 million aggregate principal amount of our 8.00% Unsecured Convertible Notes. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we recognized a gain on early extinguishment of debt of approximately $11.3 million related to the repurchase, in privately negotiated transactions, of approximately $75 million of our 3.70% Unsecured Convertible Notes for approximately $59.2 million in cash. Income from discontinued operations, net of $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 reflects the results of operations of one operating property classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2010 and the results of operations and gains related to the sales of one operating property during the year ended December 31, 2010. We sold one operating property located in the Seattle market that had been classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2009. In connection with the operating property sold during the year ended December 31, 2010, we recognized a gain of approximately $24,000. Income from discontinued operations, net of $5.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 reflects the results of operations of one operating property that was classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2010, res ults of operations of the property sold during the year ended December 31, 2010, and the results of operations and gain on sales of four operating properties sold during the year ended December 31, 2009. In connection with the operating properties sold during the year ended December 31, 2009, we recognized a gain of approximately $2.6 million. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we sold land parcels in Mission Bay, San Francisco. These land parcels did not meet the criteria for discontinued operations since the parcels did not have any significant operations prior to disposition. In connection with the sales of land parcels during the year ended December 31, 2010, we recognized a gain of approximately $59.4 million. Comparison of the year ended December 31, 2009 to the year ended December 31, 2008 Rental revenues increased by $24.5 million, or 7%, to $368.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to $343.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase resulted from rental revenue from properties placed in service or redeveloped during the periods after January 1, 2008 and increases in rental rates related to renewed and/or releasable space leased. Additionally, in 2009 and 2008, we recognized additional rental income aggregating $18.5 million and $11.3 million, respectively, primarily related to a modification of a lease for a property in South San Francisco, California. Tenant recoveries increased by $2.8 million, or 3%, to $103.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to $100.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase resulted primarily from properties placed in service or redeveloped during the periods after January 1, 2008. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, approximately 96% and 97%, respectively, of our leases (on a rentable square footage basis) were triple net leases, requiring tenants to pay substantially all real estate taxes and insurance, common area, and other operating expenses (including increases thereto) in addition to base rent. Other income for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 of $11.9 million and $11.2 million, respectively, represents construction management fees, interest, investment income and storage income. Other income for the year ended December 31, 2009 also includes a $7.2 million cash payment related to real estate acquired in November 2007. Excluding this cash payment, the decrease in other income is primarily due to decreases in investment income for the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2008. Rental operating expenses increased by $8.8 million, or 8%, to $122.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to $113.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase resulted primarily from increases in rental operating expenses (primarily payroll, property taxes, and insurance) from properties placed in service or redeveloped during the periods after January 1, 2008. The majority of the increase in rental operating expenses was recoverable from our tenants. 53 Table of Contents General and administrative expenses increased by $1.5 million, or 4%, to $36.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to $34.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. As a percentage of total revenues, general, and administrative expenses for 2009 remained consistent with 2008 at approximately 8%. Interest expense decreased by $3.1 million, or 4%, to $82.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to $85.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The decrease resulted from a decrease in LIBOR rates and a decrease in the outstanding balance on our unsecured line of credit partially offset by the issuance of our 8.00% Unsecured Convertible Notes in April 2009. The weighted average interest rate on our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan, including the impact of our interest rate hedge agreements, decreased from approximately 4.3% as of December 31, 2008 to approximately 4.1% as of December 31, 2009. We have entered into certain interest rate hedge agreements to hedge a portion of our exposure to variable interest rates primarily associated with our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan (see Liq uidity and Capital Resources Interest Rate Hedge Agreements ). Depreciation and amortization increased by $10.4 million, or 10%, to $117.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to $107.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase resulted primarily from depreciation associated with the improvements and properties placed in service or redeveloped during the periods after January 1, 2008. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we recognized a gain on early extinguishment of debt of approximately $11.3 million related to the repurchase, in privately negotiated transactions, of approximately $75 million of our 3.70% Unsecured Convertible Notes for approximately $59.2 million in cash. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we recognized aggregate non-cash impairment charges of $13.3 million associated with other-than-temporary declines in the value of certain investments below their carrying value. Income from discontinued operations, net of $5.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 reflects the results of operations of one property that was classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2010, the results of operations of one operating property sold during the year ended December 31, 2010, and the results of operations and gain on sales of four operating properties sold during the year ended December 31, 2009. In connection with the operating properties sold in 2009, we recognized a gain of approximately $2.6 million. Income from discontinued operations, net of approximately $19.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 reflects the results of operations of one operating property that was classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2010, the results of operations of one operating property sold during the yea r ended December 31, 2010, the results of operations of four operating properties sold during the year ended December 31, 2009, and the results of operations and gain on sales of eight operating properties sold during the year ended December 31, 2008. In connection with the operating properties sold in 2008, we recognized a gain of approximately $20.4 million. We also recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $4.7 million in March 2008 related to an industrial building located in a suburban submarket south of Boston and an office building located in the San Diego market which was included in income from discontinued operations, net for the year ended December 31, 2008. These properties were sold later in 2008. 54 Table of Contents Liquidity and capital resources Overview We expect to continue meeting our short term liquidity and capital requirements generally through our working capital and net cash provided by operating activities. We believe that the net cash provided by operating activities will continue to be sufficient to enable us to make distributions necessary to continue qualifying as a REIT. We also believe that net cash provided by operating activities will be sufficient to fund recurring non-revenue enhancing capital expenditures, tenant improvements, and leasing commissions. We expect to meet certain long term liquidity requirements, such as for property acquisitions, development, redevelopment, and other construction projects, scheduled debt maturities, and non-recurring capital improvements, through net cash provided by operating activities, periodic asset sales, long term secured and unsecured indebtedness, including borrowings under the unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan, and the issuance of additional debt and/or equity securities. We intend to continue to focus on the completion of our existing active redevelopment projects aggregating approximately 755,463 rentable square feet and our existing active development projects aggregating approximately an additional 475,818 rentable square feet. Additionally, we intend to continue with preconstruction activities for certain land parcels for future ground-up development in order to preserve and create value for these projects. These important preconstruction activities add significant value to our land for future ground-up development and are required for the ultimate vertical construction of the buildings. We also intend to be very careful and prudent with any future decisions to add new projects to our active ground-up developments. Future ground-up development projects will likely require significant pre-leasing from high-quality and/or creditworthy entiti es. We also intend to continue to reduce debt as a percentage of our overall capital structure over a multi-year period. During this period, we may also extend and/or refinance certain debt maturities. We expect the source of funds for construction activities and repayment of outstanding debt to be provided over several years by cash flows from operations, opportunistic sales of real estate, joint ventures, new secured or unsecured debt, and the issuance of additional equity securities, as appropriate. As of December 31, 2010, we had identified one asset as held for sale that has been classified in discontinued operations. As further discussed below, our principal liquidity needs are to fund: normal recurring expenses; selective acquisitions; development and redevelopment costs; capital expenditures, including tenant improvements, and leasing costs; principal and interest payments due under our debt obligations, including balloon payments of principal; and dividend distributions in order to maintain our REIT qualification under the Internal Revenue Code. We believe that our sources of capital for our principal liquidity needs will be satisfied by: cash on hand of approximately $91.2 million as of December 31, 2010; restricted cash of approximately $28.4 million as of December 31, 2010 to fund certain construction costs; cash flows generated by operating activities (for the year ended December 31, 2010, we generated approximately $219.3 million of cash flows from operating activities); availability under our $2.25 billion unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan as amended in January 2011 (approximately $1.5 billion outstanding as of December 31, 2010); cash proceeds from new secured or unsecured financings; cash proceeds generated from potential asset sales including one property that was classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2010; cash proceeds from the issuance of equity or debt securities; and cash proceeds from joint ventures. 55 Table of Contents Principal liquidity needs Contractual obligations and commitments Contractual obligations as of December 31, 2010 consisted of the following (in thousands): Payments by Period Total 2011 2012-2013 2014-2015 Thereafter Secured notes payable (1) $ 791,974 $ 100,812 $ 66,228 $ 238,766 $ 386,168 Unsecured line of credit (2) 748,000 748,000 Unsecured term loan (3) 750,000 750,000 Unsecured convertible notes 302,184 301,934 250 Estimated interest payments 350,300 84,499 116,614 58,827 90,360 Ground lease obligations 614,024 7,619 16,898 16,809 572,698 Other obligations 24,952 1,469 22,387 (4) 308 788 Total $ 3,581,434 $ 194,399 $ 1,274,061 $ 1,062,960 $ 1,050,014 (1) Amounts include noncontrolling interests share of scheduled principal maturities of approximately $22.0 million, of which approximately $20.9 million matures in 2014. Amounts exclude unamortized discounts of approximately $1.1 million. (2) In January 2011, we extended the maturity date of our unsecured line of credit to January 2015, assuming we exercise our sole right to extend the maturity twice by an additional six months after each exercise. (3) Our unsecured term loan matures in October 2012, assuming we exercise our sole right to extend the maturity by one year. (4) Includes approximately $21.1 million representing our share of a secured note payable due in 2012 held by our unconsolidated real estate entity. Secured notes payable as of December 31, 2010 consisted of 20 notes secured by 49 properties. Our secured notes payable require monthly payments of principal and interest and had weighted average interest rates of approximately 5.99% at December 31, 2010. Noncontrolling interests share of secured notes payable aggregated approximately $22.0 million as of December 31, 2010. The total book values of rental properties, net, land held for future development, and construction in progress securing debt were approximately $1.3 billion at December 31, 2010. At December 31, 2010, our secured notes payable were comprised of approximately $789.9 million and $1.0 million of fixed and variable rate debt, respectively. In January 2011, we entered into the Third Amendment to our Existing Credit Agreement. The Third Amendment amended the Existing Credit Agreement to, among other things, increase the maximum permitted borrowings under the credit facilities from $1.9 billion to $2.25 billion, consisting of a $1.5 billion unsecured line of credit (increased from $1.15 billion) and a $750 million unsecured term loan and provide an accordion option to increase commitments under the Unsecured Credit Facility by up to an additional $300 million. Borrowings under the Unsecured Credit Facility will bear interest at LIBOR or the specified base rate, plus in either case a margin specified in the Amended Credit Agreement. The Applicable Margin for LIBOR borrowings under the revolving credit facility was initially set at 2.4%. The Applicable Margin for the LIBOR borrowings under the unsecured term loa n was not amended in the Third Amendment and was 1.0% as of December 31, 2010. 56 Table of Contents Under the Third Amendment, the maturity date for the unsecured revolving credit facility is January 2015, assuming we exercise our sole right under the amendment to extend this maturity date twice by an additional six months after each exercise. The maturity date for the $750 million unsecured term loan remained unchanged at October 2012, assuming we exercise our sole right to extend the maturity date by one year. The Third Amendment modified certain financial covenants with respect to the Unsecured Credit Facility, including the fixed charge coverage ratio, secured debt ratio, leverage ratio, and minimum book value, and added covenants relating to an unsecured leverage ratio and unsecured debt yield. In January 2007, we completed a private offering of $460 million of our 3.70% Unsecured Convertible Notes. In December 2010, we repurchased, in privately negotiated transactions, approximately $82.8 million of certain of our 3.70% Unsecured Convertible Notes for $84.6 million in cash. In April 2009, we repurchased, in privately negotiated transactions, approximately $75 million of certain of our 3.70% Unsecured Convertible Notes. See additional information under Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K regarding our ability to redeem the notes, the ability of the holders to require us to repurchase the notes, and circumstances under which the holders may convert the notes. Estimated interest payments on our fixed rate debt and hedged variable rate debt were calculated based upon contractual interest rates, including the impact of interest rate swap agreements, interest payment dates, and scheduled maturity dates. As of December 31, 2010, approximately 63% of our debt was fixed rate debt or variable rate debt subject to interest rate hedge agreements. See additional information regarding our interest rate hedge agreements under Liquidity and Capital Resources Interest Rate Hedge Agreements. The remaining 37% of our debt is unhedged variable rate debt based primarily on LIBOR. Interest payments on our unhedged variable rate debt have been excluded from the contractual obligations table on the prior page because we cannot reasonably determine the future interest obligations on variable rate debt as we cannot predict the applicable variable interest rates in the future. See additional information regarding our debt under Notes 5, 6, 7, and 8 to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. Ground lease obligations as of December 31, 2010 included leases for 21 of our properties and land development parcels. These lease obligations have remaining lease terms from 22 to 95 years, excluding extension options. In addition to the above, as of December 31, 2010, remaining aggregate costs under contracts for the construction of properties undergoing development, redevelopment, and generic life science infrastructure improvements under the terms of leases approximated $107.5 million. We expect payments for these obligations to occur over one to three years, subject to capital planning adjustments from time to time. We are also committed to fund approximately $52.1 million for certain investments over the next six years. Acquisitions In August 2010, we announced that we had entered into definitive agreements to acquire three life science properties and other selected assets and interests of privately-held Veralliance Properties, Inc. ( Veralliance ), including continuing services from Veralliance Founder and President, Daniel Ryan and other key management and operational personnel. Veralliance was a San Diego-based corporate real estate solutions company focused on the acquisition, development, and management of office and life science assets in Southern California. The three life science properties, located in San Diego, California, contain an aggregate of 161,000 rentable square feet and were acquired for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $50.0 million consisting of approximately $35.2 million in cash and our assumption of two secured loans aggregating approximately $14.8 mill ion. We completed the acquisition of one of these properties in the third quarter of 2010 and completed the acquisitions of the other two properties in the fourth quarter of 2010. In September 2010, we purchased a life science property with approximately 48,500 rentable square feet in the Suburban Washington, D.C. market. The total purchase price was approximately $12.5 million and consisted of approximately $6.2 million in cash and our assumption of a secured loan of approximately $6.3 million. This property is fully leased to a credit life science entity. In October 2010, we acquired a life science campus in the San Diego market aggregating approximately 347,000 rentable square feet for approximately $128 million. The purchase of this life science campus included land supporting the future development of additional life science buildings aggregating approximately 420,000 rentable square feet. At the time of this acquisition, the campus was subject to a 15-month lease with Biogen Idec Inc. In December 2010, we executed a new lease for the entire 347,000 rentable square foot campus pursuant to a 20-year lease with Illumina, Inc. ( Illumina ) and, pursuant to the lease, also commenced the ground-up development of a building aggregating approximately 123,000 rentable square feet on the campus. Illumina has the right to further expand the premises and lease one to three additional buildings that may be built on this campus. 57 Table of Contents In December 2010, we acquired one property in the San Diego market aggregating approximately 373,000 rentable square feet for approximately $114 million. The acquisition of this property included land supporting the future development of additional life science buildings aggregating approximately 244,000 rentable square feet. As of December 31, 2010, approximately 201,000 rentable square feet of the property 373,000 total rentable square footage was undergoing active redevelopment. The remaining operating square footage aggregating 172,000 rentable square feet was 100% occupied. Additionally in December 2010, we acquired one property in the Suburban Washington, D.C. market aggregating approximately 50,000 rentable square feet for approximately $14 million. Off-balance sheet arrangements Our off-balance sheet arrangements consist of our investment in a real estate entity that is a variable interest entity for which we are not the primary beneficiary. We account for the real estate entity under the equity method. The debt held by the unconsolidated real estate entity is secured by the land parcel owned by the entity, and is non-recourse to us. See Notes 2 and 3 to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. Capital expenditures, tenant improvements, and leasing costs As of December 31, 2010, we had various projects, including development, redevelopment, and preconstruction projects, as well as projects in China and India, with a historical cost basis aggregating $1.0 billion classified in construction in progress. For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008, we paid property-related capital expenditures and tenant improvements related to our properties, including expenditures related to our development and redevelopment projects, aggregating approximately $415.4 million, $446.1 million, and $542.5 million, respectively. These amounts include payments for property-related capital expenditures and tenant improvements presented in the table below including non-revenue enhancing capital expenditures and tenant improvement and leasing costs related to re-tenanted and renewal space. We expect our future property-related capital expenditures and tenant improvements related to our life science properties to be relatively in the range of capital expenditures incurred in 2010. The following table shows total and the five-year average per square foot property-related capital expenditures, tenant improvements, and leasing costs (excluding capital expenditures and tenant improvements that are recoverable from tenants, revenue-enhancing or related to properties that have undergone redevelopment) for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, 2008, 2007, and 2006: Five-Year Year Ended December 31, Average 2010 2009 2008 2007 2006 Capital expenditures (1): Major capital expenditures $ 653,000 $ 379,000 $ 529,000 $ 405,000 $ 1,379,000 $ 575,000 Recurring capital expenditures $ 920,000 $ 953,000 $ 1,405,000 $ 955,000 $ 648,000 $ 639,000 Square feet in portfolio 11,396,107 12,202,231 11,740,993 11,770,769 11,476,217 9,790,326 Per square foot: Major capital expenditures $ 0.06 $ 0.03 $ 0.05 $ 0.03 $ 0.12 $ 0.06 Recurring capital expenditures $ 0.08 $ 0.08 $ 0.12 $ 0.08 $ 0.06 $ 0.07 Tenant improvements and leasing costs: Re-tenanted space (2) Tenant improvements and leasing costs $ 2,174,000 $ 3,097,000 $ 1,475,000 $ 3,481,000 $ 1,446,000 $ 1,370,000 Re-tenanted square feet 393,914 778,547 211,638 505,773 224,767 248,846 Per square foot $ 5.52 $ 3.98 $ 6.97 $ 6.88 $ 6.43 $ 5.51 Renewal space Tenant improvements and leasing costs $ 2,431,000 $ 3,628,000 $ 3,263,000 $ 2,364,000 $ 1,942,000 $ 957,000 Renewal square feet 770,317 999,419 976,546 748,512 671,127 455,980 Per square foot $ 3.16 $ 3.63 $ 3.34 $ 3.16 $ 2.89 $ 2.10 (1) Property-related capital expenditures include all major capital and recurring capital expenditures except capital expenditures that are recoverable from tenants, revenue-enhancing capital expenditures, or costs related to the redevelopment of a property. Major capital expenditures consist of roof replacements and HVAC systems that are typically identified and considered at the time a property is acquired. (2) Excludes space that has undergone redevelopment before re-tenanting. 58 Table of Contents Capital expenditures fluctuate in any given period due to the nature, extent, and timing of improvements required and the extent to which they are recoverable from our tenants. As of December 31, 2010 approximately 93% (on a rentable square footage basis) of our leases provide for the recapture of certain capital expenditures (such as HVAC systems maintenance and/or replacement, roof replacement, and parking lot resurfacing). In addition, we maintain an active preventative maintenance program at each of our properties to minimize capital expenditures. Tenant improvements and leasing costs also fluctuate in any given year depending upon factors such as the timing and extent of vacancies, property age, location and characteristics, the type of lease (renewal tenant or re-tenanted space) the involvement of external leasing agents, and overall competitive market conditions. We expect our future capital expenditures, tenant improvements, and leasing costs (excluding capital expenditures and tenant improvements that are recoverable from tenants, revenue-enhancing or related to properties that have undergone redevelopment) to be approximately in the range as shown in the table immediately above. Unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan We use our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan to fund working capital, acquisition of properties, and construction activities. In January 2011, we entered into a Third Amendment to our Existing Credit Agreement. The Third Amendment amended the Existing Credit Agreement to, among other things, increase the maximum permitted borrowings under the credit facilities from $1.9 billion to $2.25 billion, consisting of a $1.5 billion unsecured line of credit (increased from $1.15 billion) and a $750 million unsecured term loan and provide an accordion option to increase commitments under the Unsecured Credit Facility by up to an additional $300 million. Borrowings under the Unsecured Credit Facility will bear interest at LIBOR or the specified base rate, plus in either case a margin specified in the Amended Credit Agreement. The Applicable Margin for LIBOR borrowings under the revolving credit facility was initially set at 2.4%. The Applicable Margin for the LIBOR borrowings under the unsecured term loan was not amended in the Third Amendment and was 1.0% as of December 31, 2010. Under the Third Amendment, the maturity date for the unsecured line of credit will be January 2015, assuming we exercise our sole right under the amendment to extend this maturity date twice by an additional six months after each exercise. The maturity date for the $750 million unsecured term loan remained unchanged at October 2012, assuming we exercise our sole right to extend the maturity date by one year. The Third Amendment also modified certain financial covenants with respect to the Unsecured Credit Facility, including the fixed charge coverage ratio, secured debt ratio, leverage ratio, minimum book value, and interest coverage ratio covenants, and added covenants relating to an unsecured leverage ratio and unsecured debt yield. The requirements and actual results as of December 31, 2010 of the key financial covenants under the Third Amendment are as follows: Covenant Requirement Actual at December 31, 2010 Leverage ratio Less than or equal to 60% 36% Unsecured leverage ratio Less than or equal to 60% 39% Fixed charge coverage ratio Greater than or equal to 1.5 2.0 Unsecured debt yield Greater than or equal to 11% 14% Minimum book value Greater than or equal to the sum of $2.0 billion and 50% of the net proceeds of equity offerings $2.9 billion Secured debt ratio Less than or equal to 40% 11% As of December 31, 2010, we had borrowings of $748 million and $750 million outstanding under our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan, respectively, with a weighted average interest rate, including the impact of our interest rate swap agreements, of approximately 2.8%. In addition, the terms of the unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan restrict, among other things, certain investments, indebtedness, distributions, mergers, developments, land, and borrowings available under our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan for developments, land, and encumbered and unencumbered assets. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, we were in compliance with all such covenants. Management continuously monitors the Company compliance and projected compliance with the covenants. Our current expectation is that we will continue to meet requirements of our debt covenants in the short and long term. However, in the event of an economic slow-down, crisis in the credit markets, and rising cost of capital, there is no certainty that we will be able to continue to satisfy all of the covenant requirements. 59 Table of Contents Additionally, we may be required to reduce our outstanding borrowings under our credit facility in order to maintain compliance with one or more covenants under our credit facility. For a full description of the terms and conditions under our Existing Credit Agreement, refer to our second amended and restated credit agreement dated as of October 31, 2006, filed as an exhibit to the Company annual report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 1, 2007, the first amendment thereto filed as an exhibit to the Company annual report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 1, 2007 and the second amendment thereto filed as an exhibit to the Company quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on August 9, 2007. For a full description of the covenants related to our Third Amendment, refer to our third amendment to second amended and restated credit agreement, dated as of January 28, 2011, appearing as an exhibit to this annual report on Form 10-K filed. See Item 15. Exhibit 10.18. font> As of December 31, 2010, we had approximately 50 lenders providing commitments under our $1.9 billion Existing Credit Facility. During 2010, all lenders under our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan funded all borrowings requested under these agreements. In the future, if one or more such lenders fail to fund a borrowing request, we may not be able to borrow funds necessary for working capital, construction activities, dividend payments, debt repayment, monthly debt service, and other recurring capital requirements. The failure of one or more lenders to fund their share of a borrowing request may have a material impact on our financial statements. Interest rate hedge agreements We utilize interest rate hedge agreements, including interest rate swap and cap agreements, to hedge a portion of our exposure to variable interest rates primarily associated with our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan. These agreements involve an exchange of fixed and floating rate interest payments without the exchange of the underlying principal amount (the notional amount ). Interest received under all of our interest rate hedge agreements is based on the one-month LIBOR rate. The net difference between the interest paid and the interest received is reflected as an adjustment to interest expense. The following table summarizes our interest rate swap agreements as of December 31, 2010 (dollars in thousands): Transaction Dates Effective Dates Termination Dates Interest Pay Rates Notional Amounts Effective at December 31, 2010 Fair Values December 2006 December 29, 2006 March 31, 2014 4.990% $ 50,000 $ 50,000 $ (5,908 ) October 2007 October 31, 2007 September 30, 2012 4.546 50,000 50,000 (3,448 ) October 2007 October 31, 2007 September 30, 2013 4.642 50,000 50,000 (4,884 ) October 2007 July 1, 2008 March 31, 2013 4.622 25,000 25,000 (2,124 ) October 2007 July 1, 2008 March 31, 2013 4.625 25,000 25,000 (2,126 ) October 2008 September 30, 2009 January 31, 2011 3.119 100,000 100,000 (246 ) December 2006 November 30, 2009 March 31, 2014 5.015 75,000 75,000 (8,925 ) December 2006 November 30, 2009 March 31, 2014 5.023 75,000 75,000 (8,942 ) December 2006 December 31, 2010 October 31, 2012 5.015 100,000 100,000 (8,042 ) Total $ 550,000 $ (44,645 ) We have entered into master derivative agreements with each counterparty. These master derivative agreements (all of which are adapted from the standard International Swaps & Derivatives Association, Inc. form) define certain terms between the Company and each counterparty to address and minimize certain risks associated with our interest rate hedge agreements. In order to limit our risk of non-performance by an individual counterparty under our interest rate hedge agreements, our interest rate hedge agreements are spread among various counterparties. As of December 31, 2010, the largest aggregate notional amount with an individual counterparty was $175 million. If one or more of our counterparties fail to perform under our interest rate hedge agreements, we may incur higher costs associated with our variable rate LIBOR-based debt than the interest cos ts we originally anticipated. As of December 31, 2010, our interest rate hedge agreements were classified in accounts payable, accrued expenses, and tenant security deposits based upon their respective fair values aggregating a liability balance of approximately $44.6 million with the offsetting adjustment reflected as unrealized losses in accumulated other comprehensive loss in total equity. Balances in accumulated other comprehensive loss are recognized in the period that the forecasted hedge transactions affect earnings. We have not posted any collateral related to our interest rate hedge agreements. For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008 approximately $30.6 million, $38.9 million, and $15.4 million, respectively, was reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to interest expense as an increase to interest expense. During the next 12 months, we expect to recl assify approximately $20.8 million from accumulated other comprehensive loss to interest expense as an increase to interest expense. 60 Table of Contents Secured notes payable As of December 31, 2010, we had aggregate secured notes payable of approximately $790.9 million. If we are unable to refinance, extend principal payments due at maturity, or pay principal maturities with proceeds from other capital sources, then our cash flows may be insufficient to pay dividends to our stockholders and to repay debt upon maturity. Furthermore, even if we are able to refinance debt prior to maturity, the interest rate, loan to value, and other key loan terms may be less favorable than existing loan terms. Less favorable loan terms, assuming we are able to refinance our secured notes payable, may result in higher interest costs, additional required capital as a result of less proceeds or lower loan to value upon refinancing and new or more restrictive covenants or loan terms. Dividends We are required to distribute 90% of our REIT taxable income on an annual basis in order to continue to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, we intend to make, but are not contractually bound to make, regular quarterly distributions to preferred and common stockholders from cash flow from operating activities. All such distributions are at the discretion of our board of directors. We may be required to use borrowings under our unsecured line of credit, if necessary, to meet REIT distribution requirements and maintain our REIT status. We consider market factors and our performance in addition to REIT requirements in determining distribution levels. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we paid dividends on our common stock aggregating approximately $67.9 million. Also, during the year ended December 31, 2010, we paid div idends on our Series C Preferred Stock and Series D Convertible Preferred Stock aggregating approximately $10.9 million and $17.5 million, respectively. Sources of capital Cash and cash equivalents As of December 31, 2010, we had approximately $91.2 million of cash and cash equivalents. Restricted cash Restricted cash consisted of the following (in thousands): December 31, 2010 2009 Funds held in trust under the terms of certain secured notes payable $ 20,035 $ 19,340 Funds held in escrow related to construction projects 5,902 24,054 Other restricted funds 2,417 3,897 Total $ 28,354 $ 47,291 The funds held in escrow related to construction projects will be used to pay for certain construction costs. Cash flows Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2010 increased by $8.3 million to $219.3 million compared to $211.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase resulted primarily from an increase in cash flows from overall changes in operating assets and liabilities. Cash flows from operations are primarily dependent upon the occupancy level of our portfolio, the net effective rental rates achieved on our leases, the collectability of rent and operating escalations and recoveries from our tenants, and the level of operating and other costs. We believe our cash flows from operating activities provide a stable source of cash to fund operating expenses. In addition, as of December 31, 2010, approximately 96% of our leases (on a rentable square footage basis) were triple net leases, requiring tenants to pay substantiall y all real estate taxes and insurance, common area, and other operating expenses (including increases thereto) in addition to base rent. We are largely dependent on the life science industry for revenues due under lease agreements. Our business could be adversely affected if the life science industry is impacted by the current economic downturn and financial and banking crisis or if the life science industry migrates from the United States to other countries. Our tenants may not be able to pay amounts due under their lease agreements if they are unsuccessful in discovering, developing, making, or selling their products or technologies. The bankruptcy or insolvency of a major tenant may also adversely affect the income produced by a property. If any of our tenants becomes a debtor in a case under the United States Bankruptcy Code, the bankruptcy court must approve any eviction. The bankruptcy court may authorize the tenant to reject and terminate its lease with us. Our claim against such a tenant for unpaid future rent would be subject to a statutory limitation that might be substantially less than the remaining rent actually owed to us under the tenant lease. Any shortfall in rent payments could adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. 61 Table of Contents Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2010 was $436.7 million compared to $409.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase in net cash used in investing activities reflects an increase in property acquisition activities offset by higher amounts of proceeds from sales of properties and a slight decrease in additions to properties during the year ended December 31, 2010, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2009. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2010 increased by $39.6 million, to $237.9 million compared to $198.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. For the year ended December 31, 2010, proceeds from the issuance of common stock and borrowings from our unsecured line of credit of approximately $1.2 billion was partially offset by principal reductions of secured notes payable and our unsecured line of credit, repurchase of certain of our 3.70% Unsecured Convertible Notes, the retirement of substantially all of our 8.00% Unsecured Convertible Notes, changes in restricted cash related to financings, and deferred financing costs paid, totaling approximately $859.9 million. Additionally, for the year ended December 31, 2010, we paid dividends on our common and preferred stock of approximately $96.2 million. For the year ended December 31, 2009, proceeds from the issuance of common stock, the issuance of our 8.00% Unsecured Convertible Notes, borrowings from secured notes payable and from our unsecured line of credit, and changes in restricted cash related to financings of approximately $1.5 billion were partially offset by the repurchase of certain of our 3.70% Unsecured Convertible Notes, principal reductions of secured notes payable and our unsecured line of credit, changes in restricted cash related to financings, and deferred financing costs paid totaling approximately $1.2 billion. Additionally, for the year ended December 31, 2009, we paid dividends on our common and preferred stock of approximately $115.0 million. Unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan We use our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan to fund working capital, the acquisition of properties, and construction activities. Our $2.25 billion unsecured credit facility, as amended in January 2011, consists of a $1.5 billion unsecured line of credit and a $750 million unsecured term loan. We may in the future elect to increase commitments under our unsecured credit facilities by up to an additional $300 million. As of December 31, 2010, we had borrowings of $748 million and $750 million outstanding under our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan, respectively, with a weighted average interest rate, including the impact of our interest rate swap agreements, of approximately 2.8%. See additional information regarding our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan on page 59. Property dispositions During the year ended December 31, 2010, we sold one property at an aggregate contract price of approximately $11.8 million. As of December 31, 2010, we had one property classified as held for sale. In November 2010, we completed sales of land parcels in Mission Bay, San Francisco for an aggregate sales price of approximately $278 million at a gain of approximately $59 million. The sales of the land parcels resulted in a reduction of our preconstruction square footage by approximately 2.0 million square feet in the Mission Bay, San Francisco submarket. The cash proceeds from these sales were used to repay outstanding borrowings under our unsecured line of credit. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we sold four properties at an aggregate contract price of approximately $20.9 million. Other resources and liquidity requirements Under our current shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, we may offer common stock, preferred stock, debt, and other securities. These securities may be issued from time to time at our discretion based on our needs and market conditions. In September 2010, we sold 5,175,000 shares of our common stock in a follow-on offering (including 675,000 shares issued upon full exercise of the underwriters over-allotment option). The shares were issued at a price of $69.25 per share, resulting in aggregate proceeds of approximately $342.3 million (after deducting underwriters discounts and other offering costs). 62 Table of Contents In September 2009, we sold 4,600,000 shares of our common stock in a follow-on offering (including shares issued upon full exercise of the underwriters over-allotment option). The shares were issued at a price of $53.25 per share, resulting in aggregate proceeds of approximately $233.5 million (after deducting underwriters discounts and other offering costs). In April 2009, we completed a private offering of $240 million of our 8.00% Unsecured Convertible Notes. In June 2010, we completed an exchange of approximately $232.7 million of our 8.00% Unsecured Convertible Notes. In July 2010, we repurchased, in a privately negotiated transaction, an additional $7.1 million of our 8.00% Unsecured Convertible Notes. As of December 31, 2010, approximately $250,000 principal amount of our 8.00% Unsecured Convertible Notes remained outstanding. In March 2009, we sold 7,000,000 shares of our common stock in a follow-on offering. The shares were issued at a price of $38.25 per share, resulting in aggregate proceeds of approximately $254.6 million (after deducting underwriters discounts and other offering costs). We hold interests, together with certain third parties, in companies which we consolidate in our financial statements. These third parties may contribute equity into these entities primarily related to their share of funds for construction and financing related activities. Exposure to environmental liabilities In connection with the acquisition of all of our properties, we have obtained Phase I environmental assessments to ascertain the existence of any environmental liabilities or other issues. The Phase I environmental assessments of our properties have not revealed any environmental liabilities that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations taken as a whole, nor are we aware of any material environmental liabilities that have occurred since the Phase I environmental assessments were completed. In addition, we carry a policy of pollution legal liability insurance covering exposure to certain environmental losses at substantially all of our properties. Inflation As of December 31, 2010, approximately 96% of our leases (on a rentable square footage basis) were triple net leases, requiring tenants to pay substantially all real estate taxes and insurance, common area, and other operating expenses (including increases thereto) in addition to base rent. Approximately 91% of our leases (on a rentable square footage basis) contained effective annual rent escalations that were either fixed (generally ranging from 3.0% to 3.5%) or indexed based on the consumer price index or another index. Accordingly, we do not believe that our earnings or cash flow from real estate operations are subject to any significant risk from inflation. An increase in inflation, however, could result in an increase in the cost of our variable rate borrowings, including borrowings related to our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan. 63 Table of Contents Funds from operations GAAP basis accounting for real estate assets utilizes historical cost accounting and assumes real estate values diminish over time. In an effort to overcome the difference between real estate values and historical cost accounting for real estate assets, the Board of Governors of NAREIT established the measurement tool of FFO. Since its introduction, FFO has become a widely used non-GAAP financial measure among REITs. We believe that FFO is helpful to investors as an additional measure of the performance of an equity REIT. We compute FFO in accordance with standards established by the Board of Governors of NAREIT in its April 2002 White Paper (the White Paper ) and related implementation guidance, which may differ from the methodology for calculating FFO utilized by other equity REITs, and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other REITs. The White Paper defines FFO as net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. While FFO is a relevant and widely used measure of operating performance for REITs, it should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indication of financial performance, or to cash flows from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of our liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make distributions (see Liquidity and Capital Resources Principal Liquidity Needs Cash Flows above for information regarding these measures of cash flow). The following table presents a reconciliation of net income attributable to Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. common stockholders, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to FFO, to FFO attributable to Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. common stockholders (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Net income attributable to Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. common stockholders $ 105,941 $ 104,974 $ 90,746 Add: Depreciation and amortization (1) 126,640 118,508 108,743 Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 3,729 7,047 3,799 Net income attributable to unvested restricted stock awards 995 1,270 1,327 Subtract: Gain on sales of property (2) (59,466 ) (2,627 ) (20,401 ) FFO attributable to noncontrolling interests (4,226 ) (3,843 ) (4,108 ) FFO attributable to unvested restricted stock awards (1,608 ) (2,694 ) (2,596 ) FFO attributable to Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. common stockholders 172,005 222,635 177,510 Effect of dilutive securities and assumed conversion: Assumed conversion of 8.00% Unsecured Convertible Notes 7,781 11,943 Amounts attributable to unvested restricted stock awards (22 ) 118 9 FFO attributable to Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. common stockholders assuming effect of dilutive securities and assumed conversion $ 179,764 $ 234,696 $ 177,519 (1) Includes depreciation and amortization classified in discontinued operations related to assets held for sale (for the periods prior to when such assets were designated as held for sale ). (2) Gain on sales of property relates to land parcels and one operating property sold during 2010, four operating properties sold during 2009, and eight operating properties sold during 2008. 64 Table of Contents
