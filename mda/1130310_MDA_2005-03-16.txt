ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis should be read in combination with our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 herein. OVERVIEW BACKGROUND We are a public utility holding company, created on August 31, 2002 as part of a corporate restructuring of Reliant Energy, Incorporated (Reliant Energy) in compliance with requirements of the Texas Electric Choice Plan (Texas electric restructuring law). We are the successor to Reliant Energy for financial reporting purposes under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Our operating subsidiaries own and operate electric transmission and distribution facilities, natural gas distribution facilities, interstate pipelines and natural gas gathering, processing and treating facilities. We are a registered holding company under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, as amended (1935 Act). For information about the 1935 Act, please read " -- Liquidity and Capital Resources -- Future Sources and Uses of Cash -- Certain Contractual and Regulatory Limits on Ability to Issue Securities and Pay Dividends on Our Common Stock." Our indirect wholly owned subsidiaries include: - CenterPoint Energy Houston Electric, LLC (CenterPoint Houston), which owns and operates our electric transmission and distribution business in the Texas Gulf Coast area; and - CenterPoint Energy Resources Corp. (CERC Corp., and together with its subsidiaries, CERC), which owns and operates our local gas distribution companies, interstate pipelines and gas gathering systems, provides various ancillary services, and offers variable and fixed price physical natural gas supplies to commercial and industrial customers and natural gas distributors. In July 2004, we announced our agreement to sell our majority owned subsidiary, Texas Genco Holdings, Inc. (Texas Genco), to Texas Genco LLC (formerly known as GC Power Acquisition LLC), an entity owned in equal parts by affiliates of The Blackstone Group, Hellman & Friedman LLC, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. L.P. and Texas Pacific Group. On December 15, 2004, Texas Genco completed the sale of its fossil generation assets (coal, lignite and gas-fired plants) to Texas Genco LLC for $2.813 billion in cash. Following the sale, Texas Genco distributed $2.231 billion in cash to us. Texas Genco's principal remaining asset is its ownership interest in a nuclear generating facility. The final step of the transaction, the merger of Texas Genco 39 <PAGE> with a subsidiary of Texas Genco LLC in exchange for an additional cash payment of $700 million to us, is expected to close during the first half of 2005, following receipt of approval from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). At the time of Reliant Energy's corporate restructuring, it owned an 83% interest in Reliant Resources, Inc., now known as Reliant Energy, Inc. (RRI). On September 30, 2002, we distributed that interest to our shareholders (the RRI Distribution). BUSINESS SEGMENTS In this section, we discuss our results from continuing operations on a consolidated basis and individually for each of our business segments. We also discuss our liquidity, capital resources and critical accounting policies. CenterPoint Energy is first and foremost an energy delivery company and it is our intention to remain focused on this segment of the energy business. The results of our business operations are significantly impacted by weather, customer growth, cost management, rate proceedings before regulatory agencies and other actions of the various regulatory agencies to which we are subject. Our transmission and distribution services remain subject to rate regulation and are reported in the Electric Transmission & Distribution business segment as are impacts of generation-related stranded costs and other true-up balances recoverable by the regulated utility. Although our former retail sales business is no longer conducted by us, retail customers remained regulated customers of our former integrated electric utility, Reliant Energy HL&P, through the date of their first meter reading in 2002. Sales of electricity to retail customers in 2002 prior to this meter reading are reflected in the Electric Transmission & Distribution business segment. Our reportable business segments include: Electric Transmission & Distribution Our electric transmission and distribution operations provide electric transmission and distribution services to retail electric providers serving approximately 1.9 million metered customers in a 5,000-square-mile area of the Texas Gulf coast that has a population of approximately 4.8 million people and includes Houston. On behalf of retail electric providers, CenterPoint Houston delivers electricity from power plants to substations and from one substation to another and to retail electric customers in locations throughout the control area managed by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, Inc. (ERCOT). ERCOT serves as the regional reliability coordinating council for member electric power systems in Texas. ERCOT membership is open to consumer groups, investor and municipally owned electric utilities, rural electric cooperatives, independent generators, power marketers and retail electric providers. The ERCOT market represents approximately 85% of the demand for power in Texas and is one of the nation's largest power markets. Transmission services are provided under tariffs approved by the Public Utility Commission of Texas (the Texas Utility Commission). Operations include construction and maintenance of electric transmission and distribution facilities, metering services, outage response services and other call center operations. Distribution services are provided under tariffs approved by the Texas Utility Commission. Natural Gas Distribution CERC owns and operates our natural gas distribution business, which engages in intrastate natural gas sales to, and natural gas transportation for, approximately 3 million residential, commercial and industrial customers in Arkansas, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Oklahoma and Texas. These operations are regulated as natural gas utility operations. Its operations also include non-rate regulated retail and wholesale gas sales to, and transportation services for, commercial and industrial customers in the six states listed above as well as several other Midwestern states. 40 <PAGE> Pipelines and Gathering CERC's pipelines and gathering business operates two interstate natural gas pipelines as well as gas gathering facilities and also provides pipeline services. CERC's gathering operations are conducted by a wholly owned gas gathering subsidiary, CenterPoint Energy Field Services, Inc. (CEFS). CEFS is a natural gas gathering and processing business serving natural gas fields in the Midcontinent basin of the United States that interconnect with CERC's pipelines, as well as other interstate and intrastate pipelines. CEFS operates gathering pipelines, which collect natural gas from approximately 200 separate systems located in major producing fields in Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Texas. CEFS, through its Service Star operating division, provides remote data monitoring and communications services to affiliates and third parties. The Service Star operating division currently provides monitoring activities at over 6,000 locations across Alabama, Arkansas, Kansas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, New Mexico, Texas and Wyoming. Other Operations Our Other Operations business segment includes office buildings and other real estate used in our business operations and other corporate operations which support all of our business operations. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY RECENT EVENTS 2004 TRUE-UP PROCEEDING Pursuant to the Texas Electric Choice Plan (the Texas electric restructuring law), CenterPoint Houston is permitted to recover certain costs associated with the transition to a competitive retail electric market in Texas. The amount of costs recoverable was determined in a true-up proceeding before the Texas Utility Commission. In March 2004, CenterPoint Houston filed the final true-up application required by the Texas electric restructuring law with the Texas Utility Commission. CenterPoint Houston's requested true-up balance was $3.7 billion, excluding interest and net of the retail clawback from RRI. In June, July and September 2004, the Texas Utility Commission conducted hearings on and held public meetings addressing CenterPoint Houston's true-up application. In December 2004, the Texas Utility Commission approved a final order in CenterPoint Houston's true-up proceeding authorizing CenterPoint Houston to recover $2.3 billion including interest through August 31, 2004, subject to adjustments to reflect the benefit of certain deferred taxes and the accrual of interest and payment of excess mitigation credits after August 31, 2004. Based on our analysis of the Texas Utility Commission's final order, we recorded an after-tax charge to earnings in 2004 of $977 million to write-down our electric generation-related regulatory assets to their realizable value, which is reflected as an extraordinary loss in the Statements of Consolidated Operations. Additionally, we have recorded other income of $226 million in the fourth quarter of 2004 representing the return on our true-up balance for the years 2002, 2003 and 2004 based on the Texas Utility Commission's final decision on this matter. In January 2005, we appealed certain aspects of the final order seeking to increase the true-up balance ultimately recovered by CenterPoint Houston. Other parties have also appealed the order, seeking to reduce the amount authorized for CenterPoint Houston's recovery. Although we believe we have meritorious arguments and that the other parties' appeals are without merit, no prediction can be made as to the ultimate outcome or timing of such appeals. In December 2004, CenterPoint Houston filed for approval of a financing order to issue transition bonds to securitize its true-up balance, which will be adjusted downward to reflect the benefit of certain deferred taxes previously recovered through rates, and upward to reflect the accrual of interest and payment of excess mitigation credits occurring after August 31, 2004. On March 9, 2005, the Texas Utility Commission issued its order allowing CenterPoint Houston to securitize approximately $1.8 billion and requiring that the benefit of certain deferred taxes be reflected as a reduction in the competition transition charge. CenterPoint Houston also has filed an application for a competition transition charge to recover any portion of its adjusted true-up balance that it is not able to recover through the issuance of transition bonds. Hearings in this proceeding are scheduled for April 2005. 41 <PAGE> The balance approved by the Texas Utility Commission in the 2004 True-Up Proceeding includes $699 million in environmental expenditures incurred by Texas Genco, of which approximately $50 million was not projected to be spent until 2005 and 2006. CenterPoint Houston has agreed to return to its customers any funds not expended on environmental projects by December 31, 2006. The December 2004 final order in the 2004 True-Up Proceeding requires CenterPoint Houston to demonstrate by January 31, 2007, that the $699 million was spent on environmental projects or to refund its customers the unspent funds, along with interest. SALE OF TEXAS GENCO Disposition. On December 14, 2004, Texas Genco merged with an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of CenterPoint Energy. As a result of the merger, Texas Genco became our indirect wholly owned subsidiary, and all of Texas Genco's publicly held shares (other than 227 shares held by shareholders who validly perfected their dissenter's rights under Texas law) were converted into the right to receive $47 per share in cash without interest (the Merger Consideration) less any applicable withholding taxes. In connection with the merger, Texas Genco entered into a credit agreement (the Overnight Bridge Loan) under which it borrowed approximately $716 million on December 14, 2004 to finance the payment of the aggregate Merger Consideration payable as a result of the merger. Texas Genco's shares ceased to be publicly traded as of the close of trading on December 14, 2004. The merger was part of the first step of the sale transaction announced in July 2004 in which Texas Genco LLC agreed to acquire Texas Genco for approximately $3.65 billion in cash. On December 15, 2004, Texas Genco completed the sale of its fossil generation assets (coal, lignite and gas-fired plants) to Texas Genco LLC for $2.813 billion in cash. Texas Genco used approximately $716 million of the cash proceeds from the sale to repay the Overnight Bridge Loan and distributed $2.231 billion, consisting of the balance of the cash proceeds from the sale and cash on hand, to us. We used the proceeds primarily to repay outstanding indebtedness. In connection with the sale of Texas Genco's fossil generation assets to Texas Genco LLC, Texas Genco, LP, a subsidiary of Texas Genco (Genco LP), also entered into a services agreement with Texas Genco LLC, under which Texas Genco LLC has agreed to provide at cost energy dispatch and coordination services to Genco LP, administer Genco LP's PUC-mandated capacity auctions and market Genco LP's excess capacity and energy to third parties. For those services, Genco LP will pay a monthly fee. Following the sale of its fossil generation assets, Texas Genco's principal remaining asset is its interest in the South Texas Project Electric Generating Station, a nuclear generating facility (South Texas Project). Texas Genco currently owns a 30.8% interest in the South Texas Project, that is subject to increase pursuant to the right of first refusal described below, and currently bears a corresponding 30.8% share of the capital and operating costs associated with the project. In connection with the sale of Texas Genco's fossil generation assets to Texas Genco LLC, Genco LP entered into a power purchase and sale agreement with a subsidiary of Texas Genco LLC, which we refer to as the back-to-back power purchase agreement. Under this agreement, Genco LP has agreed to sell forward a substantial portion of Genco LP's total share of the energy from the South Texas Project through December 31, 2008. Genco LP has agreed to sell this energy on a unit-contingent basis, meaning that Genco LP will be excused (subject to the contingent payment for economic costs described below) from its obligations to deliver this energy to the extent the energy is unavailable as a result of a derating or forced outage at the South Texas Project or other specified causes. During the period from the closing of the first step of the sale transaction until the closing of the second step, the pricing for the energy sold under the back-to-back power purchase agreement will be at the weighted-average price achieved by Texas Genco LLC on its firm forward sales in the South ERCOT zone, subject to payment by Genco LP to Texas Genco LLC, in the event the second step does not close, of 50% of the economic cost (i.e., liquidated damages payable to third parties or cost of cover) incurred by Texas Genco LLC during that period as a result of energy from the South Texas Project being unavailable to meet the contract quantity. After any termination of the transaction agreement, the pricing for this energy will be at 42 <PAGE> 90% of such weighted-average price, with no contingent payment for economic costs. The transaction agreement may be terminated under various circumstances, including a failure to close the second step of the sale transaction by April 30, 2005 (which date may be extended by either party for up to two consecutive 90-day periods if NRC approval has not yet been obtained or is being contested and all other closing conditions are capable of being satisfied). The second step of the transaction, the merger of Texas Genco with a subsidiary of Texas Genco LLC in exchange for an additional cash payment to us of $700 million, is expected to close during the first half of 2005 following receipt of approval from the NRC. Total cash proceeds to CenterPoint Energy from both steps of the transaction are expected to be $2.931 billion. We recorded an after-tax loss of approximately $214 million in 2004 related to the sale of Texas Genco and an additional after-tax loss of $152 million offsetting our interest in Texas Genco's 2004 earnings from July 1, 2004. Until the sale of Texas Genco is complete, our interest in any future Texas Genco earnings will be offset by an increase in the loss on the pending sale. The consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K present Texas Genco's operations as discontinued operations in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets," (SFAS No. 144). Right of First Refusal. In September 2004, Genco LP signed an agreement to purchase a portion of AEP Texas Central Company's (AEP) 25.2% interest in the South Texas Project for approximately $174 million. Once the purchase is complete, Genco LP will own an additional 13.2% interest in the South Texas Project for a total of 44%, or approximately 1,100 MW. This purchase agreement was entered into pursuant to Genco LP's right of first refusal to purchase this interest when AEP announced its agreement to sell this interest to a third-party. In addition to AEP's ownership interest and Genco LP's current 30.8% ownership, the 2,500 MW nuclear plant is currently 28%-owned by City Public Service of San Antonio (CPS) and 16%-owned by Austin Energy. CPS is expected to purchase AEP's remaining 12% ownership interest under its right of first refusal. The sale is subject to approval by the NRC. Texas Genco expects to fund the purchase of its share of AEP's interest, including reimbursements of draws under letters of credit, with existing cash balances that have been provided to cash collateralize the letters of credit as described below and, if necessary, cash expected to be generated through operations. If CPS were to default and fail to purchase the 12% interest it has agreed to acquire, Texas Genco would purchase AEP's entire 25.2% interest in the South Texas Project, in which case Texas Genco would need approximately $158 million of additional cash. We expect this transaction will be completed by the end of the second quarter of 2005. In December 2004, prior to the consummation of the sale of Texas Genco's coal, lignite and gas-fired generation assets to Texas Genco LLC, the $250 million revolving credit facility of Genco LP was terminated and the then outstanding letters of credit aggregating $182 million issued under the facility in favor of AEP relating to the right of first refusal were cash collateralized at 105% of their face amount. In February 2005, Genco LP also established a $75 million term loan facility under which borrowings may be made for working capital purposes at LIBOR plus 50 basis points. Two drawings aggregating $75 million may be made under the facility which matures on the earlier of August 2005 or the closing of the final step of the Texas Genco sale. An initial draw of $59 million was made in February 2005. This facility is secured by a lien on Texas Genco's equity and partnership interests in its subsidiaries and cash collateral accounts described above. SIGNIFICANT EVENTS IN 2005 Resolution of legal proceedings relating to the 2004 True-Up Proceeding, recovery of amounts approved in the 2004 True-Up Proceeding and the sale of our remaining interest in Texas Genco are the most significant events facing us in 2005. We expect to use the proceeds received from these events to further repay a portion of our indebtedness and for other general corporate purposes. In January 2005, we appealed certain aspects of the final order seeking to increase the true-up balance ultimately recovered by CenterPoint Houston. Other parties have also appealed the order, seeking to reduce the amount authorized for CenterPoint Houston's recovery. Although we believe we have meritorious arguments and that the other parties' appeals are without merit, no prediction can be made as to the ultimate outcome or timing of such appeals. 43 <PAGE> We recorded an after-tax loss of approximately $214 million in 2004 related to the sale of our interest in Texas Genco. See "Recent Events" above. We also recorded an after-tax extraordinary loss of $977 million in 2004 related to the 2004 True-Up Proceeding as discussed above. Portions of these losses recorded in periods prior to the fourth quarter of 2004 reduced our earnings below the level required for us to continue paying our current quarterly dividends out of current earnings as required under our Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) financing order. However, in May 2004, we received an order from the SEC under the 1935 Act authorizing us to continue to pay our current quarterly dividend in the second and third quarters of 2004 out of capital or unearned surplus in the event we had such losses. We declared a dividend in the fourth quarter of 2004 out of current earnings. If our earnings for subsequent quarters are insufficient to pay dividends from current earnings, additional authority would be required from the SEC for payment of the quarterly dividend from capital or unearned surplus, but there can be no assurance that the SEC would authorize such payments. These losses would delay the timing of our achievement of a ratio of common equity to total capitalization of 30% as generally required by the SEC under the 1935 Act. Accordingly, we may issue equity and take other actions to achieve a future equity capitalization of 30%. In March 2005, we replaced our $750 million revolving credit facility with a $1 billion five-year revolving credit facility. Borrowings may be made under the facility at LIBOR plus 100 basis points based on current credit ratings. An additional utilization fee of 12.5 basis points applies to borrowings any time more than 50% of the facility is utilized. Changes in credit ratings would lower or raise the increment to LIBOR depending on whether ratings improved or were lowered. In March 2005, CenterPoint Houston established a $200 million five-year revolving credit facility. Borrowings may be made under the facility at LIBOR plus 75 basis points based on CenterPoint Houston's current credit rating. An additional utilization fee of 12.5 basis points applies to borrowings any time more than 50% of the facility is utilized. Changes in credit ratings would lower or raise the increment to LIBOR depending on whether ratings improved or were lowered. CenterPoint Houston also established a $1.31 billion credit facility in March 2005. This facility is available to be utilized only to refinance CenterPoint Houston's $1.31 billion term loan maturing in November 2005 in the event that proceeds from the issuance of transition bonds are not sufficient to repay such term loan. Drawings may be made under this credit facility until November 2005, at which time any outstanding borrowings are converted to term loans maturing in November 2007. Net proceeds from the issuance of transition bonds and certain new net indebtedness for borrowed money issued by CenterPoint Houston in excess of $200 million must be used to repay borrowings under the new facility. Based on CenterPoint Houston's current credit ratings, borrowings under the facility can be made at LIBOR plus 75 basis points. Changes in credit ratings would lower or raise the increment to LIBOR depending on whether ratings improved or were lowered. Any drawings under this facility must be secured by CenterPoint Houston's general mortgage bonds in the same principal amount and bearing the same interest rate as such drawings. In March 2005, we filed a registration statement relating to an offer to exchange our 3.75% convertible senior notes due 2023 for a new series of 3.75% convertible senior notes due 2023. This registration statement has not yet been declared effective by the SEC. We expect to conduct the exchange offer in response to the guidance set forth in Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 04-8, "The Effect of Contingently Convertible Instruments on Diluted Earnings Per Share." Under that guidance, because the terms of the new notes provide for settlement of the principal amount on conversion in cash rather than our common stock, exchanging new notes for old notes will allow us to exclude the portion of the conversion value of the new notes attributable to their principal amount from our computation of diluted earnings per share from continuing operations. 44 <PAGE> 2004 HIGHLIGHTS In addition to the extraordinary loss related to the 2004 True-Up Proceeding and the loss related to the sale of Texas Genco as discussed above, our operating performance for 2004 compared to 2003 were affected by: - the termination of revenues related to Excess Cost Over Market (ECOM) as of January 1, 2004 compared to ECOM revenues of $661 million recorded in 2003; - an increase in operating income of $135 million in our Electric Transmission & Distribution business segment, excluding ECOM, primarily due to the absence of an $87 million reserve recorded in 2003 related to the final fuel reconciliation, excluding interest, and a $15 million reversal of this reserve in 2004; - an increase in other income of $226 million related to the return on our true-up balance as discussed above; - rate increases of $15 million in 2004 in our Natural Gas Distribution business segment; - increased operating income of $22 million in our Pipelines and Gathering business segment primarily from increased throughput, favorable commodity prices and increased ancillary services; and - continued customer growth, with the addition of over 92,000 metered electric and gas customers. CERTAIN FACTORS AFFECTING FUTURE EARNINGS Our past earnings and results of operations are not necessarily indicative of our future earnings and results of operations. The magnitude of our future earnings and results of our operations will depend on or be affected by numerous factors including: - the timing and amount of our recovery of the true-up components; - the timing and results of the monetization of our remaining interest in Texas Genco; - state and federal legislative and regulatory actions or developments, including deregulation, re-regulation, constraints placed on our activities or business by the 1935 Act, changes in or application of laws or regulations applicable to other aspects of our business and actions with respect to: - allowed rates of return; - rate structures; - recovery of investments; and - operation and construction of facilities; - industrial, commercial and residential growth in our service territory and changes in market demand and demographic patterns; - the timing and extent of changes in commodity prices, particularly natural gas; - changes in interest rates or rates of inflation; - weather variations and other natural phenomena; - the timing and extent of changes in the supply of natural gas; - commercial bank and financial market conditions, our access to capital, the cost of such capital, receipt of certain financing approvals under the 1935 Act, and the results of our financing and refinancing efforts, including availability of funds in the debt capital markets; - actions by rating agencies; - inability of various counterparties to meet their obligations to us; 45 <PAGE> - non-payment for our services due to financial distress of our customers, including RRI; - the outcome of the pending securities lawsuits against us, Reliant Energy and RRI; - the ability of RRI to satisfy its obligations to us, including indemnity obligations; - our ability to control costs; - the investment performance of our employee benefit plans; - our internal restructuring or other restructuring options that may be pursued; - our potential business strategies, including acquisitions or dispositions of assets or businesses, which cannot be assured to be completed or beneficial to us; and - other factors discussed in Item 1 of this report under "Risk Factors."

We reported income from continuing operations before extraordinary loss of $205 million ($0.61 per diluted share) for 2004 as compared to $409 million ($1.24 per diluted share) for 2003. The decrease in income from continuing operations of $204 million was primarily due to the termination of revenues in our Electric Transmission & Distribution business segment related to ECOM as of January 1, 2004, which had contributed $430 million of income in 2003, higher net transmission costs of $6 million related to our Electric Transmission & Distribution business segment and increased interest expense of $36 million related to continuing operations as discussed below. These items were partially offset by the absence of an $87 million reserve recorded in 2003 by our Electric Transmission & Distribution business segment related to the final fuel reconciliation, a $15 million reversal of this reserve in 2004 and $226 million of other income related to a return on the true-up balance of our Electric Transmission & Distribution business segment. These items were a result of the Texas Utility Commission's final orders in the fuel reconciliation and the 2004 True-Up Proceeding. Additionally, income from continuing operations was favorably impacted by increased operating income of $31 million related to customer growth in our Electric Transmission & Distribution business segment, increased operating income of $20 million in our Natural Gas Distribution business segment primarily due to rate increases, increased operating income of $22 million in our Pipelines and Gathering business segment primarily from increased throughput, favorable commodity prices and increased ancillary services, and a gain of $10 million on the sale of land by our Electric Transmission & Distribution business segment. Net loss for 2004 included an after-tax extraordinary loss of $977 million ($2.72 per diluted share) from a write-down of regulatory assets based on our analysis of the Texas Utility Commission's final order in the 2004 True-Up Proceeding. Additionally, net loss for 2004 included a net after-tax loss from discontinued operations of Texas Genco of $133 million ($0.37 per diluted share). Net income for 2003 includes the cumulative effect of an accounting change resulting from the adoption of SFAS No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" ($80 million after-tax gain, or $0.24 earnings per diluted share), which is included in discontinued operations related to Texas Genco. 2003 COMPARED TO 2002 Income from Continuing Operations. We reported income from continuing operations of $409 million ($1.24 per diluted share) for 2003 compared to $482 million ($1.61 per diluted share) for 2002. The decrease in income from continuing operations for 2003 compared to 2002 of $73 million was primarily due to a $69 million increase in expenses related to CenterPoint Houston's final fuel reconciliation, a $36 million reduction in non-cash ECOM revenue and an increase in interest expense of $29 million related to continuing operations due to higher borrowing costs and increased debt levels as discussed below. INTEREST EXPENSE AND OTHER FINANCE CHARGES In 2002 and 2003, our $3.85 billion credit facility consisted of a revolver and a term loan. This facility was amended in October 2003 to a $2.35 billion credit facility, consisting of a revolver and a term loan. According to the terms of the $3.85 billion credit facility, any net cash proceeds received from the sale of Texas Genco were required to be applied to repay borrowings under the credit facility. According to the terms of the $2.35 billion credit facility, until such time as the facility had been reduced to $750 million, 100% of any net cash proceeds received from the sale of Texas Genco were required to be applied to repay borrowings under the credit facility and reduce the amount available under the credit facility. In the fourth quarter of 2004, we reduced borrowings under our credit facility by $1.574 billion and retired $375 million of trust preferred securities. We expensed $15 million of unamortized loan costs in the fourth quarter of 2004 that were associated with the credit facility. In accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 87-24 "Allocation of Interest to Discontinued Operations", we have reclassified interest to discontinued operations of Texas Genco based on net proceeds to be received from the sale of Texas Genco of $2.5 billion, and have applied the proceeds to the amount of debt assumed to be paid down in each respective period according to the terms of the respective credit facilities in effect for those periods. In periods where only the term loan was 47 <PAGE> assumed to be repaid, the actual interest paid on the term loan was reclassified. In periods where a portion of the revolver was assumed to be repaid, the percentage of that portion of the revolver to the total outstanding balance was calculated, and that percentage was applied to the actual interest paid in those periods to compute the amount of interest reclassified. Total interest expense incurred was $764 million, $942 million and $849 million in 2002, 2003 and 2004, respectively. We have reclassified $52 million, $201 million and $72 million of interest expense in 2002, 2003 and 2004, respectively, based upon actual interest expense incurred within our discontinued operations and interest expense associated with debt that would have been required to be repaid as a result of our disposition of Texas Genco. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS BY BUSINESS SEGMENT The following table presents operating income (in millions) for each of our business segments for 2002, 2003 and 2004. Some amounts from the previous years have been reclassified to conform to the 2004 presentation of the financial statements. These reclassifications do not affect consolidated net income.

(2) Usage volumes for commercial and industrial customers are included in total GWh delivered; however, the majority of these customers are billed on a peak demand (KW) basis and, as a result, revenues do not vary based on consumption. 2004 Compared to 2003. Our Electric Transmission & Distribution business segment reported operating income of $494 million for 2004, consisting of $456 million for the regulated electric transmission and distribution utility and $38 million for the transition bond company subsidiary of CenterPoint Houston that issued $749 million principal amount of transition bonds in 2001. For 2003, operating income totaled $1.0 billion, consisting of $321 million for the regulated electric transmission and distribution utility, $38 million for the transition bond company and $661 million of non-cash income associated with ECOM. Operating income increased $31 million from continued customer growth and a $10 million gain on a land sale, partially offset by milder weather and decreased usage of $18 million and higher net transmission costs of $6 million. Additionally, operating income in 2004 was favorably impacted by the absence of $87 million reserve recorded in 2003 related to the final fuel reconciliation and a $15 million reversal of this fuel reserve in 2004 as a result of the Texas Utility Commission's final orders in the fuel reconciliation and the 2004 True-Up Proceeding. 2003 Compared to 2002. Our Electric Transmission & Distribution business segment reported operating income of $1.0 billion for 2003 consisting of $321 million for the regulated electric transmission and distribution utility, $38 million for the transition bond company and $661 million of non-cash income associated with ECOM. For 2002, operating income totaled $1.1 billion, consisting of $359 million for the regulated electric transmission and distribution utility, $40 million for the transition bond company and $697 million of non-cash income associated with ECOM. Increased revenues from customer growth ($40 million) were more than offset by transition period revenues that only occurred in 2002 ($90 million) and decreased industrial demand, resulting in an overall decrease in electric revenues from the regulated electric transmission and distribution business of $62 million. Additionally, non-cash ECOM revenue decreased $36 million as a result of higher operating margins from sales of generation based on the state-mandated capacity auctions. Operation and maintenance expenses decreased in 2003 compared to 2002 primarily due to the absence of purchased power costs that occurred in 2002 during the transition period to deregulation ($48 million), a decrease in labor costs as a result of work force reductions in 2002 ($13 million), non-recurring contract services expense primarily related to transition to deregulation in 2002 ($10 million) and lower bad debt expense related to transition revenues in 2002 ($10 million). These decreases were offset by an increase in expenses related to CenterPoint Houston's final fuel reconciliation ($69 million) and an increase in benefits expense primarily due to increased pension costs ($18 million). Taxes other than income taxes decreased $15 million primarily due to the absence of gross receipts tax associated with transition period revenue in the first quarter of 2002 ($9 million). 49 <PAGE> NATURAL GAS DISTRIBUTION The following table provides summary data of our Natural Gas Distribution business segment for 2002, 2003 and 2004 (in millions, except throughput data): <Table> <Caption> YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, ------------------------ 2002 2003 2004 ------ ------ ------ <S> <C> <C> <C> Operating Revenues......................................... $3,960 $5,435 $6,684 Operating Expenses: Natural gas.............................................. 2,995 4,428 5,631 Operation and maintenance................................ 539 560 566 Depreciation and amortization............................ 126 136 143 Taxes other than income taxes............................ 102 109 122 ------ ------ ------ Total operating expenses.............................. 3,762 5,233 6,462 ------ ------ ------ Operating Income........................................... $ 198 $ 202 $ 222 ====== ====== ====== Throughput (in billion cubic feet (Bcf)): Residential.............................................. 175 183 175 Commercial and industrial................................ 253 238 237 Non-rate regulated commercial and industrial............. 471 511 579 Eliminations............................................. (48) (96) (134) ------ ------ ------ Total Throughput...................................... 851 836 857 ====== ====== ====== </Table> 2004 Compared to 2003. Our Natural Gas Distribution business segment reported operating income of $222 million for 2004 as compared to $202 million for 2003. Increases in operating income of $4 million from continued customer growth with the addition of 45,000 customers since December 31, 2003, $15 million from rate increases, $11 million from the impact of the 2003 change in estimate of margins earned on unbilled revenues implemented in 2003 and $9 million related to certain regulatory adjustments made to the amount of recoverable gas costs in 2003 were partially offset by the $8 million impact of milder weather. Operations and maintenance expense increased $6 million for 2004 as compared to 2003. Excluding an $8 million charge recorded in the first quarter of 2004 for severance costs associated with staff reductions, which has reduced costs in later periods, operation and maintenance expenses decreased by $2 million. 2003 Compared to 2002. Our Natural Gas Distribution business segment's operating income increased $4 million in 2003 compared to 2002 primarily due to higher revenues from rate increases implemented late in 2002 ($33 million), improved margins from our unregulated commercial and industrial sales ($6 million) and continued customer growth with the addition of over 38,000 customers since December 2002 ($6 million). These increases were partially offset by decreased revenues as a result of a decrease in the estimate of margins earned on unbilled revenues ($11 million). Additionally, operating income was negatively impacted by higher employee benefit expenses primarily due to increased pension costs ($13 million), certain costs being included in operating expense subsequent to the amendment of a receivables facility in November 2002 as compared to being included in interest expense in the prior year ($7 million) and increased bad debt expense primarily due to higher gas prices ($9 million). 50 <PAGE> PIPELINES AND GATHERING The following table provides summary data of our Pipelines and Gathering business segment for 2002, 2003 and 2004 (in millions, except throughput data): <Table> <Caption> YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, ------------------------ 2002 2003 2004 ------ ------ ------ <S> <C> <C> <C> Operating Revenues.......................................... $ 374 $ 407 $ 451 Operating Expenses: Natural gas............................................... 32 61 46 Operation and maintenance................................. 130 129 164 Depreciation and amortization............................. 41 40 44 Taxes other than income taxes............................. 18 19 17 ----- ----- ----- Total operating expenses............................... 221 249 271 ----- ----- ----- Operating Income............................................ $ 153 $ 158 $ 180 ===== ===== ===== Throughput (Bcf): Natural gas sales......................................... 14 9 11 Transportation............................................ 845 794 859 Gathering................................................. 287 292 321 Elimination(1)............................................

Our Pipelines and Gathering business segment's operating income increased by $22 million in 2004 compared to 2003. Operating margins (revenues less fuel costs) increased by $59 million primarily due to favorable commodity pricing ($3 million), increased demand for certain transportation services driven by commodity price volatility ($36 million) and increased throughput and enhanced services related to our core gas gathering operations ($11 million). The increase in operating margin was partially offset by higher operation and maintenance expenses of $35 million primarily due to compliance with pipeline integrity regulations ($4 million) and costs relating to environmental matters ($9 million). Project work expenses included in operation and maintenance expense increased ($11 million) resulting in a corresponding increase in revenues billed for these services ($15 million). 2003 Compared to 2002. Our Pipelines and Gathering business segment's operating income increased $5 million in 2003 compared to 2002. The increase was primarily a result of increased margins (revenues less fuel costs) due to higher commodity prices ($8 million), improved margins from new transportation contracts to power plants ($7 million) and improved margins from enhanced services in our gas gathering operations ($4 million), partially offset by higher pension, employee benefit and other miscellaneous expenses ($14 million). Project work expenses included in operation and maintenance expense decreased ($15 million) resulting in a corresponding decrease in revenues billed for these services ($14 million). 51 <PAGE> OTHER OPERATIONS The following table provides summary data for our Other Operations business segment for 2002, 2003 and 2004 (in millions): <Table> <Caption> YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, ------------------ 2002 2003 2004 ---- ---- ---- <S> <C> <C> <C> Operating Revenues.......................................... $30 $ 28 $ 8 Operating Expenses.......................................... 37 53 40 --- ---- ---- Operating Loss.............................................. $(7) $(25) $(32) === ==== ==== </Table> 2004 Compared to 2003. Our Other Operations business segment's operating loss in 2004 compared to 2003 increased $7 million primarily due to a reduction in rental income from RRI in 2004 as compared to 2003, partially offset by changes in unallocated corporate costs in 2004 as compared to 2003. 2003 Compared to 2002. Our Other Operations business segment's operating loss in 2003 compared to 2002 increased $18 million primarily due to changes in unallocated corporate costs in 2002 as compared to 2003. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS On September 30, 2002, we distributed all of the shares of RRI common stock owned by us on a pro-rata basis to our shareholders. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared to reflect the effect of the RRI Distribution as described above on the CenterPoint Energy consolidated financial statements. The consolidated financial statements present the RRI businesses (Wholesale Energy, European Energy, Retail Energy and related corporate costs) as discontinued operations in accordance with SFAS No. 144. We also recorded a $4.4 billion non-cash loss on disposal of these discontinued operations in 2002. This loss represents the excess of the carrying value of our net investment in RRI over the market value of RRI common stock at the time of the RRI Distribution. In February 2003, we sold our interest in Argener, a cogeneration facility in Argentina, for $23 million. The carrying value of this investment was approximately $11 million as of December 31, 2002. We recorded an after-tax gain of $7 million from the sale of Argener in the first quarter of 2003. In April 2003, we sold our final remaining investment in Argentina, a 90 percent interest in Empresa Distribuidora de Electricidad de Santiago del Estero S.A. We recorded an after-tax loss of $3 million in the second quarter of 2003 related to our Latin America operations. We have completed our strategy of exiting all of our international investments. The consolidated financial statements present these operations as discontinued operations in accordance with SFAS No. 144. In November 2003, we sold CenterPoint Energy Management Services, Inc. (CEMS), a business that provides district cooling services in the Houston central business district and related complementary energy services to district cooling customers and others. We recorded an after-tax loss of $1 million from the sale of CEMS in the fourth quarter of 2003. We recorded an after-tax loss in discontinued operations of $16 million ($25 million pre-tax) during the second quarter of 2003 to record the impairment of the CEMS long-lived assets based on the impending sale and to record one-time termination benefits. The consolidated financial statements present these operations as discontinued operations in accordance with SFAS No. 144. In July 2004, we announced our agreement to sell our majority owned subsidiary, Texas Genco, to Texas Genco LLC. On December 15, 2004, Texas Genco completed the sale of its fossil generation assets (coal, lignite and gas-fired plants) to Texas Genco LLC for $2.813 billion in cash. Following the sale, Texas Genco distributed $2.231 billion in cash to us. Texas Genco's principal remaining asset is its ownership interest in a nuclear generating facility. The final step of the transaction, the merger of Texas Genco with a subsidiary of Texas Genco LLC in exchange for an additional cash payment to us of $700 million, is expected to close during the first half of 2005, following receipt of approval from the NRC. The Company recorded an after-tax loss of $214 million in 2004 related to the sale of Texas Genco. In addition, as a result of this transaction, any 52 <PAGE> future earnings of Texas Genco will be offset by an increase in the loss. The consolidated financial statements present these operations as discontinued operations in accordance with SFAS No. 144. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES HISTORICAL CASH FLOWS The net cash provided by/used in operating, investing and financing activities for 2002, 2003 and 2004 is as follows (in millions): <Table> <Caption> YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, ----------------------- 2002 2003 2004 ----- ----- ------- <S> <C> <C> <C> Cash provided by (used in): Operating activities..................................... $ 455 $ 650 $ 381 Investing activities..................................... (513) (504) 1,709 Financing activities..................................... 723 (434) (2,107) Discontinued operations.................................. (379) 72 95 </Table> CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES Net cash provided by operating activities in 2004 decreased $269 million compared to 2003 primarily due to increased pension contributions of $453 million and decreased income tax refunds of $74 million, partially offset by the receipt of a $177 million retail clawback payment from RRI in the fourth quarter of 2004 and decreased accounts receivable attributable to a higher level of accounts receivable being sold under CERC Corp.'s receivables facility ($81 million). Additionally, other changes in working capital items, primarily increased net accounts receivable and accounts payable due to higher natural gas prices in December 2004 as compared to December 2003 ($99 million), contributed to the overall decrease in cash provided by operating activities. Cash provided by operating activities will be negatively impacted in 2005 by the payment of taxes associated with the sale of Texas Genco, the proceeds of which are reflected in cash provided by investing activities in 2004 as discussed below. Net cash provided by operating activities in 2003 increased $195 million compared to 2002 primarily due to higher income tax refunds received of $170 million, partially offset by higher interest paid related to outstanding borrowings of $130 million. CASH PROVIDED BY (USED IN) INVESTING ACTIVITIES Net cash provided by investing activities increased $2.2 billion in 2004 as compared to 2003 primarily due to proceeds of $2.231 billion received from the sale of Texas Genco's fossil generation assets in December 2004, partially offset by increased capital expenditures of $34 million primarily related to our Electric Transmission & Distribution and Other Operations business segments. Net cash used in investing activities decreased $9 million during 2003 compared to 2002 due primarily to decreased capital expenditures in our Electric Transmission & Distribution business segment primarily resulting from process improvements that included revised construction and design standards. CASH PROVIDED BY (USED IN) FINANCING ACTIVITIES In 2004, debt payments exceeded net loan proceeds by $2.0 billion. Proceeds received from the sale of Texas Genco's fossil generation assets in December 2004 and the retail clawback payment from RRI as discussed above were used to retire a $915 million term loan, pay down $944 million in borrowings under our revolving credit facility and retire $375 million of trust preferred securities. As of December 31, 2004, we had borrowings of $239 million under our revolving credit facility which were used to fund a portion of the $420 million pension contribution made in December 2004. 53 <PAGE> In 2003, debt payments exceeded net loan proceeds by $338 million. In 2002, net loan proceeds exceeded debt payments by $1.1 billion. Additionally, common stock dividends paid by us in 2003 were $202 million less than in 2002. Since the beginning of 2003, the terms of our credit facility limited the common stock dividend to $0.10 per share per quarter. This dividend limitation was eliminated in the new $1 billion credit facility entered into in March 2005. FUTURE SOURCES AND USES OF CASH Our liquidity and capital requirements are affected primarily by our results of operations, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, tax payments, working capital needs, various regulatory actions and appeals relating to such regulatory actions. Our principal cash requirements during 2005, excluding the requirements of Texas Genco, include the following: - approximately $655 million of capital expenditures; - an estimated $77 million in refunds by CenterPoint Houston of excess mitigation credits (assuming they are terminated as of April 29, 2005); - dividend payments on CenterPoint Energy common stock and debt service payments; - $1.8 billion of maturing long-term debt, including $47 million of transition bonds; and - income tax payments, including approximately $430 million in the first quarter of 2005. Significant cash inflows in 2005 are expected to include the following: - cash proceeds of approximately $1.8 from the issuance of transition bonds; and - cash proceeds of $700 million from the sale of Texas Genco. We expect that borrowings under our credit facilities and anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our cash needs for 2005. CenterPoint Houston's $1.31 billion term loan requires the proceeds from the issuance of transition bonds to be used to reduce the term loan unless refused by the lenders. CenterPoint Houston's $1.31 billion credit facility is expected to be utilized if the $1.31 billion term loan matures prior to the issuance of sufficient transition bonds. The credit facility requires that proceeds from the issuance of transition bonds and certain new net indebtedness for borrowed money issued by CenterPoint Houston in excess of $200 million be used to repay borrowings under the credit facility. The 1935 Act regulates our financing ability, as more fully described in "-- Certain Contractual and Regulatory Limits on Ability to Issue Securities and Pay Dividends on Our Common Stock" below. The following table sets forth our capital expenditures for 2004 and estimates of our capital requirements for 2005 through 2009, excluding expenditures related to discontinued operations (in millions): <Table> <Caption> 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- <S> <C> <C> <C> <C> <C> <C> Electric Transmission & Distribution....... $235 $282 $295 $295 $271 $272 Natural Gas Distribution................... 197 218 203 207 209 210 Pipelines and Gathering.................... 73 139 139 74 52 102 Other Operations........................... 25 16 14 9 10 4 ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- Total.................................... $530 $655 $651 $585 $542 $588 ==== ==== ==== ==== ==== ==== </Table> 54 <PAGE> The following table sets forth estimates of our contractual obligations to make future payments for 2005 through 2009 and thereafter (in millions): <Table> <Caption> 2010 AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS(1) TOTAL 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 THEREAFTER - -------------------------- ------- ------ ---- ---- ---- ---- ---------- <S> <C> <C> <C> <C> <C> <C> <C> Long-term debt, including current portion(2).......... $ 9,015 $1,831 $212 $ 66 $572 $80 $6,254 Capital leases................ 9 5 3 -- -- -- 1 Operating leases(3)........... 110 25 21 18 14 6 26 Non-trading derivative liabilities................. 33 26 -- 4 2 1 -- Other commodity commitments(4).............. 1,432 807 401 193 29 1 1 ------- ------ ---- ---- ---- --- ------ Total contractual cash obligations.............. $10,599 $2,694 $637 $281 $617 $88 $6,282 ======= ====== ==== ==== ==== === ====== </Table> - --------------- (1) Contributions to the pension plan are not required in 2005; however, we expect to contribute approximately $29 million to our postretirement benefits plan in 2005 to fund a portion of our obligations in accordance with rate orders or to fund pay-as-you-go costs associated with the plan. (2) The amounts reflected for long-term debt obligations in the table above do not include interest and have been updated to reflect the new credit facilities established on March 7, 2005. (3) For a discussion of operating leases, please read Note 11(b) to our consolidated financial statements. (4) For a discussion of other commodity commitments, please read Note 11(a) to our consolidated financial statements. In October 2001, CenterPoint Houston was required by the Texas Utility Commission to reverse the amount of redirected depreciation and accelerated depreciation taken for regulatory purposes as allowed under the 1998 transition plan and the Texas electric restructuring law. CenterPoint Houston recorded a regulatory liability to reflect the prospective refund of the accelerated depreciation and in January 2002 CenterPoint Houston began paying excess mitigation credits, which were to be paid over a seven-year period. The annual payment of excess mitigation credits is approximately $264 million. In January 2005, CenterPoint Houston filed a writ of mandamus petition with the Texas Supreme Court asking that court to order the Texas Utility Commission to terminate immediately the payment of all excess mitigation credits and to ensure full recovery of all excess mitigation credits. Although we believe we have meritorious arguments, a writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy and no prediction can be made as to the ultimate outcome or timing of the mandamus petition. If the Supreme Court denies our mandamus petition, we will continue to pursue this issue through regular appellate mechanisms. On March 1, 2005, a non-unanimous settlement was filed in Docket No. 30774, which involves the adjustment of RRI's Price-to-Beat. Under the terms of that settlement, the excess mitigation credits being paid by CenterPoint Houston would be terminated as of April 29, 2005. The Texas Utility Commission approved the settlement on March 9, 2005. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements. Other than operating leases, we have no off-balance sheet arrangements. However, we do participate in a receivables factoring arrangement. CERC Corp. has a bankruptcy remote subsidiary, which we consolidate, which was formed for the sole purpose of buying receivables created by CERC and selling those receivables to an unrelated third-party. This transaction is accounted for as a sale of receivables under the provisions of SFAS No. 140, "Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities", and, as a result, the related receivables are excluded from the Consolidated Balance Sheet. In January 2004, the $100 million receivables facility was replaced with a $250 million receivables facility terminating in January 2005. In January 2005, the facility was extended to January 2006 and temporarily increased, for the period from January 2005 to June 2005, to $375 million. For additional information regarding this transaction please read Note 2(i) to our consolidated financial statements. 55 <PAGE> Credit Facilities. In March 2005, we replaced our $750 million revolving credit facility with a $1 billion five-year revolving credit facility. Borrowings may be made under the facility at LIBOR plus 100 basis points based on current credit ratings. An additional utilization fee of 12.5 basis points applies to borrowings any time more than 50% of the facility is utilized. Changes in credit ratings would lower or raise the increment to LIBOR depending on whether ratings improved or were lowered. The facility contains covenants, including a debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) covenant and an EBITDA to interest covenant. Borrowings under our credit facility are available upon customary terms and conditions for facilities of this type, including a requirement that we represent, except as described below, that no "material adverse change" has occurred at the time of a new borrowing under this facility. A "material adverse change" is defined as the occurrence of a material adverse change in our ability to perform our obligations under the facility. The base line for any determination of a relative material adverse change is our most recently audited financial statements. At any time after the first time our credit ratings reach at least BBB by Standard & Poor's Ratings Services, a division of The McGraw Hill Companies (S&P), and Baa2 by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. (Moody's), BBB+ by S&P and Baa3 by Moody's, or BBB- by S&P and Baa1 by Moody's, or if the drawing is to retire maturing commercial paper, we are not required to represent as a condition to such drawing that no material adverse change has occurred or that no litigation expected to have a material adverse effect has occurred. Also in March 2005, CenterPoint Houston established a $200 million five-year revolving credit facility. Borrowings may be made under the facility at LIBOR plus 75 basis points based on CenterPoint Houston's current credit rating. An additional utilization fee of 12.5 basis points applies to borrowings any time more than 50% of the facility is utilized. Changes in credit ratings would lower or raise the increment to LIBOR depending on whether ratings improved or were lowered. CenterPoint Houston also established a $1.31 billion credit facility in March 2005. This facility is available to be utilized only to refinance CenterPoint Houston's $1.31 billion term loan maturing in November 2005 in the event that proceeds from the issuance of transition bonds are not sufficient to repay such term loan. Drawings may be made under this credit facility until November 2005, at which time any outstanding borrowings are converted to term loans maturing in November 2007. Net proceeds from the issuance of transition bonds and certain new net indebtedness for borrowed money issued by CenterPoint Houston in excess of $200 million must be used to repay borrowings under the new facility. Based on CenterPoint Houston's current credit ratings, borrowings under the facility can be made at LIBOR plus 75 basis points. Changes in credit ratings would lower or raise the increment to LIBOR depending on whether ratings improved or were lowered. Any drawings under this facility must be secured by CenterPoint Houston's general mortgage bonds in the same principal amount and bearing the same interest rate as such drawings. CenterPoint Houston's $200 million and $1.31 billion credit facilities each contain covenants, including a debt to total capitalization covenant of 68% and an EBITDA to interest covenant. Borrowings under CenterPoint Houston's $200 million credit facility and its $1.31 billion credit facility are available notwithstanding that a material adverse change has occurred or litigation that could be expected to have a material adverse effect has occurred, so long as other customary terms and conditions are satisfied. In February 2005, Genco LP also established a $75 million term loan facility under which borrowings may be made for working capital purposes at LIBOR plus 50 basis points. Two drawings aggregating $75 million may be made under the facility which matures on the earlier of August 2005 or the closing of the final step of the Texas Genco sale. An initial draw of $59 million was made in February 2005. This facility is secured by a lien on Texas Genco's equity and the partnership interests in its subsidiaries and cash collateral accounts set up in connection with the sale of Texas Genco's coal, lignite and gas-fired generation assets. 56 <PAGE> As of March 11, 2005, we had the following credit facilities (in millions): <Table> <Caption> AMOUNT UTILIZED AT DATE EXECUTED COMPANY SIZE OF FACILITY MARCH 11, 2005 TERMINATION DATE - ---------------- ------------------- ---------------- ------------------ ---------------- <S> <C> <C> <C> <C> March 23, 2004 CERC Corp. $ 250 $ -- March 23, 2007 March 7, 2005 CenterPoint Energy 1,000 235 March 7, 2010 March 7, 2005 CenterPoint Houston 200 30 March 7, 2010 March 7, 2005 CenterPoint Houston 1,310 -- (1) February 3, 2005 Texas Genco 75 59 (2) </Table> - --------------- (1) Revolver until November 2005 with two-year term-out of borrowed moneys.

Temporary Investments. On December 31, 2004, we had temporary external investments of $144 million, of which $22 million were investments of Texas Genco and are included in current assets of discontinued operations in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Money Pools. We have two "money pools" through which our participating subsidiaries can borrow or invest on a short-term basis. Funding needs are aggregated and external borrowing or investing is based on the net cash position. Following Texas Genco's certification by the FERC as an "exempt wholesale generator" under the 1935 Act in October 2003, it could no longer participate with our regulated subsidiaries in the same money pool. In October 2003, we established our second money pool in which Texas Genco and its subsidiaries are currently the sole participants. The net funding requirements of the money pool in which our regulated subsidiaries participate are expected to be met with borrowings under CenterPoint Energy's revolving credit facility. Except in an emergency situation (in which case we could provide funding pursuant to applicable SEC rules), we would be required to obtain approval from the SEC to issue and sell securities for purposes of funding Texas Genco's operations via the money pool established in October 2003. We do not currently expect to fund the operations of Texas Genco via the money pool. A $75 million credit facility, established in February 2005 at a subsidiary of Texas Genco, is expected to be used to fund Texas Genco's operations. The terms of both money pools are in accordance with requirements applicable to registered public utility holding companies under the 1935 Act and under an order from the SEC relating to our financing activities and those of our subsidiaries on June 30, 2003 (June 2003 Financing Order). This order expires in June 2005; however, we will seek appropriate approval for the money pool prior to that date. Impact on Liquidity of a Downgrade in Credit Ratings. As of March 1, 2005, Moody's, S&P, and Fitch, Inc. (Fitch) had assigned the following credit ratings to senior debt of CenterPoint Energy and certain subsidiaries: <Table> <Caption> MOODY'S S&P FITCH ------------------- ------------------- ------------------- COMPANY/INSTRUMENT RATING OUTLOOK(1) RATING OUTLOOK(2) RATING OUTLOOK(3) - ------------------ ------ ---------- ------ ---------- ------ ---------- <S> <C> <C> <C> <C> <C> <C> CenterPoint Energy Senior Unsecured Debt............................. Ba2 Negative BBB- Negative BBB- Stable CenterPoint Houston Senior Secured Debt (First Mortgage Bonds)...... Baa2 Negative BBB Negative BBB+ Stable CERC Corp. Senior Debt............. Ba1 Stable BBB Negative BBB Stable </Table> - --------------- (1) A "negative" outlook from Moody's reflects concerns over the next 12 to 18 months which will either lead to a review for a potential downgrade or a return to a stable outlook. A "stable" outlook from Moody's 57 <PAGE> indicates that Moody's does not expect to put the rating on review for an upgrade or downgrade within 18 months from when the outlook was assigned or last affirmed. (2) An S&P rating outlook assesses the potential direction of a long-term credit rating over the intermediate to longer term. (3) A "stable" outlook from Fitch encompasses a one-to-two year horizon as to the likely ratings direction. We cannot assure you that these ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that one or more of these ratings will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency. We note that these credit ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our securities and may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the rating agency. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Any future reduction or withdrawal of one or more of our credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on our ability to obtain short- and long-term financing, the cost of such financings and the execution of our commercial strategies. A decline in credit ratings would increase borrowing costs under our $1 billion credit facility, CenterPoint Houston's $200 million credit facility and its $1.31 billion credit facility and CERC's $250 million revolving credit facility. A decline in credit ratings would also increase the interest rate on long-term debt to be issued in the capital markets and would negatively impact our ability to complete capital market transactions. If we were unable to maintain an investment-grade rating from at least one rating agency, as a registered public utility holding company we would be required to obtain further approval from the SEC for any additional capital markets transactions as more fully described in "-- Certain Contractual and Regulatory Limits on Ability to Issue Securities and Pay Dividends on Our Common Stock" below. Additionally, a decline in credit ratings could increase cash collateral requirements and reduce margins of our Natural Gas Distribution business segment. As described above under "-- Credit Facilities," our revolving credit facility contains a "material adverse change" clause that could impact our ability to make new borrowings under this facility. CERC Corp.'s credit facility also contains a "material adverse change" clause which relates to CERC Corp.'s ability to perform its obligations under the credit agreement. Texas Genco's term loan facility contains a "material adverse change" clause that could impact the second borrowing under the facility. The clause relates to the business, condition (financial or otherwise), operations, performance or properties of Texas Genco. Borrowings under CenterPoint Houston's $200 million credit facility and its $1.3 billion facility are available notwithstanding that a material adverse change has occurred or litigation that could be expected to have a material adverse effect has occurred. In September 1999, we issued 2.0% Zero-Premium Exchangeable Subordinated Notes due 2029 (ZENS) having an original principal amount of $1.0 billion. Each ZENS note is exchangeable at the holder's option at any time for an amount of cash equal to 95% of the market value of the reference shares of Time Warner Inc. (TW Common) attributable to each ZENS note. If our creditworthiness were to drop such that ZENS note holders thought our liquidity was adversely affected or the market for the ZENS notes were to become illiquid, some ZENS noteholders might decide to exchange their ZENS notes for cash. Funds for the payment of cash upon exchange could be obtained from the sale of the shares of TW Common that we own or from other sources. We own shares of TW Common equal to 100% of the reference shares used to calculate our obligation to the holders of the ZENS notes. ZENS note exchanges result in a cash outflow because deferred tax liabilities related to the ZENS notes and TW Common shares become current tax obligations when ZENS notes are exchanged and TW Common shares are sold. CenterPoint Energy Gas Services, Inc. (CEGS), a wholly owned subsidiary of CERC Corp., provides comprehensive natural gas sales and services to industrial and commercial customers that are primarily located within or near the territories served by our pipelines and natural gas distribution subsidiaries. In order to hedge its exposure to natural gas prices, CEGS has agreements with provisions standard for the industry that establish credit thresholds and require a party to provide additional collateral on two business days' notice when that party's rating or the rating of a credit support provider for that party (CERC Corp. in this case) falls below those levels. As of December 31, 2004, the senior unsecured debt of CERC Corp. was rated BBB 58 <PAGE> by S&P and Ba1 by Moody's. We estimate that as of December 31, 2004, unsecured credit limits extended to CEGS by counterparties could aggregate $100 million; however, utilized credit capacity is significantly lower. Cross Defaults. Under our revolving credit facility, a payment default on, or a non-payment default that permits acceleration of, any indebtedness exceeding $50 million by us or any of our significant subsidiaries will cause a default. Pursuant to the indenture governing our senior notes, a payment default by us, CERC Corp. or CenterPoint Houston in respect of, or an acceleration of, borrowed money and certain other specified types of obligations, in the aggregate principal amount of $50 million will cause a default. As of February 28, 2005, we had issued five series of senior notes aggregating $1.4 billion in principal amount under this indenture. A default by CenterPoint Energy would not trigger a default under our subsidiaries' debt instruments or bank credit facilities. Other Factors that Could Affect Cash Requirements. In addition to the above factors, our liquidity and capital resources could be affected by: - cash collateral requirements that could exist in connection with certain contracts, including gas purchases, gas price hedging and gas storage activities of our Natural Gas Distribution business segment, particularly given gas price levels and volatility; - acceleration of payment dates on certain gas supply contracts under certain circumstances, as a result of increased gas prices and concentration of suppliers; - increased costs related to the acquisition of gas for storage; - increases in interest expense in connection with debt refinancings; - various regulatory actions; - the ability of RRI and its subsidiaries to satisfy their obligations as the principal customers of CenterPoint Houston and in respect of RRI's indemnity obligations to us and our subsidiaries; and - various of the risks identified in "Risk Factors". Certain Contractual and Regulatory Limits on Ability to Issue Securities and Pay Dividends on Our Common Stock. Limitations imposed on us as a registered public utility holding company under the 1935 Act affect our ability to issue securities, pay dividends on our common stock or take other actions that affect our capitalization. The secured term loan and each of the credit facilities of CenterPoint Houston limits CenterPoint Houston's debt, excluding transition bonds, as a percentage of its total capitalization to 68%. CERC Corp.'s bank facility and its receivables facility limit CERC's debt as a percentage of its total capitalization to 60% and contain an EBITDA to interest covenant. Our $1 billion credit facility contains a debt to EBITDA covenant and an EBITDA to interest covenant. CenterPoint Houston's $1.31 billion and $200 million credit facilities also contain EBITDA to interest covenants. We are a registered public utility holding company under the 1935 Act. The 1935 Act and related rules and regulations impose a number of restrictions on our activities and those of our subsidiaries other than Texas Genco. The 1935 Act, among other things, limits our ability and the ability of our regulated subsidiaries to issue debt and equity securities without prior authorization, restricts the source of dividend payments to current and retained earnings without prior authorization, regulates sales and acquisitions of certain assets and businesses and governs affiliated service, sales and construction contracts. The June 2003 Financing Order is effective until June 30, 2005. Additionally, we have received several subsequent orders which provide additional financing authority. These orders establish limits on the amount of external debt and equity securities that can be issued by us and our regulated subsidiaries without additional authorization but generally permit us to refinance our existing obligations and those of our regulated subsidiaries. Each of us and our subsidiaries is in compliance with the authorized limits. Discussed below are the incremental amounts of debt and equity that we are authorized to issue after giving effect to our capital 59 <PAGE> markets transactions in 2003 and 2004. The orders also permit utilization of undrawn credit facilities at CenterPoint Energy and CERC. As of February 28, 2005: - CenterPoint Energy is authorized to issue an additional aggregate $1.7 billion of debt securities and $875 million of preferred stock and preferred securities; - CenterPoint Houston is authorized to issue an additional aggregate $273 million of debt and an aggregate $250 million of preferred stock and preferred securities; and - CERC is authorized to issue an additional $2 million of debt and an additional aggregate $250 million of preferred stock and preferred securities. The SEC has reserved jurisdiction over, and must take further action to permit, the issuance of $478 million of additional debt at CenterPoint Energy, $430 million of additional debt at CERC and $250 million of additional debt at CenterPoint Houston. The orders require that if we or any of our regulated subsidiaries issue securities that are rated by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization (NRSRO), the security to be issued must obtain an investment grade rating from at least one NRSRO and, as a condition to such issuance, all outstanding rated securities of the issuer and of CenterPoint Energy must be rated investment grade by at least one NRSRO. The orders also contain certain requirements for interest rates, maturities, issuance expenses and use of proceeds. The 1935 Act limits the payment of dividends to payment from current and retained earnings unless specific authorization is obtained to pay dividends from other sources. The SEC has reserved jurisdiction over payment of $500 million of dividends from CenterPoint Energy's unearned surplus or capital. Further authorization would be required to make those payments. As of December 31, 2004, we had a retained deficit on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We recorded an after-tax loss of approximately $214 million in 2004 related to the sale of our remaining interest in Texas Genco. In addition, we recorded an after-tax extraordinary loss of $977 million in 2004 related to the 2004 True-Up Proceeding. Portions of these losses recorded in periods prior to the fourth quarter of 2004 reduced our earnings below the level required for us to continue paying our current quarterly dividends out of current earnings as required under our SEC financing order. However, in May 2004, we received an order from the SEC under the 1935 Act authorizing us to continue to pay our current quarterly dividend in the second and third quarters of 2004 out of capital or unearned surplus in the event we had such losses. We declared a dividend in the fourth quarter of 2004 out of current earnings. If our earnings for subsequent quarters are insufficient to pay dividends from current earnings, additional authority would be required from the SEC for payment of the quarterly dividend from capital or unearned surplus, but there can be no assurance that the SEC would authorize such payments. These losses would delay the timing of our achievement of a ratio of common equity to total capitalization of 30%, as generally required by the SEC under the 1935 Act. Accordingly, we may issue equity and take other actions to achieve a future equity capitalization of 30%. The June 2003 Financing Order also requires that CenterPoint Houston and CERC maintain a ratio of common equity to total capitalization of 30%. Other Factors Affecting the Upstreaming of Cash from Subsidiaries. CenterPoint Houston's term loan, subject to certain exceptions, limits the application of proceeds from capital markets transactions over $200 million by CenterPoint Houston to repayment of debt existing in November 2002. CenterPoint Houston will distribute recovery of the true-up components not used to repay CenterPoint Houston's indebtedness to us through the payment of dividends. CenterPoint Houston requires SEC action to approve any dividends in excess of its current and retained earnings. To maintain CenterPoint Houston's capital structure at the appropriate levels, we may reinvest funds in CenterPoint Houston in the form of equity contributions or intercompany loans. Under the orders described under "-- Certain Contractual and Regulatory Limits on Ability to Issue Securities and Pay Dividends on Our Common Stock," CenterPoint Houston's member's equity as a percentage of total capitalization generally must be at least 30%, although the SEC has permitted the percentage to be below this level for other companies taking into account non-recourse securitization debt as a component of capitalization. 60 <PAGE> CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES A critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and requires management to make difficult, subjective or complex accounting estimates. An accounting estimate is an approximation made by management of a financial statement element, item or account in the financial statements. Accounting estimates in our historical consolidated financial statements measure the effects of past business transactions or events, or the present status of an asset or liability. The accounting estimates described below require us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made. Additionally, different estimates that we could have used or changes in an accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur could have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition or results of operations. The circumstances that make these judgments difficult, subjective and/or complex have to do with the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be predicted with certainty. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments. These estimates may change as new events occur, as more experience is acquired, as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes. Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements. We believe the following accounting policies involve the application of critical accounting estimates. Accordingly, these accounting estimates have been reviewed and discussed with the audit committee of the board of directors. ACCOUNTING FOR RATE REGULATION SFAS No. 71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation" (SFAS No. 71), provides that rate-regulated entities account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the recovery of those incurred costs in rates if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. Application of SFAS No. 71 to the electric generation portion of our business was discontinued as of June 30, 1999. Our Electric Transmission & Distribution business continues to apply SFAS No. 71 which results in our accounting for the regulatory effects of recovery of stranded costs and other regulatory assets resulting from the unbundling of the transmission and distribution business from our electric generation operations in our consolidated financial statements. Certain expenses and revenues subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the balance sheet and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. Significant accounting estimates embedded within the application of SFAS No. 71 with respect to our Electric Transmission & Distribution business segment relate to $1.9 billion of recoverable electric generation-related regulatory assets as of December 31, 2004. These costs are recoverable under the provisions of the Texas electric restructuring law. Based on our analysis of the Texas Utility Commission's final order in the 2004 True-Up Proceeding, we recorded an after-tax charge to earnings in 2004 of approximately $977 million to write-down our electric generation-related regulatory assets to their realizable value, which is reflected as an extraordinary loss in the Statements of Consolidated Operations. IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS AND INTANGIBLES We review the carrying value of our long-lived assets, including goodwill and identifiable intangibles, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such carrying values may not be recoverable, and annually for goodwill as required by SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." No impairment of goodwill was indicated based on our analysis as of January 1, 2004. Unforeseen events and changes in circumstances and market conditions and material differences in the value of long-lived assets and intangibles due to changes in estimates of future cash flows, regulatory matters and operating costs could negatively affect the fair value of our assets and result in an impairment charge. Fair value is the amount at which the asset could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties and may be estimated using a number of techniques, including quoted market prices or valuations by third parties, present value techniques based on estimates of cash flows, or multiples of earnings 61 <PAGE> or revenue performance measures. The fair value of the asset could be different using different estimates and assumptions in these valuation techniques. We recorded an after-tax loss of approximately $214 million in 2004 related to the sale of our remaining 81% interest in Texas Genco. UNBILLED ENERGY REVENUES Revenues related to the sale and/or delivery of electricity or natural gas (energy) are generally recorded when energy is delivered to customers. However, the determination of energy sales to individual customers is based on the reading of their meters, which is performed on a systematic basis throughout the month. At the end of each month, amounts of energy delivered to customers since the date of the last meter reading are estimated and the corresponding unbilled revenue is estimated. Unbilled electricity delivery revenue is estimated each month based on daily supply volumes, applicable rates and analyses reflecting significant historical trends and experience. Unbilled natural gas sales are estimated based on estimated purchased gas volumes, estimated lost and unaccounted for gas and tariffed rates in effect. As additional information becomes available, or actual amounts are determinable, the recorded estimates are revised. Consequently, operating results can be affected by revisions to prior accounting estimates. PENSION AND OTHER RETIREMENT PLANS We sponsor pension and other retirement plans in various forms covering all employees who meet eligibility requirements. We use several statistical and other factors which attempt to anticipate future events in calculating the expense and liability related to our plans. These factors include assumptions about the discount rate, expected return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases as estimated by management, within certain guidelines. In addition, our actuarial consultants use subjective factors such as withdrawal and mortality rates to estimate these factors. The actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions, higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants. These differences may result in a significant impact to the amount of pension expense recorded. Please read "-- Other Significant Matters -- Pension Plans" for further discussion. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 2(n) to the consolidated financial statements, incorporated herein by reference, for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements that affect us. OTHER SIGNIFICANT MATTERS Pension Plan. As discussed in Note 9(b) to our consolidated financial statements, we maintain a non-contributory pension plan covering substantially all employees. Employer contributions are based on actuarial computations that establish the minimum contribution required under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and the maximum deductible contribution for income tax purposes. At December 31, 2004, the projected benefit obligation exceeded the market value of plan assets by $53 million; however, the market value of the plan assets exceeded the accumulated benefit obligation by $22 million. Changes in interest rates and the market values of the securities held by the plan during 2005 could materially, positively or negatively, change our funded status and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in 2006 and beyond. In connection with the sale of our 81% interest in Texas Genco, a separate pension plan was established for Texas Genco on September 1, 2004 and we transferred a net pension liability of approximately $68 million to Texas Genco. In October 2004, Texas Genco received an allocation of assets from our pension plan pursuant to rules and regulations under ERISA. 62 <PAGE> During 2003 and 2004, we have not been required to make contributions to our pension plan. We have made voluntary contributions of $23 million and $476 million in 2003 and 2004, respectively. Under the terms of our pension plan, we reserve the right to change, modify or terminate the plan. Our funding policy is to review amounts annually and contribute an amount at least equal to the minimum contribution required under ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code. In accordance with SFAS No. 87, "Employers' Accounting for Pensions," changes in pension obligations and assets may not be immediately recognized as pension costs in the income statement, but generally are recognized in future years over the remaining average service period of plan participants. As such, significant portions of pension costs recorded in any period may not reflect the actual level of benefit payments provided to plan participants. Pension costs were $35 million, $90 million and $80 million for 2002, 2003 and 2004, respectively. For 2002, a pension benefit of $4 million was recorded related to RRI's participants. Pension benefit for RRI's participants is reflected in the Statement of Consolidated Operations as discontinued operations. In addition, included in the costs for 2002, 2003 and 2004 are $15 million, $17 million and $11 million, respectively, of expense related to Texas Genco participants. Pension expense for Texas Genco participants is reflected in the Statement of Consolidated Operations as discontinued operations. Additionally, we maintain a non-qualified benefit restoration plan which allows participants to retain the benefits to which they would have been entitled under our non-contributory pension plan except for the federally mandated limits on qualified plan benefits or on the level of compensation on which qualified plan benefits may be calculated. The expense associated with this non-qualified plan was $9 million, $8 million and $6 million in 2002, 2003 and 2004, respectively. Included in the cost for 2002 is $3 million of expense related to RRI's participants, which is reflected in discontinued operations in the Statements of Consolidated Operations. The calculation of pension expense and related liabilities requires the use of assumptions. Changes in these assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts, and future actual experience can differ from the assumptions. Two of the most critical assumptions are the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the assumed discount rate. As of December 31, 2004, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets was 8.5%, a reduction from the 9.0% rate assumed as of December 31, 2003. We believe that our actual asset allocation, on average, will approximate the targeted allocation and the estimated return on net assets. We regularly review our actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance plan assets as appropriate. As of December 31, 2004, the projected benefit obligation was calculated assuming a discount rate of 5.75%, which is a 0.5% decline from the 6.25% discount rate assumed in 2003. The discount rate was determined by reviewing yields on high-quality bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized rating agency and the expected duration of pension obligations specific to the characteristics of our plan. Pension expense for 2005, including the benefit restoration plan, is estimated to be $37 million based on an expected return on plan assets of 8.5% and a discount rate of 5.75% as of December 31, 2004. If the expected return assumption were lowered by 0.5% (from 8.5% to 8.0%), 2005 pension expense would increase by approximately $8 million. Due to significant funding that occurred during 2004, pension plan assets (excluding the unfunded benefit restoration plan) exceed the accumulated benefit obligation, which enabled us to reverse a charge to comprehensive income of $350 million, net of tax. However, if the discount rate were lowered by 0.5% (from 5.75% to 5.25%), the assumption change would increase our projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefit obligation and 2005 pension expense by approximately $106 million, $100 million and $7 million, respectively. In addition, the assumption change would have significant impacts on our Consolidated Balance Sheet by changing the pension asset recorded as of December 31, 2004 of $610 million to a pension liability of $78 million, offset by a charge to comprehensive income in 2004 of $447 million, net of tax. 63 <PAGE> For the benefit restoration plan, if the discount rate were lowered by 0.5% (from 5.75% to 5.25%), the assumption change would increase our projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefit obligation and 2005 pension expense by approximately $4 million, $3 million, and less than $1 million, respectively. In addition, the assumption change would result in a charge to comprehensive income of approximately $2 million. Future changes in plan asset returns, assumed discount rates and various other factors related to the pension plan will impact our future pension expense and liabilities. We cannot predict with certainty what these factors will be. In October 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act (AJCA) was signed into law. The AJCA made significant changes in the taxation of nonqualified deferred compensation with new Code Section 409A. Non-compliance with Section 409A can result in increased federal income taxes on nonqualified deferred compensation for employees. We are currently analyzing the impact of Section 409A and related guidance issued by the Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service, on our non-qualified plans and agreements that provide for deferred compensation. Such plans or agreements may require amendment or modification to comply with the new law. Quasi-Reorganization. On December 30, 2004, our Board of Directors adopted a plan for an accounting reorganization of the company, to be effective as of January 1, 2005. At the same time, the Manager of CenterPoint Houston adopted a similar plan for CenterPoint Houston. These plans were adopted in order to eliminate the accumulated retained earnings deficit that exists at both companies. The plan we adopted required: (1) a report to be presented to and reviewed by our Board of Directors on or before February 28, 2005 as to the completion of the valuation analysis of the accounting reorganization and the effects of the accounting reorganization on our financial statements, (2) a determination that the accounting reorganization is in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, and (3) that there be no determination by our Board of Directors on or before February 28, 2005 that the accounting reorganization is inconsistent with our regulatory obligations. We are continuing to work to complete the valuation analysis and the effects on our financial statements of the accounting reorganization, and on February 23, 2005, our Board of Directors extended until May 10, 2005 the time for making the determination described in (3) of the preceding sentence. An accounting reorganization, sometimes called a "quasi-reorganization," allows a company to extinguish a negative retained earnings balance. It involves restating a company's assets and its liabilities to their fair values. The negative balance in the retained earnings account is then brought to zero through a reduction in the other capital accounts, giving the company a "fresh start" with a zero balance in retained earnings. As of December 31, 2004, we had an accumulated retained earnings deficit of approximately $1.7 billion. That deficit stemmed from the accounting effects of (1) the distribution of our ownership interest in RRI to our shareholders in September 2002, (2) the extraordinary loss recorded in connection with the Texas Utility Commission's order related to the 2004 True-Up Proceeding and (3) the loss on discontinued operations that was recorded in connection with our sale of Texas Genco. In addition to eliminating the accumulated deficit in retained earnings and restating assets and liabilities to fair value, if a quasi-reorganization were implemented, we and CenterPoint Houston would be required to implement any accounting standards that have been issued but not yet adopted. We and CenterPoint Houston are seeking to eliminate the negative retained earnings balance because restrictions contained in the 1935 Act require registered public utility holding companies and their subsidiaries, like us and CenterPoint Houston, to obtain express authorization from the SEC to pay dividends when current or retained earnings are insufficient to do so. Eliminating the negative retained earnings balance will permit current earnings not utilized to pay dividends to more quickly build up a retained earnings balance. Under 1935 Act regulations, we could pay dividends out of this balance during periods when current earnings may not be adequate to do so. In addition, we have undertaken an obligation under the 1935 Act to achieve a minimum ratio of common equity to total capitalization of thirty percent, which, depending on the results of the restatement of assets and liabilities under the accounting reorganization, could be affected by, and will be taken into 64 <PAGE> consideration by the Board of Directors in evaluating the effects of, the accounting reorganization. We will seek such authority as may be required under the 1935 Act in connection with the quasi-reorganization.
