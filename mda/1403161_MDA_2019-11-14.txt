In June 2017, Visa, Mastercard and a fifth financial institution also reached settlements with the plaintiffs. Settlement approval hearings were held in 2018 and courts in each of the four financial institutions on behalf of merchants that accept payment by Visa and/or Mastercard credit cards. The actions allege a violation of Canada price-fixing law and various common law claims based on separate Visa and Mastercard conspiracies in respect of default interchange and certain of the networks rules.

European Commission DCC Investigation Other Litigation The full scope of damages is not yet known because not all Merchant claims have been served and Visa has substantial defenses. However, the claims that have been issued, served and/or preserved seek several billion dollars in damages. separate Mastercard cases also involving interchange claims. On July 4, 2018, the Court of Appeal overturned the lower court rulings, finding that Visa UK domestic interchange restricted competition and the question of whether Visa UK domestic interchange was exempt from the finding of restriction under applicable law had been incorrectly decided. The Court of Appeal remitted the claim to the lower court to reconsider the exemption issue and the assessment of damages. On November 29, 2018, Visa was granted permission to appeal aspects of the Court of Appeal judgment to the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom, including the question of whether Visa UK interchange restricted competition. The Supreme Court is scheduled to hold a hearing on the appeal in January 2020. two A trial took place from November 2016 to March 2017, relating to claims asserted by only one Merchant. In judgments published in November 2017 and February 2018, the court found as to that Merchant that Visa UK domestic interchange did not restrict competition, but that if it had been found to be restrictive it would not be exemptible under applicable law. In April 2018, the Court of Appeal heard the Merchant appeal of the decision alongside additional Merchants have threatened to commence similar proceedings. Standstill agreements have been entered into with respect to some of those threatened Merchant claims, several of which have been settled. While the amount of interchange being challenged could be substantial, these claims have not yet been filed and their full scope is not yet known. The Company has learned that several additional European entities have indicated that they may also bring similar claims and the Company anticipates additional claims in the future. 30 Merchants with outstanding claims. In addition, over 400 Merchants, leaving more than 100 Merchants (the capitalized term Merchant, when used in this section, means a merchant together with subsidiary/affiliate companies that are party to the same claim) have commenced proceedings against Visa Europe, Visa Inc. and other Visa subsidiaries in the UK and Germany primarily relating to interchange rates in Europe and in some cases relating to fees charged by Visa and certain Visa rules. They seek damages for alleged anti-competitive conduct in relation to one or more of the following types of interchange fees for credit and debit card transactions: UK domestic, Irish domestic, other European domestic, intra-European Economic Area and/or other inter-regional.

Note 5 U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans The Company believes it has substantial defenses to the claims asserted in the putative class actions and individual merchant actions, but the final outcome of individual legal claims is inherently unpredictable. The Company could incur judgments, enter into settlements or revise its expectations regarding the outcome of merchants claims, and such developments could have a material adverse effect on the Company financial results in the period in which the effect becomes probable and reasonably estimable. While the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan is designed to address monetary liability in these matters, see .

The cases name as defendants Visa Inc., Visa U.S.A., Visa International, Mastercard Incorporated and Mastercard International Incorporated, although some also include certain U.S. financial institutions as defendants. A number of the cases include allegations that Visa has monopolized, attempted to monopolize, and/or conspired to monopolize debit card-related market segments. Some of the cases seek an injunction against the setting of default interchange rates; certain Visa operating rules relating to merchants, including the honor-all-cards rule; and various transaction fees, including the fixed acquirer network fee. In addition, some cases assert that Visa, Mastercard and/or their member banks conspired to prevent the adoption of chip-and-PIN authentication in the U.S. or otherwise circumvent competition in the debit market. Certain individual merchants have filed amended complaints to, among other things, add claims for injunctive relief and update claims for damages. 50 Since May 2013, more than Interchange Multidistrict Litigation (MDL) Individual Merchant Actions Settlement discussions with plaintiffs purporting to act on behalf of the putative Injunctive Relief Class are ongoing.

From time to time, the Company may engage in settlement discussions or mediations with respect to one or more of its outstanding litigation matters, either on its own behalf or collectively with other parties. Note 20 Legal Matters The Company is also subject to examinations by various state and foreign tax authorities. All material state and foreign tax matters have been concluded for years through fiscal 2002. The timing and outcome of the final resolutions of the federal, state and foreign tax examinations and refund claims are uncertain. As such, it is not reasonably possible to estimate the impact that the final outcomes could have on the Company unrecognized tax benefits in the next 12 months. The India tax authorities completed the first level examination of the Company income tax returns for the taxable years falling within the period from fiscal 2010 to 2015, and proposed certain assessments. The Company objected to these proposed assessments and filed appeals to the appellate authorities. While the timing and outcome of the final resolution of these appeals are uncertain, the Company believes that its income tax provision adequately reflects its income tax obligations in India. During fiscal 2013, the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) completed its examination of the Company fiscal 2003 through 2009 Canadian tax returns and proposed certain assessments. Based on the findings of its examination, the CRA also proposed certain assessments to the Company fiscal 2010 through 2017 Canadian tax returns. The Company filed notices of objection against these assessments and, in fiscal 2015, completed the appeals process without reaching a settlement with the CRA. In April 2016, the Company petitioned the Tax Court of Canada to overturn the CRA assessments. Legal proceedings continue to be in progress. The Company continues to believe that its income tax provision adequately reflects its obligations to the CRA. The Company fiscal 2012 through 2015 U.S. federal income tax return is currently under Internal Revenue Service (IRS) examination.

Adjustments to the conversion rate may be executed once in any six-month period unless a single, individual loss greater than Visa Inc. net income will not be impacted by VE territory covered losses as long as the as-converted value of the preferred stock is greater than the covered loss. VE territory covered losses will be recorded when the loss is deemed to be probable and reasonably estimable, or in the case of attorney fees, when incurred. Concurrently, the Company will record a reduction to stockholders equity, which represents the Company right to recover such losses through adjustments to the conversion rate applicable to the preferred stock. The reduction to stockholders equity is recorded in a contra-equity account referred to as right to recover for covered losses. Unlike the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, the Europe retrospective responsibility plan does not have an escrow account that is used to fund settlements or judgments. The Company is entitled to recover VE territory covered losses through a periodic adjustment to the class A common stock conversion rates applicable to the UK&I and Europe preferred stock. The total amount of protection available through the preferred stock component of the Europe retrospective responsibility plan is equivalent to the as-converted value of the preferred stock, which can be calculated at any point in time as the product of: (a) the outstanding number of shares of preferred stock; (b) the current conversion rate applicable to each class of preferred stock; and (c) Visa class A common stock price. This amount differs from the value of the preferred stock recorded within stockholders equity on the Company consolidated balance sheets.

Goodwill that is expected to be deductible for tax purposes amounts to million 643 $ of deferred cash consideration. Total purchase consideration has been allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired, and to liabilities assumed based on preliminary valuations as the Company continues to gather information necessary to finalize the valuations. These preliminary values may further change in future reporting periods until finalization of the valuations, which will occur no later than the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. Goodwill of million 54 $ in cash and million 886 $ , which consisted of million 940 $ , the Company acquired several businesses for a total purchase consideration of 2019 In fiscal Note 2 Acquisitions In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-15, which aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation cost incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software. The Company early adopted this standard effective October 1, 2018. The adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In March 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-05 to insert the SEC interpretive guidance from Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 into the income tax accounting codification under U.S. GAAP. The ASU permits companies to use provisional amounts for certain income tax effects of the Tax Act during a one-year measurement period. The Company previously recorded provisional amounts for the transition tax and the tax effects of various other tax provisions enacted by the Tax Act. As permitted by ASU 2018-05, the Company completed the determination of the accounting impacts of the transition tax and the tax effects of these various tax provisions in the three months ended December 31, 2018. The adjustments to the provisional amounts were not material. In addition, the Company adopted the accounting policy of accounting for taxes on global intangible low-tax income ( GILTI ) in the period that it is subject to such tax. In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-02, which allows a reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings for adjustments to tax effects that were originally recorded in other comprehensive income due to changes in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate resulting from the enactment of the U.S. tax reform legislation, commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act ). The Company will adopt the standard effective October 1, 2019. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-12, which improves the financial reporting of hedging instruments to better portray the economic results of an entity risk management activities in its financial statements. Visa early adopted the standard effective January 1, 2019, which did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In May 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-09, which amends the scope of modification accounting for share-based payment arrangements. Specifically, an entity would not apply modification accounting if the fair value, vesting conditions, and classification of the awards are the same immediately before and after the modification. The Company adopted the standard effective October 1, 2018. The adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-07, which requires that the service cost component of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost be presented in the same line item as other employee compensation costs, while the other components be presented separately as non-operating income (expense). In addition, only the service cost component is eligible for capitalization, when applicable. Retrospective application is required for the change in income statement presentation while the change in capitalized benefit cost is required to be applied prospectively. The Company adopted the standard effective October 1, 2018, which did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. The service cost component of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost is presented in personnel expenses while the other components are presented in other non-operating expense on the Company consolidated statement of operations. The Company did not apply the standard retrospectively for the change in income statement presentation as the impact would have been immaterial. September 30, 2019 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) VISA INC. Table of Contents 70 In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, which requires that a statement of cash flows includes the total of cash, cash equivalents, and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts. The Company adopted the standard effective October 1, 2018. The adoption impacted the presentation of transactions related to the U.S. litigation escrow account and customer collateral on the consolidated statements of cash flows. The prior period statement of cash flows have been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the impact of this ASU, which had no impact on the Company balance sheets, statements of operations or statements of comprehensive income for any period. In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16, which requires that entities recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset, other than inventory, when the transfer occurs. The Company adopted the standard effective October 1, 2018. The adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, which requires the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities arising from operating leases on the balance sheet. Subsequently, the FASB also issued a series of amendments to this new lease standard that address the transition methods available and clarify the guidance for lessor costs and other aspects of the new lease standard. The Company will adopt the standard effective October 1, 2019 and expects to adopt using the modified retrospective transition method without restating comparative periods. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, which amends certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments, including the requirement to measure certain equity investments at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. The Company adopted the standard effective October 1, 2018, using the modified retrospective transition method for marketable equity securities and the prospective method for non-marketable equity securities. The Company has elected to use the measurement alternative for non-marketable equity securities, defined as cost adjusted for changes from observable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer, less impairment.

September 30, 2019 for the impact of the new revenue standard on the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended Note 3 Revenues In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09, which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of goods or services to customers. This new revenue standard replaces all existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP. Subsequently, the FASB also issued a series of amendments to the new revenue standard. The new revenue standard changes the classification and timing of recognition of certain client incentives and marketing-related funds paid to customers, as well as revenues and expenses for market development funds and services provided to customers as an incentive. The Company adopted the standard effective October 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective transition method applied to the aggregate of all modifications for contracts not completed as of October 1, 2018. Results for reporting periods beginning after October 1, 2018 are presented under the new revenue standard. The comparative prior period amounts appearing on the financial statements have not been restated and continue to be reported under the prior revenue standard. See Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements . Note 15 Earnings Per Share See . The Company calculates earnings per share using the two-class method to reflect the different rights of each class and series of outstanding common stock. The dilutive effect of incremental common stock equivalents is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method. Earnings per share . Note 16 Share-based Compensation See . The Company recognizes share-based compensation cost using the fair value method of accounting. The Company recognizes compensation cost for awards with only service conditions on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period. Compensation cost for performance and market-condition-based awards is recognized on a graded-vesting basis. The amount is initially estimated based on target performance and is adjusted as appropriate based on management best estimate throughout the performance period. Share-based compensation . Note 12 Derivative and Non-derivative Financial Instruments See The Company designated the euro-denominated deferred cash consideration liability, a non-derivative financial instrument, as a hedge against a portion of the Company euro-denominated net investment in Visa Europe. Changes in the value of the deferred cash consideration liability, attributable to the change in exchange rates at the end of each reporting period, partially offset the foreign currency translation adjustments resulting from the euro-denominated net investment, are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss on the Company consolidated balance sheets. Non-derivative financial instrument designated as a net investment hedge. . Note 12 Derivative and Non-derivative Financial Instruments See Gains and losses related to changes in fair value hedges are recognized in non-operating income (expense) along with a corresponding loss or gain related to the change in value of the underlying hedged item in the same line item in the consolidated statement of operations. The change in value of net investment hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income. Amounts excluded from the effectiveness testing of net investment hedges are recognized in non-operating income (expense). Cash flows associated with derivatives designated as a fair value hedge may be included in operating, investing or financing activities on the consolidated statement of cash flows, depending on the classification of the items being hedged. Cash flows associated with financial instruments designated as net investment hedges are classified as an investing activity. Derivatives are carried at fair value on a gross basis in either prepaid and other current assets, non-current other assets, accrued liabilities or non-current other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. Gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges are accounted for either in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss on the consolidated balance sheets, or in the consolidated statements of operations in the corresponding account where revenue or expense is hedged. Gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value of derivative instruments not designated for hedge accounting are recorded in general and administrative for hedges of operating activity, or non-operating income (expense) for hedges of non-operating activity. September 30, 2019 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) VISA INC. Table of Contents 68 . The Company uses foreign exchange forward derivative contracts to reduce its exposure to foreign currency rate changes on forecasted non-functional currency denominated operational cash flows. To qualify for cash flow hedge accounting treatment, the Company formally documents, at inception of the hedge, all relationships between the hedging transactions and the hedged items, as well as the Company risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedging transactions. The Company also formally assesses whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of the hedged items and whether those derivatives may be expected to remain highly effective in future periods. Derivative financial instruments Where a non-U.S. currency is the functional currency, translation from that functional currency to the U.S. dollar is performed for balance sheet accounts using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and for revenue and expense accounts using an average exchange rate for the period. Resulting translation adjustments are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss on the consolidated balance sheets. . 2017 and 2018 , 2019 . The Company functional currency is the U.S. dollar for the majority of its foreign operations except for Visa Europe whose functional currency is the euro. Transactions denominated in currencies other than the applicable functional currency are converted to the functional currency at the exchange rate on the transaction date. At period end, monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured to the functional currency using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Resulting foreign currency transaction gains and losses related to conversion and remeasurement are recorded in general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations and were not material for fiscal Foreign currency remeasurement and translation . Note 10 Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits See The Company recognizes the funded status of its benefit plans in its consolidated balance sheets as other assets, accrued liabilities and other liabilities. The Company recognizes settlement losses when it settles pension benefit obligations, including making lump-sum cash payments to plan participants in exchange for their rights to receive specified pension benefits, when certain thresholds are met. years for the Visa Europe UK pension plan. Other assumptions involve demographic factors such as retirement age, mortality, attrition and the rate of compensation increases. The Company evaluates assumptions annually and modifies them as appropriate. 10 years for the U.S. plans and 7 corridor is recognized in net periodic pension cost over the expected average employee future service period, which is approximately 10% . The Company defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans are actuarially evaluated, incorporating various critical assumptions including the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets (for qualified pension plans). The discount rate is based on a cash flow matching analysis, with the projected benefit payments matching spot rates from a yield curve developed from high-quality corporate bonds. The expected rate of return on pension plan assets considers the current and expected asset allocation, as well as historical and expected returns on each plan asset class. Any difference between actual and expected plan experience, including asset return experience, in excess of a Pension and other postretirement benefit plans . Note 19 Income Taxes See Where interpretation of the tax law may be uncertain, the Company recognizes, measures and discloses income tax uncertainties. The Company accounts for interest expense and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as non-operating expense in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company files a consolidated federal income tax return and, in certain states, combined state tax returns. The Company elects to claim foreign tax credits in any given year if such election is beneficial to the Company. . The Company income tax expense consists of two components: current and deferred. Current income tax expense represents taxes paid or payable for the current period. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized to reflect the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the respective tax basis of existing assets and liabilities, and operating loss and credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. In assessing whether deferred tax assets are realizable, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. A valuation allowance is recorded for the portions that are not expected to be realized based on the level of historical taxable income, projections of future taxable income over the periods in which the temporary differences are deductible, and qualifying tax planning strategies.

The Company enters into long-term contracts with financial institution clients, merchants and strategic partners for various programs designed to increase revenue by growing payments volume, increasing Visa product acceptance, winning merchant routing transactions over to Visa network and driving innovation. These incentives are primarily accounted for as reductions to revenues. Client incentives are accounted for as operating expenses if the payment is in exchange for a distinct good or service provided by the customer. The Company generally capitalizes upfront and fixed incentive payments under these agreements and amortizes the amounts as a reduction to revenues ratably over the contractual term. Incentives that are earned by the customer based on performance targets are recorded as reductions to revenues based on management's estimate of each client's future performance. These accruals are regularly reviewed and estimates of performance are adjusted, as appropriate, based on changes in performance expectations, actual client performance, amendments to existing contracts or the execution of new contracts. Client incentives. Other revenues consist mainly of value-added services, license fees for use of the Visa brand or technology, fees for account holder services, certification, licensing and product enhancements, such as extended account holder protection and concierge services.

Consideration is variable based primarily upon the amount and type of transactions and payments volume on Visa products. The Company recognizes revenue, net of sales and other similar taxes, as the payment network services are performed in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for those services. Fixed fees for payment network services are generally recognized ratably over the related service period. The Company has elected the optional exemption to not disclose the remaining performance obligations related to payment network services.

Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized but are evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may exist. The Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets. The Company assesses each category of indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an aggregate basis, which may require the allocation of cash flows and/or an estimate of fair value to the assets or asset group. Impairment exists if the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than the carrying value. The Company relies on a number of factors when completing impairment assessments, including a review of discounted net future cash flows, business plans and the use of present value techniques. . Note 8 Intangible Assets and Goodwill . See September 30, 2019 years. No events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment existed as of 15 to 3 Finite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of customer relationships, reacquired rights, reseller relationships and trade names obtained through acquisitions.

Internally developed software represents software primarily used by the VisaNet electronic payments network. Internal and external costs incurred during the preliminary project stage are expensed as incurred. Qualifying costs incurred during the application development stage are capitalized. Once the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use these costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the technology estimated useful life. Acquired technology assets are initially recorded at fair value and amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life. years.

Pledged securities are held by a custodian in an account under the Company name and ownership; however, the Company does not have the right to repledge these securities, but may sell these securities in the event of default by the client on its settlement obligations. Letters of credit are provided primarily by client financial institutions to serve as irrevocable guarantees of payment. Guarantees are provided primarily by parent financial institutions to secure the obligations of their subsidiaries. The Company routinely evaluates the financial viability of institutions providing the letters of credit and guarantees. Customer collateral . The Company operates systems for authorizing, clearing and settling payment transactions worldwide. Most U.S. dollar settlements with the Company financial institution clients are settled within the same day and do not result in a receivable or payable balance.

Under the equity method, the Company share of each entity profit or loss is reflected in non-operating income on the consolidated statements of operations. The equity method of accounting is also used for flow-through entities such as limited partnerships and limited liability companies when the investment ownership percentage is equal to or greater than 50% and 20% The Company applies the equity method of accounting for investments in other entities when it holds between Non-marketable equity securities. The Company non-marketable equity securities, which are reported in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets, include investments in privately held companies without readily determinable market values. These investments are classified as Level 3 due to the absence of quoted market prices, the inherent lack of liquidity and the fact that inputs used to measure fair value are unobservable and require management judgment. Adoption of ASU 2016-01 changed the Company accounting for non-marketable equity securities. Beginning on October 1, 2018, the Company policy is to adjust the carrying value of its non-marketable equity securities to fair value when transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer are observable. All gains and losses on non-marketable equity securities, realized and unrealized, are recognized in non-operating income (expense). The Company evaluates its debt securities for other-than-temporary impairment, or OTTI, on an ongoing basis. When there has been a decline in fair value of a debt security below the amortized cost basis, the Company recognizes OTTI if: (1) it has the intent to sell the security; (2) it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery of the amortized cost basis; or (3) it does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security.

The Company considers these securities to be available-for-sale to meet working capital and liquidity needs. Investments with original maturities of greater than 90 days and stated maturities of less than one year from the balance sheet date, or investments that the Company intends to sell within one year, are classified as current assets, while all other securities are classified as non-current assets.

See Cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and restricted cash equivalents . The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Future actual results could differ materially from these estimates. The use of estimates in specific accounting policies is described further below as appropriate.

Table of Contents 55 November 14, 2019 Santa Clara, California We have served as the Company auditor since 2007. /s/ KPMG LLP The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included the following. We tested certain internal controls over the Company revenue recognition process, including controls related to the accounting for incentive payments to strategic partners and the application of the consideration payable to a customer guidance. We evaluated a sample of arrangements with certain strategic partners that participate in the Company open-loop payment network to understand the rights and obligations of the strategic partners, and how the Company earns revenue from and incentivizes the strategic partner. We selected a sample of certain strategic partner contracts and independently assessed the application of the consideration payable to a customer guidance, and compared our assessment to that of the Company s. We identified the evaluation of the revenue recognition for incentive arrangements with certain strategic partners upon adoption of ASC Topic 606 as a critical audit matter. A higher degree of auditor judgment was required to evaluate the application of the consideration payable to customer guidance due to the unique nature and complexity of the Company open-loop payment network. As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company enters into long-term contracts with financial institution clients, merchants, and strategic partners for various programs. The determination of whether incentive payments to certain strategic partners should be recorded as an operating expense or a reduction to operating revenues is dependent upon the application of the consideration payable to a customer guidance within ASC Topic 606. Evaluation of the revenue recognition for incentive arrangements with certain strategic partners upon adoption of ASC Topic 606 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm (Continued) Table of Contents 54 . We evaluated the Company ability to estimate its monetary exposure by comparing historically recorded liabilities to actual monetary amounts incurred upon resolution of legal matters for merchants that opted out of the previous MDL class settlement. We assessed the Company analysis of the estimated monetary exposure by checking that it included a complete population of opt-out merchants and performing sensitivity analysis over the Company monetary exposure calculations. MDL - Individual Merchant Actions . We considered relevant publicly available information, such as published news articles, about the Company and its legal matters, including the MDL - Individual Merchant Actions . We assessed the amounts accrued by reading letters received directly from the Company external legal counsel and in-house legal counsel that discussed the Company legal matters, including the MDL - Individual Merchant Actions The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included the following. We tested certain internal controls over the Company litigation assessment process, including internal controls over the Company litigation accrual process for the required especially challenging auditor judgment due to the assumptions and estimates associated with the consideration and evaluation of possible outcomes. Changes to the outcomes could have a significant effect on the estimated amount of the liability. MDL - Individual Merchant Actions for the as a critical audit matter. This proceeding involves complex claims that are subject to substantial uncertainties and unascertainable damages. The assessment of the accrued litigation liability MDL - Individual Merchant Actions, We identified the assessment of the accrued litigation liability for class members opting out of the Damages Class settlement, also know as the , and has recorded an accrued litigation liability of $1,203 million as of September 30, 2019. In preparing its consolidated financial statements, the Company is required to assess the probability of loss associated with each legal proceeding and the amount of such loss, if any. The outcome of the legal proceedings to which the Company is a party is not within the complete control of the Company or may not be known for prolonged periods of time. Interchange Multidistrict Litigation (MDL) - Individual Merchant Actions As discussed in Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company is involved in various legal proceedings, including the Assessment of the accrued litigation liability for class members opting out of the Damages Class settlement The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. Critical Audit Matters Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. A company internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm (Continued) Table of Contents 53 Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. The Company management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data to our consolidated financial statements included in Note 12 Derivative and Non-derivative Financial Instruments in annual interest expense. See $30 million In fiscal 2019, we entered into interest rate and cross-currency swap agreements on a portion of our outstanding senior notes that allow us to manage our interest rate exposure through a combination of fixed and floating rates and reduce our overall cost of borrowing. Together these swap agreements effectively convert a portion of our U.S. dollar denominated fixed-rate payments into euro denominated floating-rate payments. By entering into interest rate swaps, we have assumed risks associated with market interest rate fluctuations. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have resulted in an increase of approximately . September 30, 2019 on our investment securities at $9 million , respectively. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would create an estimated decrease in fair value of approximately 2018 and September 30, 2019 at $3.5 billion and $4.6 billion , respectively. The fair value balances of our adjustable-rate debt securities were $5.1 billion and $1.8 billion were 2018 and September 30, 2019 The fair value balances of our fixed-rate investment securities at Our investment portfolio assets are held in both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate securities. These assets are included in cash equivalents and short-term or long-term available-for-sale investments. Investments in fixed-rate instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk. The fair value of fixed-rate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates. Additionally, a falling-rate environment creates reinvestment risk because as securities mature, the proceeds are reinvested at a lower rate, generating less interest income. Historically, we have been able to hold investments until maturity. Neither our operating results or cash flows have been, nor are they expected to be, materially impacted by a sudden change in market interest rates. Interest Rate Risk Table of Contents 50 We are also subject to foreign currency exchange risk in daily settlement activities. This risk arises from the timing of rate setting for settlement with clients relative to the timing of market trades for balancing currency positions. Risk in settlement activities is limited through daily operating procedures, including the utilization of Visa settlement systems and our interaction with foreign exchange trading counterparties. of this report.

Translation from the euro to the U.S. dollar is performed for balance sheet accounts using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and for revenue and expense accounts using an average exchange rate for the period. Resulting translation adjustments are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss on the consolidated balance sheets. A hypothetical of this report. Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data to our consolidated financial statements included in Note 12 Derivative and Non-derivative Financial Instruments and Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies . The gain or loss from this hypothetical strengthening or weakening would be largely offset by a corresponding gain or loss on our cash flows from foreign currency-denominated revenues and payments. See September 30, 2019 , respectively, on our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at $300 million or loss of approximately $245 million strengthening or weakening in the value of the functional currencies is estimated to create an additional fair value gain of approximately 10% is fully consistent with our strategy and treasury policy aimed at reducing foreign exchange risk below a predetermined and approved threshold. However, actual results could materially differ from our forecast. The effect of a hypothetical September 30, 2019 , respectively. The aggregate notional amount outstanding at 2018 and September 30, 2019 at $3.7 billion and $3.1 billion The aggregate notional amounts of our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding in our exchange rate risk management program, including contracts not designated for cash flow hedge accounting, were We are exposed to risks from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations that are primarily related to changes in the functional currency value of revenues generated from foreign currency-denominated transactions and changes in the functional currency value of payments in foreign currencies. We manage these risks by entering into foreign currency forward contracts that hedge exposures of the variability in the functional currency equivalent of anticipated non-functional currency denominated cash flows. Our foreign currency exchange rate risk management program reduces, but does not entirely eliminate, the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk Market risk is the potential economic loss arising from adverse changes in market factors. Our exposure to financial market risks results primarily from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices. Aggregate risk exposures are monitored on an ongoing basis. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk ITEM 7A.
