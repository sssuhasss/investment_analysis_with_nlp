BUSINESS OVERVIEW Founded in 1982, Adobe Systems Incorporated is one of the largest and most diversified software companies in the world. We offer a line of creative, business, Web and mobile software and services used by creative professionals, knowledge workers, consumers, OEMs, developers and enterprises for creating, managing, delivering, optimizing and engaging with compelling content and experiences across multiple operating systems, devices and media. We distribute our products through a network of distributors, VARs, systems integrators, ISVs and OEMs, direct to end users and through our own Website at www.adobe.com. We also license our technology to hardware manufacturers, software developers and service providers, and we offer integrated software solutions to businesses of all sizes. We have operations in the Americas, Europe, EMEA and Asia. Our software runs on personal computers with Microsoft Windows, Apple OS, Linux, UNIX and various non-PC platforms, depending on the product. ACQUISITION OF OMNITURE On October 23, 2009, we completed the acquisition of Omniture, an industry leader in Web analytics and online business optimization based in Orem, Utah, for approximately $1.8 billion. Accordingly, we have included the results of the business operations acquired from Omniture in our consolidated results of operations beginning on October 24, 2009. We expect the acquisition to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. We expect our revenues, cost of revenues and operating expenses to increase in the future, but we also anticipate both revenue and cost saving synergies. Coinciding with the integration of Omniture, we created a new reportable segment for financial reporting purposes. See Note 2 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding this acquisition . CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES In preparing our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC, we make assumptions, judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our assumptions, judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. On a regular basis, we evaluate our assumptions, judgments and estimates. We also discuss our critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. We believe that the assumptions, judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for revenue recognition, stock-based compensation, business combinations, goodwill impairment and income taxes have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. These areas are key components of our results of operations and are based on complex rules which require us to make judgments and estimates, so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies. Historically, our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to our critical accounting policies have not differed materially from actual results. 53 TABLE OF CONTENTS Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue when all four revenue recognition criteria have been met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, we have delivered the product or performed the service, the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is probable. Determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report. For example, for multiple element arrangements, we must: (1) determine whether and when each element has been delivered; (2) determine whether undelivered products or services are essential to the functionality of the delivered products and services; (3) determine whether vendor-specific objective evidence ( VSOE ) of fair value exists for each undelivered element; and (4) allocate the total price among the various elements we must deliver. Changes in assumptions or judgments or changes to the elements in a software arrangement could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period. In addition, we must estimate certain royalty revenue amounts due to the timing of securing information from our customers. While we believe we can make reliable estimates regarding these matters, these estimates are inherently subjective. Accordingly, our assumptions and judgments regarding future products and services as well as our estimates of royalty revenue could differ from actual events, thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations. Product revenue is recognized when the above criteria are met. We reduce the revenue recognized for estimated future returns, price protection and rebates at the time the related revenue is recorded. In determining our estimate for returns and in accordance with our internal policy regarding global channel inventory which is used to determine the level of product held by our distributors on which we have recognized revenue, we rely upon historical data, the estimated amount of product inventory in our distribution channel, the rate at which our product sells through to the end user, product plans and other factors. Our estimated provisions for returns can vary from what actually occurs. Product returns may be more or less than what was estimated. The amount of inventory in the channel could be different than what is estimated. Our estimate of the rate of sell through for product in the channel could be different than what actually occurs. There could be a delay in the release of our products. These factors and unanticipated changes in the economic and industry environment could make our return estimates differ from actual returns, thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations. We offer price protection to our distributors that allows for the right to a credit if we permanently reduce the price of a software product. When evaluating the adequacy of the price protection allowance, we analyze historical returns, current sell-through of distributor and retailer inventory of our products, changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products and other related factors. In addition, we monitor the volume of sales to our channel partners and their inventories. Changes to these assumptions or in the economic environment could result in higher returns or higher price protection costs in subsequent periods. In the future, actual returns and price protection may materially exceed our estimates as unsold products in the distribution channels are exposed to rapid changes in consumer preferences, market conditions or technological obsolescence due to new platforms, product updates or competing products. While we believe we can make reliable estimates regarding these matters, these estimates are inherently subjective. Accordingly, if our estimates change, our returns and price protection reserves would change, which would impact the total net revenue we report. We recognize revenues for hosting services that are based on a committed number of transactions, including implementation and set-up fees, ratably beginning on the date the customer commences use of our services and continuing through the end of the customer term. Over-usage fees, and fees billed based on the actual number of transactions from which we capture data, are billed in accordance with contract terms as these fees are incurred. We record amounts that have been invoiced in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenue, depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met. Our consulting revenue is primarily recognized using the proportionate performance method and is measured monthly based on input measures, such as on hours incurred to date compared to total estimated hours to complete, with consideration given to output measures, such as contract milestones, when applicable. Accordingly, our estimates of consulting revenue could differ from actual events and may materially impact our financial position and results of operations. Stock-based Compensation Stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period. 54 TABLE OF CONTENTS We currently use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares. The determination of the fair value of stock-based awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables. These variables include our expected stock price volatility over the expected term of the awards, actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors, the risk-free interest rate, estimated forfeitures and expected dividends. We estimate the expected term of options granted by calculating the average term from our historical stock option exercise experience. We estimate the volatility of our common stock by using implied volatility in market traded options. Our decision to use implied volatility was based upon the availability of actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility. We base the risk-free interest rate on zero-coupon yields implied from U.S. Treasury issues with remaining terms similar to the expected term on the options. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and therefore use an expected dividend yield of zero in the option pricing model. We are required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. We use historical data to estimate pre-vesting option forfeitures and record stock-based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest. If we use different assumptions for estimating stock-based compensation expense in future periods or if actual forfeitures differ materially from our estimated forfeitures, the change in our stock-based compensation expense could materially affect our operating income, net income and net income per share. Business Combinations We allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed as well as to in-process research and development based upon their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. The purchase price allocation process requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at acquisition date with respect to intangible assets and deferred revenue obligations assumed. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable, they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. Examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired or may acquire in the future include but are not limited to: future expected cash flows from software license sales, subscriptions, support agreements, consulting contracts and acquired developed technologies and patents; expected costs to develop the in-process research and development into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from the projects when completed; the acquired company trade name and trademarks as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired trade name and trademarks will continue to be used in the combined company product portfolio; and discount rates. In connection with the purchase price allocations for our acquisitions, we estimate the fair value of the deferred revenue obligations assumed. The estimated fair value of the support obligations is determined utilizing a cost build-up approach. The cost build-up approach determines fair value by estimating the costs related to fulfilling the obligations plus a normal profit margin. The estimated costs to fulfill the obligations are based on the historical costs related to fulfilling the obligations. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results. Goodwill Impairment We complete our goodwill impairment test on an annual basis, during the second quarter of our fiscal year, or more frequently, if changes in facts and circumstances indicate that an impairment in the value of goodwill recorded on our balance sheet may exist. In order to estimate the fair value of goodwill, we typically estimate future revenue, consider market factors 55 TABLE OF CONTENTS and estimate our future cash flows. Based on these key assumptions, judgments and estimates, we determine whether we need to record an impairment charge to reduce the value of the asset carried on our balance sheet to its estimated fair value. Assumptions, judgments and estimates about future values are complex and often subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy or our internal forecasts. Although we believe the assumptions, judgments and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, different assumptions, judgments and estimates could materially affect our reported financial results. We completed our annual impairment test in the second quarter of fiscal 2009 and determined there was no impairment. We currently believe that there is no significant risk of future material goodwill impairment in any of our reporting units. Accounting for Income Taxes We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year. In addition, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Management must make assumptions, judgments and estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes and also our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against a deferred tax asset. Our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to the current provision for income taxes take into account current tax laws, our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities. We have established reserves for income taxes to address potential exposures involving tax positions that could be challenged by tax authorities. In addition, we are subject to the continual examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and other domestic and foreign tax authorities, including a current examination by the IRS for our fiscal 2005, 2006 and 2007 tax returns. These examinations are expected to focus on our intercompany transfer pricing practices as well as other matters. Although we believe our assumptions, judgments and estimates are reasonable, changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of the current and any future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements. Our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to the value of a deferred tax asset take into account predictions of the amount and category of future taxable income, such as income from operations or capital gains income. Actual operating results and the underlying amount and category of income in future years could render our current assumptions, judgments and estimates of recoverable net deferred taxes inaccurate. Any of the assumptions, judgments and estimates mentioned above could cause our actual income tax obligations to differ from our estimates, thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview of 2009 Effective in the first quarter of fiscal 2009, our former Mobile and Devices Solutions segment, which was integrated into our Platform business unit to better align our engineering and marketing efforts, is now reported as part of the Platform segment. Prior year information has been updated to reflect the integration of these business units. During fiscal 2009, our business was broadly impacted by the global economic recession and generally weak macro-economic environment. This resulted in a significant year-over-year decline in our revenue and earnings results. In our Creative Solutions segment, revenue decreased by 18% during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008. We attribute this decline to reduced adoption of our CS4 family of products during the year, as the global financial crisis significantly affected demand in the creative professional end user market. All major creative product categories declined on a year-over-year basis. Our Business Productivity Solutions business declined 19% in fiscal 2009 when compared to fiscal 2008. A decline in demand primarily due to the macro-economic environment with our Acrobat product family which makes up the majority of revenue in our Knowledge Worker segment was the primary factor for this decline. In our Enterprise business, our LiveCycle revenue declined 7% when compared to revenue achieved in fiscal 2008. We attribute this smaller percentage decline in comparison to our other segments to focused execution by our sales teams and the large market opportunities these product solutions address. 56 TABLE OF CONTENTS In our Platform segment, revenue declined 22% on a year-over-year basis primarily due to the impact of the OSP. The removal of license fees associated with our Flash technologies on mobile devices commenced in fiscal 2009, and as such, OEM revenue from device manufacturers began to decline from rates of revenue we achieved in fiscal 2008. We continue to expect this decline to be offset over time by an increased demand for tooling products, server technologies, services and applications in many of our other business segments. In our Print and Publishing segment, revenue was also impacted by the global macroeconomic environment, resulting in a 16% year-over-year decline. The Omniture business appeared to stabilize during the fourth quarter with the improvement in the general economy, as indicated by an increase in the transaction volume on our network. In addition, customer retention rates began stabilizing and we experienced an increase in the number of subscription services provided to our existing customers. Revenue (dollars in millions) Fiscal 2009 % Change 2009 to 2008 Fiscal 2008 % Change 2008 to 2007 Fiscal 2007 Product $ 2,759.4 (19 )% $ 3,396.5 12 % $ 3,019.5 Percentage of total revenue 94 % 95 % 96 % Services and support 186.5 2 % 183.4 33 % 138.4 Percentage of total revenue 6 % 5 % 4 % Total revenue $ 2,945.9 (18 )% $ 3,579.9 13 % $ 3,157.9 In fiscal 2009, we categorized our products into the following segments: Creative Solutions, Knowledge Worker, Enterprise, Platform, Print and Publishing and Omniture products. Our Creative Solutions segment focuses on delivering a complete professional line of integrated tools for a full range of creative and developer tasks to an extended set of customers. Our Knowledge Worker segment focuses on the needs of knowledge worker customers, providing essential applications and services to help them reliably share information and collaborate effectively. This segment contains revenue generated by the Adobe Acrobat family of products. Our Enterprise segment provides server-based enterprise interaction solutions that automate people-centric processes and contains revenue generated by our LiveCycle line of products. The Platform segment provides developer solutions and technologies, including Adobe Flash Player, Adobe AIR and Flash Builder which are used to build rich application experiences in addition to solutions that create compelling experiences through rich content, user interfaces and data services on mobile and non-PC devices such as cellular phones, consumer devices and Internet connected hand-held devices. The Print and Publishing segment addresses market opportunities ranging from the diverse publishing needs of technical and business publishing, to our legacy type and OEM printing businesses. Finally, our Omniture segment provides Web analytics and online business optimization products and services. We will adjust our reporting segments at the beginning of fiscal 2010 to reflect changes in how we manage our business as we enter the new fiscal year. Specifically, we are moving responsibility for our Adobe Connect Pro product line from our Knowledge Worker segment to our Enterprise segment. Our services and support revenue is composed of consulting, training and maintenance and support, primarily related to the licensing of our enterprise, developer and platform products. Our support revenue also includes technical support and developer support to partners and developer organizations related to our desktop products. Our maintenance and support offerings which entitle customers to receive product upgrades and enhancements or technical support, depending on the offering, are recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement. 57 TABLE OF CONTENTS Segment Information (dollars in millions) Fiscal 2009 % Change 2009 to 2008 Fiscal 2008 % Change 2008 to 2007 Fiscal 2007 Creative Solutions $ 1,702.1 (18 )% $ 2,072.8 9 % $ 1,899.0 Percentage of total revenue 58 % 58 % 60 % Knowledge Worker 623.0 (23 )% 810.9 11 % 728.5 Percentage of total revenue 21 % 23 % 23 % Enterprise 235.5 (7 )% 253.0 32 % 191.3 Percentage of total revenue 8 % 7 % 6 % Platform 181.0 (22 )% 231.6 74 % 133.4 Percentage of total revenue 6 % 6 % 4 % Print and Publishing 178.0 (16 )% 211.6 3 % 205.7 Percentage of total revenue 6 % 6 % 7 % Omniture 26.3 * % % Percentage of total revenue 1 % % % Total revenue $ 2,945.9 (18 )% $ 3,579.9 13 % $ 3,157.9 _____________________________________ * Percentage is not meaningful. Fiscal 2009 Revenue Compared to Fiscal 2008 Revenue Revenue from our Creative Solutions segment decreased $370.7 million during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 primarily due to reduced adoption of our CS family of products because of the global recession and generally weak macro-economic environment. The decrease was driven largely by a 15% decline in Creative Suites related revenue and a decline of 27% in Photoshop point product revenue. Also contributing to the decrease was an overall decline in the number of units licensed. Average unit selling prices have remained relatively consistent. Revenue in our Knowledge Worker segment decreased $187.9 million during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 for similar reasons as Creative Solutions in addition to a decrease in the licensing of our Acrobat family of products. We attribute the decline in revenue to lower volume licensing by our enterprise customers, as well as a decrease in the number of units sold through our shrink-wrap distribution channel. Average unit selling prices have remained relatively consistent. Revenue from our Enterprise segment decreased $17.5 million during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 primarily due to the economic impact which resulted in reduced spending by our enterprise customers. Revenue from our Platform segment decreased by $50.6 million during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 due to the impact of the OSP which we announced on May 1, 2008, and involves the removal of certain licensing fees of our Flash Lite client with OEMs. Revenue in our Print and Publishing business decreased by $33.6 million during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 due to reduced demand because of the global macro-economic downturn. We acquired Omniture in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, and as such, there is no prior fiscal 2008 period with which to compare Omniture fiscal 2009 revenue. Fiscal 2008 Revenue Compared to Fiscal 2007 Revenue Revenue from our Creative Solutions segment increased $173.8 million during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 primarily due to ongoing adoption of our CS3 family of products, as well as the launch of our CS4 family of products in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008. We also achieved solid growth in our Scene7 business and with our hobbyist products. The increase was also driven by a 7% increase in Creative Suites related revenue and an increase of 5% in Photoshop point product revenue. Also contributing to the increase in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 was an increase in certain unit average selling prices. Units sold remained relatively stable. Revenue in our Knowledge Worker segment increased $82.4 million during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 primarily due to an increase in the licensing of our Acrobat 8 and new Acrobat 9 family of products. An increase in the number of units sold as well as a slight increase in certain unit average selling prices also contributed to higher revenue as compared to fiscal 2007. 58 TABLE OF CONTENTS Revenue from our Enterprise segment increased $61.7 million during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 primarily due to an increased adoption of our LiveCycle family of products and a larger number of enterprise solution transactions at a higher average transaction size. Revenue from our Platform segment increased by $98.2 million during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 due to continued adoption of Flash Lite by mobile and non-PC device manufacturers, as well as increased revenue related to Flash Player and the launch of Adobe AIR which resulted in increased revenue from our developer tools. Revenue in our Print and Publishing business increased by $5.9 million during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007, driven by ongoing adoption of our eLearning solutions as well as some of our legacy print and publishing products. Geographic Information (dollars in millions) Fiscal 2009 % Change 2009 to 2008 Fiscal 2008 % Change 2008 to 2007 Fiscal 2007 Americas $ 1,382.6 (15 )% $ 1,632.8 8 % $ 1,508.9 Percentage of total revenue 46 % 46 % 48 % EMEA 928.9 (24 )% 1,229.2 20 % 1,026.4 Percentage of total revenue 32 % 34 % 32 % Asia 634.4 (12 )% 717.9 15 % 622.6 Percentage of total revenue 22 % 20 % 20 % Total revenue $ 2,945.9 (18 )% $ 3,579.9 13 % $ 3,157.9 Fiscal 2009 Revenue by Geography Compared to Fiscal 2008 Revenue by Geography Overall revenue in each of the geographic segments for fiscal 2009 decreased compared to fiscal 2008 primarily due to the global economic recession, which resulted in reduced adoption of many of our major products. Included in the overall decrease in revenue were impacts associated with foreign currency. Revenue in EMEA measured in U.S. dollars decreased approximately $47.1 million, due to the strength of the U.S. dollar against the Euro, as compared to fiscal 2008. Our currency hedging program is used to mitigate a portion of the foreign currency impact to revenue. During fiscal 2009, our currency hedging program related to the Euro resulted in hedging gains of $25.8 million. Revenue in Asia measured in U.S. dollars was favorably impacted by approximately $32.8 million due to the strength of the Yen against the U.S. dollar as compared to fiscal 2008. During fiscal 2009, our currency hedging program related to the Yen resulted in hedging gains of $1.2 million. Fiscal 2008 Revenue by Geography Compared to Fiscal 2007 Revenue by Geography Overall revenue in each of the geographic segments for fiscal 2008 increased compared to fiscal 2007 primarily due to the ongoing adoption of our CS3 family of products during the first half of the year, the launch of our CS4 family of products in the fourth quarter of the year, the launch of our Acrobat 9 family of products in the third quarter of the year and strong growth in our enterprise business. Included in the overall increase in revenue were impacts associated with foreign currency. Revenue in EMEA measured in U.S. dollars was favorably impacted by approximately $69.3 million during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 primarily due to the strength of the Euro against the U.S. dollar. Additionally, during fiscal 2008 we had a hedging gain of $13.2 million. Revenue in Asia was favorably impacted by approximately $39.6 million during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 primarily due to the strength of the Yen against the U.S. dollar. See Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk regarding foreign currency risks. Product Backlog With regard to our product backlog, the actual amount of backlog at any particular time may not be a meaningful indicator of future business prospects. Backlog is comprised of unfulfilled orders, excluding those associated with new product releases, those pending credit review and those not shipped due to the application of our global inventory policy. Our backlog for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 was approximately 9% of fourth quarter fiscal 2009 revenue compared with approximately 2% of third quarter fiscal 2009 revenue. We had minimal backlog at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008. 59 TABLE OF CONTENTS Cost of Revenue (dollars in millions) Fiscal 2009 % Change 2009 to 2008 Fiscal 2008 % Change 2008 to 2007 Fiscal 2007 Product $ 228.9 (14 )% $ 266.4 (2 )% $ 270.8 Percentage of total revenue 8 % 7 % 9 % Services and support 67.8 (30 )% 96.2 15 % 83.9 Percentage of total revenue 2 % 3 % 3 % Total cost of revenue $ 296.7 (18 )% $ 362.6 2 % $ 354.7 Product Cost of product revenue includes product packaging, third-party royalties, excess and obsolete inventory, amortization related to localization costs and acquired rights to use technology and the costs associated with the manufacturing of our products. Cost of product revenue decreased due to the following: % Change 2009 to 2008 % Change 2008 to 2007 Amortization of acquired rights to use technology (8 )% 6 % Amortization of purchased intangibles (10 ) (10 ) Royalty cost (1 ) 3 Hosted services 9 3 Various individually insignificant items (4 ) (4 ) Total change (14 )% (2 )% The decrease in amortization of acquired rights to use technology primarily relates to a charge for historical use of licensing rights associated with certain technology licensing arrangements entered into in fiscal 2008 that did not recur in fiscal 2009. Amortization of acquired rights to use technology increased in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007, primarily due to the fact that we entered into certain technology licensing arrangements totaling $100.4 million and $60.0 million during fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007, respectively. Of this cost, an estimated $56.4 million and $44.8 million during fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007, respectively, was related to future licensing rights and has been capitalized and will be amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives up to fifteen years. Of the remaining costs, we estimated that approximately $27.2 million and $15.2 million was related to historical use of licensing rights which was expensed as cost of sales and the residual of $16.8 million for fiscal 2008 was expensed as general and administrative costs. In connection with these licensing arrangements, we have the ability to acquire additional rights to use technology in the future. Amortization of purchased intangibles decreased during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 and decreased during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007, due to a decrease in amortization primarily associated with intangible assets purchased through the Macromedia acquisition which were fully amortized during fiscal 2009. The increase in hosted service costs was primarily related to the amortization of our investment in capitalized infrastructure costs related to our SaaS business in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008. Services and Support Cost of services and support revenue is primarily comprised of employee-related costs and associated costs incurred to provide consulting services, training and product support. Cost of services and support revenue decreased during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008, due to decreases in compensation and related benefits driven by headcount reductions as well as increased consulting support provided by third- party systems integrators resulting in the downsizing of our consulting organization. Cost of services and support revenue increased during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007, primarily due to increases in compensation and related benefits driven by increases in headcount related to product support and utilization by customers of our consulting services. 60 TABLE OF CONTENTS Operating Expenses (dollars in millions) Research and Development, Sales and Marketing and General and Administrative Expenses The decrease in research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2009 was primarily driven by decreases in compensation expense and a decrease in the costs associated with acquired rights to use technology. The decrease in compensation costs during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 was primarily due to lower profit sharing and employee bonuses based on company performance. The increase in compensation costs during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 related to increases in headcount and stock-based compensation offset by decreases in profit sharing and employee bonuses based on company performance. Research and Development Fiscal 2009 % Change 2009 to 2008 Fiscal 2008 % Change 2008 to 2007 Fiscal 2007 Expenses $ 565.1 (15 )% $ 662.1 8 % $ 613.2 Percentage of total revenue 19 % 18 % 19 % Research and development expenses consist primarily of salary and benefit expenses for software developers, contracted development efforts, related facilities costs and expenses associated with computer equipment used in software development. Research and development expenses decreased due to the following: % Change 2009 to 2008 % Change 2008 to 2007 Compensation and related benefits associated with headcount growth 1 % 7 % Compensation associated with incentive compensation and stock-based compensation (13 ) Various individually insignificant items (3 ) 1 Total change (15 )% 8 % We believe that investments in research and development, including the recruiting and hiring of software developers, are critical to remaining competitive in the marketplace and are directly related to continued timely development of new and enhanced products. We will continue to focus on long-term opportunities available in our end markets and make significant investments in the development of our desktop application and server-based software products. Sales and Marketing Fiscal 2009 % Change 2009 to 2008 Fiscal 2008 % Change 2008 to 2007 Fiscal 2007 Expenses $ 981.9 (10 )% $ 1,089.3 11 % $ 984.4 Percentage of total revenue 33 % 30 % 31 % Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salary and benefit expenses, sales commissions, travel expenses and related facilities costs for our sales, marketing, order management and global supply chain management personnel. Sales and marketing expenses also include the costs of programs aimed at increasing revenue, such as advertising, trade shows, public relations and other market development programs. Sales and marketing expenses decreased due to the following: % Change 2009 to 2008 % Change 2008 to 2007 Compensation and related benefits associated with headcount growth 2 % 5 % Compensation associated with incentive compensation and stock-based compensation (8 ) 1 Marketing spending related to product launches and overall marketing efforts to further increase revenue (1 ) 4 Various individually insignificant items (3 ) 1 Total change (10 )% 11 % 61 TABLE OF CONTENTS General and Administrative Fiscal 2009 % Change 2009 to 2008 Fiscal 2008 % Change 2008 to 2007 Fiscal 2007 Expenses $ 298.7 (11 )% $ 337.3 23 % $ 275.0 Percentage of total revenue 10 % 9 % 9 % General and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and benefit expenses, travel expenses and related facilities costs for our finance, facilities, human resources, legal, information services and executive personnel. General and administrative expenses also include outside legal and accounting fees, provision for bad debts, expenses associated with computer equipment and software used in the administration of the business, charitable contributions and various forms of insurance. General and administrative expenses decreased due to the following: % Change 2009 to 2008 % Change 2008 to 2007 Allocation of costs associated with acquired rights to use technology (5 )% 6 % Compensation and related benefits associated with headcount growth 2 4 Compensation associated with incentive compensation and stock-based compensation (8 ) 2 Charitable contributions (3 ) 4 Professional and consulting fees 1 2 Provision for bad debt 2 Depreciation and amortization 1 1 Various individually insignificant items 1 2 Total change (11 )% 23 % The decrease in allocation of costs associated with acquired rights to use technology in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 primarily relates to the historical use of licensing rights associated with certain technology licensing arrangements entered into in fiscal 2008 that did not recur in fiscal 2009. Allocation of costs associated with acquired rights to use technology increased in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 primarily due to the fact that we entered into certain technology licensing arrangements totaling $100.4 million and $60.0 million during fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007, respectively. Of this cost, an estimated $56.4 million and $44.8 million during fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007, respectively, was related to future licensing rights and has been capitalized and will be amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives up to fifteen years. Of the remaining costs, we estimated that approximately $27.2 million and $15.2 million during fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007, respectively, was related to historical use of licensing rights which was expensed as cost of sales and the residual of $16.8 million for fiscal 2008 was expensed as general and administrative costs. In connection with these licensing arrangements, we have the ability to acquire additional rights to use technology in the future. Charitable contributions represent funding of the Adobe Foundation which is a private foundation created to leverage human, technological and financial resources to drive social change and improve the communities in which we live and work. The decrease in charitable contributions during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 and increase in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 reflects a change in the timing of contributions to the Adobe Foundation. Restructuring Charges Fiscal 2009 % Change 2009 to 2008 Fiscal 2008 % Change 2008 to 2007 Fiscal 2007 Expenses $ 41.3 29 % $ 32.1 * % $ 0.6 Percentage of total revenue 1 % 1 % * % _____________________________________ * Percentage is not meaningful. Fiscal 2009 Restructuring Charges On November 10, 2009, we initiated a restructuring plan to appropriately align our costs in connection with our fiscal 2010 operating plan impacting up to approximately 630 full-time positions worldwide. In connection with this restructuring plan, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, we recorded restructuring charges of approximately $25.5 million related to ongoing 62 TABLE OF CONTENTS termination benefits for the elimination of approximately 340 of these full-time positions worldwide. As of November 27, 2009, approximately $2.5 million was paid. The remaining accrual associated with these ongoing termination benefits is expected to be paid during fiscal 2010. The restructuring activities related to this program affect only those employees and facilities that were associated with Adobe prior to the acquisition of Omniture on October 23, 2009. Beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2010, we expect to record additional restructuring charges of approximately $15 million to $18 million primarily related to the consolidation of leased facilities and up to approximately $26 million related to employee severance arrangements for the elimination of the remaining full-time positions worldwide. We expect to accrue the facility related liabilities beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 and pay these liabilities through fiscal 2021 based on current lease terms. Substantially all of these charges will result in cash expenditures. Omniture Restructuring Charges We completed our acquisition of Omniture on October 23, 2009. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, we initiated a plan to restructure the pre-merger operations of Omniture to eliminate certain duplicative activities, focus our resources on future growth opportunities and reduce our cost structure. In connection with this restructuring plan, we accrued a total of approximately $10.6 million in costs related to termination benefits for the elimination of approximately 100 regular positions and for the closure of duplicative facilities. We also accrued approximately $0.2 million in costs related to the cancellation of certain contracts associated with the wind-down of subsidiaries and other service contracts held by Omniture. These costs were recorded as a part of the purchase price allocation, as discussed in Note 2 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements , and have been accrued for as of November 27, 2009. We expect to pay the termination benefits and facility related liabilities through fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2013, respectively. Additionally, approximately $1.5 million of restructuring costs related to facilities were included in the liabilities assumed by us upon our acquisition of Omniture on October 23, 2009. Fiscal 2008 Restructuring Charges In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, we initiated a restructuring program, consisting of reductions in workforce of approximately 560 full-time positions globally and the consolidation of facilities, in order to reduce our operating costs and focus our resources on key strategic priorities. In connection with this restructuring program, we recorded restructuring charges totaling $29.2 million related to ongoing termination benefits for the elimination of approximately 460 of the 560 full-time positions globally. As of November 28, 2008, $0.4 million was paid. During fiscal 2009, we continued to implement restructuring activities under this program. We vacated approximately 89,000 square feet of research and development and sales facilities in the U.S., the United Kingdom and Canada. We accrued $8.5 million for the fair value of our future contractual obligations under these operating leases using our credit-adjusted risk-free interest rate, estimated at approximately 6% as of the date we ceased to use the leased properties. This amount is net of the fair value of future estimated sublease income of approximately $4.4 million. We also recorded additional charges of $6.7 million for termination benefits for the elimination of substantially all of the remaining 100 full-time positions expected to be terminated. We have paid substantially all of the accrued termination benefits during fiscal 2009 and expect to pay the remaining amounts in fiscal 2010. We expect to pay facilities-related liabilities through fiscal 2013. Macromedia Restructuring Charges We completed our acquisition of Macromedia on December 3, 2005. In connection with this acquisition, we initiated plans to restructure both the pre-merger operations of Adobe and Macromedia to eliminate certain duplicative activities, focus our resources on future growth opportunities and reduce our cost structure. In connection with the worldwide restructuring plan, we recognized costs related to termination benefits for employee positions that were eliminated and for the closure of duplicative facilities. We also recognized costs related to the cancellation of certain contracts associated with the wind-down of subsidiaries and other service contracts held by Macromedia. Costs for termination benefits and contract cancellations were completed during fiscal 2007. Total costs incurred were $27.0 million and $3.2 million, respectively. 63 TABLE OF CONTENTS As of November 27, 2009, accrued restructuring charges related to the 2009 restructuring program, 2008 restructuring program, Omniture acquisition, and Macromedia acquisition totaled approximately $23.0 million, $4.4 million, $12.3 million, and $5.0 million respectively. We expect to pay the liabilities associated with the 2009 and 2008 restructuring programs through fiscal 2021 and 2013, respectively. We expect to pay the restructuring liabilities associated with the Omniture and Macromedia acquisitions through fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012, respectively. See Note 11 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding our restructuring charges. Amortization of Purchased Intangibles and Incomplete Technology Fiscal 2009 % Change 2009 to 2008 Fiscal 2008 % Change 2008 to 2007 Fiscal 2007 Expenses $ 71.6 5 % $ 68.2 (6 )% $ 72.4 Percentage of total revenue 2 % 2 % 2 % As a result of our acquisition of Omniture in fiscal 2009, we acquired purchased intangibles which are amortized over their estimated useful lives of one to twelve years. In addition, as a result of our acquisition of Macromedia in fiscal 2006, we acquired purchased intangibles which are amortized over their estimated useful lives of two to four years. During fiscal 2009, we completed one business combination, in addition to Omniture. During fiscal 2008 we completed one business combination and during fiscal 2007, we completed two business combinations and one asset acquisition. We acquired purchased intangibles through these acquisitions which are amortized over their estimated useful lives. Amortization expense increased during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008, primarily due to amortization expense associated with intangibles assets purchased through the acquisition of Omniture. Amortization expense decreased during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007, due to a decrease in amortization expense associated with intangible assets purchased through the Macromedia acquisition. Non-Operating Income (Expense) (dollars in millions) Fiscal 2009 % Change 2009 to 2008 Fiscal 2008 % Change 2008 to 2007 Fiscal 2007 Interest and other income, net $ 31.4 (28 )% $ 43.8 (47 )% $ 82.7 Percentage of total revenue 1 % 1 % 3 % Interest expense (3.4 ) 66 % (10.0 ) * (0.2 ) Percentage of total revenue * * * Investment gains (losses), net (17.0 ) (204 )% 16.4 131 % 7.1 Percentage of total revenue (1 )% * % * Total non-operating income (expense), net $ 11.0 (78 )% $ 50.2 (44 )% $ 89.6 _________________________________________ * Percentage is not meaningful. Interest and Other Income, Net Interest and other income, net, consists primarily of interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and short-term fixed income investments. Interest and other income, net also includes foreign exchange gains and losses, including those from hedging revenue transactions primarily denominated in Euro and Japanese Yen currencies. Interest and other income, net, decreased during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 primarily due to lower interest rates, partially offset by lower average invested balances, realized gains on sales of fixed income securities and lower foreign exchange losses. Interest and other income, net, decreased during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 primarily as a result of lower average invested balances due to cash used for our share repurchase programs, lower interest rates and increased hedging costs. Additionally, during fiscal 2008, interest and other income, net included losses on fixed income investments associated with a write-down for an other-than-temporary impairment totaling approximately $1.3 million during the second quarter of fiscal 2008. 64 TABLE OF CONTENTS Interest Expense Interest expense for fiscal 2009 and 2008, primarily represents interest associated with our credit facility. The outstanding balance as of November 27, 2009 was $1.0 billion. Interest due under the credit facility is paid upon expiration of the London interbank offered rate ( LIBOR ) contract or at a minimum, quarterly. The decline in interest expense was primarily due to lower interest rates. Investment Gains (Losses), Net Investment gains (losses), net, consists principally of realized gains or losses from the sale of marketable equity investments, other-than-temporary declines in the value of marketable and non-marketable equity securities, unrealized holding gains and losses associated with our deferred compensation plan assets (classified as trading securities), and gains and losses of Adobe Ventures. Investment gains and (losses), net fluctuated due to the following (in millions): 2009 2008 2007 Net gains (losses) related to our investments in Adobe Ventures and cost method investments $ (16.7 ) $ 15.9 $ 6.9 Gains from sale of equity investments 5.4 0.2 Write-downs due to other-than-temporary declines in value of our marketable equity securities (0.3 ) (4.9 ) Total investment gains (losses), net $ (17.0 ) $ 16.4 $ 7.1 During fiscal 2009, investment gains (losses), net decreased as compared to fiscal 2008 primarily due to net unrealized losses related to our Adobe Ventures and direct investments. During fiscal 2008, investment gains (losses), net increased as compared to fiscal 2007 due primarily to investment gains from our direct and Adobe Ventures investments. Additionally, during fiscal 2008, we received cash and recognized a gain resulting from the expiration of the escrow period related to the sale of our investment in Atom Entertainment, Inc. that occurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. Provision for Income Tax es (dollars in millions) Fiscal 2009 % Change 2009 to 2008 Fiscal 2008 % Change 2008 to 2007 Fiscal 2007 Provision $ 315.0 52 % $ 206.7 (7 )% $ 223.4 Percentage of total revenue 11 % 6 % 7 % Effective tax rate 45 % 19 % 24 % Our effective tax rate increased approximately twenty-six percentage points during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008. The increase was primarily due to a one-time charge that was related to our acquisition of Omniture. The charge was the tax cost of inter-company transactions necessary to license certain Omniture assets to Adobe trading companies, so that Omniture services can be offered to customers from Adobe companies. Our effective tax rate decreased approximately five percentage points during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007. The decrease was primarily related to the completion in the third quarter of fiscal 2008 of a U.S. income tax examination covering our fiscal years 2001 through 2004, a refund of foreign taxes from our fiscal years 2000 through 2002 following a foreign tax court judgment and stronger international profits for fiscal 2008 offset in part by an increase due to the tax benefit for the reinstatement of the research and development credit relating to fiscal 2006 in the first quarter of fiscal 2007. 65 TABLE OF CONTENTS LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES This data should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. (in millions) Fiscal 2009 Fiscal 2008 Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments $ 1,904.5 $ 2,019.2 Working capital $ 1,629.1 $ 1,972.5 Stockholders equity $ 4,890.6 $ 4,410.4 Summary of our cash flows is as follows (in millions): Fiscal 2009 Fiscal 2008 Fiscal 2007 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,117.7 $ 1,280.7 $ 1,441.1 Net cash (used for) provided by investing activities (1,497.1 ) (304.7 ) 81.5 Net cash provided by (used for) financing activities 477.7 (1,021.6 ) (1,350.4 ) Effect of foreign currency exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents 14.7 (14.4 ) 1.7 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 113.0 $ (60.0 ) $ 173.9 Our primary source of cash is receipts from revenue. The primary uses of cash are payroll related expenses; general operating expenses including marketing, travel and office rent; and cost of product revenue. Another source of cash is proceeds from the exercise of employee options and participation in the employee stock purchase plan ( ESPP ). Another use of cash is our stock repurchase program, which is described below. Cash flows from operating activities Net cash provided by operating activities of $1.1 billion for fiscal 2009, was primarily comprised of net income plus the net effect of non-cash expenses. The primary working capital sources of cash were net income coupled with decreases in trade receivables, prepaid expenses and other current assets and increases in income taxes payable. Trade receivables decreased primarily from CS4 revenue that was shipped in the latter half of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 and collected during the first quarter of fiscal 2009, in addition to lower overall gross revenue and improved collections. The primary working capital uses of cash were decreases in accrued expenses, deferred revenue, trade payables and accrued restructuring. Accrued expenses decreased primarily due to payments for employee bonuses and commissions related to fiscal 2008. Decreases in deferred revenue related primarily to deferred revenue that was recognized in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 associated with our free of charge upgrades for CS4 and Adobe Photoshop Lightroom products, as well as declines in maintenance and support orders. Accrued restructuring decreased primarily due to payments related to the 2008 restructuring program that was initiated in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, offset in part by new charges related to our 2009 restructuring program and acquisition of Omniture. Net cash provided by operating activities of $1.3 billion for fiscal 2008, was primarily comprised of net income plus the net effect of non-cash expenses. The primary working capital sources of cash were increases in net income, deferred revenue, accrued restructuring and trade payables. Increases in deferred revenue related to maintenance and support and free of charge upgrade plan purchases which offset in part, decreases in deferred revenue related to royalties. Accrued restructuring costs increased due to the restructuring program initiated in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 offset in part by payments of facility costs during fiscal 2008 associated with the Macromedia acquisition. See Note 11 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding our restructuring charges. The primary working capital uses of cash were increases in trade receivables and prepaid expenses and other current assets coupled with decreases in income taxes payable and accrued expenses. Trade receivables increased primarily as a result of high sales of our CS4 family of products at the end of fiscal 2008. Income taxes payable decreased primarily due to payments made as the result of the completion of a U.S. income tax examination covering our fiscal years 2001 through 2004. Accrued expenses decreased primarily due to payments for employee bonuses and profit sharing offset in part by increases in royalty accruals and charitable contributions. Net cash provided by operating activities of $1.4 billion for fiscal 2007, was primarily comprised of net income, net of non-cash related expenses. 66 TABLE OF CONTENTS The primary working capital sources of cash for fiscal 2007 were increases in net income, accrued expenses, income taxes payable, deferred revenue and trade payables coupled with decreases in trade receivables and prepaid expenses and other current assets. Net changes in accrued expenses was primarily attributable to increases in accrued bonuses and accrued localization costs related to the localization of our CS3 family of products during fiscal 2007. Income taxes payable increased due to overall increased taxable income. Increases to deferred revenue related primarily to deferred maintenance and service revenue due to strong upgrade plan sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 for our CS3 family of products and related individual creative products. The decrease in trade receivables was due to collections in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 related to high Acrobat 8 sales at the end of fiscal 2006 and strong collections during the third quarter of fiscal 2007 resulting from shipments of our CS3 family of products. The primary working capital use of cash in fiscal 2007 was a decrease in accrued restructuring costs which was primarily due to payments for facility and severance costs for fiscal 2007. Cash flows from investing activities Net cash used for investing activities of $1.5 billion for fiscal 2009, was primarily due to the acquisition of Omniture, purchases of short-term investments and property and equipment, offset in part by maturities and sales of short-term investments. Purchases of long-term investments and other assets during fiscal 2009 were less than fiscal 2008 primarily due to $56.0 million paid in the third quarter of fiscal 2008 for future licensing rights acquired through certain technology licensing arrangements which did not recur in fiscal 2009. Net cash from investing activities changed from cash provided for fiscal 2007 of $81.5 million to cash used in fiscal 2008 of $304.7 million primarily due to purchases of short-term investments offset in part by maturities and sales of short-term investments. Other uses of cash during fiscal 2008 represented purchases of property and equipment, long-term investments and other assets and one business combination offset in part by proceeds from the sale of other investments in equity securities. The uses associated with the purchase of long-term investments and other assets related primarily to cash paid for future licensing rights acquired through certain technology licensing arrangements totaling $56.0 million in fiscal 2008. The primary sources of cash from investment activities during fiscal 2007 were sales and maturities of short-term investments offset in part by purchases of short-term investments. The proceeds from the sales of short-term investments were primarily used for stock repurchases. Uses of cash during fiscal 2007 included purchases of property and equipment, purchases of long-term investments and other assets which related primarily to the technology licensing arrangements that occurred during the second quarter of fiscal 2007, the completion of two business combinations and one asset acquisition in fiscal 2007, and the purchase of a portion of the lease receivable totaling $80.4 million associated with our lease extension for the Almaden tower lease. See Note 17 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding this lease extension. Cash flows from financing activities Net cash from financing activities changed from cash used in fiscal 2008 of $1.0 billion to cash provided for fiscal 2009 of $477.7 million, primarily due to additional borrowing under our credit agreement of $650.0 million and lower purchases of treasury stock, offset in part by proceeds related to the issuance of treasury stock (See sections entitled Stock Repurchase Program I and Stock Repurchase Program II discussed below). Net cash used for financing activities decreased $328.8 million for a total of $1.0 billion in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007, primarily due to net borrowings under our credit agreement of $350.0 million. Additionally, we had lower purchases of treasury stock when compared to the prior year (See sections entitled Stock Repurchase Program I and Stock Repurchase Program II discussed below), offset in part by lower proceeds related to the issuance of treasury stock. We expect to continue our investing activities, including short-term and long-term investments, venture capital, facilities expansion and purchases of computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, product support and administrative staff. Furthermore, cash reserves may be used to repurchase stock under our stock repurchase programs and strategically acquire software companies, products or technologies that are complementary to our business. The Board of Directors has approved a facilities expansion for our operations in India, which may include the purchase of land and buildings. 67 TABLE OF CONTENTS Acquisition of Omniture On October 23, 2009, we completed the acquisition of Omniture, an industry leader in Web analytics and online business optimization based in Orem, Utah for approximately $1.8 billion. Under the terms of the agreement, we completed our tender offer to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Omniture common stock at a price of $21.50 per share, net to the seller in cash, without interest. We expect to incur significant incremental costs, such as direct costs related to the acquisition and costs associated with restructuring our operations. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet these cash outlays. Restructuring On November 10, 2009, we initiated a restructuring plan to appropriately align our costs in connection with our fiscal 2010 operating plan impacting up to approximately 630 full-time positions worldwide. In connection with this restructuring plan, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, we recorded restructuring charges of approximately $25.5 million related to ongoing termination benefits for the elimination of approximately 340 of these full-time positions worldwide. As of November 27, 2009, approximately $2.5 million was paid. The remaining accrual associated with these ongoing termination benefits is expected to be paid during fiscal 2010. The restructuring activities related to this program are only to those employees and facilities that were associated with Adobe prior to the acquisition of Omniture on October 23, 2009. Beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2010, we expect to record approximately $15 million to $18 million primarily related to the consolidation of leased facilities and up to approximately $26 million related to employee severance arrangements for the elimination of the remaining full-time positions worldwide. We expect to accrue the facility related liabilities beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 and pay these liabilities through fiscal 2021 based on current lease terms. Substantially all of these charges will result in cash expenditures. We completed our acquisition of Omniture on October 23, 2009. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, we initiated a plan to restructure the pre-merger operations of Omniture to eliminate certain duplicative activities, focus our resources on future growth opportunities and reduce our cost structure. In connection with this restructuring plan, we accrued a total of approximately $10.6 million in costs related to termination benefits for the elimination of approximately 100 regular positions and for the closure of duplicative facilities. We also accrued approximately $0.2 million in costs related to the cancellation of certain contracts associated with the wind-down of subsidiaries and other service contracts held by Omniture. These costs were recorded as a part of the purchase price allocation, as discussed in Note 2 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements , and have been accrued for as of November 27, 2009. We expect to pay the termination benefits and facility related liabilities through fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2013, respectively. Additionally, approximately $1.5 million of restructuring costs related to facilities were included in the liabilities assumed by us upon acquisition of Omniture on October 23, 2009. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, we initiated a restructuring program, consisting of reductions in workforce of approximately 560 full-time positions globally and the consolidation of facilities, in order to reduce our operating costs and focus our resources on key strategic priorities. In connection with this restructuring program, we recorded restructuring charges in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 totaling $29.2 million related to termination benefits for the elimination of approximately 460 of the 560 full-time positions globally. During fiscal 2009, we continued to implement restructuring activities under this program. We vacated approximately 89,000 square feet of research and development and sales facilities in the U.S., the United Kingdom and Canada. We accrued $8.5 million for the fair value of our future contractual obligations under these operating leases using our credit-adjusted risk-free interest rate, estimated at approximately 6% as of the date we ceased to use the leased properties. This amount is net of the fair value of future estimated sublease income of approximately $4.4 million. We also recorded charges of $6.7 million for ongoing termination benefits for the elimination of substantially all of the remaining 100 full-time positions expected to be terminated. We have paid substantially all of the accrued termination benefits during fiscal 2009 with and expect to pay the remaining amounts in fiscal 2010. We expect to pay facilities-related liabilities through fiscal 2013. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet the cash outlays for the restructuring changes described above. 68 TABLE OF CONTENTS Other Liquidity and Capital Resources Considerations Our existing cash, cash equivalents and investment balances may further decline during fiscal 2010 in the event of a further weakening of the economy or changes in our planned cash outlay, including changes in incremental costs such as direct and integration costs related to the acquisition. Cash from operations could also be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to the risks detailed in Part I, Item 1A titled Risk Factors. However, based on our current business plan and revenue prospects, we believe that our existing balances and our anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital and operating resource expenditure requirements for the next twelve months. At November 27, 2009, our existing credit facility is $1.0 billion and we have borrowed against the entire amount. See Note 18 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding our credit agreement. We use professional investment management firms to manage a large portion of our invested cash. External investment firms managed, on average, 50% of our consolidated invested balances during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. Within the U.S., the portfolio is invested primarily in money market funds for working capital purposes. Outside of the U.S., our fixed income portfolio is primarily invested in U.S. Treasury securities. Stock Repurchase Program I To facilitate our stock repurchase program, designed to return value to our stockholders and minimize dilution from stock issuances, we repurchase shares in the open market and also enter into structured repurchases with third-parties. Authorization to repurchase shares to cover on-going dilution is not subject to expiration. However, this repurchase program is limited to covering net dilution from stock issuances and is subject to business conditions and cash flow requirements as determined by our Board of Directors from time to time. During fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007 we entered into several structured repurchase agreements with large financial institutions, whereupon we provided the financial institutions with prepayments of $350.0 million, $525.0 million and $1.1 billion, respectively. We entered into these agreements in order to take advantage of repurchasing shares at a guaranteed discount to the Volume Weighted Average Price ( VWAP ) of our common stock over a specified period of time. We only enter into such transactions when the discount that we receive is higher than the foregone return on our cash prepayments to the financial institutions. There were no explicit commissions or fees on these structured repurchases. Under the terms of the agreements, there is no requirement for the financial institutions to return any portion of the prepayment to us. The financial institutions agree to deliver shares to us at monthly intervals during the contract term. The parameters used to calculate the number of shares deliverable are: the total notional amount of the contract, the number of trading days in the contract, the number of trading days in the interval, and the average VWAP of our stock during the interval less the agreed upon discount. During fiscal 2009, we repurchased approximately 15.2 million shares at an average price per share of $27.89 through structured repurchase agreements entered into during fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2009. During fiscal 2008, we repurchased 22.4 million shares at an average price of $36.26 through structured repurchase agreements which included prepayments from fiscal 2007. During fiscal 2007, we repurchased 22.0 million shares at an average price of $40.04 through structured repurchase agreements which included prepayments from fiscal 2006. During fiscal 2008, we also repurchased 3.6 million shares at an average price of $36.41 in open market transactions. For fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, the prepayments were classified as treasury stock on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at the payment date, though only shares physically delivered to us by November 27, 2009, November 28, 2008 and November 30, 2007 were excluded from the denominator in the computation of earnings per share. As of November 27, 2009 and November 28, 2008, approximately $59.9 million and $134.7 million, respectively, of up-front payments remained under the agreements. See Item 5, Market for Registrant Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities, for share repurchases during the quarter ended November 27, 2009. Stock Repurchase Program II Under this stock repurchase program, we had authorization to repurchase an aggregate of 50.0 million shares of our common stock. From the inception of the 50.0 million share authorization under this program, we provided prepayments of $1.9 billion under structured share repurchase agreements to large financial institutions. During the third quarter of fiscal 2008, the remaining authorized number of shares were repurchased. 69 TABLE OF CONTENTS During fiscal 2008, we provided prepayments of $1.0 billion and repurchased 31.9 million shares under these structured agreements at an average price of $37.15. During fiscal 2007, we provided prepayments of $850.0 million under structured share repurchase agreements to large financial institutions. During fiscal 2007, we repurchased 17.7 million shares under these structured agreements at an average price of $40.50 and approximately $133.7 million of up-front payments remained under these agreements as of November 30, 2007. During fiscal 2008, we also repurchased 0.5 million shares at an average price of $39.79 in open market transactions.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations Our principal commitments as of November 27, 2009, consist of obligations under operating leases, royalty agreements and various service agreements. See Note 17 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our contractual commitments . Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of November 27, 2009 (in millions): Payment Due by Period Total Less than 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than 5 years Operating leases $ 249.3 $ 53.2 $ 74.7 $ 44.8 $ 76.6 Purchase obligations 210.5 165.5 26.0 6.0 13.0 Debt 1,000.0 1,000.0 Total $ 1,459.8 $ 218.7 $ 100.7 $ 1,050.8 $ 89.6 As of November 27, 2009, the principal outstanding under the credit agreement was $1.0 billion which is due in full no later than February 16, 2013. Interest associated with this agreement cannot be estimated with certainty by period throughout the term since it is based on a fluctuating interest rate calculation. Our credit facility contains a financial covenant requiring us not to exceed a certain maximum leverage ratio. Our leases for the East and West Towers and the Almaden Tower are both subject to standard covenants including certain financial ratios as defined in the lease agreements that are reported to the lessors quarterly. As of November 27, 2009, we were in compliance with all of our covenants. We believe these covenants will not impact our credit or cash in the coming fiscal year or restrict our ability to execute our business plan. Under the terms of our credit agreement and lease agreements, we are not prohibited from paying cash dividends unless payment would trigger an event of default or one currently exists. 70 TABLE OF CONTENTS The gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits at November 27, 2009 was $218.0 million, exclusive of interest and penalties. The timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain as are the amounts and timing of tax payments that are part of any audit settlement process. These events could cause large fluctuations in the balance sheet classification of current and non-current assets and liabilities. We believe that before the end of fiscal 2010, it is reasonably possible that either certain audits will conclude or statutes of limitations on certain income tax examination periods will expire, or both. Given the uncertainties described above, we can only determine a range of estimated potential decreases in underlying unrecognized tax benefits equal to $0 to approximately $10.0 million. These amounts would decrease income tax expense under accounting for income taxes and as a result of the revised accounting guidance for business combinations in fiscal 2010. See Note 1 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Under the revised accounting guidance for business combinations, adjustments to acquired income tax liabilities (including adjustments for acquisitions completed prior to the effective date) that are recorded subsequent to the acquisition date will be recognized in income from continuing operations, with certain exceptions, if such changes occur after the measurement period. Royalties We have certain royalty commitments associated with the shipment and licensing of certain products. Royalty expense is generally based on a dollar amount per unit shipped or a percentage of the underlying revenue. Guarantees The lease agreements for our corporate headquarters provide for residual value guarantees. The fair value of a residual value guarantee in lease agreements entered into after December 31, 2002, must be recognized as a liability on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As such, we recognized $5.2 million and $3.0 million in liabilities, related to the extended East and West Towers and Almaden Tower leases, respectively. These liabilities are recorded in other long-term liabilities with the offsetting entry recorded as prepaid rent in other assets. The balance will be amortized to our Consolidated Statements of Income over the life of the leases. As of November 27, 2009, the unamortized portion of the fair value of the residual value guarantees remaining in other long-term liabilities and prepaid rent was $1.3 million. Indemnifications In the normal course of business, we provide indemnifications of varying scope to customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third-parties arising from the use of our products. Historically, costs related to these indemnification provisions have not been significant and we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these indemnification provisions on our future results of operations. To the extent permitted under Delaware law, we have agreements whereby we indemnify our directors and officers for certain events or occurrences while the director or officer is, or was serving, at our request in such capacity. The indemnification period covers all pertinent events and occurrences during the director or officer lifetime. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited; however, we have director and officer insurance coverage that limits our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. We believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements in excess of applicable insurance coverage is minimal. As part of our limited partnership interests in Adobe Ventures, we have provided a general indemnification to Granite Ventures, an independent venture capital firm and sole general partner of Adobe Ventures, for certain events or occurrences while Granite Ventures is, or was serving, at our request in such capacity provided that Granite Ventures acts in good faith on behalf of the partnership. We are unable to develop an estimate of the maximum potential amount of future payments that could potentially result from any hypothetical future claim, but believe the risk of having to make any payments under this general indemnification to be remote.
