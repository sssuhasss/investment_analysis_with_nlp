ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview We are a diversified chemical company serving agricultural, consumer and industrial markets globally with innovative solutions, applications and market-leading products. We operate in three distinct business segments: Agricultural Products, Specialty Chemicals and Industrial Chemicals. Our Agricultural Products segment develops, markets and sells all three major classes of crop protection chemicals insecticides, herbicides, and fungicides with particular strength in insecticides and herbicides. These products are used in agriculture to enhance crop yield and quality by controlling a broad spectrum of insects, weeds and disease, as well as pest control in non-agricultural markets. Specialty Chemicals consists of our BioPolymer and lithium businesses and focuses on food ingredients that are used to enhance texture, structure and physical stability, pharmaceutical additives for binding, encapsulation and disintegrant applications, ultrapure biopolymers for medical devices and lithium for energy storage specialty polymers and pharmaceutical synthesis. Our Industrial Chemicals segment manufactures a wide range of inorganic materials, including soda ash, hydrogen peroxide, specialty peroxygens, zeolites and silicates. Through December 31, 2010, our Industrial Chemicals segment also held a niche position in phosphorous chemicals products, however, in November 2010, we made the decision to exit the phosphate business via the shutdown of our Huelva facility in Spain. 2010 Highlights Our businesses this year have been positively impacted by the increase in global economic activity resulting in higher volumes. Results for 2010 reflect increases in both consolidated revenues and earnings in all three of our operating segments driven by solid performance. Our Agricultural Products segment revenues increased 18 percent driven by sales gains in North America, Latin America, particularly Brazil, and Asia due to improved market conditions in several key crops and growth from new and recently introduced products. Revenue also increased in our Specialty Chemicals segment with revenues up nine percent compared to the prior year period. Increases in the Specialty Chemicals segment were led by a robust demand recovery in lithium primaries and strong commercial performance in BioPolymer. Our Industrial Chemicals segment revenues increased three percent from prior year period as volume gains across all businesses were largely offset by reduced selling prices and lower electricity sales stemming from the sale of a Spanish cogeneration facility in 2009. In Spain we operate electricity cogeneration facilities and sell excess electricity into the Spanish electrical grid. Agricultural Products operating profit increased seven percent compared to the prior year period reflecting strong sales performance partially offset by less favorable mix, higher inventory and distribution costs, increased selling and administrative expenses and higher spending on growth initiatives. Specialty Chemicals operating profit grew by 16 percent as volume gains in lithium primaries, favorable commercial performance in BioPolymer and the benefits of productivity initiatives were partially offset by higher raw material costs. Industrial Chemicals operating profit increased 37 percent from the prior year period, driven by the strong demand recovery and lower raw material, particularly phosphate rock, and energy costs which more than offset lower selling prices across the segment. See Segment Results section starting on page 28 for further discussion on the results of our operating segments. In the fourth quarter of 2010, we announced a new corporate strategy, which we refer to as Vision 2015. Vision 2015 is focused on driving sales and earnings growth while sustaining a return on invested capital well above our cost of capital, and has as one of its key objectives, achieving a total shareholder return in the top quartile of a broad group of industry peers. Vision 2015 and its five key elements are explained in more detail in our strategy section of this Form 10-K included in Item 1. In November 2010, we made the decision to cease operations at our Huelva, Spain facility and exit the phosphate business in Europe. The facility was a part of our subsidiary FMC Foret, S.A. ( Foret ), which is included in our Industrial Chemicals segment. The closure of the facility was initiated as a consequence of the Spanish judicial ruling which, effective January 1, 2011, prohibited us from storing phosphogypsum on a site adjacent to our production facility. The phosphogypsum is a byproduct of the process of manufacturing phosphoric acid, which is used in the manufacturing of our phosphate products. Since receipt of the unfavorable Spanish judicial ruling, we attempted to pursue strategic alternatives for our Foret phosphorus business. With no reasonable economic alternatives, the judicial ruling inhibited our ability to cost effectively produce our phosphate product and therefore rendered it uneconomical for FMC to continue operations at the facility. The Huelva decision resulted in the incurrence of significant restructuring charges in 2010. 26 Table of Contents 2011 Outlook In 2011, we expect a year of solid performance. We expect to have an increase to our revenues driven by increased volumes in most regions, particularly Latin America and Asia, in our Agricultural Products segment and favorable commercial performance in BioPolymer and higher selling prices and favorable mix in lithium in our Specialty Chemicals segment. This revenue increase will be slightly offset by lower revenue in our Industrial Chemicals segment as growth in soda ash and peroxygens is expected to be fully offset by the absence of revenue for the exited phosphate business. We expect an increase in earnings. The increase will be partially driven by higher sales as discussed above. Additionally, we expect continued productivity improvements in our Specialty Chemicals segments as well as the benefit of cost reduction initiatives in our Industrial Chemicals segment. Our projected earnings increase will be partially offset by higher spending on growth initiatives and higher raw material costs particularly in our Agricultural Products segment. We expect cash flow from our business segments to remain strong. Results of Operations 2010, 2009 and 2008 Overview The following presents a reconciliation of our segment operating profit to net income attributable to FMC stockholders as seen through the eyes of our management. For management purposes, we report the operating performance of each of our business segments based on earnings before interest and income taxes excluding corporate expenses, other income (expense), net and corporate special income/(charges). Year Ended December 31, (in Millions) 2010 2009 2008 Revenue Agricultural Products $ 1,241.8 $ 1,051.6 $ 1,058.7 Specialty Chemicals 824.5 753.1 764.5 Industrial Chemicals 1,054.8 1,026.7 1,296.9 Eliminations (4.8 ) (5.2 ) (4.8 ) Total $ 3,116.3 $ 2,826.2 $ 3,115.3 Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes Agricultural Products $ 309.5 $ 289.0 $ 245.2 Specialty Chemicals 185.0 159.6 152.0 Industrial Chemicals 122.9 89.7 201.4 Eliminations 0.2 (0.1 ) (0.1 ) Segment operating profit (1) 617.6 538.2 598.5 Corporate (63.0 ) (44.1 ) (49.8 ) Other income (expense), net (18.0 ) (27.5 ) (8.6 ) Interest expense, net (39.3 ) (27.0 ) (31.9 ) Corporate special income (charges): Restructuring and other income (charges) (151.9 ) (132.8 ) (49.6 ) Impairment of Perorsa joint venture (1.4 ) Purchase accounting inventory fair value impact and other related inventory adjustments (7.1 ) (2.3 ) Pension settlement charge (7.3 ) Provision for income taxes (132.0 ) (53.0 ) (125.4 ) Discontinued operations, net of income taxes (33.6 ) (18.2 ) (24.9 ) Net income attributable to FMC stockholders $ 172.5 $ 228.5 $ 304.6 (1) Results for all segments are net of noncontrolling interests in 2010, 2009 and 2008 of $12.4 million, $10.3 million and $17.0 million, respectively. The majority of which pertains to our Industrial Chemicals segment. 27 Table of Contents The following chart, which is provided to assist the readers of our financial statements, depicts certain after-tax charges (gains). These items are excluded by us in the measures we use to evaluate business performance and determine certain performance-based compensation. These after-tax items are discussed in detail within the Other results of operations section that follows. Additionally, the chart below discloses our Non-GAAP financial measure After-tax income from continuing operations, excluding restructuring and other income and charges reconciled from the GAAP financial measure Net income attributable to FMC stockholders . We believe that this measure provides useful information about our operating results to investors and securities analysts. We also believe that excluding the effect of restructuring and other income and charges from operating results allows management and investors to compare more easily the financial performance of our underlying businesses from period to period. This measure should not be considered as a substitute for net income (loss) or other measures of performance or liquidity reported in accordance with GAAP. Year Ended December 31, (in Millions) 2010 2009 2008 Net income attributable to FMC stockholders $ 172.5 $ 228.5 $ 304.6 Corporate special charges (income), pre-tax 159.2 139.9 53.3 Income tax expense (benefit) on Corporate special charges (income) (50.4 ) (38.8 ) (23.0 ) Corporate special charges (income), net of income taxes 108.8 101.1 30.3 Discontinued operations, net of income tax benefit of $18.7 million, $11.2 million and $15.0 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively 33.6 18.2 24.9 Tax adjustments 38.7 (43.7 ) (8.7 ) After-tax income from continuing operations excluding restructuring and other income and charges $ 353.6 $ 304.1 $ 351.1 Year Ended December 31, 2010 compared to December 31, 2009 In the following discussion, year refers to the year ended December 31, 2010, and prior year refers to the year ended December 31, 2009. Additionally, in the discussion below, please refer to our chart on page 27 under Overview . All comparisons are between the periods unless otherwise noted. Segment Results For management purposes, segment operating profit is defined as segment revenue less segment operating expenses (segment operating expenses consist of costs of sales and services, selling, general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses). We have excluded the following items from segment operating profit: corporate staff expense, interest income and expense associated with corporate debt facilities and investments, income taxes, gains (or losses) on divestitures of businesses, restructuring and other charges (income), investment gains and losses, loss on extinguishment of debt, asset impairments, Last-in, First-out ( LIFO ) inventory adjustments, amortization of inventory step-up from business acquisitions and other related inventory adjustments, pension settlement charge adjustments and other income and expense items. Information about how each of these items relates to our businesses at the segment level and results by segment are discussed below and in Note 19 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K. 28 Table of Contents Agricultural Products Year Ended December 31, Increase/(Decrease) (in Millions) 2010 2009 $ % Revenue $ 1,241.8 $ 1,051.6 $ 190.2 18 % Operating Profit 309.5 289.0 20.5 7 Revenue of $1,241.8 million increased 18 percent versus the prior year, as higher sales were recognized in North America, Latin America and Asia. North America revenue increased 15 percent to $252.0 million due to strong demand for our proprietary herbicides, growth from new and recently introduced products, particularly our newly acquired herbicide, fluthiacet-methyl, and improving market conditions in some non-crop segments. Europe, Middle East and Africa revenue of $158.7 million were flat year over year. Latin America revenue of $628.9 million increased 24 percent due to improved market conditions, particularly in the sugarcane, cotton, soybeans, corn and tobacco segments, and growth in new and recently introduced products. Revenue in Asia increased 21 percent to $202.1 million reflecting better market conditions, the introduction of new products and growth in most countries particularly India, Indonesia, Australia and China. Segment operating profit of $309.5 million increased seven percent compared to the prior year period, reflecting strong sales performance partially offset by higher first-half inventory and distribution costs, and selling and administrative expenses. Higher selling and administrative expenses were primarily due to foreign exchange impacts, higher spending on growth initiatives and increased people-related costs. In 2011, we expect full-year revenue growth in the high-single digits driven by increased volumes in most regions, particularly Latin America and Asia, due to expected strong market conditions and growth in new and recently introduced products. Full-year segment operating profit growth is expected in the high-single digits reflecting the sales gains partially offset by higher spending on growth initiatives and higher raw material costs. Certain Regulatory Issues In our Agricultural Products segment, several products are undergoing re-registration in the U.S. and/or a comparable regulatory review by the European Union ( EU ) governmental authorities. In August 2006, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) issued its Interim Reregistration Eligibility Decision ( IRED ) for our carbofuran insecticide under the U.S. federal pesticide law. The IRED proposed cancellation of all carbofuran uses in the United States, subject to a phase out period for certain minor crop uses, while maintaining tolerances for imported commodities (bananas, coffee, rice and sugarcane). The EPA reiterated its proposal in January 2008, with the issuance of a draft Notice of Intent to cancel carbofuran use ( Notice ). In February 2008, the EPA convened a Scientific Advisory Panel meeting to evaluate scientific issues relevant to the Notice. Separately, the U.S. Department of Agriculture issued its comments on the Notice, stating that carbofuran should continue to be registered. On July 24, 2008, the EPA published a proposal to revoke all carbofuran tolerances under the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act in advance of any issuance of a final Notice under the federal pesticide law. We responded to that notice, expressing our strong disagreement with the EPA proposal to revoke tolerances and our belief that carbofuran residues on food do not pose a threat to human health. In May 2009, the EPA published its final revocation of all carbofuran tolerances effective December 31, 2009. We filed our objections to this revocation and requested a hearing before an administrative law judge. On October 30, 2009, the EPA denied our objections and our request for a hearing. We believe that we are entitled to a hearing and we have challenged this decision by seeking judicial review in the U.S. federal courts. On July 23, 2010, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit ruled that the EPA acted arbitrarily and capriciously in revoking the import tolerances, and ordered that those tolerances be reinstated. However, the Court did not extend its rationale to the domestic tolerances and instead ruled that the EPA had the right to deny our request for administrative hearing. In mid-February 2011, we filed a petition for writ of certiorari, seeking review before the U.S. Supreme Court. In light of the December 31, 2009, tolerance revocation, FMC ceased sales of carbofuran in the United States in 2009. FMC sales of our carbofuran products in the United States were not significant and termination of such U.S. sales did not have a material effect on the Company financial condition or results of operations. We do not know the EPA timing on a final Notice of Intent to Cancel the carbofuran registration, though the EPA has said it intends to issue such notice after the tolerance revocation decision is finally resolved. 29 Table of Contents In the EU, following an administrative appeals process, the European Commission proposal to exclude our bifenthrin product from the European Commission official list of approved pesticides, was adopted on November 30, 2009. FMC had an additional six months to sell bifenthrin in the EU (i.e., through end-May 2010), and subsequently, in most EU countries, there is up to 6-12 months for further sale by distributors or dealers, and use by farmers. We have re-submitted for reconsideration and the product dossier is now being reviewed by relevant European authorities. On December 30, 2010, the French Ministry of Agriculture issued a notice adding bifenthrin, along with eight other pesticidal active ingredients, to the Grenelle list of pesticides prohibited for sale in France. We believe that such listing was unwarranted and contrary to French administrative law, and we are challenging the decision. Through these efforts, we are seeking to minimize the interruption in existing and future bifenthrin sales in the European market. We intend to defend vigorously all our products in the U.S., EU and other countries regulatory processes where FMC pesticide products will be reviewed in the ordinary course of regulatory programs during 2011 as part of the ongoing cycle of re-registration in countries around the world. The Brazilian health surveillance agency has informed us that they intend to review carbofuran along with 13 other major pesticides, but has yet to issue any required formal announcement that identifies their specific concerns or preliminary position on re-registration. FMC is cooperating and defending our product in this process. Under the Brazilian regulatory process, any recommendation would require public notice and comment as well as concurrence from the Brazilian environmental and agricultural ministries before any regulatory change is effective. Thus, we do not expect a potential sales impact in Brazil in 2011. Specialty Chemicals (in Millions) Year Ended December 31, Increase/(Decrease) 2010 2009 $ % Revenue $ 824.5 $ 753.1 $ 71.4 9 % Operating Profit 185.0 159.6 25.4 16 Revenue in Specialty Chemicals was $824.5 million, an increase of approximately nine percent versus the prior-year period. The increase was driven primarily by a robust demand recovery in lithium primaries and strong commercial performance in BioPolymer. BioPolymer revenues of $611.5 million increased six percent from the prior-year period. This increase was primarily due to higher volumes which increased revenue by five percent. BioPolymer experienced broad-based volume gains across both food and pharmaceutical markets. Additionally, improved pricing and mix increased revenue, driven primarily by higher pricing in food ingredients. Lithium revenues of $213.0 million increased 22 percent from the prior-year period primarily due to higher volumes driven by improving economic conditions slightly offset by lower pricing. Higher volumes increased revenue by 29 percent while the lower pricing impacted revenues downward by seven percent. The improving economic conditions in lithium are driven primarily by growth in battery and metals markets in Asia. Segment operating profit of $185.0 million increased 16 percent versus the year ago period, as volume gains in lithium primaries, favorable commercial performance in BioPolymer and the benefits of productivity initiatives were partially offset by higher raw material costs. In 2011, we expect full-year revenue growth in the mid-single digits, driven by favorable commercial performance in BioPolymer and higher selling prices and favorable mix in lithium. Full-year segment operating profit growth is expected in the low teens reflecting higher sales across all businesses and continued productivity improvements. 30 Table of Contents Industrial Chemicals (in Millions) Year Ended December 31, Increase/(Decrease) 2010 2009 $ % Revenue $ 1,054.8 $ 1,026.7 28.1 3 % Operating Profit 122.9 89.7 33.2 37 Revenue in Industrial Chemicals was $1,054.8 million, an increase of approximately three percent versus the prior-year period. An increase in volumes across the segment increased revenues by eight percent which was offset by a seven percent decline in pricing. Soda ash revenues were up due to increased volumes, particularly in the export market, partially offset by lower prices. The segment experienced volume increases in peroxygens and phosphates offset by reduced selling prices for these products. The higher volumes in the segment also resulted in increased freight billings which increased revenue by three percent. The segment was also negatively impacted by $12 million or one percent decrease due to lower electricity sales due to the divestiture of a Spanish co-generation facility in the third quarter of 2009. In Spain, we operate electricity co-generation facilities and sell excess electricity into the Spanish electrical grid. Segment operating profit of $122.9 million increased approximately 37 percent versus the year ago period, driven by the strong demand recovery and lower raw material, particularly phosphate rock, and energy costs which more than offset lower selling prices across the segment. In 2011, we expect full-year revenue to be approximately 5 percent lower as growth in soda ash and peroxygens will be offset by the absence of revenue from the exited phosphate business, which occurred at the end of 2010. Full-year operating profit growth is expected in the mid-twenties driven by higher selling prices and volume growth augmented by the benefit of cost reduction initiatives. Recent events in Venezuela, such as hyperinflation, devaluation of currency, government price controls, parallel exchange rates, and political issues have created significant risks and uncertainties for the Venezuelan operations of U.S.-based companies. Our Spanish subsidiary, FMC Foret, holds a noncontrolling interest in a Venezuelan joint-venture named Tripoliven. The value of this investment on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2010 is approximately $9 million. While the receipts of collecting dividends from this entity have slowed, we continued to receive dividends from the entity during 2010. We do not believe there is any impairment of the entity at December 31, 2010 and, in light of the facts and circumstances noted above, will continue to monitor this situation. The risks associated with this entity would have an immaterial impact on our liquidity or consolidated financial position but could result in an impact to our results of operations in any one period in the form of an impairment charge. Other Results of Operations Corporate expenses We recorded expenses of $63.0 million in 2010 compared to $44.1 million in 2009. The increase was primarily due to increased incentive compensation expense and consulting expense compared to the prior year. The increase in consulting services is a result of several new initiatives, primarily involving global procurement, aimed at reducing the costs of goods and services purchased on a world-wide basis. Corporate expenses are included as a component of the line item Selling, general and administrative expenses on our consolidated statements of income. Other income (expense), net Other income (expense), net is comprised primarily of LIFO inventory adjustments and pension expense. Other expense was $18.0 million in 2010 compared to $27.5 million in 2009. The decrease was due primarily to income related to a decrease in our LIFO inventory reserves. These charges were partially offset by higher pension expense and incentive compensation. Excluding pension expense, other income (expense), net is included as a component of the line item Costs of sales and services on our consolidated statements of income. Pension expense is included as a component of the line item Selling, general and administrative expenses on our consolidated statements of income. Interest expense, net The 2010 net interest expense increased to $39.3 million compared to $27.0 million in 2009 primarily due to higher interest rates associated with our senior bond offering in the fourth quarter 2009 whose proceeds were used to pay off lower variable rate debt under out committed credit facilities. 31 Table of Contents Corporate special income (charges) Restructuring and other charges (income) were $151.9 million in 2010 compared to $132.8 million in 2009. Please see the table and further discussion regarding our restructuring and other charges (income) in Note 7 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K. The restructuring and other charges (income) of $151.9 million recorded in 2010 were a result of the following: Restructuring charges and asset disposals A $7.2 million charge in our Speci a lty Chemicals segment due to the continued realignment of our BioPolymer alginates manufacturing operations. The charge consisted of (i) accelerated depreciation on fixed assets to be abandoned of $1.6 million, (ii) a reduction to previously recorded severance reserves of $0.6 million, (iii) the accrual of costs associated with leased properties which we have ceased using of $5.2 million and (iv) other shut down charges of $1.0 million. In 2009, we made the decision to close our Bayport butyllithium facility located in Bayport, Texas, which is part of our Specialty Chemicals segment. As the closure was finalized in 2010, we recorded $1.1 million of income which consisted of (i) a reduction of previously recorded retirement obligations at the site of $0.9 million and (ii) a reduction of previously recorded severance reserves of $0.2 million. A $110.4 million charge in our Industrial Chemicals segment due to the decision to shut down our Huelva facility and exit the phosphate business. The charge consisted of (i) severance and employee benefits of $37.0 million, (ii) accelerated depreciation on fixed assets to be abandoned of $69.4 million and (iii) other shut down charges of $4.0 million. We ceased production at this facility on December 31, 2010. A $6.9 million charge in our Industrial Chemicals segment due to our decision in 2009 to phase out operations of our Barcelona, Spain facility. The charge consisted of (i) accelerated depreciation on fixed assets to be abandoned of $10.1 million and (ii) other costs of $1.0 million, mainly related to spare part write-offs and contract termination expenses, partially offset by (iii) recoveries associated with the phase out of $4.0 million, and (iv) a reduction to previously recorded severance reserves of $0.2 million. The recoveries represented the sale of the land lease rights associated with a portion of this facility. In 2009, we made the decision to shut down our manufacturing operations at our Peroxygens facility in Santa Clara, Mexico, which is part of our Industrial Chemicals segment. During 2010, we recorded $1.0 million of income which related to the reversal of a previously recorded loss contingency. Severance costs due to other workforce restructurings of $5.5 million primarily related to our Industrial Chemicals segment. A $0.7 million gain, primarily related to foreign currency translation adjustment as a result of the liquidation of a legal entity that owned a co-generation facility at Foret. Other charges (income), net Corporate net charges of $14.2 million relating to environmental remediation at operating sites. A $5.7 million charge related to our Agricultural Products segment acquiring certain rights relating to a herbicide compound still under development. $1.5 million of net charges primarily related to a legal settlement associated with the U.S. hydrogen peroxide matter in our Industrial Chemicals segment. $0.5 million of charges in our Agricultural Products segment related to a collaboration and license agreement with a third-party company. $2.8 million of charges, primarily relating to the accrual of interest associated with a European Commission fine currently being appealed. The restructuring and other charges (income) of $132.8 million recorded in 2009 were a result of the following: Restructuring charges and asset disposal charges A $1.8 million charge in our Agricultural Products segment due to our decision to phase-out operations at our Baltimore, Maryland agricultural chemicals facility. The charge consisted of (i) demolition costs of $1.2 million and (ii) other shutdown costs of $0.6 million. We ceased production at this facility in the second quarter of 2008. 32 Table of Contents A $13.3 million charge in our Specialty Chemicals segment due to the realignment of our BioPolymer alginates manufacturing operations. The charge consisted of (i) accelerated depreciation on fixed assets to be abandoned of $8.6 million, (ii) severance and employee benefits of $3.9 million and (iii) other shut down charges of $0.8 million. A $7.5 million charge in our Specialty Chemicals segment due to our decision to close our Bayport butyllithium facility located in Bayport, Texas. The charge consisted of (i) accelerated depreciation on fixed assets to be abandoned of $6.8 million and (ii) severance and employee benefits of $0.7 million. A $7.4 million charge in our Specialty Chemicals segment due to our decision to close our Lithium metal production unit at our Bromborough, UK plant. The charge consisted of (i) accelerated depreciation on fixed assets to be abandoned of $5.0 million, (ii) severance and employee benefits of $1.8 million and (iii) other shut down charges of $0.6 million. A $25.8 million charge in our Industrial Chemicals segment due to our decision to phase out operations of our Barcelona, Spain facility. The charge consisted of (i) severance and employee benefits of $10.1 million, (ii) accelerated depreciation on fixed assets to be abandoned of $15.2 million and (iii) other shut down costs of $0.5 million. A $6.7 million charge in our Industrial Chemicals segment due to our decision to shut down our manufacturing operations at our Peroxygens facility in Santa Clara, Mexico. The charge consisted of (i) accelerated depreciation on fixed assets to be abandoned of $3.5 million, (ii) severance and employee benefits of $1.5 million and (iii) other shut down costs of $1.7 million. $12.4 million of severance costs due to other workforce restructurings, of which $11.0 million related to our Industrial Chemicals segment and $1.4 million related to our Specialty Chemicals segment. Other asset abandonment charges of $6.4 million, of which $2.6 million related to our Agricultural Products segment, $2.7 million related to our Industrial Chemicals segment and $1.1 million related to our Specialty Chemicals segment. Asset abandonment charges were determined based upon our decision and related analysis to abandon these assets before the end of their previously estimated life. $0.2 million of other charges primarily representing adjustments related to previously recorded restructuring reserves. Other charges (income), net A $2.3 million net gain as a result of exiting our leases at our Princeton facility. A gain of $1.0 million as a result of the sale of our sodium sulfate co-generation facility in our Industrial Chemicals segment. A charge of $21.0 million related to the resolution of a regulatory matter in our Industrial Chemicals segment. A charge of $3.3 million related to the settlement of a legal matter in our Industrial Chemicals segment. $5.6 million of charges representing settlements with state authorities for property claims. Corporate charges of $20.2 million relating to environmental remediation at operating sites. Charges of $2.0 million related to our Agricultural Products segment acquiring further rights under a collaboration and license agreement with a third-party company. $2.5 million of other charges primarily representing the accrual of interest associated with the European Commission fine. The activity of the restructuring charges listed above are included within Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K. We believe the restructuring plans implemented are on schedule and the benefits and savings either have been or will be achieved. Purchase accounting inventory fair value impact and other related inventory adjustments for the year ended December 31, 2009, totaled $7.1 million. In purchase accounting, inventory is stepped up from its cost value to estimated selling prices less costs to sell. This line item represented charges related to amortization of the inventory fair value step-up associated with the third quarter 2008 acquisition in our Specialty Chemicals segment and the first quarter 2009 acquisition in our Agricultural Products segment. Additionally the amount in 2009 includes inventory adjustments related to the third quarter 2008 acquisition in our Specialty Chemicals segment and subsequent alginates business restructuring. On the consolidated statements of income, these charges are included in Costs of sales and services . No such events occurred in the year ended December 31, 2010. Pension settlement charge represent a settlement charge associated with the acceleration of previously deferred pension actuarial losses. The acceleration was triggered by a lump-sum payout to our former Chairman and CEO. 33 Table of Contents On the consolidated statements of income, these charges are included in Selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2010. No such event occurred for the year ended December 31, 2009. Provision for income taxes We recorded a provision of $132.0 million in 2010 compared with a provision of $53.0 million in 2009 resulting in effective tax rates of 37.7 percent and 17.1 percent, respectively. The change in the effective tax rate was primarily a result of tax adjustments recorded in 2010 and 2009 as described below. 2010 tax adjustments were unfavorable in the amount of $38.7 million and are primarily a result of recording a $40 million valuation allowance in our Spanish legal entity, predominantly due to the Huelva facility shutdown, for tax losses that are not expected to be fully recoverable in future years from the earnings of the remaining businesses in that entity. 2010 tax adjustments were also impacted by a $3.6 million tax charge associated with the tax treatment of the Medicare Part D subsidy, which was enacted as part of the recent U.S. health care reform legislation. The unfavorable tax adjustments were partially offset by a reduction in our liability for unrecognized tax benefits due to settlements of audits and expiration of statute of limitations and recognition of various tax credits. 2009 tax adjustments were favorable in the amount of $43.7 million and were primarily a result of a reduction in our liability for unrecognized tax benefits due to favorable settlements of tax audits and the expiration of statutes of limitations as well as the reversal of certain domestic related tax valuation allowances. These domestic valuation allowances were no longer necessary because of our expectation that the related deferred tax assets were likely to be realized. Excluding the impact of these tax adjustments, our effective tax rate in 2010 was 26.6 percent versus 31.1 percent in 2009 and the fluctuation is primarily the result of the mix of domestic income compared to income earned outside of the U.S. Income we earn domestically is typically taxed at rates higher than income earned outside the U.S. Discontinued operations, net of income tax Our discontinued operations represent adjustments to retained liabilities primarily related to operations discontinued between 1976 and 2001. The primary liabilities retained include environmental liabilities, other post-retirement benefit liabilities, self-insurance and long-term obligations related to legal proceedings. Discontinued operations, net of income tax totaled a loss of $33.6 million in 2010 versus a loss of $18.2 million in 2009. The 2010 loss is primarily related to environmental charges associated with our Middleport site and operating and maintenance activities partially offset by recoveries. The 2010 loss also includes charges for legal reserves and expenses related to discontinued operations. The 2009 loss is primarily related to environmental charges associated with our Front Royal and Middleport sites and operating and maintenance activities partially offset by recoveries related to our Front Royal site. The 2009 loss also includes charges for legal reserves and expenses related to discontinued operations. Net income attributable to FMC stockholders Net income attributable to FMC stockholders decreased to $172.5 million in 2010 compared with $228.5 million in 2009. The decrease was primarily due to higher restructuring and other charges (income) and increased corporate expenses, interest expense, income taxes and environmental charges. Partially offsetting these decreases were higher profits across all segments. Year Ended December 31, 2009 compared to December 31, 2008 In the following discussion, year refers to the year ended December 31, 2009 and prior year refers to the year ended December 31, 2008. Additionally, in the discussion below, please refer to our chart on page 27 under Overview . All comparisons are between the periods unless otherwise noted. 34 Table of Contents Segment Results Agricultural Products (in Millions) Year Ended December 31, Increase/(Decrease) 2009 2008 $ % Revenue $ 1,051.6 $ 1,058.7 $ (7.1 ) (1 )% Operating Profit 289.0 245.2 43.8 18 Revenue of $1,051.6 million was one percent lower than the prior year period as sales gains in North America, Latin America (which is primarily Brazil) and non-crop markets and generally higher pricing across the entire business were more than fully offset by lower sales in Europe and Asia, which also included unfavorable currency impacts in these two regions. North American revenues of $218.7 million increased three percent on new product introductions, price increases and sales from the CB Professional Products line acquisition. Revenues in Europe, Middle East and Africa of $146.4 million declined 11 percent due to weaker markets and unfavorable currency impacts. In Latin America, revenues increased two percent to $506.8 million primarily due to improved second half market conditions in Brazil, partially offset by unfavorable currency impacts. In Asia, revenues declined two percent to $166.6 million due mainly to unfavorable weather conditions, weak pest pressures and unfavorable currency impacts. Segment operating profit of $289.0 million was 18 percent higher than the prior year, driven by growth from new products, particularly in North America and Brazil, better second half market conditions in Brazil, higher selling prices in most regions, continued global supply chain productivity improvements, the benefit of indirect tax recoveries in Brazil, lower raw material costs and lower selling and administrative expenses. Specialty Chemicals (in Millions) Year Ended December 31, Increase/(Decrease) 2009 2008 $ % Revenue $ 753.1 $ 764.5 $ (11.4 ) (1 )% Operating Profit 159.6 152.0 7.6 5 Specialty Chemicals revenue of $753.1 million decreased one percent versus the prior year period. The decrease was driven primarily by lower volumes across the Lithium business mostly offset by higher selling prices and a full year of revenue related to the acquisitions in the mid-third quarter of 2008 in BioPolymer. BioPolymer revenues increased to $579.2 million which is eight percent higher than prior year. This change was due to the benefit of a full year of revenue related to the acquisitions in the mid-third quarter of 2008 which increased revenue by ten percent. Improved pricing and mix increased revenue by an additional five percent. These benefits were partially offset by volume declines of approximately three percent and the impact of a weaker euro. Lithium revenues of $173.9 million declined 24 percent from the prior year primarily due to weak demand across the business. Segment operating profit of $159.6 million was five percent higher than the prior year as favorable commercial performance in BioPolymer, the benefits of acquisitions in Biopolymer, productivity initiatives and a recovery of export taxes in Argentina were partially offset by lower lithium volumes, temporary plant curtailments to reduce inventories and unfavorable currency translation. 35 Table of Contents Industrial Chemicals (in Millions) Year Ended December 31, Increase/(Decrease) 2009 2008 $ % Revenue $ 1,026.7 $ 1,296.9 $ (270.2 ) (21 )% Operating Profit 89.7 201.4 (111.7 ) (55 ) Industrial Chemicals revenue of $1,026.7 million decreased 21 percent versus the prior year period due primarily to volume declines across the segment. These volume declines reduced segment revenues by approximately 15 percent, while pricing remained flat, despite a significant year-over-year reduction in pricing for phosphates. The remaining decline of approximately six percent was driven primarily by unfavorable currency impacts and reduced freight billings in line with the volume declines noted above. Soda ash revenues were down on lower volumes, with pricing improvements partially offsetting these unfavorable impacts. Foret revenues were down on lower volumes and pricing, particularly for phosphates and an unfavorable euro. Finally, North American Peroxygens revenue decreased primarily due to volume declines, partially offset by pricing improvements. Segment operating profit of $89.7 million was 55 percent lower than the prior period, driven by lower volumes across the segment. Other Results of Operations Corporate expenses We recorded charges of $44.1 million in 2009 compared to $49.8 million in 2008. The decrease was primarily due to reduced incentive compensation expense and reductions in discretionary spending compared to the prior year. Other income (expense), net Other expense was $27.5 million in 2009 compared to $8.6 million in 2008. The increase was due primarily to higher charges related to our LIFO inventory reserves, higher pension expense and an increase to the mark to market impact of our deferred compensation liability. Interest expense, net The 2009 net interest expense decreased to $27.0 million compared to $31.9 million in 2008 primarily due to lower interest rates on the borrowings under our credit agreements as compared to the prior period. Corporate special income (charges) Restructuring and other charges (income) were $132.8 million in 2009 compared to $49.6 million in 2008. Refer to page 32 for a list of the charges in this category for the year ended December 31, 2009. The restructuring and other charges (income) of $49.6 million recorded in 2008 were a result of the following: Restructuring charges and asset impairments A $31.5 million charge in our Agricultural Products segment due to our decision in 2007 to phase-out operations at our Baltimore, Maryland agricultural chemicals facility. These charges consisted of (i) accelerated depreciation on fixed assets of $27.0 million, (ii) severance and employee benefits of $1.4 million, and (iii) other shutdown charges of $3.1 million. A $5.6 million charge in our Agricultural Products segment due to our decision in 2008 to phase-out operations at our Jacksonville, Florida facility. The charge consisted of (i) accelerated depreciation on fixed assets of $3.8 million, (ii) severance and employee benefits of $1.0 million and (iii) other shutdown charges of $0.8 million. Severance costs due to workforce restructurings of $8.1 million, of which $3.2 million related to our Agricultural Products segment, $0.7 million related to our Specialty Chemicals segment and $4.2 million related to our Industrial Chemicals segment. Asset abandonment charges of $7.0 million, of which $2.2 million related to our Agricultural Products segment, $1.5 million related to our Industrial Chemicals segment and $3.3 million related to our Specialty Chemicals segment. 36 Table of Contents Other charges (income), net A gain on the sale of the Princeton property of $29.0 million, completed on March 18, 2008. A gain on the sale of Foret sodium sulfate assets of $3.6 million. Foret is part of our Industrial Chemicals segment. A $10.0 million charge related to an agreement in principle to settle a class action alleging violations of antitrust law involving our hydrogen peroxide product in our Industrial Chemicals segment. $16.2 million of charges relating to environmental remediation at operating sites as a Corporate charge. A $1.0 million charge related to our Agricultural Products segment extending their rights associated with the collaboration and license agreement discussed below. $2.8 million of other charges primarily representing the accrual of interest associated with the European Commission fine. Impairment of Perorsa joint venture represents a $1.4 million charge related to the impairment of our Perorsa joint venture in our Industrial Chemicals segment. On the consolidated statements of income this charge is included in Equity in (earnings) loss of affiliates for the year ended December 31, 2008. There is no such comparable charge in 2009. Purchase accounting inventory fair value impact and other related inventory adjustments for the year ended December 31, 2009, totaled $7.1 million. Refer to page 33 for a description of this charge for the year ended December 31, 2009. For the year ended December 31, 2008, the charges of $2.3 million represented the amortization of the inventory fair value step-up resulting from the application of purchase accounting associated with the third quarter 2008 acquisition in our Specialty Chemicals segment. Provision for income taxes We recorded a provision of $53.0 million in 2009 compared with a provision of $125.4 million in 2008 resulting in effective tax rates of 17.1 percent and 26.6 percent, respectively. The effective tax rates were impacted by tax adjustments recorded during 2009 and 2008. These tax adjustments are described below. 2009 tax adjustments were favorable in the amount of $43.7 million and were primarily a result of a reduction in our liability for unrecognized tax benefits due to favorable settlements of tax audits and the expiration of statutes of limitations as well as the reversal of certain domestic related tax valuation allowances. These domestic valuation allowances were no longer necessary because of our expectation that the related deferred tax assets were likely to be realized. 2008 tax adjustments were favorable in the amount of $8.7 million and primarily result from a benefit to adjust our reserve for unrecognized tax benefits due to favorable settlements of tax audits. Partially offsetting this benefit are charges associated with adjustments for prior years tax matters. Excluding the impact of these tax adjustments, our effective tax rate in 2009 was 31.1 percent versus 28.4 percent in 2008. This change was related to the 2009 resolution of a regulatory matter in our Industrial Chemicals segment that was non-deductible for tax purposes. Discontinued operations, net of income tax Discontinued operations, net of income tax totaled a loss of $18.2 million in 2009 versus a loss of $24.9 million in 2008. The 2009 loss is primarily related to environmental charges associated with our Front Royal and Middleport sites and operating and maintenance activities partially offset by recoveries related to our Front Royal site. The 2009 loss also includes charges for legal reserves and expenses related to discontinued operations. The 2008 loss is primarily related to environmental charges associated with our Front Royal and Middleport sites and charges for legal reserves and expenses related to discontinued operations. Discontinued environmental charges include environmental remediation costs at sites of discontinued businesses for which we are responsible for environmental compliance. Net income attributable to FMC stockholders Net income attributable to FMC stockholders decreased to $228.5 million in 2009 compared with $304.6 million in 2008. The decrease was primarily due to lower Industrial Chemicals segment operating profit and significantly higher restructuring and other charges (income). Partially offsetting these decreases were higher profits in our Agricultural Products segment and to a lesser extent, our Specialty Chemicals segment. 37 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2010 and 2009 were $161.5 million and $76.6 million, respectively. We had total debt of $637.9 million and $643.9 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. This included $503.0 million and $588.0 million of long-term debt (excluding current portions of $116.4 million and $22.5 million) at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Short-term debt, which consists of foreign borrowings, decreased to $18.5 million at December 31, 2010 compared to $33.4 million at December 31, 2009. 2009 Senior Notes Offering On November 30, 2009, we issued $300 million aggregate principal amount of 5.20% Senior Notes due 2019. The net proceeds from the offering were used to pay down existing indebtedness under our revolving credit agreements and for general corporate purposes. Domestic Credit Agreement On August 28, 2007, we executed a credit agreement (the Domestic Credit Agreement ), which provided for a five-year, $600 million revolving credit facility. The proceeds from this facility are available for general corporate purposes, including issuing letters of credit up to a $300 million sub-limit. The Domestic Credit Agreement also contains an option under which, subject to certain conditions, we may request an increase in the facility to $1 billion. Loans under the facility bear interest at a floating rate, either a base rate as defined, or the applicable euro currency rate for the relevant term plus an applicable margin. The margin is 0.3 percent per year, subject to adjustment based on the credit rating assigned to our senior unsecured debt. At December 31, 2010, the applicable borrowing rate under our Domestic Credit Agreement was 0.6 percent per annum. We had no borrowings under our Domestic Credit Agreement at December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009. Letters of credit outstanding under the Domestic Credit Agreement totaled $130.4 million and $153.2 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Available funds under the Domestic Credit Agreement were $469.6 million and $446.8 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. European Credit Agreement On December 16, 2005, FMC Finance B.V., our Dutch finance subsidiary, executed a credit agreement (the European Credit Agreement ), which provides for an unsecured revolving credit facility in the amount of 220 million. Borrowings may be denominated in euros or U.S. dollars. FMC and our Dutch finance subsidiary direct parent provide guarantees of amounts due under the European Credit Agreement. On August 13, 2010, we amended this agreement to extend its maturity to August 2012. Loans under the European Credit Agreement bear interest at a euro currency base rate, which for loans denominated in euros is the Euro InterBank Offered Rate, and for loans denominated in dollars is London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ) in each case plus a margin. The applicable margin under our European Credit Agreement is subject to adjustment based on the rating assigned to FMC by each of Moody and S&P. At December 31, 2010, the applicable margin was 1.8 percent and the applicable borrowing rate under the European Credit Agreement was 2.5 percent per annum. At December 31, 2010 and 2009 we had no borrowings, in revolving credit facility borrowings under the European Credit Agreement, resulting in available funds of $289.1 million and $315.4 million, respectively. Among other restrictions, the Domestic Credit Agreement and the European Credit Agreement contain financial covenants applicable to FMC and its consolidated subsidiaries related to leverage (measured as the ratio of debt to adjusted earnings) and interest coverage (measured as the ratio of adjusted earnings to interest expense). Our actual leverage for the four consecutive quarters ended December 31, 2010 was 1.2 which is below the maximum leverage of 3.5. Our actual interest coverage for the four consecutive quarters ended December 31, 2010 was 14.9 which is above the minimum interest coverage of 3.5. We were in compliance with all covenants at December 31, 2010. 38 Table of Contents Statement of Cash Flows Cash provided by operating activities for 2010 was $399.7 million. Income from continuing operations of $218.5 million reflected restructuring and other charges of $151.9 million, of which $81.1 million was for non-cash asset write-downs related to the exit of various facilities announced in 2010 and $46.1 million of other facilities exit costs to be settled in cash, mainly for severance costs and lease obligations. Cash spending on restructuring and other charges in 2010 was $53.4 million. Also included in income from continuing operations was $14.2 million for environmental and remediation at our operating sites, which will be spent in years beyond 2010. Net cash spending on environmental remediation at our operating sites in 2010 was $8.9 million which was recorded against pre-existing reserves. Income from continuing operations is also adjusted for other non-cash items which include stock-based compensation expense and excess tax benefits from share-based compensation. There was a significant increase in excess tax benefits from share-based compensation because we utilized our remaining U.S. federal net operating losses in 2010. See Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K for further discussion on these excess tax benefits. Receivables were a use of cash of $109.9 million due to revenue increases in our businesses, particularly for Agricultural Products sales in Brazil where terms are significantly longer than in the rest of our businesses. Partially offsetting the higher receivables were accrued customer rebates which increased by $33.2 million due to increased sales primarily in our Agricultural Products segment. These rebates are primarily in North America and Brazil and generally settle in the fourth quarter of each year, however, have increased from the prior year due to higher revenues in these areas. Accounts payables also increased as a result of a higher focus on payables management. Accrued pension and other post retirement benefits were a use of cash of $105.2 million which included a voluntary contribution to our U.S. defined benefit plan of $80 million as well as a lump-sum payout of approximately $15 million from our nonqualified pension plan. Cash provided by operating activities for 2009 was $343.5 million. Income from continuing operations of $257.0 million reflected restructuring and other charges of $132.8 million, of which $46.3 million was for non-cash asset write-downs on exit of various facilities during the year and $35.2 million of other facilities exit costs to be settled in cash, mainly for severance costs. Cash spending on restructuring and other charges during 2009 was $37.4 million. Also included in restructuring and other income and charges was $20.2 million for environmental remediation at our operating sites, which will be spent in years beyond 2009. Cash spending on environmental remediation at our operating sites in 2009 was $7.4 million, against pre-existing reserves. Receivables in 2009 were a use of cash of $59.3 million as lower receivables in Industrial Chemicals due to the revenue decline was more than offset by increased receivables in Agricultural Products in Brazil, where sales have grown and terms are significantly longer. Inventories were a source of cash of $35.4 million due to lower inventory costs in Industrial Chemicals, particularly for phosphate rock. Accounts Payable were a use of cash of $71.5 million as the higher cost phosphate rock in payables at the end of 2008 was replaced with lower cost phosphate rock at the end of 2009. Accrued pension and other post retirement benefits was a use of cash of $93.4 million which included a voluntary contribution to our U.S. defined benefit plan of $75 million. Cash provided by operating activities for 2008 was $357.4 million. Income from continuing operations of $346.5 million reflected restructuring and other charges of $49.6 million, of which $37.5 million was for non-cash asset write-downs on exit of various facilities during the year and $14.7 million of other facilities exit costs to be settled in cash, mainly for severance costs. Cash spending on restructuring and other charges during 2008 was $21.3 million. Also included in restructuring and other income and charges was $16.2 million for environmental remediation at our operating sites, which will be spent in years beyond 2008. Cash spending on environmental remediation at our operating sites in 2008 was $13.6 million, against pre-existing reserves. Receivables in 2008 were a use of cash of $99.0 million due to the higher revenue in all of our businesses, particularly in Agricultural Products in Brazil where terms are significantly longer than in rest of our businesses. Inventories were a use of cash of $83.7 million as inventories were built to support the stronger trading levels experienced in 2008 prior to the global economic turndown. Additionally, inventories in Industrial Chemicals increased due to the rising cost of phosphate 39 Table of Contents rock during 2008. Accounts Payable were a source of cash of $52.0 million reflecting the higher inventory levels and phosphate rock in our accounts payable at year end 2008. Accrued pension and other post retirement benefits were a use of cash of $46.8 million, which included a voluntary contribution to our US defined benefit plan of $30 million. Cash required by operating activities of discontinued operations was $45.2 million, $42.0 million and $49.8 million for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The change in 2010 compared to 2009 was due to higher spending on legal proceedings associated with discontinued operations partially offset by lower net environmental spending in 2010. The change in 2009 compared to 2008 was due to lower net environmental spending for discontinued sites in 2009. Discontinued environmental spending was $17.1 million in 2010 compared to $22.1 million in 2009 and $32.2 million in 2008. The remaining discontinued cash outflows primarily represents spending against reserves for legal proceedings associated with discontinued operations. Cash required by investing activities was $154.0 million, $200.7 million and $191.7 million for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The decrease in cash required in 2010 was driven primarily by a reduction in acquisitions and capital expenditures. The increase in cash required in 2009 was driven primarily by significant reduction of proceeds from the sale of the properties and assets during 2009 as compared to 2008 partially offset by reduced spending on acquisitions in 2009. Additionally, capital expenditures in 2009 were approximately $14 million less than the prior year period. Cash required by financing activities was $116.6 million, $77.8 million and $137.5 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The change in 2010 compared to 2009 was due primarily to the repurchases of common stock and lower proceeds from borrowings of long term debt, partially offset by lower repayments under our committed credit facilities and the inclusion of excess tax benefits from share-based compensation. The change in 2009 compared to 2008 was due primarily to the proceeds from our borrowings of long-term debt, a reduction in repurchases of common stock, and a reduction in repayments of long-term debt partially offset by higher repayments under our committed credit facilities. Other potential liquidity needs Our cash needs for 2011 include operating cash requirements, capital expenditures, scheduled mandatory payments of long-term debt, dividend payments, contributions to our pension plans, environmental spending and restructuring. We plan to meet our liquidity needs through available cash, cash generated from operations and borrowings under our committed revolving credit facilities. We continually evaluate our options for divesting real estate holdings and property, plant and equipment that are no longer integral to any of our operating businesses. Projected 2011 capital expenditures are expected to be approximately 15 percent higher than 2010 levels, primarily to increase capacity in BioPolymer, lithium and soda ash. Projected 2011 spending includes approximately $35.0 million of net environmental remediation spending. This spending does not include expected spending of approximately $6.6 million in 2011 on capital projects relating to environmental control facilities. Also, we expect to spend approximately $23.9 million in 2011 for environmental compliance costs, which we will include as a component of costs of sales and services in our consolidated statements of income since these amounts are not covered by established reserves. Capital spending to expand, maintain or replace equipment at our production facilities may trigger requirements for upgrading our environmental controls, which may increase our spending for environmental controls above the foregoing projections. In regard to our U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan ( U.S. Plan ), the markets rebounded significantly in 2009 and 2010, exemplified by the S&P 500 index in the U.S. increasing 26 percent in 2009 and 15 percent in 2010. As a result of higher returns and contributions, our U.S. Plan assets increased from $708.4 million at December 31, 2009 to $842.4 million at December 31, 2010. Our U.S. Plan assets comprise approximately 93 percent of our total plan assets with the difference representing plan assets related to foreign pension plans. We are maintaining the 8.5 percent assumption for the long-term rate of return on plan assets used in 2010 for 2011. In developing the assumption for the long-term rate of return on plan assets for our U.S. Plan, we take into consideration the technical analysis performed by our outside actuaries, 40 Table of Contents including historical market returns, information on the assumption for long-term real returns by asset class, inflation assumptions, and expectations for standard deviation related to these best estimates. We also consider the historical performance of our own plan trust, which earned 15 percent in 2010 and has earned a compound annual rate of return of approximately 11 percent over the last 20 years (which is in excess of comparable market indices for the same period) as well as other factors. Given an actively managed investment portfolio, the expected annual rate of return by asset class for our portfolio, using geometric averaging, and after being adjusted for an estimated inflation rate of approximately 2.5 percent, is between 8.6 percent and 10.3 percent for equities, and between 4.2 percent and 6.3 percent for fixed-income investments, which generates a total expected portfolio return that is in line with our assumptions for the rate of return on assets. In order to reduce future funding volatility, we intend to contribute $55.0 million in 2011, which is in excess of the minimum requirements versus contributions of $80.0 million in 2010 and $75.0 million in 2009. We do not believe that the additional contribution will have a significant negative impact on our current and future liquidity needs. However, a continuation of the volatility of interest rates and negative equity returns under current market conditions may require greater contributions to the Plan in the future. On October 24, 2008, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $250 million of our common stock. At December 31, 2010, $54.8 million remained unused of the 2008 authorization. On February 18, 2011, the Board authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $250 million of our common stock for a total of $304.8 million. The repurchase program does not include a specific timetable or price targets and may be suspended or terminated at any time. Shares may be purchased through open market or privately negotiated transactions at the discretion of management based on its evaluation of market conditions and other factors. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2010, we repurchased 1,874,519 shares under the publicly announced repurchase program for $135.0 million. We also reacquire shares from time to time from employees in connection with the vesting, exercise and forfeiture of awards under our equity compensation plans. On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act was signed into law. Title VII of the Act contains significant changes in the ways derivatives are regulated. Several U.S. government regulatory agencies and departments are charged with developing, largely within 360 days of passage, the many regulations required under the new law. While the exact effects on FMC cannot be known until final regulations are promulgated, we believe the liquidity requirements will be adequately met by the sources available to us. Commitments We provide guarantees to financial institutions on behalf of certain Agricultural Products customers, principally in Brazil, for their seasonal borrowing. The total of these guarantees was $24.1 million and $49.5 million at December 31, 2010, and 2009, respectively, and are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets for each date as Guarantees of vendor financing . The higher level of guarantees at December 31, 2009, compared with December 31, 2010, arose from a greater borrowing need of our Brazilian sugar cane customers in 2009. We guarantee repayment of some of the borrowings of certain foreign affiliates accounted for using the equity method. As of December 31, 2010, and 2009, these guarantees had maximum potential payments of $6.2 million and $5.8 million, respectively. Short-term debt consisted of foreign credit lines at December 31, 2010, and 2009. We provide parent-company guarantees to lending institutions providing credit to our foreign subsidiaries. In connection with our property and asset sales and divestitures, we have agreed to indemnify the buyer for certain liabilities, including environmental contamination and taxes that occurred prior to the date of sale. Our indemnification obligations with respect to these liabilities may be indefinite as to duration and may or may not be subject to a deductible, minimum claim amount or cap. As such, it is not possible for us to predict the likelihood that a claim will be made or to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential loss or range of loss. If triggered, we may be able to recover certain of the indemnity payments from third parties. We have not recorded any specific liabilities for these guarantees. 41 Table of Contents Our total significant committed contracts that we believe will affect cash over the next four years and beyond are as follows: Contractual Commitments Expected Cash Payments by Year 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 & beyond Total (in Millions) Debt maturities (1) $ 134.9 $ 21.6 $ 6.5 $ 32.7 $ 443.3 $ 639.0 Contractual interest (2) 33.2 26.6 25.2 24.6 239.5 349.1 Lease obligations (3) 25.7 22.6 21.9 19.5 48.8 138.5 Certain long-term liabilities (4) 2.1 2.1 2.1 2.1 23.0 31.4 Forward energy and foreign exchange contracts (5) 6.8 6.8 Purchase obligations (6) 49.2 22.4 21.9 1.5 0.8 95.8 Total (7) $ 251.9 $ 95.3 $ 77.6 $ 80.4 $ 755.4 $ 1,206.6 (1) Excluding discounts. (2) Contractual interest is the interest we are contracted to pay on our long-term debt obligations. We had $23.0 million of long-term debt subject to variable interest rates at December 31, 2010. The rate assumed for the variable interest component of the contractual interest obligation was the rate in effect at December 31, 2010. Variable rates are market determined and will fluctuate over time. (3) Before sub-lease rental income. (4) Payments associated with our Ewing research and development facility. (5) At December 31, 2010, the net value of these contracts results in a liability position. (6) Purchase obligations consist of agreements to purchase goods and services that are enforceable and legally binding on us and specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, price provisions and timing of the transaction. We have entered into a number of purchase obligations for the sourcing of materials and energy where take-or-pay arrangements apply. Since the majority of the minimum obligations under these contracts are take-or-pay commitments over the life of the contract as opposed to a year by year take-or-pay, the obligations in the table related to these types of contacts are presented in the earliest period in which the minimum obligation could be payable under these types of contracts. (7) As of December 31, 2010, the liability for uncertain tax positions was $17.3 million and this liability is excluded from the table above. Due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash flows associated with these liabilities, we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and periods in which these liabilities might be paid. Contingencies On January 28, 2005, we and our wholly owned subsidiary Foret received a Statement of Objections from the European Commission concerning alleged violations of competition law in the hydrogen peroxide business in Europe during the period 1994 to 2001. All of the significant European hydrogen peroxide producers also received the Statement of Objections. We and Foret responded to the Statement of Objections in April 2005 and a hearing on the matter was held at the end of June 2005. On May 3, 2006, we received a notice from the European Commission indicating that the European Commission had imposed a fine on us and Foret in the aggregate amount of 25.0 million as a result of alleged violations during the period 1997-1999. In connection with this fine, we recorded an expense of $30.0 million (reflecting then-prevailing exchange rates) in our consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2006. This expense was included as a component of Restructuring and other charges (income) . Both we and Foret have appealed the decision of the European Commission. The Foret appeal was argued before the Court of First Instance on March 4, 2010, but no decision has been rendered. The FMC appeal was argued in May of 2010. During the appeal process, interest accrues on the fine, which as of December 31, 2010, was at a rate of 4.0 percent per annum. We have provided a bank letter of credit in favor of the European Commission to guarantee our payment of the fine and accrued interest. At December 31, 2010, the amount of the letter of credit was 30.5 million (U.S. $41.2 million). In February 2005, putative direct and indirect purchaser class action complaints were filed against six U.S. hydrogen peroxide producers (and certain of their foreign affiliates) in various federal courts alleging violations of antitrust laws. Related cases were also filed in various state courts. In January 2009, FMC reached an agreement to settle with the direct purchaser class for $10 million, with a pro rata credit for opt outs. The $10 million figure was included as a component of 42 Table of Contents Restructuring and other charges (income) in our consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2008. Ten companies (predominantly paper producers) opted out of this class settlement. FMC settled with two of the ten companies for an amount within the opt out credit described above. The remaining eight opt outs filed suit against FMC and, in some cases, Foret. These cases were assigned to the same judge as the class action. FMC motion to dismiss the opt out claims to the extent they were based on foreign purchases was granted on April 1, 2010. FMC has settled the remaining claims of these eight opt outs for an aggregate of $1.7 million which is net of a $0.3 million opt out credit. Another individual opt out case was dismissed following the bankrupt opt out decision to participate in the class settlement. FMC settled the indirect purchaser class claims for $0.25 million. The settlement has been finally approved by the Court, and all remaining state court cases have been dismissed with prejudice. We recorded the $2.0 million as a component of Restructuring and other charges (income) in our consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2010. As a result, all U.S. litigation against FMC regarding alleged price fixing in the hydrogen peroxide industry is now concluded. We still face putative class actions against FMC and five other major hydrogen peroxide producers in provincial courts in Ontario, Quebec and British Columbia under the laws of Canada. Four of the defendants have settled these claims for a total of approximately $20.5 million. On September 28, 2009, the Ontario Superior Court of Justice certified a class of direct and indirect purchasers of hydrogen peroxide. FMC moved for leave to appeal the class certification decision, which was denied in June 2010. The Company intends to defend these cases. Since the proceedings are in the preliminary stages with respect to the merits, we believe an exposure of loss cannot be reasonably estimated. Like hundreds of other industrial companies, we have been named as one of many defendants in asbestos-related personal injury litigation. Most of these cases allege personal injury or death resulting from exposure to asbestos in premises of FMC or to asbestos-containing components installed in machinery or equipment manufactured or sold by discontinued operations. We intend to continue managing these cases in accordance with our historical experience. We have established a reserve for this litigation within our discontinued operations and believe that any exposure of a loss in excess of the established reserve cannot be reasonably estimated. In late June 2004, we were served in a lawsuit captioned Lewis et al v. FMC Corporation , which was filed in United States District Court for the Western District of New York. The suit was brought by thirteen residents of Middleport, New York who allege that we violated certain state and federal environmental laws and seeks injunctive relief and monetary damages for personal injuries and property damage in connection with such alleged violations. A motion for summary was filed by the Company in 2007 and is expected to be decided in 2011. We believe this suit is without merit, and therefore have not established a reserve for it. We have certain other contingent liabilities arising from litigation, claims, performance guarantees and other commitments incident to the ordinary course of business. Based on information currently available and established reserves, the ultimate resolution of our known contingencies, including the matters described in Note 18 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or liquidity. However, there can be no assurance that the outcome of these contingencies will be favorable, and adverse results in certain of these contingencies could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity . Climate Change We have been following legislative and regulatory developments regarding climate change because the regulation of greenhouse gases, depending on their nature and scope, could subject some of our manufacturing operations to additional costs or limits on operations. On December 29, 2009, EPA Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases Rule became effective. This rule requires FMC to collect information regarding greenhouse gas emissions from our large sources and report them beginning in 2011. Our Alkali Chemicals Division mines and processes trona ore into soda ash and related products at our facilities near Green River, Wyoming. This activity constitutes most of FMC greenhouse gas emissions globally. We will report to the EPA under the Greenhouse Gas reporting rule approximately 1.6 million metric tons of direct emissions from these operations for 2010. In addition, two plants in our BioPolymer business will also be required to report emissions above the EPA reporting threshold, but each plant emissions are substantially less than at our Green River facilities, in total less than 0.1 million metric tons. A significant source of greenhouse gas emissions at Green River are process emissions. That is, a significant portion of the greenhouse gases released during the mining and processing of soda ash occurs naturally in the trona ore feedstock. Unlike the situation with energy efficiency, where efficiencies may result in a reduction of greenhouse gases, the amount of greenhouse gases present in the trona ore cannot be reduced. All of the companies 43 Table of Contents producing natural soda ash have such process emissions. Yet, the lower energy intensity of natural soda ash provides a favorable carbon intensity compared with synthetic soda ash produced throughout the rest of the world. Energy use is a major cost component of our Alkali Chemicals business, leading to significant focus on reducing all forms of energy. The Alkali division has continued to make investments to lower energy intensity (e.g. co-generation, solution mining). As one of the division key performance indicators, we measure and review monthly the amount of BTUs/ton of soda ash produced. In 2010, the soda ash business engaged a third party consultant to assist in identifying new methods to reduce energy usage. This effort has proven successful as we have lowered the energy needed per ton of output over the last 6 months and have a management system in place to sustain and build on the methodologies put in place. The Alkali Chemicals Division currently sells products (soda ash, sodium bicarbonate, ground trona) used in environmental scrubbing applications. Federal regulations require utilities and industrial plants to reduce emissions, particularly at coal fired power plants where FMC products are sold. Stiffer regulations are expected to be implemented in the near future (Clean Air Interstate Rule, Maximum Achievable Control Technology and National Ambient Air Quality Standards) that will increase the need for these products. The uncertainty of final climate change legislation will likely lead to existing coal fired utility plants remaining in existence for a longer period of time, sustaining demand for these products. In addition, soda ash is an essential raw material in the production of glass of all kinds. Climate change, energy intensity and alternative forms of energy will drive increased production of new forms of glass (lower emissivity glass, solar panel glass, etc.) and will increase the need for this essential raw material from FMC. The soda ash industry has an interest in assuring that climate change legislation or regulation recognizes the benefits of soda ash (particularly natural soda ash) and the challenges facing this industry in controlling its greenhouse gas emissions. It is not possible at this time to predict whether or when Congress may enact climate change legislation in the United States or what provisions might be included in the final legislation. In the absence of federal climate change legislation, the EPA has moved forward with a finding of endangerment and a promulgated tailoring rule to apply the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) provisions of the Clean Air Act to greenhouse gas emissions. This rule is being challenged in court, and there may be bills introduced in Congress to withdraw EPA authority to regulate greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act while Congress considers enactment of federal legislation. Because of the many variables, it is premature to make any estimate of the costs of complying with un-enacted federal climate change legislation or as yet un-implemented federal regulations in the United States. At this point our U.S. facilities are not subject to any state or regional greenhouse gas regulation that limits or imposes fees on current emissions, and our foreign operations outside of Europe and Canada are not subject to national or local greenhouse gas regulation. Although some of our European and Canadian operations may be subject to greenhouse gas regulation, the cost to these facilities has not been and is not expected to be significant, and effect of European Union and Canadian greenhouse gas regulation has not been and is not expected to be material to FMC. We have considered the potential physical risks to FMC facilities and operations and the indirect consequences of regulation or business trends as a result of potential future climate change. Because of the many variables, not only with respect to the science, but also with respect to the nature and effect of future global climate change regulation itself, it is impossible to predict in any meaningful way what type of property damage or disruptions to our operations or indirect consequences might result from future climate change. Recently Adopted and Issued Accounting Pronouncements and Regulatory Items See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K. 44 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. We have described our accounting policies in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K. We have reviewed these accounting policies, identifying those that we believe to be critical to the preparation and understanding of our consolidated financial statements. We have reviewed with the Audit Committee those accounting policies that we have deemed critical. These policies are central to our presentation of results of operations and financial condition and require management to make estimates and judgments on certain matters. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience, current conditions and other reasonable factors. Environmental obligations We provide for environmental-related obligations when they are probable and amounts can be reasonably estimated. Where the available information is sufficient to estimate the amount of liability, that estimate has been used. Where the information is only sufficient to establish a range of probable liability and no point within the range is more likely than any other, the lower end of the range has been used. Estimated obligations to remediate sites that involve oversight by the United States Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ), or similar government agencies, are generally accrued no later than when a Record of Decision ( ROD ), or equivalent, is issued, or upon completion of a Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study ( RI/FS ), or equivalent, that is submitted by us to the appropriate government agency or agencies. Estimates are reviewed quarterly by our environmental remediation management, as well as by financial and legal management and, if necessary, adjusted as additional information becomes available. The estimates can change substantially as additional information becomes available regarding the nature or extent of site contamination, required remediation methods, and other actions by or against governmental agencies or private parties. Our environmental liabilities for continuing and discontinued operations are principally for costs associated with the remediation and/or study of sites at which we are alleged to have released hazardous substances into the environment. Such costs principally include, among other items, RI/FS, site remediation, costs of operation and maintenance of the remediation plan, fees to outside law firms and consultants for work related to the environmental effort, and future monitoring costs. Estimated site liabilities are determined based upon existing remediation laws and technologies, specific site consultants engineering studies or by extrapolating experience with environmental issues at comparable sites. Included in the environmental reserve balance, other assets balance and disclosure of reasonably possible loss contingencies are amounts from third party insurance policies, which we believe are probable of recovery. Provisions for environmental costs are reflected in income, net of probable and estimable recoveries from named Potentially Responsible Parties ( PRPs ) or other third parties. Such provisions incorporate inflation and are not discounted to their present values. In calculating and evaluating the adequacy of our environmental reserves, we have taken into account the joint and several liability imposed by Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act ( CERCLA ) and the analogous state laws on all PRPs and have considered the identity and financial condition of the other PRPs at each site to the extent possible. We have also considered the identity and financial condition of other third parties from whom recovery is anticipated, as well as the status of our claims against such parties. Although we are unable to forecast the ultimate contributions of PRPs and other third parties with absolute certainty, the degree of uncertainty with respect to each party is taken into account when determining the environmental reserve by adjusting the reserve to reflect the facts and circumstances on a site-by-site basis. Our liability includes our best estimate of the costs expected to be paid before the consideration of any potential recoveries from third parties. We believe that any recorded recoveries related to PRPs are realizable in all material respects. Recoveries are recorded as either an offset in Environmental liabilities, continuing and discontinued or as Other Assets in our consolidated balance sheets in accordance with U.S. accounting literature. See Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K for changes in estimates associated with our environmental obligations. 45 Table of Contents Impairments and valuation of long-lived assets Our long-lived assets include property, plant and equipment and long-term investments, goodwill and intangible assets. We test for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the net book value of these assets may not be recoverable from the estimated undiscounted expected future cash flows expected to result from their use and eventual disposition. In cases where the estimated undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than net book value, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the net book value exceeds the estimated fair value of assets, which is based on discounted cash flows at the lowest level determinable. The estimated cash flows reflect our assumptions about selling prices, volumes, costs and market conditions over a reasonable period of time. We perform an annual impairment test of goodwill in the third quarter. The assumptions used to estimate fair value include our best estimate of future growth rates, discount rates and market conditions over a reasonable period. We performed this test in 2010 and determined that no impairment charge was required. See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K for charges associated with long-lived asset disposal costs and the activity associated with the restructuring reserves. Pensions and other postretirement benefits We provide qualified and nonqualified defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans, as well as postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans to our employees and retirees. The costs (benefits) and obligations related to these benefits reflect key assumptions related to general economic conditions, including interest (discount) rates, healthcare cost trend rates, expected rates of return on plan assets and the rates of compensation increases for employees. The costs (benefits) and obligations for these benefit programs are also affected by other assumptions, such as average retirement age, mortality, employee turnover, and plan participation. To the extent our plans actual experience, as influenced by changing economic and financial market conditions or by changes to our own plans demographics, differs from these assumptions, the costs and obligations for providing these benefits, as well as the plans funding requirements, could increase or decrease. When actual results differ from our assumptions, the difference is typically recognized over future periods. In addition, the unrealized gains and losses related to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations may also affect periodic benefit costs (benefits) in future periods. We use certain calculated values of assets under methods both to estimate the expected rate of return on assets component of pension cost and to calculate our plans funding requirements. The expected rate of return on plan assets is based on a market-related value of assets that recognizes investment gains and losses over a five-year period. We use an actuarial value of assets to determine our plans funding requirements. The actuarial value of assets must be within a certain range, high or low, of the actual market value of assets, and is adjusted accordingly. We select the discount rate used to calculate pension and other postretirement obligations based on a review of available yields on high-quality corporate bonds, including Moody Investors Service, Inc. ( Moody ) Aa-rated Corporate and Industrial bond indices. In selecting the discount rate for 2010, we placed particular emphasis on a yield-curve approach designed by our actuary to derive an appropriate discount rate for computing the present value of the future cash flows associated with our pension and other postretirement obligations taking into consideration both the timing and amount of the cash flows. The specific interest rates supporting the yield curve were derived from calculated returns (yields) from a portfolio of high-quality (Aa-graded or higher) bond investments constructed by our actuary. In developing the assumption for the long-term rate of return on assets for our U.S. Plan, we take into consideration the technical analysis performed by our outside actuaries, including historical market returns, information on the assumption for long-term real returns by asset class, inflation assumptions, and expectations for standard deviation related to these best estimates. We also consider the historical performance of our own plan trust, which has earned a compound annual rate of return of approximately 10.61 percent over the last 20 years (which is in excess of comparable market indices for the same period) as well as other factors which are discussed in Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K. For the sensitivity of our pension costs to incremental changes in assumptions see our discussion below. Sensitivity analysis related to key pension and postretirement benefit assumptions. A one-half percent increase in the assumed discount rate would have decreased pension and other postretirement benefit obligations by $60.7 million and $54.7 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and decreased pension and other postretirement benefit costs by $6.4 million, $3.1 million and $0.5 million for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. A one-half percent decrease in the assumed discount rate would have increased pension and other postretirement benefit 46 Table of Contents obligations by $66.6 million and $59.9 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and increased pension and other postretirement benefit net periodic benefit cost by $6.5 million, $4.5 million and $0.5 million for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. A one-half percent increase in the assumed expected long-term rate of return on plan assets would have decreased pension costs by $4.5 million, $4.2 million and $4.2 million for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. A one-half percent decrease in the assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets would have increased pension costs by $4.5 million, $4.2 million and $4.2 million for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Further details on our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and net periodic benefit costs (benefits) are found in Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K. Income taxes We have recorded a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized. In assessing the need for this allowance, we have considered a number of factors including future taxable income, the jurisdictions in which such income is earned and our ongoing tax planning strategies. In the event that we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made. Similarly, should we conclude that we would be able to realize certain deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made. Additionally, we file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions. The income tax returns for FMC entities taxable in the U.S. and significant foreign jurisdictions are open for examination and adjustment. We assess our income tax positions and record a liability for all years open to examination based upon our evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. For those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. We adjust these liabilities, if necessary, upon the completion of tax audits or changes in tax law. See Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K for additional discussion surrounding income taxes. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors. Dividends On January 20, 2011, we paid dividends aggregating $9.0 million to our shareholders of record as of December 31, 2010. This amount is included in Accrued and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2010. For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, we paid $36.4 million, $36.3 million and $34.4 million in dividends, respectively. Fair Value Measurements See Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K for additional discussion surrounding our fair value measurements. 47 Table of Contents
