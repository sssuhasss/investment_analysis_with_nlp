Our actual results could differ materially from the results contemplated by these forward-looking statements due to various factors, including those discussed in Item 1A and elsewhere in this Form 10-K. Overview and Executive Summary Agilent Technologies Inc. ("we", "Agilent" or the "company"), incorporated in Delaware in May 1999, is a global leader in life sciences, diagnostics and applied chemical markets, providing application focused solutions that includes instruments, software, services and consumables for the entire laboratory workflow. On November 1, 2014, we completed the distribution of 100% of the outstanding common shares of Keysight Technologies, Inc. ("Keysight") to Agilent stockholders who received one share of Keysight common stock for every two shares of Agilent held as of the close of business on the record date, October 22, 2014. The historical results of operations and the financial position of Keysight are included in the consolidated financial statements of Agilent and are reported as discontinued operations within this Form 10-K. For additional information see Note 4, "Discontinued Operations". The results from operations presented within management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are reported for the continuing operations of Agilent. Income taxes are presented on a revised basis for prior periods see Note 2, " Revision of Prior Period Financial Statements". In November 2014, we announced a change in organizational structure designed to better serve our customers. Our life sciences business, excluding the nucleic acid solutions division, together with the chemical analysis business combined to form a new segment called life sciences and applied markets business. Our diagnostics and genomics businesses combined with the nucleic acid solutions division from our life sciences business and became the diagnostics and genomics segment. Finally, the Agilent CrossLab segment was formed from the services and consumables businesses previously part of the life sciences and chemical analysis businesses. Financial reporting under this new structure is included within this report on Form 10-K and historical financial segment information has been recast to conform to this new presentation within our financial statements. On April 30, 2015 we announced that we have completed an agreement with Rigaku, a privately held scientific instrumentation company headquartered in Tokyo, to acquire Agilent's X-ray diffraction (XRD) business, a key manufacturer of single-crystal X-ray instruments for the global chemical crystallography market. The transaction did not have a material impact to our results of operations, statement of financial position or statement of cash flows in the current or prior fiscal periods. On May 19, 2015 we announced that we have completed the acquisition of 100% of the shares of Cartagenia, a leading provider of software and services for clinical genetics and molecular pathology laboratories for 60 million. Cartagenia, provides software solutions for variant assessment and reporting of clinical genomics data from next-generation sequencing and microarrays. The Cartagenia Bench platform enables technicians, laboratory directors and clinicians to visualize, assess and report clinical genetics data in the context of patient information. On November 2, 2015 we announced that we have completed the acquisition of Seahorse Bioscience ("Seahorse"), a leader in providing instruments and assay kits for measuring cell metabolism and bioengergetics for $242 million in cash. Seahorse's 30 Table of Contents technology enables researchers to better understand cell health, function and signaling, and how the cell may be impacted by the introduction of a specific drug, by providing real-time kinetics to unlock essential cellular bioenergetics data. The financial results of Seahorse will be included within Agilent's from the beginning of the first quarter of 2016. Agilent's net revenue of $4,038 million in 2015 was flat when compared to 2014. Foreign currency movements for 2015 had an unfavorable impact of approximately 6 percentage points compared to 2014. Agilent's net revenue of $4,048 million increased 4 percent in 2014 when compared to 2013. The life sciences and applied markets business brings together Agilent's analytical laboratory instrumentation and informatics. Revenue decreased 2 percent in 2015 when compared to 2014. Foreign currency movements had an unfavorable impact of approximately 5 percentage points in 2015 when compared to 2014. In addition, an unfavorable impact on revenue of approximately 2 percentage point in 2015 was largely due to the NMR business which we are exiting. For the year ended October 31, 2015 and excluding the impact of currency movements and the NMR business, our performance within the life sciences business showed consistent revenue growth from sales to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology market partially offset by a decrease in the revenue generated from sales to the life sciences research market. Within applied markets and excluding the impact of currency movements and the NMR business, there was weakness in the chemical and energy markets in the year ended October 31, 2015 when compared to the prior year. Revenue from sales to the life sciences and applied markets business increased 2 percent in 2014 when compared to 2013. For the year ended October 31, 2014 our performance within the life sciences business improved with sales to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology market partially offset by a decrease in the revenue generated from the life sciences research market when compared to the prior year. Within applied markets there was revenue growth from sales to all markets in the year ended October 31, 2014 when compared to the prior year. The diagnostics and genomics business is comprised of three areas of activity. First, we are focused on pathology, companion diagnostics and reagent partnerships. Second, the genomics business includes our arrays, NGS target enrichment and our other genomics solutions. Third, the nucleic acid solutions business manufactures synthetic RNA to be potentially used as active pharmaceutical ingredients. Revenue was flat in 2015 when compared to 2014. Foreign currency movements had an unfavorable impact of approximately 8 percentage points in 2015 when compared to 2014. Excluding the impact of foreign currency movements, growth in revenue from sales to the diagnostics and clinical research market was strong in the year ended October 31, 2015 when compared to the prior year. Revenue increased 5 percent in 2014 when compared to 2013. For the year ended October 31, 2014 our performance within the diagnostics and genomics business improved from sales to the diagnostics and clinical markets when compared to the prior year. The Agilent CrossLab business combines our analytical laboratory services and consumables business. Revenue increased 2 percent in 2015 when compared to 2014. Foreign currency movements had an unfavorable impact of approximately 7 percentage points in 2015 when compared to 2014. Excluding the impact of foreign currency movements there was growth in sales to all key end markets, in particular, the pharmaceutical and biotechnology market in the year ended October 31, 2015 when compared to last year. Within the applied markets revenue in chemical and energy end markets were slower but still reported growth when adjusted for currency movements. Revenue increased 7 percent in 2014 when compared to 2013. Revenue growth from sales to all markets was similar to that of our life sciences and applied markets business in the year ended October 31, 2014 when compared to last year. Net income from continuing operations was $438 million in 2015 compared to net income from continuing operations of $232 million and $225 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively. As of October 31, 2015 and 2014 we had cash and cash equivalents balances of $2,003 million and $2,218 million, respectively. On November 22, 2013 we announced that our board of directors had authorized a share repurchase program. The existing program is designed to reduce or eliminate dilution resulting from issuance of stock under the company's employee equity incentive programs to target maintaining a weighted average share count of approximately 335 million diluted shares. For the years ended October 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 we repurchased 6 million shares for $267 million, 4 million shares for $200 million and 20 million shares for $900 million, respectively. All such shares and related costs are held as treasury stock and accounted for using the cost method. On May 28, 2015 we announced that our board of directors had approved a new share repurchase program (the "2015 repurchase program"). The 2015 share repurchase program authorizes the purchase of up to $1.14 billion of our common stock through and including November 1, 2018. The 2015 share repurchase program will commence, at the option of the company, on either November 1, 2015, or the date on which we complete the purchase of the remaining $98 million for a total of $365 million of common stock in fiscal 2015 under the existing stock repurchase program. Upon commencement, the 2015 share repurchase program replaces our existing stock repurchase program, which authorized the repurchase of shares to reduce or 31 Table of Contents eliminate share dilution from equity programs. The 2015 repurchase program does not require the company to acquire a specific number of shares and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. For the years ended October 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 cash dividends of $133 million, $176 million and $156 million were paid on the company's outstanding common stock, respectively. On November 19, 2015, we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.115 per share of common stock, or approximately $38 million which will be paid on January 27, 2016 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on January 5, 2016. The timing and amounts of any future dividends are subject to determination and approval by our board of directors. In 2015 we introduced an improvement initiative to transform a number of the company's operations. These actions produced savings of approximately $40 million in total in 2015. Looking forward, we expect to focus on organic growth and expand the operating margin of our businesses. In addition, we anticipate returning a significant proportion of our cash flow to shareholders through our dividend and share repurchase programs. The unfavorable effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates has decreased revenue by approximately 6 percentage points for the year ended October 31, 2015. Costs and expenses, incurred in local currency, were subject to the favorable effects due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates reducing our overall net exposure. The impact of foreign currency exchange rates movements can be positive or negative in any period and is calculated by applying the prior period foreign currency exchange rates to the current year period. We anticipate that changes in foreign currency exchange rates will continue to have an unfavorable impact on our performance for the near future. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable. Although these estimates are based on management's best knowledge of current events and actions that may impact the company in the future, actual results may be different from the estimates. An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur could materially change the financial statements. Our critical accounting policies are those that affect our financial statements materially and involve difficult, subjective or complex judgments by management. Those policies are revenue recognition, inventory valuation, share-based compensation, retirement and post-retirement plan assumptions, valuation of goodwill and purchased intangible assets, restructuring and accounting for income taxes. Revenue recognition. We enter into agreements to sell products (hardware or software), services, and other arrangements (multiple element arrangements) that include combinations of products and services. Revenue from product sales, net of trade discounts and allowances, is recognized provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the price is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. Delivery is considered to have occurred when title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer. Revenue is reduced for estimated product returns, when appropriate. For sales that include customer-specified acceptance criteria, revenue is recognized after the acceptance criteria have been met. For products that include installation, if the installation meets the criteria to be considered a separate element, product revenue is recognized upon delivery, and recognition of installation revenue occurs when the installation is complete. Otherwise, neither the product nor the installation revenue is recognized until the installation is complete. Revenue from services is deferred and recognized over the contractual period or as services are rendered and accepted by the customer. We allocate revenue to each element in our multiple-element arrangements based upon their relative selling prices. We determine the selling price for each deliverable based on a selling price hierarchy. The selling price for a deliverable is based on our vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE) if available, third-party evidence (TPE) if VSOE is not available, or estimated selling price (ESP) if neither VSOE nor TPE is available. Revenue from the sale of software products that are not required to deliver the tangible product's essential functionality are accounted for under software revenue recognition rules. Revenue allocated to each element is then recognized when the basic revenue recognition criteria for that element have been met. The amount of product revenue recognized is affected by our judgments as to whether an arrangement includes multiple elements. We use VSOE of selling price in the selling price allocation in all instances where it exists. VSOE of selling price for products and services is determined when a substantial majority of the selling prices fall within a reasonable range when sold separately. TPE of selling price can be established by evaluating largely interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone sales to similarly situated customers. As our products contain a significant element of proprietary technology and the solution offered differs substantially from that of competitors, it is difficult to obtain the reliable standalone competitive pricing 32 Table of Contents necessary to establish TPE. ESP represents the best estimate of the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a standalone basis. We determine ESP for a product or service by using historical selling prices which reflect multiple factors including, but not limited to customer type, geography, market conditions, competitive landscape, gross margin objectives and pricing practices. The determination of ESP is made through consultation with and approval by management. We may modify or develop new pricing practices and strategies in the future. As these pricing strategies evolve changes may occur in ESP. The aforementioned factors may result in a different allocation of revenue to the deliverables in multiple element arrangements, which may change the pattern and timing of revenue recognition for these elements but will not change the total revenue recognized for the arrangement. Inventory valuation. We assess the valuation of our inventory on a periodic basis and make adjustments to the value for estimated excess and obsolete inventory based upon estimates about future demand and actual usage. Such estimates are difficult to make under most economic conditions. The excess balance determined by this analysis becomes the basis for our excess inventory charge. Our excess inventory review process includes analysis of sales forecasts, managing product rollovers and working with manufacturing to maximize recovery of excess inventory. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional write-downs may be required. If actual market conditions are more favorable than anticipated, inventory previously written down may be sold to customers, resulting in lower cost of sales and higher income from operations than expected in that period. In the fourth quarter of 2014, Agilent announced it is exiting the NMR business, and as a result, recorded an excess inventory charge of $30 million. For the year ended October 31, 2015 additional excess inventory charges were recorded in respect of the exiting of the NMR business of $4 million. Share-based compensation. We account for share-based awards in accordance with the authoritative guidance. Under the authoritative guidance, share-based compensation expense is primarily based on estimated grant date fair value and is recognized on a straight line basis. The fair value of share-based awards for employee stock option awards was estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Shares granted under the Long-Term Performance Program ("LTPP") were valued using the Monte Carlo simulation model. The estimated fair value of restricted stock unit awards is determined based on the market price of Agilent's common stock on the date of grant adjusted for expected dividend yield. The Employee Stock Purchase Plan ("ESPP") allows eligible employees to purchase shares of our common stock at 85 percent of the fair market value at the purchase date. Both the Black-Scholes and Monte Carlo simulation fair value models require the use of highly subjective and complex assumptions, including the option's expected life and the price volatility of the underlying stock. Due to the separation of Keysight on November 1, 2014, expected volatility for grants of options in 2015 was based on a 5.5 year average historical stock price volatility of a group of our peer companies. We believe our historical volatility prior to the separation of Keysight is no longer relevant. For the grants of options prior to November 1, 2014, the expected stock price volatility assumption was determined using the historical volatility of Agilent stock options over the most recent historical period equivalent to the expected life of 5.8 years. A 10 percent increase in our historical estimated volatility from 28 percent to 38 percent for our most recent employee stock option grant would generally increase the value of an award and the associated compensation cost by approximately 31 percent if no other factors were changed. For the grants awarded under the 2009 stock plan after November 1, 2010, we increased the period available to retirement eligible employees to exercise their options from three years at retirement date to the full contractual term of ten years. In developing our estimated life of our employee stock options of 5.8 years for 2013 to 2014, we considered the historical option exercise behavior of our executive employees who were granted the majority of the options in the annual grants, which we believe is representative of future behavior. See Note 5, "Share-based Compensation," to the consolidated financial statements for more information. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share-based awards represent our best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable and appropriate, changes in assumptions could materially impact our reported financial results. Retirement and post-retirement benefit plan assumptions. Retirement and post-retirement benefit plan costs are a significant cost of doing business. They represent obligations that will ultimately be settled sometime in the future and therefore are subject to estimation. Pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employees' average expected future service to Agilent based on the terms of the plans and investment and funding decisions. To estimate the impact of these future payments and our decisions concerning funding of these obligations, we are required to make assumptions using actuarial concepts within the framework of accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. Two critical assumptions are the discount rate and the expected long-term return on plan assets. Other important assumptions include, expected future salary increases, expected future increases to benefit payments, expected retirement dates, employee turnover, retiree mortality rates, and portfolio composition. We evaluate these assumptions at least annually. The discount rate is used to determine the present value of future benefit payments at the measurement date - October 31 33 Table of Contents for both U.S. and non-U.S. plans. For 2014 and 2015, the U.S. discount rates were based on the results of matching expected plan benefit payments with cash flows from a hypothetically constructed bond portfolio. In 2015, discount rates for the U.S. Plans remained relatively flat from the previous year. For 2015 and 2014, the discount rate for non-U.S. plans was generally based on published rates for high quality corporate bonds and in 2015, remained the same or decreased from the previous year. If we changed our discount rate by 1 percent, the impact would be $5 million on U.S. pension expense and $12 million on non-U.S. pension expense. Lower discount rates increase present values and subsequent year pension expense; higher discount rates decrease present values and subsequent year pension expense. The company uses alternate methods of amortization as allowed by the authoritative guidance which amortizes the actuarial gains and losses on a consistent basis for the years presented. For U.S. Plans, gains and losses are amortized over the average future working lifetime. For most Non-U.S. Plans and U.S. Post-Retirement Benefit Plans, gains and losses are amortized using a separate layer for each year's gains and losses. The expected long-term return on plan assets is estimated using current and expected asset allocations as well as historical and expected returns. Plan assets are valued at fair value. If we changed our estimated return on assets by 1 percent, the impact would be $3 million on U.S. pension expense and $8 million on non-U.S. pension expense. For 2015, actual return on assets was below expectations which, along with contributions during the year, increased next year pension cost as well as resulting in a degradation of the funded status at year end. The net periodic pension and post-retirement benefit costs recorded in continuing operations were $26 million in 2015, $15 million in 2014, and $36 million in 2013. Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets. Under the authoritative guidance we have the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary. The accounting standard gives an entity the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether performing the two-step test is necessary. If an entity believes, as a result of its qualitative assessment, that it is more-likely-than-not (i.e. greater than 50% chance) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the quantitative impairment test will be required. Otherwise, no further testing will be required. The guidance includes examples of events and circumstances that might indicate that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying amount. These include macro-economic conditions such as deterioration in the entity's operating environment or industry or market considerations; entity-specific events such as increasing costs, declining financial performance, or loss of key personnel; or other events such as an expectation that a reporting unit will be sold or a sustained decrease in the stock price on either an absolute basis or relative to peers. If it is determined, as a result of the qualitative assessment, that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the provisions of authoritative guidance require that we perform a two-step impairment test on goodwill. In the first step, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. The second step (if necessary) measures the amount of impairment by applying fair-value-based tests to the individual assets and liabilities within each reporting unit. As defined in the authoritative guidance, a reporting unit is an operating segment, or one level below an operating segment. We aggregate components of an operating segment that have similar economic characteristics into our reporting units. In fiscal year 2015, we assessed goodwill impairment for our three reporting units which consisted of three segments: life sciences and applied markets, diagnostics and genomics and Agilent CrossLab. Due to the new segment structure in November 2014 we performed a quantitative test for goodwill impairment of the three reporting units, as of September 30, 2015. Based on the results of our testing, the fair value of these reporting units are greater than their respective carrying values. Each quarter we review the events and circumstances to determine if goodwill impairment is indicated. There was no impairment of goodwill during the years ended October 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. Purchased intangible assets consist primarily of acquired developed technologies, proprietary know-how, trademarks, and customer relationships and are amortized using the best estimate of the asset's useful life that reflect the pattern in which the economic benefits are consumed or used up or a straight-line method ranging from 6 months to 15 years. In-process research and development ("IPR&D") is initially capitalized at fair value as an intangible asset with an indefinite life and assessed for impairment thereafter. When the IPR&D project is complete, it is reclassified as an amortizable purchased intangible asset and is amortized over its estimated useful life. If an IPR&D project is abandoned, Agilent will record a charge for the value of the related intangible asset to Agilent's condensed consolidated statement of operations in the period it is abandoned. Agilent's indefinite-lived intangible assets are IPR&D intangible assets. The accounting guidance allows a qualitative approach for testing indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, similar to the issued impairment testing guidance for goodwill and allows the option to first assess qualitative factors (events and circumstances) that could have affected the significant inputs used in determining the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not (i.e. greater than 50% chance) that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. An organization may choose to bypass the qualitative assessment for any indefinite-lived intangible asset in any period and proceed directly to calculating its fair value. We performed a qualitative test for impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets as of September 30, 2015. Based on the results of our qualitative 34 Table of Contents testing, we believe that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of these indefinite-lived intangible assets is greater than their respective carrying values. Each quarter we review the events and circumstances to determine if impairment of indefinite-lived intangible asset is indicated. In the years ended October 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we recorded an impairment of $3 million, $4 million and zero, respectively due to the cancellation of certain IPR&D projects. In addition, in the year ended October 31, 2014, we also recorded $12 million of impairment of other intangibles due to the exit of our NMR business. Restructuring and exit of NMR business. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014, we made the decision to cease the manufacture and sale of our nuclear magnetic resonance ( NMR ) product line within our life sciences and applied markets segment. The main components of expenses are related to workforce reductions, assets impairments and write-downs and special charges to inventory, which mainly relates to exiting of one of our businesses. Workforce reduction charges are accrued when payment of benefits that the employees are entitled to becomes probable and the amounts can be estimated. We have also assessed the recoverability of our long-lived assets, by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted future cash flows. Asset impairments primarily consist of property, plant and equipment and are based on an estimate of the amounts and timing of future cash flows related to the expected future remaining use and ultimate sale or disposal of buildings and equipment net of costs to sell. The charges related to inventory include estimated future inventory disposal payments that we are contractually obliged to make to our suppliers and inventory written-down to net realizable value. If the amounts and timing of cash flows from restructuring activities are significantly different from what we have estimated, the actual amount of restructuring and asset impairment charges could be materially different, either higher or lower, than those we have recorded. Accounting for income taxes. We must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits, benefits and deductions, and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes, as well as interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions. Significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period. Significant management judgment is also required in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part. When it is more-likely-than-not that all or some portion of specific deferred tax assets such as net operating losses or foreign tax credit carryforwards will not be realized, a valuation allowance must be established for the amount of the deferred tax assets that cannot be realized. We consider all available positive and negative evidence on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis when assessing whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable. We consider evidence such as our past operating results, the existence of losses in recent years and our forecast of future taxable income. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 we released the valuation allowance for the majority of our U.S. deferred tax assets. At October 31, 2015, we continue to recognize a valuation allowance for certain U.S. state and foreign deferred tax assets. We intend to maintain a valuation allowance in these jurisdictions until sufficient positive evidence exists to support its reversal. We have not provided for all U.S. federal income and foreign withholding taxes on the undistributed earnings of some of our foreign subsidiaries because we intend to reinvest such earnings indefinitely. Should we decide to remit this income to the U.S. in a future period, our provision for income taxes will increase materially in that period. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax law and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions. Although the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes the use of a recognition and measurement model, the determination of whether an uncertain tax position has met those thresholds will continue to require significant judgment by management. In accordance with the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, for all U.S. and other tax jurisdictions, we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and interest will be due. The ultimate resolution of tax uncertainties may differ from what is currently estimated, which could result in a material impact on income tax expense. If our estimate of income tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, a further charge to expense would be required. If events occur and the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. We include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes on the consolidated statements of operations. As a part of our accounting for business combinations, intangible assets are recognized at fair values and goodwill is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net estimated fair values of assets acquired. Impairment charges associated with goodwill are generally not tax deductible and will result in an increased effective income tax rate in the period that any impairment is recorded. Amortization expenses associated with acquired intangible assets are generally not tax deductible and therefore deferred tax liabilities have been recorded for non-deductible amortization expenses as a part of the accounting for business combinations. 35 Table of Contents Adoption of New Pronouncements See Note 3, "New Accounting Pronouncements," to the consolidated financial statements for a description of new accounting pronouncements. Exit of NMR Business During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014, we made the decision to cease the manufacture and sale of our nuclear magnetic resonance ( NMR ) product line within our life sciences and applied markets segment. The exit of the NMR business was primarily due to the lack of growth and profitability of the product line. These actions involved severance and other personnel costs related to the workforce reduction of approximately 300 employees primarily located in the United Kingdom and California and non-cash charges related to intangible asset impairments and other asset write-downs including inventory. After including employee reductions due to attrition and the application to open positions and acceptance of employment within the company of some employees previously affected, we have approximately 30 employees that are pending termination under the above actions as of October 31, 2015. We expect to complete these restructuring activities by early fiscal 2016. For the year ended October 31, 2015, the exit of the NMR business has positively impacted our operating profit by $15 million. As of October 31, 2015, approximately $15 million was paid to date under these restructuring activities. We will continue to provide service support to the NMR installed base. Foreign Currency Our revenues, costs and expenses, and monetary assets and liabilities are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our global operating and financing activities. The unfavorable effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates has decreased revenue by approximately 6 percentage points for the year ended October 31, 2015. Costs and expenses, incurred in local currency, were subject to the favorable effects due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates for the year ended October 31, 2015, reducing our overall net exposure. The impact of foreign currency exchange rates movements can be positive or negative in any period and is calculated by applying the prior period foreign currency exchange rates to the current year period. We hedge revenues, expenses and balance sheet exposures that are not denominated in the functional currencies of our subsidiaries on a short term and anticipated basis. We do experience some fluctuations within individual lines of the condensed consolidated statement of operations and balance sheet because our hedging program is not designed to offset the currency movements in each category of revenues, expenses, monetary assets and liabilities. Our hedging program is designed to hedge currency movements on a relatively short-term basis (up to a rolling twelve month period). Therefore, we are exposed to currency fluctuations over the longer term. To the extent that we are required to pay for all, or portions, of an acquisition price in foreign currencies, Agilent may enter into foreign exchange contracts to reduce the risk that currency movements will impact the U.S. dollar cost of the transaction.

Increases in total gross margins for the year ended October 31, 2015 were the result of lower intangible asset amortization, favorable product mix and improved manufacturing efficiencies partially offset by the impact of unfavorable currency movements and wage increases. Total gross margins for the year ended October 31, 2014 were flat when compared to prior year. Total gross margins for the year ended October 31, 2014 were impacted by favorable product mix offset by higher regulatory costs to address an FDA warning letter, which is now lifted and wage increases. Total operating margins increased 3 percentage points for the year ended October 31, 2015, when compared to last year. Operating margins improved due to increased gross margins and reduced expenses on lower revenue compared to last year. Total operating margins increased 1 percentage point for the year ended October 31, 2014, when compared to last year. In 2014 there were higher costs as a result of the exit from the NMR business together with some pre separation expenses associated with the separation of Keysight. Gross inventory charges, included in continuing operations, were $30 million in 2015, $46 million in 2014 and $27 million in 2013. Sales of previously written down inventory, included in continuing operations, were $13 million in 2015, $8 million in 2014 and $6 million in 2013. Our research and development efforts focus on potential new products and product improvements covering a wide variety of technologies, none of which is individually significant to our operations. We conduct three types of research and development: basic research, foundation technologies and life sciences. Our research seeks to improve on various technical competencies in software, systems and solutions, life sciences and diagnostics. In each of these research fields, we conduct research that is focused on specific product development for release in the short-term as well as other research that is intended to be the foundation for future products over a longer time-horizon. Some of our product development research is designed to improve products already in production, focus on major new product releases, and develop new product segments for the future. Due to the breadth of research and development projects across all of our businesses, there are a number of drivers of this expense. We remain committed to invest significantly in research and development and have focused our development efforts on key strategic opportunities to align our business with available markets and position ourselves to capture market share. Research and development expenses decreased 8 percent for the year ended October 31, 2015 when compared with last year. R&D expenditure decreased due to the impact of foreign currency movements, savings from the exit from the NMR business and transformation initiatives, offset by wage increases. Research and development expenses increased 6 percent for the year ended October 31, 2014 when compared with last year. R&D expenditure increased due to continued investment in next generation products and expanding our product portfolios. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 1 percent in 2015 compared to 2014. There were increases in expenditure mostly due to the impact of wage increases, higher commissions and costs associated with business improvement and transformation initiatives more than offset by favorable foreign currency movements and the decline in NMR expenses due to the exiting of that business together with a decrease in pre separation expenses related to the separation of Keysight. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 1 percent in 2014 compared to 2013. Selling, general and administrative expenditure increased mostly due to the impact of wage increases and higher commissions. Interest expense for the years ended October 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $66 million, $110 million and $107 million, respectively, and relates to the interest charged on our senior notes offset by the amortization of deferred gains recorded upon 38 Table of Contents termination of interest rate swap contracts. The decrease in interest expense in 2015 compared with 2014 and 2013 is due to debt redemptions as part of the debt repositioning as a result of the separation of the Keysight business. At October 31, 2015, our headcount was approximately 11,800 compared to 11,900 in 2014. Other income (expense), net For the year ended October 31, 2015 other income (expense), net includes $25 million of income in respect of the provision of certain IT and site service costs to, and lease income from, Keysight. The costs associated with these services are reported within income from operations. Agilent expects to receive lease income and site service income from Keysight over the next 4-5 years of approximately $13 million per year. For the year ended October 31, 2014 other income (expense) net, included a net loss on the early redemption of senior notes of $89 million. Income Taxes Years Ended October 31, 2015 2014 2013 (in millions) Provision (benefit) for income taxes $ 42 $ (3 ) $ 68 For 2015, the company effective tax rate from continuing operations was 8.7 percent. The income tax expense from continuing operations was $42 million. The income tax provision from continuing operations for the year ended October 31, 2015 included net discrete tax benefits of $55 million. The net discrete tax benefit for the year ended October 31, 2015 included $32 million of net tax benefit primarily due to the settlement of an Internal Revenue Service ( IRS) audit in the U.S. and the recognition of tax expense related to the repatriation of dividends to the U.S. The remaining $23 million net tax benefit for the year ended October 31, 2015 included $16 million of tax benefit related to the de-registration of certain foreign branches and statutue of limitations lapses, $6 million of tax benefit for the extension of the U.S. research and development tax credit attributable to the company's prior fiscal year and $1 million of other discrete benefits. For 2014, the company's effective tax rate from continuing operations was (1.3) percent. The income tax benefit from continuing operations was $3 million. The income tax benefit for the year ended October 31, 2014 included a net discrete benefit of $33 million primarily due to the settlement of an Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") audit in the U.S. and the recognition of tax expense related to the repatriation of dividends. For 2013, the effective tax rate from continuing operations was 23.4 percent. The 23.4 percent effective tax rate is lower than the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to the mix of earnings in non-U.S. jurisdictions taxed at lower statutory rates; in particular Singapore where we enjoy tax holidays. Agilent enjoys tax holidays in several different jurisdictions, most significantly in Singapore. The tax holidays provide lower rates of taxation on certain classes of income and require various thresholds of investments and employment or specific types of income in those jurisdictions. The tax holidays are due for renewal between 2016 and 2023. As a result of the incentives, the impact of the tax holidays decreased income taxes by $65 million, $27 million, and $44 million in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. The benefit of the tax holidays on net income per share (diluted) was approximately $0.19, $0.08, and $0.13 in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. In accordance with the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, for all U.S. and other tax jurisdictions, we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and interest will be due. If our estimate of income tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, a further charge to expense would be required. If events occur and the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. We include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes on the consolidated statements of operations. On November 1, 2014, Agilent transferred deferred tax assets of $237 million, deferred tax liabilities of $37 million, current income tax payable of $40 million, and other long-term liabilities related to uncertain tax positions totaling $8 million to Keysight as part of its separation from Agilent. A current prepaid income tax asset of $19 million and long-term prepaid income tax asset of $3 million related to sales of intercompany assets was also transferred to Keysight upon separation from Agilent. In addition, 39 Table of Contents for the year ended October 31, 2015, a $6 million return to provision adjustment for Keysight associated with bonus depreciation was recognized through retained earnings. In the U.S., tax years remain open back to the year 2012 for federal income tax purposes and the year 2000 for significant states. On September 22, 2015, we reached an agreement with the IRS for the tax years 2008 through 2011. We expect to make a payment of approximately $9 million as part of closing the exam. As a result, in 2015 we reclassified a portion of other long-term liabilities to other accrued liabilities related to uncertain tax positions of continuing operations that we expect to pay within the next twelve months. This amount is partially offset by a prepaid tax account of approximately $3 million that the IRS is allowing as an offset to the $12 million in incremental taxes. The settlement resulted in the recognition, within the continuing operations, of previously unrecognized tax benefits of $119 million, offset by a tax liability on foreign distributions of approximately $99 million principally related to the repatriation of foreign earnings. On January 29, 2014, we reached an agreement with the IRS for the tax years 2006 through 2007. The settlement resulted in the recognition, within the continuing operations, of previously unrecognized tax benefits of $111 million, offset by a tax liability on foreign distributions of approximately $75 million principally related to the repatriation of foreign earnings. In other major jurisdictions where the company conducts business, the tax years generally remain open back to the year 2003. With these jurisdictions and the U.S., it is reasonably possible that there could be significant changes to our unrecognized tax benefits in the next twelve months due to either the expiration of a statute of limitation or a tax audit settlement which will be partially offset by an anticipated tax liability related to unremitted foreign earnings, where applicable. Given the number of years and numerous matters that remain subject to examination in various tax jurisdictions, management is unable to estimate the range of possible changes to the balance of our unrecognized tax benefits. On July 27, 2015, the U.S. Tax Court issued an opinion in Altera Corp. v. Commissioner related to the treatment of stock-based compensation expense in an intercompany cost-sharing arrangement. A final decision was entered by the U.S. Tax Court on December 1, 2015. At this time, the U.S. Department of the Treasury has not withdrawn the requirement from its regulations to include stock-based compensation. The I.R.S. has the right to appeal the U.S. Tax Court decision. We concluded that no adjustment to our consolidated financial statements is appropriate at this time due to the uncertainties with respect to the ultimate resolution of this case. Segment Overview In November 2014, we announced a change in organizational structure designed to better serve our customers. Our life sciences business, excluding the nucleic acid solutions division, together with the chemical analysis business combined to form a new segment called life sciences and applied markets business. Our diagnostics and genomics businesses combined with the nucleic acid solutions division from our life sciences business and became the diagnostics and genomics segment. Finally, the Agilent CrossLab segment was formed from the services and consumables businesses previously part of the life sciences and chemical analysis businesses. Financial reporting under this new structure is included within this report on Form 10-K and historical financial segment information has been recast to conform to this new presentation within our financial statements. Life Sciences and Applied Markets Our life sciences and applied markets business provides application-focused solutions that include instruments and software that enable customers to identify, quantify and analyze the physical and biological properties of substances and products, as well as enable customers in the clinical and life sciences research areas to interrogate samples at the molecular level.

Foreign currency movements for 2015 had an unfavorable impact of 5 percentage points on revenue growth when compared to the same period last year. Geographically, revenue grew 4 percent in the Americas with a 3 percentage point unfavorable currency impact, grew 2 percent in Asia Pacific excluding Japan with a 1 percentage point unfavorable currency impact, declined 8 percent in Europe with a 10 percentage point unfavorable currency impact and declined 20 percent in Japan with a 13 percentage point unfavorable currency impact. Double digit revenue growth in the pharmaceutical market helped drive the revenue growth in the Americas, but was partially offset by declines in the life science and research market due to reductions in academia and government spending. In Europe, our pharmaceutical market revenue growth was not enough to offset declines in revenue from our life science and research market and softness in applied markets. Product revenue results were led by solid demand across the entire product folio, offset by decline in NMR revenue reducing overall growth by 2 percentage points. Life science and applied markets business revenue in 2014 increased 2 percent compared to 2013. Product revenue results in 2014 were led by growth in GCMS and spectroscopy, and partially offset by declines in LCMS and NMR. End market performance reflected mixed growth across markets in 2015. Our pharmaceutical and biotechnology market revenue growth was strong, and driven by technology refreshes. Larger pharmaceutical companies, continue to upgrade to the latest technologies and help drive revenue growth in this market. In life science research, reduced budgets and delayed spending on capital equipment from government entities, led to a decline in revenue in this market segment. Applied market revenue growth was weaker primarily due to the revenue from the chemical and energy market where lower oil prices have reduced capital spending. Excluding currency movements and the NMR business, environmental decreased when compared to last year as weakness in the US oil and gas markets is now spreading to related environmental testing markets. Sales to the food market were down slightly when compared to last year excluding currency movements and the NMR business. Revenue growth in 2014 was led by strong pharmaceutical sales and moderate revenue growth in applied markets, partially offset by a reduction in revenue from the life science and research markets compared to the prior year. Looking forward we are optimistic about continued growth from pharmaceutical sales and the technology replacement business from our strong portfolio offering. While low spending levels in life science research and reduced chemical and energy spending continue to be a concern, we continue to see opportunities for customers buying replacement instruments and we will keep strengthening our product and technology portfolio accordingly. Gross Margin and Operating Margin The following table shows the life sciences and applied markets business' margins, expenses and income from operations for 2015 versus 2014 , and 2014 versus 2013 .

Looking forward, we expect strength in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology markets will continue to offset weakness in the chemical and energy markets in the near term. The drivers of organic revenue growth in the short-term will be our commitment to bringing innovative solutions to market and our focus on expanding the partnerships we have with our customers. Our launch of the Agilent CrossLab brand promise is beginning to help us communicate the value we bring to our customers, and we are optimistic that this will translate into continued long-term growth. We will also remain committed to fiscal discipline by optimizing gross margins across all our product lines. Gross Margin and Operating Margin The following table shows the Agilent CrossLab business's margins, expenses and income from operations for 2015 versus 2014 and 2014 versus 2013 . Years Ended October 31, 2015 over 2014 Change 2014 over 2013 Change 2015 2014 2013 Total gross margin 49.6 % 48.5 % 48.7 % 1 ppt Operating margin 22.5 % 23.0 % 24.4 % (1) ppt (1) ppt (in millions) Research and development $ 46 $ 45 $ 31 3% 45% Selling, general and administrative $ 315 $ 287 $ 266 10% 8% Income from operations $ 299 $ 301 $ 299 (1)% 1% 44 Table of Contents Gross margins increased by 1 percentage point in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to the favorable currency hedging gains recognized in 2015, which were partially offset by higher logistical costs. Gross margins remained flat in 2014 compared to 2013. Research and development expenses increased 3 percent in 2015 when compared to 2014, due to higher project expenses and wage increases. Research and development expenses increased 45 percent in 2014 compared to 2013, due to increased investment into expanding our biocolumn and LC column product portfolio. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 10 percent in 2015 compared to 2014, due to the increase in allocated infrastructure costs following our separation of Keysight and wage increases. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 8 percent in 2014 compared to 2013, due to higher field selling costs and higher infrastructure expenses. Operating margins declined 1 percentage point in 2015 compared to 2014, due to the increase in allocated infrastructure costs following our separation of Keysight, which were partially offset by the favorable currency hedging gains recognized in 2015. Operating margins decreased 1 percentage point in 2014 compared to 2013, due to the higher infrastructure expenses. Income from Operations Income from operations in 2015 decreased by $2 million or 1 percent compared to 2014 on a revenue increase of $23 million. Income from operations in 2014 increased by $2 million or 1 percent compared to 2013 on a revenue increase of $83 million, a 3 percent year-over-year operating margin incremental. Financial Condition Liquidity and Capital Resources Our financial position as of October 31, 2015 consisted of cash and cash equivalents of $2,003 million as compared to $2,218 million as of October 31, 2014, which excludes $810 million of cash and cash equivalents held by Keysight. On November 1, 2014, we completed the distribution of 100% of the outstanding common shares of Keysight to Agilent stockholders who received one share of Keysight common stock for every two shares of Agilent held as of the close of business on the record date, October 22, 2014. The separation agreement provided that prior to the distribution, Keysight make a cash distribution to Agilent in an amount equal to $900 million. The distribution of such cash to Agilent was intended to be a return of capital to Agilent that ensures that Keysight had approximately $700 million of total cash immediately following distribution. For the year ended October 31 2015, we transferred a net amount of $734 million to Keysight. As of October 31, 2015, approximately $1,780 million of our cash and cash equivalents is held outside of the U.S. in our foreign subsidiaries. Most of the amounts held outside of the U.S. could be repatriated to the U.S. but, under current law, would be subject to U.S. federal and state income taxes, less applicable foreign tax credits. Agilent has accrued for U.S. federal and state tax liabilities on the earnings of its foreign subsidiaries except when the earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested outside of the U.S. Repatriation could result in additional material U.S. federal and state income tax payments in future years. We utilize a variety of funding strategies in an effort to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed. We believe our cash and cash equivalents, cash generated from operations, and ability to access capital markets and credit lines will satisfy, for at least the next twelve months, our liquidity requirements, both globally and domestically, including the following: working capital needs, capital expenditures, business acquisitions, stock repurchases, cash dividends, contractual obligations, commitments, principal and interest payments on debt, and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations. Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $491 million in 2015 as compared to $711 million provided in 2014 and $1,152 million provided in 2013. For the years ended 2014 and 2013, net cash provided by operating activities included the cash provided by Keysight operating activities. We paid approximately $129 million of net taxes in 2015, as compared to net $131 million in taxes in 2014 and net $110 million in 2013. Income taxes, including those paid for the Keysight business, were paid by Agilent for the years ended October 31, 2014 and 2013. The increase in cash paid for income taxes for the year ended October 31, 2015 was due to tax payments related to the separation. Operating cash flows in 2014 were impacted by pre-separation costs and separation related taxes, the redemption of senior notes including payments related to accrued interest and the timing of the purchase of shares under the employee stock purchase plan. For the years ended October 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 other assets and liabilities used cash of $262 million, $45 million and provided cash of $8 million, respectively. The increase in the usage of cash for the 45 Table of Contents year ended October 31, 2015 in other assets and liabilities was largely the result of contributions to defined benefit plans, changes in interest and restructuring accruals, income tax liabilities and transaction tax assets and liabilities. In 2015, the change in accounts receivable used cash of $24 million, $119 million in 2014 and provided cash of $14 million in 2013. For the years ended October 31, 2014 and 2013 the change in accounts receivable included $25 million of cash used and $44 million of cash provided by Keysight, respectively. Days' sales outstanding were 53 days in 2015, 49 days in 2014 and 47 days in 2013. The change in accounts payable used cash of $26 million in 2015, provided cash of $50 million in 2014 and used cash of $27 million in 2013. For the years ended October 31, 2014 and 2013 the change in accounts payable included $32 million of cash provided and $24 million of cash used by Keysight, respectively. Cash used in inventory was $24 million in 2015, $99 million in 2014 and $100 million in 2013. For the years ended October 31, 2014 and 2013 the change in inventory included $31 million and $53 million of cash used by Keysight, respectively. Inventory days on-hand decreased to 97 days in 2015 compared to 106 days in 2014 and 118 days in 2013. We contributed $15 million, $30 million and $30 million to our U.S. defined benefit plans in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. For the years ended October 31, 2014 and 2013 we contributed $15 million and $15 million, respectively, to our U.S. defined benefit plans on behalf of Keysight. We contributed $25 million, $72 million and $89 million to our non-U.S. defined benefit plans in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. For the years ended October 31, 2014 and 2013 we contributed $41 million and $45 million, respectively, to our non-U.S. defined benefit plans on behalf of Keysight. We contributed less than $1 million to our U.S. post-retirement benefit plans in 2015 and $1 million in both 2014 and 2013. Our non-U.S. defined benefit plans are generally funded ratably throughout the year. Total contributions in 2015 were $40 million or 61 percent less than 2014. Total contributions in 2014 were $103 million or 14 percent more than 2013. Our annual contributions are highly dependent on the relative performance of our assets versus our projected liabilities, among other factors. We expect to contribute approximately $25 million to our U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit plans and $1 million to our U.S. post-retirement benefit plans during 2016. Net Cash Used in Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities in 2015 was $400 million and in 2014 was $230 million as compared to net cash used of $248 million in 2013. For the years ended October 31, 2014 and 2013 cash used in investing activities included $82 million and $85 million of cash used by Keysight, respectively. Investments in property, plant and equipment were $98 million in 2015, $205 million in 2014 and $195 million in 2013. For the years ended October 31, 2014 and 2013 investments in plant and equipment included $70 million and $69 million, respectively, related to Keysight. Proceeds from sale of property, plant and equipment were $12 million in 2015, $14 million in 2014 and $2 million in 2013. In 2015 we invested $74 million in acquisitions of businesses and intangible assets, net of cash acquired compared to $13 million in 2014 and $21 million in 2013. In 2015 we increased our investment in our equity method investment by $1 million. In 2014, there were $25 million of purchases of equity method investments including a $3.5 million loan converted to equity compared with $46 million of purchases of investments including $21 million for equity method investments in 2013. Proceeds from a divestiture was $3 million in 2015 compared to $2 million in 2014. Proceeds from the sale of investment securities in 2015 were zero, $1 million in 2014 and $12 million in 2013. We made a payment of $2 million in exchange for convertible note in 2015. Change in restricted cash and cash equivalents was $240 million in 2015 related to our Seahorse Biosciences acquisition and $4 million and zero in 2014 and 2013 respectively. Net Cash Used in Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities in 2015 was $1,068 million compared to $97 million in 2014 and $554 million in 2013, respectively. The increase in cash used in 2015 when compared to 2014 was largely due to the net cash transferred to Keysight. Treasury stock repurchases On November 22, 2013 we announced that our board of directors had authorized a share repurchase program. The existing program is designed to reduce or eliminate dilution resulting from issuance of stock under the company's employee equity incentive programs to target maintaining a weighted average share count of approximately 335 million diluted shares. For the years ended October 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 we repurchased 6 million shares for $267 million, 4 million shares for $200 million and 20 million shares for $900 million, respectively. All such shares and related costs are held as treasury stock and accounted for using the cost method. On May 28, 2015 we announced that our board of directors had approved a new share repurchase program (the "2015 repurchase program"). The 2015 share repurchase program authorizes the purchase of up to $1.14 billion of our common stock through and including November 1, 2018. The 2015 share repurchase program will commence, at the option of the company, 46 Table of Contents on either November 1, 2015, or the date on which we complete the purchase of the remaining $98 million for a total of $365 million of common stock in fiscal 2015 under the existing stock repurchase program. Upon commencement, the 2015 share repurchase program replaces our existing stock repurchase program, which authorized the repurchase of shares to reduce or eliminate share dilution from equity programs. The 2015 repurchase program does not require the company to acquire a specific number of shares and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. Dividends For the years ended October 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 cash dividends of $133 million, $176 million and $156 million were paid on the company's outstanding common stock, respectively. On November 19, 2015, we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.115 per share of common stock, or approximately $38 million which will be paid on January 27, 2016 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on January 5, 2016. The timing and amounts of any future dividends are subject to determination and approval by our board of directors. Credit Facility On September 15, 2014, Agilent entered into a credit agreement with a financial institution which provides for a $400 million five-year unsecured credit facility that will expire on September 15, 2019. On June 9, 2015, the commitments under the existing credit facility were increased by $300 million so that the aggregate commitments under the facility now total $700 million. As of October 31, 2015, the company had no borrowings outstanding under the facility. We were in compliance with the covenants for the credit facility during the years ended October 31, 2015 and 2014. Long-term debt In October 2007, the company issued an aggregate principal amount of $600 million in senior notes ("2017 senior notes"). The 2017 senior notes were issued at 99.60% of their principal amount. The notes will mature on November 1, 2017, and bear interest at a fixed rate of 6.50% per annum. The interest is payable semi-annually on May 1st and November 1st of each year and payments commenced on May 1, 2008. On November 25, 2008, we terminated two interest rate swap contracts associated with our 2017 senior notes that represented the notional amount of $400 million. The asset value, including interest receivable, upon termination was approximately $43 million and the amount to be amortized at October 31, 2015 was $2 million. The gain is being deferred and amortized to interest expense over the remaining life of the 2017 senior notes. On October 20, 2014, we settled the redemption of $500 million of the $600 million outstanding aggregate principal amount of our 2017 senior notes due November 1, 2017 that had been called for redemption on September 19, 2014. In July 2010, the company issued an aggregate principal amount of $500 million in senior notes ("2020 senior notes"). The 2020 senior notes were issued at 99.54% of their principal amount. The notes will mature on July 15, 2020, and bear interest at a fixed rate of 5.00% per annum. The interest is payable semi-annually on January 15th and July 15th of each year, payments commenced on January 15, 2011. On August 9, 2011, we terminated our interest rate swap contracts related to our 2020 senior notes that represented the notional amount of $500 million. The asset value, including interest receivable, upon termination for these contracts was approximately $34 million and the amount to be amortized at October 31, 2015 was $19 million. The gain is being deferred and amortized to interest expense over the remaining life of the 2020 senior notes. In September 2012, the company issued an aggregate principal amount of $400 million in senior notes ("2022 senior notes"). The senior notes were issued at 99.80% of their principal amount. The notes will mature on October 1, 2022, and bear interest at a fixed rate of 3.20% per annum. The interest is payable semi-annually on April 1st and October 1st of each year, payments commenced on April 1, 2013. In June 2013, the company issued aggregate principal amount of $600 million in senior notes ("2023 senior notes"). The 2023 senior notes were issued at 99.544% of their principal amount. The notes will mature on July 15, 2023 and bear interest at a fixed rate of 3.875% per annum. Interest is payable semi-annually on January 15th and July 15th of each year and payments commenced January 15, 2014. As of October 31, 2015, we have mortgage debts, secured on buildings in Denmark, in Danish Krone equivalent of $38 million aggregate principal outstanding with a Danish financial institution. The loans have a variable interest rate based on 3 47 Table of Contents months Copenhagen Interbank Rate ("Cibor") and will mature on September 30, 2027. Interest payments are made in March, June, September and December of each year. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Other We have contractual commitments for non-cancelable operating leases. See Note 18, "Commitments and Contingencies", to our consolidated financial statements for further information on our non-cancelable operating leases. Our liquidity is affected by many factors, some of which are based on normal ongoing operations of our business and some of which arise from fluctuations related to global economics and markets. Our cash balances are generated and held in many locations throughout the world. Local government regulations may restrict our ability to move cash balances to meet cash needs under certain circumstances. We do not currently expect such regulations and restrictions to impact our ability to pay vendors and conduct operations throughout our global organization. Contractual Commitments Our cash flows from operations are dependent on a number of factors, including fluctuations in our operating results, accounts receivable collections, inventory management, and the timing of tax and other payments. As a result, the impact of contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be analyzed in conjunction with such factors. The following table summarizes our total contractual obligations at October 31, 2015 for Agilent operations and excludes amounts recorded in our consolidated balance sheet (in millions): Less than one year One to three years Three to five years More than five years Operating leases $ 35 $ 54 $ 26 $ 34 Commitments to contract manufacturers and suppliers 581 Other purchase commitments 53 Retirement plans 26 Total $ 695 $ 54 $ 26 $ 34 Operating leases. Commitments under operating leases relate primarily to leasehold property, see Note 18, "Commitments and Contingencies". Commitments to contract manufacturers and suppliers. We purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products. During the normal course of business, we issue purchase orders with estimates of our requirements several months ahead of the delivery dates. However, our agreements with these suppliers usually provide us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed. Typically purchase orders outstanding with delivery dates within 30 days are non-cancelable. Therefore, only approximately 38 percent of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements are firm, non-cancelable, and unconditional commitments. We expect to fulfill most of our purchase commitments for inventory within one year. In addition to the above mentioned commitments to contract manufacturers and suppliers, we record a liability for firm, non-cancelable and unconditional purchase commitments for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with our policy relating to excess inventory. As of October 31, 2015, the liability for our firm, non-cancelable and unconditional purchase commitments was $5 million compared to $10 million, as of October 31, 2014 and less than $1 million as of October 31, 2013. These amounts are included in other accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet. Other purchase commitments. We have categorized "other purchase commitments" related to contracts with professional services suppliers. Typically we can cancel contracts without penalties. For those contracts that are not cancelable without penalties, we are disclosing the termination fees and costs or commitments for continued spending that we are obligated to pay to a supplier under each contact's termination period before such contract can be cancelled. Our contractual obligations with these suppliers under "other purchase commitments" were approximately $53 million within the next year. Retirement Plans. Commitments under the retirement plans relate to expected contributions to be made to our U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit plans and to our post-retirement medical plans for the next year only. Contributions after next year are impractical to estimate. 48 Table of Contents We had no material off-balance sheet arrangements as of October 31, 2015 or October 31, 2014. On Balance Sheet Arrangements The following table summarizes our total contractual obligations at October 31, 2015 related to our long-term debt and interest expense (in millions): Less than one year One to three years Three to five years More than five years Senior notes $ $ 100 $ 500 $ 1,000 Other debt 38 Interest expense 68 132 123 96 Total $ 68 $ 232 $ 623 $ 1,134 Other long-term liabilities include $227 million and $286 million of liabilities for uncertain tax positions as of October 31, 2015 and October 31, 2014, respectively. We are unable to accurately predict when these amounts will be realized or released. However, it is reasonably possible that there could be significant changes to our unrecognized tax benefits in the next twelve months due to either the expiration of a statute of limitations or a tax audit settlement. 49 Table of Contents
