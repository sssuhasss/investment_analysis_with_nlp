Item 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW Our results for the year ended December 31, 2008 were in line with our expectations and reflect the progress we are making toward implementing our major strategic initiatives. Net sales grew at an annual rate of 3.8%. Marketplace performance improved in response to our continued investment in our core brands. We are investing to strengthen our position in the chocolate and confectionery markets in which we compete and build on our marketplace results. The net sales increase was driven by favorable price realization, improved U.S. marketplace performance for our products, and sales gains from our international businesses, offset somewhat by reduced sales volume in the United States. Incremental sales from the full-year results of Godrej Hershey Ltd. also contributed to the net sales increase, as results for 2007 only included the seven months subsequent to the acquisition of the business. Net income and earnings per share-diluted increased substantially compared with 2007 due to lower costs resulting from our business realignment initiatives. Non-GAAP Financial Measures Items Affecting Comparability Our Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section includes certain measures of financial performance that are not defined by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ). For each of these non-GAAP financial measures, we are providing below (1) the most directly comparable GAAP measure; (2) a reconciliation of the differences between the non-GAAP measure and the most directly comparable GAAP measure; (3) an explanation of why our management believes these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to investors; and (4) additional purposes for which we use these non-GAAP measures. We believe that the disclosure of these non-GAAP measures provides investors with a better comparison of our year-to-year operating results. We exclude the effects of certain items from Income before Interest and Income Taxes ( EBIT ), Net Income and Income per Share-Diluted-Common Stock ( EPS ) when we evaluate key measures of our performance internally, and in assessing the impact of known trends and uncertainties on our business. We also believe that excluding the effects of these items provides a more balanced view of the underlying dynamics of our business. Items affecting comparability include the impacts of charges or credits in 2008, 2007, 2006, 2005 and 2003 associated with our business realignment initiatives and a reduction of the income tax provision in 2004 resulting from adjustments to income tax contingency reserves. 19 Table of Contents For the years ended December 31, 2008 2007 EBIT Net Income EPS EBIT Net Income EPS In millions of dollars except per share amounts Results in accordance with GAAP $ 589.9 $ 311.4 $ 1.36 $ 458.8 $ 214.2 $ .93 Items affecting comparability: Business realignment charges included in cost of sales 77.8 53.4 .23 123.1 80.9 .35 Business realignment charges included in selling, marketing and administrative ( SM&A ) 8.1 4.9 .02 12.6 7.8 .03 Business realignment and impairment charges, net 94.8 60.8 .27 276.9 178.9 .77 Non-GAAP results excluding items affecting comparability $ 770.6 $ 430.5 $ 1.88 $ 871.4 $ 481.8 $ 2.08 For the years ended December 31, 2006 2005 EBIT Net Income EPS EBIT Net Income EPS In millions of dollars except per share amounts Results in accordance with GAAP $ 992.6 $ 559.1 $ 2.34 $ 853.6 $ 488.5 $ 1.97 Items affecting comparability: Business realignment (credits) charges included in cost of sales (3.2 ) (2.0 ) (.01 ) 22.5 13.4 .05 Business realignment charges included in SM&A .3 .2 Business realignment and impairment charges, net 14.5 9.3 .04 96.5 60.7 .25 Non-GAAP results excluding items affecting comparability $ 1,004.2 $ 566.6 $ 2.37 $ 972.6 $ 562.6 $ 2.27 For the years ended December 31, 2004 2003 EBIT Net Income EPS EBIT Net Income EPS In millions of dollars except per share amounts Results in accordance with GAAP $ 876.6 $ 574.6 $ 2.24 $ 767.4 $ 439.2 $ 1.66 Items affecting comparability: Business realignment charges included in cost of sales 2.1 1.3 Business realignment and impairment charges, net 23.4 14.2 .05 Gain on sale of business (8.3 ) (5.7 ) (.02 ) Tax provision adjustment (61.1 ) (.24 ) Cumulative effect of accounting change 7.4 .03 Non-GAAP results excluding items affecting comparability $ 876.6 $ 513.5 $ 2.00 $ 784.6 $ 456.4 $ 1.72 Actual Results Excluding Items Affecting Comparability Key Annual Performance Measures 2008 2007 2006 Increase in Net Sales 3.8% 0.1% 2.6% (Decrease) increase in EBIT (11.6)% (13.2)% 3.2% (Decline) improvement in EBIT Margin in basis points ( bps ) (260)bps (270)bps 10 bps (Decrease) increase in EPS (9.6)% (12.2)% 4.4% 20 Table of Contents SUMMARY OF OPERATING RESULTS Analysis of Selected Items from Our Income Statement Percent Change Increase (Decrease) For the years ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 2008-2007 2007-2006 In millions of dollars except per share amounts Net Sales $ 5,132.8 $ 4,946.7 $ 4,944.2 3.8 % 0.1 % Cost of Sales 3,375.1 3,315.1 3,076.7 1.8 7.7 Gross Profit 1,757.7 1,631.6 1,867.5 7.7 (12.6 ) Gross Margin 34.2 % 33.0 % 37.8 % SM&A Expense 1,073.0 895.9 860.3 19.8 4.1 SM&A Expense as a percent of sales 20.9 % 18.1 % 17.4 % Business Realignment and Impairment Charges, Net 94.8 276.9 14.6 (65.8 ) N/A EBIT 589.9 458.8 992.6 28.6 (53.8 ) EBIT Margin 11.5 % 9.3 % 20.1 % Interest Expense, Net 97.9 118.6 116.1 (17.5 ) 2.2 Provision for Income Taxes 180.6 126.0 317.4 43.2 (60.3 ) Effective Income Tax Rate 36.7 % 37.1 % 36.2 % Net Income $ 311.4 $ 214.2 $ 559.1 45.4 (61.7 ) Net Income Per Share Diluted $ 1.36 $ .93 $ 2.34 46.2 (60.3 ) Net Sales 2008 compared with 2007 The increase in net sales was attributable to favorable price realization from list price increases, substantially offset by sales volume decreases primarily in the United States. Increased sales in the United States were primarily attributable to our core brands, particularly Hershey and Reese s, and incremental sales of new products, primarily Hershey Bliss . Sales volume increases from our international businesses, particularly in India, China and the Philippines, also contributed to the sales increase, although were offset somewhat by the impact of unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates. Net sales for our Godrej Hershey Ltd. business increased $37.2 million, or 0.8%, in 2008 reflecting incremental sales for the full-year compared with results for 2007 which included only the seven months subsequent to the acquisition of the business. 2007 compared with 2006 Net sales for 2007 were essentially even with 2006. Sales increased for our international businesses, primarily exports to Asia and Latin America, as well as sales in Canada and Mexico. The acquisition of Godrej Hershey Ltd. increased net sales by $46.5 million, or 0.9%, in 2007. Favorable foreign currency exchange rates also had a positive impact on sales. These increases were substantially offset by lower sales volume for existing products in the U.S., reflecting increased competitive activity and reduced retail velocity. Decreased price realization from higher rates of promotional spending and higher allowances for slow-moving products at retail more than offset increases in list prices contributing to the sales decline in the U.S. Key U.S. Marketplace Metrics For the 52 weeks ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Consumer Takeaway Increase 3.3 % 1.3 % 4.0 % Market Share Decrease (0.2 ) (1.3 ) (0.2 ) 21 Table of Contents Consumer takeaway is provided for channels of distribution accounting for approximately 80% of our U.S. confectionery retail business. These channels of distribution include food, drug, mass merchandisers, including Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., and convenience stores. The change in market share is provided for channels measured by syndicated data which include sales in the food, drug, convenience store and mass merchandiser classes of trade, excluding sales of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Cost of Sales and Gross Margin 2008 compared with 2007 The cost of sales increase compared with 2007 was primarily associated with higher input and energy costs, and the full-year cost of sales for Godrej Hershey Ltd. which in 2007 included cost of sales for only the seven months subsequent to the acquisition of the business. These cost increases were offset partially by favorable supply chain productivity. Lower business realignment charges included in cost of sales in 2008 compared with 2007 also partially offset the cost of sales increases. Business realignment charges of $77.8 million were included in cost of sales in 2008, compared with $123.1 million in the prior year. Gross margin increased primarily as a result of lower business realignment charges recorded in 2008 compared with 2007. Favorable price realization and improved supply chain productivity also contributed to the increase, but were offset substantially by higher input and energy costs. 2007 compared with 2006 Business realignment charges of $123.1 million were included in cost of sales in 2007, compared with a credit of $3.2 million included in cost of sales in 2006. The remainder of the cost of sales increase was primarily associated with significantly higher input costs, particularly for dairy products and certain other raw materials, and the Godrej Hershey Ltd. business acquired in May 2007, offset somewhat by favorable supply chain productivity. The gross margin decline was primarily attributable to the impact of business realignment initiatives recorded in 2007 compared with 2006, resulting in a reduction of 2.6 percentage points. The rest of the decline reflected substantially higher costs for raw materials, offset somewhat by improved supply chain productivity. Also contributing to the decrease was lower net price realization due to higher promotional costs. Selling, Marketing and Administrative 2008 compared with 2007 Selling, marketing and administrative expenses increased primarily as a result of higher costs associated with employee-related expenses, including higher incentive compensation expense, increased levels of retail coverage primarily in the United States and expansion of our international businesses. Higher advertising, marketing research and merchandising expenses also contributed to the increase. Expenses of $8.1 million related to our 2007 business realignment initiatives were included in selling, marketing and administrative expenses in 2008 compared with $12.6 million in 2007. 2007 compared with 2006 Selling, marketing and administrative expenses increased primarily as a result of higher administrative and advertising expenses, partially offset by lower consumer promotional expenses. Project implementation costs related to our 2007 business realignment initiatives contributed $12.6 million to the increase. Higher administrative costs were principally associated with employee-related expenses from the expansion of our international businesses, including the impact of the acquisition of Godrej Hershey Ltd. 22 Table of Contents Business Realignment Initiatives and Impairment Charges In February 2007, we announced a comprehensive, three-year supply chain transformation program (the global supply chain transformation program ) and, in December 2007, we recorded impairment and business realignment charges associated with our business in Brazil (together, the 2007 business realignment initiatives ). When completed, the global supply chain transformation program will greatly enhance our manufacturing, sourcing and customer service capabilities, reduce inventories resulting in improvements in working capital and generate significant resources to invest in our growth initiatives. These initiatives include accelerated marketplace momentum within our core U.S. business, creation of innovative new product platforms to meet customer needs and disciplined global expansion. Under the program, which will be implemented in stages over three years, we will significantly increase manufacturing capacity utilization by reducing the number of production lines by more than one-third, outsource production of low value-added items and construct a flexible, cost-effective production facility in Monterrey, Mexico to meet current and emerging marketplace needs. The program will result in a total net reduction of 1,500 positions across our supply chain over the three-year implementation period. The original estimated pre-tax cost of the program announced in February 2007 was from $525 million to $575 million over three years. The total included from $475 million to $525 million in business realignment costs and approximately $50 million in project implementation costs. Total costs of $130.0 million were recorded in 2008 and $400.0 million were recorded in 2007 for this program. Excluding possible pension settlement charges in 2009 and 2010, we now expect total charges for the global supply chain transformation program to be at the upper end of the $575 million to $600 million range, reflecting our latest estimates for the cost of the original program and an expansion in scope of the program approved in December 2008. The expansion in the scope of the program will include approximately $25.0 million associated with the closure of two subscale manufacturing facilities of Artisan Confections Company, a wholly-owned subsidiary, and consolidation of the associated production into existing U.S. facilities, along with costs associated with the rationalization of other select portfolio items. The affected facilities are located in Berkeley and San Francisco, California. These additional business realignment charges will be recorded in 2009 and include severance for approximately 150 impacted employees. For more information, see Outlook for Global Supply Chain Transformation Program on page 49. In 2001, we acquired a small business in Brazil, Hershey do Brasil, that through 2007 had not gained profitable scale or adequate market distribution. In an effort to improve the performance of this business, in January 2008 Hershey do Brasil entered into a cooperative agreement with Pandurata Alimentos LTDA ( Bauducco ), a leading manufacturer of baked goods in Brazil whose primary brand is Bauducco. In the fourth quarter of 2007, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge and approved a business realignment program associated with initiatives to improve distribution and enhance the financial performance of our business in Brazil. Business realignment and impairment charges of $4.9 million were recorded in 2008 and $12.6 million were recorded in 2007. In July 2005, we announced initiatives intended to advance our value-enhancing strategy (the 2005 business realignment initiatives ). The 2005 business realignment initiatives consisted primarily of U.S. and Canadian Voluntary Workforce Reduction Programs and the closure of the Las Piedras, Puerto Rico plant. Charges (credits) for the 2005 business realignment initiatives were recorded during 2005 and 2006 and the 2005 business realignment initiatives were completed by December 31, 2006. 23 Table of Contents Charges (credits) associated with business realignment initiatives and impairment recorded during 2008, 2007 and 2006 were as follows: For the years ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 In thousands of dollars Cost of sales 2007 business realignment initiatives: Global supply chain transformation program $ 77,767 $ 123,090 $ 2005 business realignment initiatives (1,599 ) Previous business realignment initiatives (1,600 ) Total cost of sales 77,767 123,090 (3,199 ) Selling, marketing and administrative 2007 business realignment initiatives: Global supply chain transformation program 8,102 12,623 2005 business realignment initiatives 266 Total selling, marketing and administrative 8,102 12,623 266 Business realignment and impairment charges, net 2008 impairment of trademarks 45,739 2007 business realignment initiatives: Global supply chain transformation program: Net (gain on sale)/impairment of fixed assets (4,882 ) 47,938 Plant closure expense 23,415 13,506 Employee separation costs 11,469 176,463 Pension settlement loss 12,501 12,075 Contract termination costs 1,637 14,316 Brazilian business realignment: Goodwill impairment 12,260 Employee separation costs 1,581 310 Fixed asset impairment charges 754 Contract termination and other exit costs 2,587 2005 business realignment initiatives: U.S. voluntary workforce reduction program 9,972 U.S. facility rationalization 1,567 Streamline international operations (primarily Canada) 2,524 Previous business realignment initiatives 513 Total business realignment and impairment charges, net 94,801 276,868 14,576 Total net charges associated with business realignment initiatives and impairment $ 180,670 $ 412,581 $ 11,643 Global Supply Chain Transformation Program The 2008 charge of $77.8 million recorded in cost of sales for the global supply chain transformation program related primarily to the accelerated depreciation of fixed assets over a reduced estimated remaining useful life and start-up costs associated with the global supply chain transformation program. The $8.1 million recorded in selling, marketing and administrative expenses related primarily to project administration for the global supply chain transformation program. In determining the costs related to fixed asset impairments, fair value was estimated based on the expected sales proceeds. The $4.9 million of gains on sale of fixed assets resulted from the receipt of proceeds in excess of the carrying value primarily from the sale of a warehousing and distribution facility. The $23.4 million of plant closure expenses for 2008 related primarily to the preparation of plants for sale and production line removal costs. 24 Table of Contents Certain real estate with a carrying value of $15.8 million was being held for sale as of December 31, 2008. The global supply chain transformation program employee separation costs were related to involuntary terminations at the North American manufacturing facilities which are being closed. The global supply chain transformation program had identified six manufacturing facilities which would be closed. As of December 31, 2008, the facilities located in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia; Montreal, Quebec; and Oakdale, California have been closed and sold. The facilities located in Naugatuck, Connecticut and Smiths Falls, Ontario have been closed and are being held for sale. The facility in Reading, Pennsylvania is being held and used pending closure, following which it will be offered for sale. The 2007 charge of $123.1 million recorded in cost of sales for the global supply chain transformation program related primarily to the accelerated depreciation of fixed assets over a reduced estimated remaining useful life and costs related to inventory reductions. The $12.6 million recorded in selling, marketing and administrative expenses related primarily to project management and administration. In determining the costs related to fixed asset impairments, fair value was estimated based on the expected sales proceeds. Certain real estate with a carrying value of $40.2 million was being held for sale as of December 31, 2007. Employee separation costs included $79.0 million primarily for involuntary terminations at the six North American manufacturing facilities which are being closed. The employee separation costs also included $97.5 million for charges relating to pension and other post-retirement benefits curtailments and special termination benefits. 2008 Impairment of Trademarks As a result of our annual impairment tests of intangible assets with useful lives determined to be indefinite, we recorded total impairment charges of $45.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. Certain trademarks, primarily the Mauna Loa brand, were determined to be impaired as a result of a decrease in the fair value of the brands resulting from reduced expectations for future sales and cash flows compared with the valuations of these trademarks at the acquisition dates. For more information, refer to pages 46 and 47. Brazilian Business Realignment The 2008 Brazilian business realignment charges and the 2007 employee separation costs were related to involuntary terminations and costs associated with office consolidation related to the cooperative agreement with Bauducco. During the fourth quarter of 2007, we completed our annual impairment evaluation of goodwill and other intangible assets. As a result of reduced expectations for future cash flows resulting primarily from lower expected profitability, we determined that the carrying amount of our wholly-owned subsidiary, Hershey do Brasil, exceeded its fair value and recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $12.3 million in December 2007. There was no tax benefit associated with this charge. 2005 Business Realignment Initiatives The 2006 charges (credits) recorded in cost of sales relating to the 2005 business realignment initiatives included a credit of $1.6 million resulting from higher than expected proceeds from the sale of equipment from the Las Piedras plant. The charge recorded in selling, marketing and administrative expenses in 2006 resulted from accelerated depreciation relating to the termination of an office building lease. The net business realignment charges included $7.3 million for involuntary terminations in 2006. The 2006 charges (credits) relating to previous business realignment initiatives which began in 2003 and 2001 resulted from the finalization of the sale of certain properties, adjustments to liabilities which had previously been recorded, and the impact of the settlement of litigation in connection with the 2003 business realignment initiatives. Liabilities Associated with Business Realignment Initiatives The liability balance as of December 31, 2008 relating to the 2007 business realignment initiatives was $31.0 million for employee separation costs to be paid primarily in 2009. The liability balance as of 25 Table of Contents December 31, 2007 was $68.4 million, primarily related to employee separation costs. Charges for employee separation and contract termination costs of $12.9 million were recorded in 2008. During 2008 and 2007, we made payments against the liabilities recorded for the 2007 business realignment initiatives of $46.9 million and $13.2 million, respectively, principally related to employee separation and project administration. The liability balance as of December 31, 2008 was reduced by $3.4 million as a result of foreign currency translation adjustments. Income Before Interest and Income Taxes and EBIT Margin 2008 compared with 2007 EBIT increased in 2008 compared with 2007 as a result of lower net business realignment charges. Net pre-tax business realignment charges of $180.7 million were recorded in 2008 compared with $412.6 million in 2007. The increase in EBIT resulting from lower business realignment charges and an increase in gross profit was substantially offset by higher selling, marketing and administrative expenses. EBIT margin increased from 9.3% in 2007 to 11.5% in 2008. Net business realignment and impairment charges reduced EBIT margin by 3.5 percentage points in 2008 and 8.3 percentage points in 2007, resulting in an improvement in EBIT margin of 4.8 percentage points from 2007 to 2008. This impact was substantially offset by higher selling, marketing and administrative expense as a percentage of sales. 2007 compared with 2006 EBIT decreased in 2007 compared with 2006, principally as a result of higher net business realignment and impairment charges recorded in 2007. Net pre-tax business realignment and impairment charges of $412.6 million were recorded in 2007 compared with $11.6 million recorded in 2006, an increase of $400.9 million. The remainder of the decrease in EBIT was attributable to lower gross profit resulting primarily from higher input costs and higher selling, marketing and administrative expenses. EBIT margin declined from 20.1% in 2006 to 9.3% in 2007. Net business realignment and impairment charges reduced EBIT margin by 8.3 percentage points in 2007. Net business realignment charges reduced EBIT margin by 0.2 percentage points in 2006. The remainder of the decrease primarily resulted from the lower gross margin, in addition to higher selling, marketing and administrative expense as a percentage of sales. Interest Expense, Net 2008 compared with 2007 Net interest expense was lower in 2008 than in 2007 primarily due to lower interest rates and reduced borrowings as compared to the prior year. 2007 compared with 2006 Net interest expense was higher in 2007 than in 2006 primarily reflecting increased borrowings partially offset by lower interest rates. Income Taxes and Effective Tax Rate 2008 compared with 2007 Our effective income tax rate was 36.7% in 2008, and was increased by 0.7 percentage points as a result of the effective tax rate associated with business realignment charges recorded during the year. 26 Table of Contents 2007 compared with 2006 Our effective income tax rate was 37.1% for 2007 and 36.2% for 2006. The impact of tax rates associated with business realignment and impairment charges increased the effective income tax rate for 2007 by 1.1 percentage points. Net Income and Net Income Per Share 2008 compared with 2007 As a result of net charges associated with our business realignment initiatives, net income in 2008 was reduced by $119.1 million or $0.52 per share-diluted. After considering the impact of business realignment charges in each period, earnings per share-diluted in 2008 decreased $0.20 as compared with 2007. 2007 compared with 2006 Net income in 2007 was reduced by $267.7 million, or $1.15 per share-diluted, and in 2006 was reduced by $7.6 million, or $0.03 per share-diluted, as a result of net business realignment and impairment charges. Excluding the impact of these charges, earnings per share-diluted in 2007 decreased by $0.29 as compared with 2006 as a result of lower EBIT, offset somewhat by reduced interest expense and the impact of lower weighted-average shares outstanding in 2007. 27 Table of Contents FINANCIAL CONDITION Our financial condition remained strong during 2008. Solid cash flow from operations and our liquidity, leverage and capital structure contributed to our continued investment grade credit rating by recognized rating agencies. The financial market turmoil and credit crisis, to date, have not had a material affect on our business operations or liquidity. Acquisitions and Divestitures In January 2008, our Brazilian subsidiary, Hershey do Brasil, entered into a cooperative agreement with Bauducco. In the fourth quarter of 2007, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge and approved a business realignment program associated with initiatives to improve distribution and enhance performance of our business in Brazil. In the first quarter of 2008, we received approximately $2.0 million in cash and recorded an other intangible asset of $13.7 million associated with the cooperative agreement with Bauducco in exchange for our conveying to Bauducco a 49% interest in Hershey do Brasil. We will maintain a 51% controlling interest in Hershey do Brasil. In May 2007, we entered into an agreement with Godrej Beverages and Foods, Ltd., one of India largest consumer goods, confectionery and food companies, to manufacture and distribute confectionery products, snacks and beverages across India. Under the agreement, we invested $61.5 million during 2007 and own a 51% controlling interest in Godrej Hershey Ltd. Total liabilities assumed were $51.6 million. Effective in May 2007, this business acquisition was included in our consolidated results, including the related minority interest. Also in May 2007, our Company and Lotte Confectionery Co., LTD., entered into a manufacturing agreement in China that will produce Hershey products and certain Lotte products for the markets in Asia, particularly in China. We invested $39.0 million in 2007 and own a 44% interest. We are accounting for this investment using the equity method. In October 2006, our wholly-owned subsidiary, Artisan Confections Company, purchased the assets of Dagoba Organic Chocolates, LLC based in Ashland, Oregon, for $17.0 million. Dagoba is known for its high-quality organic chocolate bars, drinking chocolates and baking products that are primarily sold in natural food and gourmet stores across the United States. Results subsequent to the dates of acquisition were included in the consolidated financial statements. Had the results of the acquisitions been included in the consolidated financial statements for each of the periods presented, the effect would not have been material. Assets A summary of our assets is as follows: December 31, 2008 2007 In thousands of dollars Current assets $ 1,344,945 $ 1,426,574 Property, plant and equipment, net 1,458,949 1,539,715 Goodwill and other intangibles 665,449 740,575 Deferred income taxes 13,815 Other assets 151,561 540,249 Total assets $ 3,634,719 $ 4,247,113 28 Table of Contents The change in current assets from 2007 to 2008 was primarily due to the following: Lower cash and cash equivalents in 2008 primarily as a result of decisions to reduce short-term borrowings; A decrease in accounts receivable primarily resulting from the timing of sales and cash collections in November and December 2008 as compared with November and December 2007, along with a decrease in extended dated receivables associated with sales of seasonal items and new products; An increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets primarily reflecting assets associated with certain commodity and treasury hedging transactions. Property, plant and equipment was lower in 2008 primarily due to depreciation expense of $227.2 million and asset retirements. Accelerated depreciation of fixed assets at facilities which are being closed as well as certain asset retirements resulted primarily from the global supply chain transformation program. Goodwill and other intangibles decreased as a result of total impairment charges of $45.7 million associated with certain trademarks and the effect of currency translation adjustments, offset partially by the $13.7 million intangible asset associated with the cooperative agreement with Bauducco. The decrease in other assets was primarily associated with the change in the funded status of our pension plans in 2008, resulting from a significant reduction in the fair value of pension plan assets. Liabilities A summary of our liabilities is as follows: December 31, 2008 2007 In thousands of dollars Current liabilities $ 1,270,212 $ 1,618,770 Long-term debt 1,505,954 1,279,965 Other long-term liabilities 504,963 544,016 Deferred income taxes 3,646 180,842 Total liabilities $ 3,284,775 $ 3,623,593 Changes in current liabilities from 2007 to 2008 were primarily the result of the following: Higher accounts payable reflecting the effect of working capital improvement initiatives and higher costs of goods and services; Lower accrued liabilities primarily associated with the 2007 business realignment initiatives and certain executive retirement benefit payments in 2008, partially offset by higher expected incentive compensation payments in 2009; A decrease in short-term debt reflecting repayments of commercial paper borrowings using the proceeds of the $250 million of Notes issued in March 2008 as well as cash provided from operations. The increase in long-term debt in 2008 primarily resulted from the issuance of $250 million of Notes in March 2008, discussed further in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section. The decrease in other long-term liabilities primarily reflects the impact of favorable claims experience and a higher discount rate used in determining the liability for our post-retirement benefit plans. The decrease in deferred income tax liabilities was principally associated with the change in the funded status of our pension plans in 2008 and the tax effect of impairment charges related to certain trademarks. 29 Table of Contents Capital Structure We have two classes of stock outstanding, Common Stock and Class B Stock. Holders of the Common Stock and the Class B Stock generally vote together without regard to class on matters submitted to stockholders, including the election of directors. Holders of the Common Stock have one vote per share. Holders of the Class B Stock have ten votes per share. Holders of the Common Stock, voting separately as a class, are entitled to elect one-sixth of our Board of Directors. With respect to dividend rights, holders of the Common Stock are entitled to cash dividends 10% higher than those declared and paid on the Class B Stock. Hershey Trust Company, as trustee for the benefit of Milton Hershey School (the Milton Hershey School Trust or the Trust ) maintains voting control over The Hershey Company. Historically, the Milton Hershey School Trust had not taken an active role in setting our policy, nor had it exercised influence with regard to the ongoing business decisions of our Board of Directors or management. However, in October 2007, the Chairman of the Board of the Milton Hershey School Trust issued a statement indicating that the Trust continues to be guided by two key principles: first, that, in its role as controlling stockholder of the Company, it intends to retain its controlling interest in The Hershey Company and, second, that the long-term prosperity of the Company requires the Board of Directors of the Company and its management to build on its strong U.S. position by aggressively pursuing strategies for domestic and international growth. He further stated that the Milton Hershey School Trust had communicated to the Company Board that the Trust was not satisfied with the Company results and that, as a result, the Trust was actively engaged in an ongoing process, the goal of which has been to ensure vigorous Company Board focus on resolving the Company current business challenges and on implementing new growth strategies. In that release, the Trust board chairman reiterated the Trust longstanding position that the Company Board, and not the Trust board, is solely responsible and accountable for the Company management and performance. On November 11, 2007 we announced that all of the members of our Board of Directors had resigned except for Richard H. Lenny, who was at that time our Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, David J. West, who was at that time President of the Company and currently serves as our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Robert F. Cavanaugh, who is also a member of the board of directors of Hershey Trust Company and board of managers (governing body) of Milton Hershey School. In addition, we announced that the Milton Hershey School Trust through stockholder action effected by written consent had amended the By-laws of the Company to allow the Company stockholders to fix the number of directors to serve on our Board of Directors and from time to time to increase or decrease such number of directors, expanded the size of our Board of Directors from 11 directors to 13 directors, and appointed eight new directors, including two who are also members of the board of directors of Hershey Trust Company and board of managers of Milton Hershey School. The Milton Hershey School Trust decided to explore a sale of The Hershey Company in June 2002, but subsequently decided to terminate the sale process in September 2002. After terminating the sale process, the Trustee of the Milton Hershey School Trust advised the Pennsylvania Office of Attorney General in September 2002 that it would not agree to any sale of its controlling interest in The Hershey Company without approval of the court having jurisdiction over the Milton Hershey School Trust following advance notice to the Office of Attorney General. Subsequently, Pennsylvania enacted legislation that requires that the Office of Attorney General be provided advance notice of any transaction that would result in the Milton Hershey School Trust no longer having voting control of the Company. The law provides specific statutory authority for the Attorney General to intercede and petition the Court having jurisdiction over the Milton Hershey School Trust to stop such a transaction if the Attorney General can prove that the transaction is unnecessary for the future economic viability of the Company and is inconsistent with investment and management considerations under fiduciary obligations. This legislation could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock and thereby delay or prevent a change in control of the Company. In December 2000, our Board of Directors unanimously adopted a Stockholder Protection Rights Agreement ( Rights Agreement ). The Milton Hershey School Trust supported the Rights Agreement. This 30 Table of Contents action was not in response to any specific effort to acquire control of The Hershey Company. Under the Rights Agreement, our Board of Directors declared a dividend of one right ( Right ) for each outstanding share of Common Stock and Class B Stock payable to stockholders of record at the close of business on December 26, 2000. The Rights will at no time have voting power or receive dividends. The issuance of the Rights has no dilutive effect, will not affect reported earnings per share, is not taxable and will not change the manner in which our Common Stock is traded. We discuss the Rights Agreement in more detail in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Our principal source of liquidity is operating cash flows. Our net income and, consequently, our cash provided from operations are impacted by: sales volume, seasonal sales patterns, timing of new product introductions, profit margins and price changes. Sales are typically higher during the third and fourth quarters of the year due to seasonal and holiday-related sales patterns. Generally, working capital needs peak during the summer months. We meet these needs primarily by issuing commercial paper. Global capital and credit markets, including the commercial paper markets, have recently experienced increased volatility and disruption. Despite this volatility and disruption, we have continued to have full access to the tier 1 commercial paper market. We believe that our operating cash flow, together with our unsecured committed revolving credit facility, lines of credit and other available debt financing, will be adequate to meet current operating, investing and financing needs, although there can be no assurance that continued or increased volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our ability to access these markets on commercially acceptable terms. Cash Flows from Operating Activities Our cash flows provided from (used by) operating activities were as follows: For the years ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 In thousands of dollars Net income $ 311,405 $ 214,154 $ 559,061 Depreciation and amortization 249,491 310,925 199,911 Stock-based compensation and excess tax benefits 22,196 9,526 16,323 Deferred income taxes (17,125 ) (124,276 ) 4,173 Business realignment and impairment charges, net of tax 119,117 267,653 7,573 Contributions to pension plans (32,759 ) (15,836 ) (23,570 ) Working capital 65,791 148,019 (40,553 ) Changes in other assets and liabilities (198,555 ) (31,329 ) 275 Net cash provided from operating activities $ 519,561 $ 778,836 $ 723,193 Over the past three years, total cash provided from operating activities was approximately $2.0 billion. Depreciation and amortization expenses decreased in 2008 principally as the result of lower accelerated depreciation charges related to the 2007 business realignment initiatives compared with accelerated depreciation charges recorded in 2007. Accelerated depreciation recorded in 2008 was approximately $60.6 million compared with approximately $108.6 million recorded in 2007. Depreciation and amortization expenses represent non-cash items that impacted net income and are reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows to reconcile cash flows from operating activities. Cash used by deferred income taxes in 2008 and 2007 versus cash provided by deferred income taxes in 2006, primarily reflected the deferred tax benefit related to the 2007 business realignment and impairment charges recorded during 2008 and 2007. 31 Table of Contents We contributed $72.2 million to our pension plans over the past three years to improve the plans funded status and to pay benefits under the non-funded plans. As of December 31, 2008, our pension benefit obligations exceeded the fair value of our pension plan assets by $40.8 million. Over the three-year period, cash provided from or used by working capital tended to fluctuate due to the timing of sales and cash collections during November and December of each year and working capital management practices, including initiatives implemented during 2007 and 2008 to reduce working capital. During the three-year period, cash used by or provided from changes in other assets and liabilities primarily reflected the impact of business realignment initiatives and the related tax effects, as well as the effect of hedging transactions. The decrease in income taxes paid in 2008 compared with 2007 primarily reflected the impact of lower taxable income for 2008. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Our cash flows provided from (used by) investing activities were as follows: For the years ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 In thousands of dollars Capital additions $ (262,643 ) $ (189,698 ) $ (183,496 ) Capitalized software additions (20,336 ) (14,194 ) (15,016 ) Proceeds from sales of property, plant and equipment 82,815 Business acquisitions (100,461 ) (17,000 ) Proceeds from divestitures 1,960 Net cash used by investing activities $ (198,204 ) $ (304,353 ) $ (215,512 ) Capital additions associated with our global supply chain transformation program were approximately $162.6 million. Other capital additions were primarily related to modernization of existing facilities and purchases of manufacturing equipment for new products. Capitalized software additions were primarily for ongoing enhancement of our information systems. In 2008, we received $82.8 million in proceeds from the sale of manufacturing and distribution facilities under the global supply chain transformation program. We anticipate total capital expenditures of approximately $175 million to $185 million in 2009 of which approximately $40 million to $50 million is associated with our global supply chain transformation program. In January 2008, our Brazilian subsidiary, Hershey do Brasil, entered into a cooperative agreement with Bauducco. We received approximately $2.0 million in cash associated with the cooperative agreement in exchange for a 49% interest in Hershey do Brasil. In May 2007, we entered into an agreement with Godrej Beverages and Foods, Ltd. to manufacture and distribute confectionery products, snacks and beverages across India. Under the agreement, we invested $61.5 million in this business during 2007. In May 2007, our Company and Lotte Confectionery Co. LTD. entered into a manufacturing agreement to produce Hershey products and certain Lotte products for markets in Asia, particularly in China. We invested $39.0 million in this business during 2007. In October 2006, our wholly-owned subsidiary, Artisan Confections Company, acquired the assets of Dagoba Organic Chocolates, LLC for $17.0 million. 32 Table of Contents Cash Flows from Financing Activities Our cash flows provided from (used by) financing activities were as follows: For the years ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 In thousands of dollars Net change in short-term borrowings $ (371,393 ) $ 195,055 $ (163,826 ) Long-term borrowings 247,845 496,728 Repayment of long-term debt (4,977 ) (188,891 ) (234 ) Cash dividends paid (262,949 ) (252,263 ) (235,129 ) Exercise of stock options 38,383 59,958 46,386 Repurchase of Common Stock (60,361 ) (256,285 ) (621,648 ) Net cash used by financing activities $ (413,452 ) $ (442,426 ) $ (477,723 ) We use short-term borrowings (commercial paper and bank borrowings) to fund seasonal working capital requirements and ongoing business needs. Additional information on short-term borrowings is included under Borrowing Arrangements below. In March 2008, we issued $250 million of 5.0% Notes due in 2013. The Notes were issued under a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 filed in May 2006 described under Registration Statements below. In March 2007, we repaid $150.0 million of 6.95% Notes due in 2007. In August 2006, we issued $250 million of 5.3% Notes due in 2011 and $250 million of 5.45% Notes due in 2016 under the shelf registration statement on Form S-3 filed in May 2006. We paid cash dividends of $197.8 million on our Common Stock and $65.1 million on our Class B Stock in 2008. Cash used for the repurchase of Common Stock was partially offset by cash received from the exercise of stock options. Repurchases and Issuances of Common Stock For the years ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 In thousands Shares Dollars Shares Dollars Shares Dollars Shares repurchased under pre-approved share repurchase programs: Open market repurchases $ 2,916 $ 149,983 9,912 $ 524,387 Milton Hershey School Trust repurchases 689 38,482 Shares repurchased to replace Treasury Stock issued for stock options and employee benefits 1,610 60,361 2,046 106,302 1,096 58,779 Total share repurchases 1,610 60,361 4,962 256,285 11,697 621,648 Shares issued for stock options and employee benefits (1,595 ) (51,992 ) (1,748 ) (56,670 ) (1,437 ) (44,564 ) Net change 15 $ 8,369 3,214 $ 199,615 10,260 $ 577,084 We intend to continue to repurchase shares of Common Stock in order to replace Treasury Stock shares issued for exercised stock options. The value of shares purchased in a given period will vary based on stock options exercised over time and market conditions. During 2006, we completed share repurchase programs of $250 million approved in April 2005 and $500 million approved in December 2005. In December 2006, our Board of Directors approved an additional $250 million share repurchase program. As of December 31, 2008, $100.0 million remained available for repurchases of Common Stock under this program. 33 Table of Contents Cumulative Share Repurchases and Issuances A summary of cumulative share repurchases and issuances is as follows: Shares Dollars In thousands Shares repurchased under authorized programs: Open market repurchases 57,436 $ 1,984,431 Repurchases from the Milton Hershey School Trust 11,918 245,550 Shares retired (1,056 ) (12,820 ) Total repurchases under authorized programs 68,298 2,217,161 Privately negotiated purchases from the Milton Hershey School Trust 67,282 1,501,373 Shares reissued for stock option obligations, supplemental retirement contributions, and employee stock ownership trust obligations (29,090 ) (762,543 ) Shares repurchased to replace reissued shares 26,377 1,053,940 Total held as Treasury Stock as of December 31, 2008 132,867 $ 4,009,931 Borrowing Arrangements We maintain debt levels we consider prudent based on our cash flow, interest coverage ratio and percentage of debt to capital. We use debt financing to lower our overall cost of capital which increases our return on stockholders equity. In December 2006, we entered into a five-year agreement establishing an unsecured committed revolving credit facility to borrow up to $1.1 billion, with an option to increase borrowings to $1.5 billion with the consent of the lenders. During the fourth quarter of 2007, the lenders approved an extension of this agreement by one year in accordance with our option under the agreement. The five-year agreement will now expire in December 2012. As of December 31, 2008, $1.1 billion was available to borrow under the agreement. The unsecured revolving credit agreement contains certain financial and other covenants, customary representations, warranties, and events of default. As of December 31, 2008, we complied with all of these covenants. We may use these funds for general corporate purposes, including commercial paper backstop and business acquisitions. In August 2007, we entered into an unsecured revolving short-term credit agreement to borrow up to an additional $300 million because we believed at the time that seasonal working capital needs, share repurchases and other business activities would cause our borrowings to exceed the $1.1 billion borrowing limit available under our five-year credit agreement. We used the funds borrowed under this new agreement for general corporate purposes, including commercial paper backstop. Although the new agreement was scheduled to expire in August 2008, we elected to terminate it in June 2008 because we determined that we no longer needed the additional borrowing capacity provided by the agreement. In March 2006, we entered into a short-term credit agreement establishing an unsecured revolving credit facility to borrow up to $400 million through September 2006. In September 2006, we entered into an agreement amending the short-term facility. The amended agreement reduced the credit limit from $400 million to $200 million and expired on December 1, 2006. We used the funds for general corporate purposes, including commercial paper backstop. We entered into this agreement because we expected borrowings to exceed the $900 million credit limit available under the revolving credit agreement in effect at that time. In addition to the revolving credit facility, we maintain lines of credit with domestic and international commercial banks. As of December 31, 2008, we could borrow up to approximately $67.1 million in various currencies under the lines of credit and as of December 31, 2007, we could borrow up to $57.0 million. 34 Table of Contents Registration Statements In May 2006, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 that registered an indeterminate amount of debt securities. This registration statement was effective immediately upon filing under Securities and Exchange Commission regulations governing well-known seasoned issuers (the WKSI Registration Statement ). In August 2006, we issued $250 million of 5.3% Notes due September 1, 2011, and $250 million of 5.45% Notes due September 1, 2016. These Notes were issued under the WKSI Registration Statement. In March 2008, we issued $250 million of 5.0% Notes due April 1, 2013. The Notes were issued under the WKSI Registration Statement. Proceeds from the debt issuances and any other offerings under the WKSI Registration Statement may be used for general corporate requirements. These may include reducing existing borrowings, financing capital additions, funding contributions to our pension plans, future business acquisitions and working capital requirements. OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS, CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND COMMITMENTS As of December 31, 2008, our contractual cash obligations by year were as follows: Payments Due by Year In thousands of dollars Contractual Obligations 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Total Unconditional Purchase Obligations $ 1,103,400 $ 492,400 $ 122,100 $ 84,900 $ $ $ 1,802,800 Non-cancelable Operating Leases 14,857 11,188 8,911 7,960 4,269 13,919 61,104 Long-term Debt 18,384 2,990 253,298 151,799 250,000 847,867 1,524,338 Total Obligations $ 1,136,641 $ 506,578 $ 384,309 $ 244,659 $ 254,269 $ 861,786 $ 3,388,242 In entering into contractual obligations, we have assumed the risk that might arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts. We mitigate this risk by performing financial assessments prior to contract execution, conducting periodic evaluations of counterparty performance and maintaining a diverse portfolio of qualified counterparties. Our risk is limited to replacing the contracts at prevailing market rates. We do not expect any significant losses resulting from counterparty defaults. Purchase Obligations We enter into certain obligations for the purchase of raw materials. These obligations were primarily in the form of forward contracts for the purchase of raw materials from third-party brokers and dealers. These contracts minimize the effect of future price fluctuations by fixing the price of part or all of these purchase obligations. Total obligations for each year presented above, consists of fixed price contracts for the purchase of commodities and unpriced contracts that were valued using market prices as of December 31, 2008. The cost of commodities associated with the unpriced contracts is variable as market prices change over future periods. We mitigate the variability of these costs to the extent we have entered into commodities futures contracts to hedge our costs for those periods. Increases or decreases in market prices are offset by gains or losses on commodities futures contracts. This applies to the extent that we have hedged the unpriced contracts as of December 31, 2008 and in future periods by entering into commodities futures contracts. Taking delivery of and making payments for the specific commodities for use in the manufacture of finished goods satisfies our obligations under the forward purchase contracts. For each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2008, we satisfied these obligations by taking delivery of and making payment for the specific commodities. 35 Table of Contents Asset Retirement Obligations Our Company has a number of facilities that contain varying amounts of asbestos in certain locations within the facilities. Our asbestos management program is compliant with current applicable regulations. Current regulations require that we handle or dispose of this type of asbestos in a special manner if such facilities undergo major renovations or are demolished. We believe we do not have sufficient information to estimate the fair value of any asset retirement obligations related to these facilities. We cannot specify the settlement date or range of potential settlement dates and, therefore, sufficient information is not available to apply an expected present value technique. We expect to maintain the facilities with repairs and maintenance activities that would not involve or require the removal of asbestos. As of December 31, 2008, certain real estate associated with the closure of facilities under the global supply chain transformation program is being held for sale. We are not aware of any significant obligations related to the environmental remediation of these facilities which has not been reflected in our current estimates. Income Tax Obligations We base our deferred income taxes, accrued income taxes and provision for income taxes upon income, statutory tax rates, the legal structure of our Company and interpretation of tax laws. We are regularly audited by Federal, state and foreign tax authorities. From time to time, these audits result in assessments of additional tax. We maintain reserves for such assessments. We adjust the reserves, from time to time, based upon changing facts and circumstances, such as receiving audit assessments or clearing of an item for which a reserve has been established. Assessments of additional tax require cash payments. We are not aware of any significant income tax assessments. The amount of tax obligations is not included in the table of contractual cash obligations by year on page 35 because we are unable to reasonably predict the ultimate amount or timing of settlement of our reserves for income taxes. ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND MARKET RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS We use certain derivative instruments, from time to time, including interest rate swaps, foreign currency forward exchange contracts and options, and commodities futures and options contracts, to manage interest rate, foreign currency exchange rate and commodity market price risk exposures, respectively. We enter into interest rate swap agreements and foreign exchange forward contracts and options for periods consistent with related underlying exposures. These derivative instruments do not constitute positions independent of those exposures. We enter into commodities futures and options contracts for varying periods. These futures and options contracts are intended to be, and are effective as hedges of market price risks associated with anticipated raw material purchases, energy requirements and transportation costs. We do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to any instruments with leverage or prepayment features. In entering into these contracts, we have assumed the risk that might arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts. We mitigate this risk by performing financial assessments prior to contract execution, conducting periodic evaluations of counterparty performance and maintaining a diverse portfolio of qualified counterparties. We do not expect any significant losses from counterparty defaults. Accounting Under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 We account for derivative instruments in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities , as amended ( SFAS No. 133 ). SFAS No. 133 provides that we report the effective portion of the gain or loss on a derivative instrument designated and qualifying as a cash flow hedging instrument as a component of other comprehensive income. We reclassify the effective portion of the gain or loss on these derivative instruments into income in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. The remaining gain or loss on the derivative instrument resulting from hedge ineffectiveness, if any, must be recognized currently in earnings. 36 Table of Contents Fair value hedges pertain to derivative instruments that qualify as a hedge of exposures to changes in the fair value of a firm commitment or assets and liabilities recognized on the balance sheet. For fair value hedges, we reflect the gain or loss on the derivative instrument in earnings in the period of change together with the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item. The effect of that accounting is to reflect in earnings the extent to which the hedge is not effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value. As of December 31, 2008, we designated and accounted for all derivative instruments, including foreign exchange forward contracts and commodities futures contracts, as cash flow hedges. Additional information regarding accounting policies associated with derivative instruments is contained in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. The information below summarizes our market risks associated with long-term debt and derivative instruments outstanding as of December 31, 2008. Note 1, Note 5 and Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements provide additional information. Long-Term Debt The table below presents the principal cash flows and related interest rates by maturity date for long-term debt, including the current portion, as of December 31, 2008. We determined the fair value of long-term debt based upon quoted market prices for the same or similar debt issues. Maturity Date 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Total Fair Value In thousands of dollars except for rates Long-term Debt $ 18,384 $ 2,990 $ 253,298 $ 151,799 $ 250,000 $ 847,867 $ 1,524,338 $ 1,594,973 Interest Rate 10.0 % 8.5 % 5.4 % 7.0 % 5.0 % 6.2 % 6.0 % We calculated the interest rates on variable rate obligations using the rates in effect as of December 31, 2008. Interest Rate Swaps In order to minimize financing costs and to manage interest rate exposure, from time to time, we enter into interest rate swap agreements. In December 2005, we entered into forward swap agreements to hedge interest rate exposure related to $500 million of term financing to be executed during 2006. In February 2006, we terminated a forward swap agreement hedging the anticipated execution of $250 million of term financing because the transaction was no longer expected to occur by the originally specified time period or within an additional two-month period of time thereafter. We recorded a gain of $1.0 million in the first quarter of 2006 as a result of the discontinuance of this cash flow hedge. In August 2006, a forward swap agreement hedging the anticipated issuance of $250 million of 10-year notes matured resulting in cash receipts of $3.7 million. The $3.7 million gain on the swap will be amortized as a reduction to interest expense over the term of the $250 million of 5.45% Notes due September 1, 2016. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007 we were not a party to any interest rate swap agreements. Foreign Exchange Forward Contracts We enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge transactions denominated in foreign currencies. These transactions are primarily purchase commitments or forecasted purchases of equipment, raw materials and finished goods. We also may hedge payment of forecasted intercompany transactions with our subsidiaries outside the United States. These contracts reduce currency risk from exchange rate movements. We generally hedge foreign currency price risks for periods from 3 to 24 months. 37 Table of Contents Foreign exchange forward contracts are effective as hedges of identifiable, foreign currency commitments. We designate our foreign exchange forward contracts as cash flow hedging derivatives. The fair value of these contracts is classified as either an asset or liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We record gains and losses on these contracts as a component of other comprehensive income and reclassify them into earnings in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. A summary of foreign exchange forward contracts and the corresponding amounts at contracted forward rates is as follows: December 31, 2008 2007 Contract Amount Primary Currencies Contract Amount Primary Currencies In millions of dollars Foreign exchange forward contracts to purchase foreign currencies $0.8 Euros Swiss francs Mexican pesos $13.8 British pounds Australian dollars Euros Foreign exchange forward contracts to sell foreign currencies $68.1 Canadian dollars Australian dollars $86.7 Canadian dollars Brazilian reais Mexican pesos We define the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts as the amount of the difference between the contracted and current market foreign currency exchange rates at the end of the period. We estimate the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts on a quarterly basis by obtaining market quotes of spot and forward rates for contracts with similar terms, adjusted where necessary for maturity differences. A summary of the fair value and market risk associated with foreign exchange forward contracts is as follows: December 31, 2008 2007 In millions of dollars Fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts, net asset (liability) $ 10.3 $ (2.1 ) Potential net loss in fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts of ten percent resulting from a hypothetical near-term adverse change in market rates $ 1.0 $ .2 Our risk related to foreign exchange forward contracts is limited to the cost of replacing the contracts at prevailing market rates. Commodities Price Risk Management and Futures Contracts Our most significant raw material requirements include cocoa products, sugar, dairy products, peanuts and almonds. The cost of cocoa products and prices for related futures contracts historically have been subject to wide fluctuations attributable to a variety of factors. These factors include: the effect of weather on crop yield; imbalances between supply and demand; currency exchange rates; political unrest in producing countries; and speculative influences. 38 Table of Contents We use futures and options contracts in combination with forward purchasing of cocoa products, sugar, corn sweeteners, natural gas, fuel oil and certain dairy products primarily to provide favorable pricing opportunities and flexibility in sourcing our raw material and energy requirements. We attempt to minimize the effect of future price fluctuations related to the purchase of raw materials by using forward purchasing to cover future manufacturing requirements generally for 3 to 24 months. However, the dairy futures markets are not as developed as many of the other commodities markets and, therefore, there are limited opportunities to hedge our costs by taking forward positions to extend coverage beyond three to six months. We use fuel oil futures contracts to minimize price fluctuations associated with our transportation costs. Our commodity procurement practices are intended to reduce the risk of future price increases and provide visibility to future costs, but also may potentially limit our ability to benefit from possible price decreases. During 2008, cocoa prices traded in a range between $.86 and $1.50 per pound, based on the prices of IntercontinentalExchange futures contracts. Cocoa futures traded at prices which were near 30-year highs by mid-year primarily reflecting speculative commodity fund trading activity. During the fourth quarter of 2008, a reduction in anticipated demand associated with deteriorating economic conditions in addition to strengthening of the U.S. dollar in relation to other relevant foreign currencies resulted in the significant liquidation of cocoa futures positions by speculative commodity funds. This resulted in a substantial decrease in cocoa futures market prices near the end of the year. During 2008, dairy prices have come down from unprecedented highs set in 2007, starting the year at nearly $.20 per pound and dropping to $.15 per pound on a class II fluid milk basis. Prices have weakened in response to strong production of milk and dairy products and slowing demand worldwide. We account for commodities futures contracts in accordance with SFAS No. 133. We make or receive cash transfers to or from commodity futures brokers on a daily basis reflecting changes in the value of futures contracts on the IntercontinentalExchange or various other exchanges. These changes in value represent unrealized gains and losses. We report these cash transfers as a component of other comprehensive income. The cash transfers offset higher or lower cash requirements for the payment of future invoice prices of raw materials, energy requirements and transportation costs. Futures held in excess of the amount required to fix the price of unpriced physical forward contracts are effective as hedges of anticipated purchases. Sensitivity Analysis The following sensitivity analysis reflects our market risk to a hypothetical adverse market price movement of ten percent, based on our net commodity positions at four dates spaced equally throughout the year. Our net commodity positions consist of the amount of futures contracts we hold over or under the amount of futures contracts we need to price unpriced physical forward contracts for the same commodities. Inventories, priced forward contracts and estimated anticipated purchases not yet under contract were not included in the sensitivity analysis calculations. We define a loss, for purposes of determining market risk, as the potential decrease in fair value or the opportunity cost resulting from the hypothetical adverse price movement. The fair values of net commodity positions reflect quoted market prices or estimated future prices, including estimated carrying costs corresponding with the future delivery period. For the years ended December 31, 2008 2007 Fair Value Market Risk (Hypothetical 10% Change) Fair Value Market Risk (Hypothetical 10% Change) In millions of dollars Highest long position $ (357.1 ) $ 35.7 $ (112.5 ) $ 11.3 Lowest long position (574.1 ) 57.4 (460.9 ) 46.1 Average position (long) (440.6 ) 44.1 (317.0 ) 31.7 39 Table of Contents The decrease in fair values from 2007 to 2008 primarily reflected a decrease in net commodity positions, which more than offset the impact of higher prices in 2008. The negative positions primarily resulted as unpriced physical forward contract futures requirements exceeded the amount of commodities futures that we held at certain points in time during the years. Sensitivity analysis disclosures represent forward-looking statements which are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those presently anticipated or projected. Factors that could affect the sensitivity analysis disclosures include: significant increases or decreases in market prices reflecting fluctuations attributable to the effect of weather on crop yield; imbalances between supply and demand; currency exchange rates; political unrest in producing countries; speculative influences; and changes in our hedging strategies. USE OF ESTIMATES AND OTHER CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. In various instances, GAAP requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We believe that our most critical accounting policies and estimates relate to the following: Accounts Receivable Trade Accrued Liabilities Pension and Other Post-Retirement Benefits Plans Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Commodities Futures Contracts Management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. While we base estimates and assumptions on our knowledge of current events and actions we may undertake in the future, actual results may ultimately differ from these estimates and assumptions. For a discussion of our significant accounting policies, refer to Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Accounts Receivable Trade In the normal course of business, we extend credit to customers that satisfy pre-defined credit criteria based upon the results of our recurring financial account reviews and our evaluation of the current and projected economic conditions. Our primary concentration of credit risk is associated with McLane Company, Inc., one of the largest wholesale distributors in the United States to convenience stores, drug stores, wholesale clubs and mass merchandisers. McLane Company, Inc. accounted for approximately 27.3% of our total accounts receivable as of December 31, 2008. As of December 31, 2008, no other customer accounted for more than 10% of our total accounts receivable. We believe that we have little concentration of credit risk associated with the remainder of our customer base. 40 Table of Contents Accounts Receivable Trade, as shown on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, were net of allowances and anticipated discounts. An allowance for doubtful accounts is determined through analysis of the following: Aging of accounts receivable at the date of the financial statements; Assessments of collectibility based on historical trends; and Evaluation of the impact of current and projected economic conditions. We monitor the collectibility of our accounts receivable on an ongoing basis by analyzing aged accounts receivable, assessing the credit worthiness of our customers and evaluating the impact of reasonably likely changes in economic conditions that may impact credit risks. Estimates with regard to the collectibility of accounts receivable are reasonably likely to change in the future. Information on our Accounts Receivable Trade, related expenses and assumptions is as follows: For the three-year period 2006-2008 In millions of dollars, except percents Average expense for potential uncollectible accounts $1.0 Average write-offs of uncollectible accounts $1.1 Allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of gross accounts receivable 1% 2% We recognize the provision for uncollectible accounts as selling, marketing and administrative expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. If we made reasonably possible near-term changes in the most material assumptions regarding collectibility of accounts receivable, our annual provision could change within the following range: A reduction in expense of approximately $4.5 million; and An increase in expense of approximately $4.8 million. Changes in estimates for future uncollectible accounts receivable would not have a material impact on our liquidity or capital resources. Accrued Liabilities Accrued liabilities requiring the most difficult or subjective judgments include liabilities associated with marketing promotion programs and potentially unsaleable products. Liabilities associated with marketing promotion programs We recognize the costs of marketing promotion programs as a reduction to net sales along with a corresponding accrued liability based on estimates at the time of revenue recognition. Information on our promotional costs and assumptions is as follows: For the years ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 In millions of dollars Promotional costs $ 766.6 $ 702.1 $ 631.7 We determine the amount of the accrued liability by: Analysis of programs offered; Historical trends; Expectations regarding customer and consumer participation; Sales and payment trends; and 41 Table of Contents Experience with payment patterns associated with similar, previously offered programs. The estimated costs of these programs are reasonably likely to change in the future due to changes in trends with regard to customer and consumer participation, particularly for new programs and for programs related to the introduction of new products. Reasonably possible near-term changes in the most material assumptions regarding the cost of promotional programs could result in changes within the following range: A reduction in costs of approximately $14.5 million An increase in costs of approximately $6.0 million Changes in these assumptions would affect net sales and income before income taxes. Over the three-year period ended December 31, 2008, actual promotion costs have not deviated from the estimated amounts by more than 4%. Changes in estimates related to the cost of promotional programs would not have a material impact on our liquidity or capital resources. Liabilities associated with potentially unsaleable products At the time of sale, we estimate a cost for the possibility that products will become aged or unsaleable in the future. The estimated cost is included as a reduction to net sales. A related accrued liability is determined using statistical analysis that incorporates historical sales trends, seasonal timing and sales patterns, and product movement at retail. Estimates for costs associated with unsaleable products may change as a result of inventory levels in the distribution channel, current economic trends, changes in consumer demand, the introduction of new products and changes in trends of seasonal sales in response to promotional programs. Over the three-year period ended December 31, 2008, costs associated with aged or unsaleable products have amounted to approximately 2% of gross sales. Reasonably possible near-term changes in the most material assumptions regarding the estimates of such costs would have increased or decreased net sales and income before income taxes in a range from $.9 million to $1.8 million. Over the three-year period ended December 31, 2008, actual costs have not deviated from our estimates by more than approximately 1%. Reasonably possible near-term changes in the estimates of costs associated with unsaleable products would not have a material impact on our liquidity or capital resources. Pension and Other Post-Retirement Benefit Plans Overview We sponsor a number of defined benefit pension plans. The primary plans are The Hershey Company Retirement Plan and The Hershey Company Retirement Plan for Hourly Employees. These are cash balance plans that provide pension benefits for most domestic employees hired prior to January 1, 2007. We monitor legislative and regulatory developments regarding cash balance plans, as well as recent court cases, for any impact on our plans. We also sponsor two primary post-retirement benefit plans. The health care plan is contributory, with participants contributions adjusted annually, and the life insurance plan is non-contributory. We fund domestic pension liabilities in accordance with the limits imposed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and Federal income tax laws. Beginning January 1, 2008, we complied with the 42 Table of Contents funding requirements of the Pension Protection Act of 2006. We fund non-domestic pension liabilities in accordance with laws and regulations applicable to those plans. We broadly diversify our pension plan assets, consisting primarily of domestic and international common stocks and fixed income securities. Short-term and long-term liabilities associated with benefit plans are primarily determined based on actuarial calculations. These calculations consider payroll and employee data, including age and years of service, along with actuarial assumptions at the date of the financial statements. We take into consideration long-term projections with regard to economic conditions, including interest rates, return on assets and the rate of increase in compensation levels. With regard to liabilities associated with post-retirement benefit plans that provide health care and life insurance, we take into consideration the long-term annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of the covered benefits. In compliance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions , and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions , we review the discount rate assumptions and may revise them annually. The expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption ( asset return assumption ) for funded plans is by its nature of a longer duration and revised only when long-term asset return projections demonstrate that need. In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132 (R) ( SFAS No. 158 ). SFAS No. 158 requires an employer that is a business entity and sponsors one or more single-employer defined benefit plans to: Recognize the funded status of a benefit plan measured as the difference between plan assets at fair value and the benefit obligation in its statement of financial position. For a pension plan, the benefit obligation is the projected benefit obligation; for any other post-retirement benefit plan, such as a retiree health care plan, the benefit obligation is the accumulated post-retirement benefit obligation. Recognize as a component of other comprehensive income, net of tax, the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise during the period but are not recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost. Measure defined benefit plan assets and obligations as of the date of the employer fiscal year-end statement of financial position. Disclose in the notes to financial statements additional information about certain effects on net periodic benefit cost for the next fiscal year that arise from delayed recognition of the gains or losses, prior service costs or credits, and transition asset or obligation. We adopted the recognition and related disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 158 as of December 31, 2006. Pension Plans Our pension plan costs and related assumptions were as follows: For the years ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 In millions of dollars Net periodic pension benefit (income) costs $ (17.4 ) $ (9.0 ) $ 25.3 Assumptions: Average discount rate assumptions net periodic benefit cost calculation 6.3 % 5.8 % 5.4 % Average discount rate assumptions benefit obligation calculation 6.4 % 6.2 % 5.7 % Asset return assumptions 8.5 % 8.5 % 8.5 % 43 Table of Contents Net Periodic Pension Benefit Costs We recorded net periodic pension benefit income in 2008 primarily due to the modifications announced in October 2006 which reduced future benefits under The Hershey Company Retirement Plan, The Hershey Company Retirement Plan for Hourly Employees and the Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan and the impact of a higher discount rate assumption as of December 31, 2007. We expect to incur periodic pension benefit costs in 2009 of approximately $50 million compared with income of approximately $17.4 million in 2008, principally as a result of the significant decline in the value of pension plan assets during 2008 reflecting the unprecedented volatility and deterioration in financial market and economic conditions. Actuarial gains and losses may arise when actual experience differs from assumed experience or when we revise the actuarial assumptions used to value the plans obligations. We only amortize the unrecognized net actuarial gains/losses in excess of 10% of a respective plan projected benefit obligation, or the fair market value of assets, if greater. The estimated recognized net actuarial loss component of net periodic pension benefit expense for 2009 is $33.6 million. The 2008 recognized net actuarial gain component of net periodic pension benefit income was $.5 million. Projections beyond 2009 are dependent on a variety of factors such as changes to the discount rate and the actual return on pension plan assets. Average Discount Rate Assumption Net Periodic Benefit (Income) Costs The discount rate represents the estimated rate at which we could effectively settle our pension benefit obligations. In order to estimate this rate for 2008 and 2007, a single effective rate of discount was determined by our actuaries after discounting the pension obligation cash flows using the spot rate of matching duration from the Citigroup Pension Discount Curve. The use of a different discount rate assumption can significantly affect net periodic benefit (income) cost: A one-percentage point decrease in the discount rate assumption would have decreased 2008 net periodic pension benefit income by $9.3 million. A one-percentage point increase in the discount rate assumption would have increased 2008 net periodic pension benefit income by $2.6 million. Average Discount Rate Assumption Benefit Obligations The discount rate assumption to be used in calculating the amount of benefit obligations is determined in the same manner as the average discount rate assumption used to calculate net periodic benefit (income) cost as described above. We increased our 2008 discount rate assumption due to the increasing interest rate environment consistent with the duration of our pension plan liabilities. The use of a different discount rate assumption can significantly affect the amount of benefit obligations: A one-percentage point decrease in the discount rate assumption would have increased the December 31, 2008 pension benefits obligations by $96.6 million. A one-percentage point increase in the discount rate assumption would have decreased the December 31, 2008 pension benefits obligations by $81.8 million. 44 Table of Contents Asset Return Assumptions We based the expected return on plan assets component of net periodic pension benefit (income) costs on the fair market value of pension plan assets. To determine the expected return on plan assets, we consider the current and expected asset allocations, as well as historical and expected returns on the categories of plan assets. The historical geometric average return over the 21 years prior to December 31, 2008 was approximately 7.7%. The actual return on assets was as follows: For the years ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Actual (loss) return on assets (24.1 )% 7.1 % 15.7 % The use of a different asset return assumption can significantly affect net periodic benefit (income) cost: A one-percentage point decrease in the asset return assumption would have decreased 2008 net periodic pension benefit income by $13.2 million. A one-percentage point increase in the asset return assumption would have increased 2008 net periodic pension benefit income by $13.0 million. Our asset investment policies specify ranges of asset allocation percentages for each asset class. The ranges for the domestic pension plans were as follows: Asset Class Allocation Range Equity securities 58% 85% Debt securities 15% 42% Cash and certain other investments 0% 5% As of December 31, 2008, actual allocations were within the specified ranges. We expect the level of volatility in pension plan asset returns to be in line with the overall volatility of the markets and weightings within the asset classes. As of December 31, 2008, the benefit plan fixed income assets were invested primarily in conventional instruments benchmarked to the Barclays Capital U.S. Aggregate Bond Index and direct exposure to highly volatile, risky sectors, such as sub-prime mortgages, was minimal. For 2008 and 2007, minimum funding requirements for the plans were not material. However, we made contributions of $32.8 million in 2008 and $15.8 million in 2007 to improve the funded status of our qualified plans and for the payment of benefits under our non-qualified pension plans. These contributions were fully tax deductible. A one-percentage point change in the funding discount rate would not have changed the 2008 minimum funding requirements significantly for the domestic plans. For 2009, there are no significant minimum funding requirements for our pension plans. Post-Retirement Benefit Plans Other post-retirement benefit plan costs and related assumptions were as follows: For the years ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 In millions of dollars Net periodic other post-retirement benefit cost $ 21.6 $ 24.7 $ 28.7 Assumptions: Average discount rate assumption 6.3 % 5.8 % 5.4 % 45 Table of Contents The use of a different discount rate assumption can significantly affect net periodic other post-retirement benefit cost: A one-percentage point decrease in the discount rate assumption would have decreased 2008 net periodic other post-retirement benefit cost by $.6 million. A one-percentage point increase in the discount rate assumption would have increased 2008 net periodic other post-retirement benefit cost by $1.0 million. Other post-retirement benefit obligations and assumptions were as follows: December 31, 2008 2007 In millions of dollars Other post-retirement benefit obligation $ 315.4 $ 362.9 Assumptions: Benefit obligations discount rate assumption 6.4 % 6.2 % A one-percentage point decrease in the discount rate assumption would have increased the December 31, 2008 other post-retirement benefits obligations by $28.1 million. A one-percentage point increase in the discount rate assumption would have decreased the December 31, 2008 other post-retirement benefits obligations by $23.8 million. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets We account for goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets . This standard classifies intangible assets into three categories: (1) intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization; (2) intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization; and (3) goodwill. For intangible assets with definite lives, the standard requires impairment testing if conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. For intangible assets with indefinite lives and for goodwill, the standard requires impairment testing at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that these assets might be impaired. We use a two-step process to evaluate goodwill for impairment. In the first step, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit with the carrying amount of the reporting unit, including goodwill. We estimate the fair value of the reporting unit based on discounted future cash flows. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit, we complete a second step to determine the amount of the goodwill impairment that we should record. In the second step, we determine an implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill by allocating the reporting unit fair value to all of its assets and liabilities other than goodwill (including any unrecognized intangible assets). We compare the resulting implied fair value of the goodwill to the carrying amount and record an impairment charge for the difference. The assumptions we used to estimate fair value are based on the past performance of each reporting unit and reflect the projections and assumptions that we use in current operating plans. We also consider assumptions that market participants may use. Such assumptions are subject to change due to changing economic and competitive conditions. Our other intangible assets consist primarily of customer-related intangible assets, patents and trademarks obtained through business acquisitions. We amortize customer-related intangible assets and patents over their estimated useful lives. The useful lives of trademarks were determined to be indefinite and, therefore, we do not amortize them. We evaluate our trademarks for impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the assets to their estimated fair value. The fair value of trademarks is calculated using a relief from royalty payments methodology. This approach involves two steps. In the first step, we estimate reasonable royalty rates for each 46 Table of Contents trademark. In the second step, we apply these royalty rates to a net sales stream and discount the resulting cash flows to determine fair value. This fair value is then compared with the carrying value of each trademark. If the estimated fair value is less than the carrying amount, we record an impairment charge to reduce the asset to its estimated fair value. The estimates of future cash flows are generally based on past performance of the brands and reflect net sales projections and assumptions for the brands that we use in current operating plans. We also consider assumptions that market participants may use. Such assumptions are subject to change due to changing economic and competitive conditions. The Company performs annual impairment tests in the fourth quarter of each year or when circumstances arise that indicate a possible impairment might exist. Due to reduced expectations for future sales and cash flows compared with the valuations at the acquisition dates, we determined that the carrying amounts of certain trademarks, primarily the Mauna Loa brand, exceeded their estimated fair value and recorded total non-cash impairment charges of $45.7 million in December 2008. As a result of reduced expectations for future cash flows resulting from lower expected profitability, we determined that the carrying amount of our wholly-owned subsidiary, Hershey do Brasil, exceeded its fair value and recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $12.3 million in December 2007. There was no tax benefit associated with these charges. We discuss the impairment testing results in more detail in Note 1 and Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We determined that none of our goodwill or other intangible assets, with the exception of the aforementioned trademarks and Brazil goodwill, were impaired as of December 31, 2008 and 2007 based on our annual impairment evaluation. Commodities Futures and Options Contracts We use futures and options contracts in combination with forward purchasing of cocoa products and other commodities primarily to reduce the risk of future price increases, provide visibility to future costs and take advantage of market fluctuations. Accounting for commodities futures and options contracts is in accordance with SFAS No. 133. Additional information with regard to accounting policies associated with commodities futures and options contracts and other derivative instruments is contained in Note 5, Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. Our gains (losses) on cash flow hedging derivatives were as follows: For the years ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 In millions of dollars Net after-tax gains on cash flow hedging derivatives $ 11.5 $ 6.8 $ 11.4 Reclassification adjustments from accumulated other comprehensive loss to income (34.1 ) .2 (5.3 ) Hedge ineffectiveness (losses) gains recognized in cost of sales, before tax (.1 ) (.5 ) 2.0 We reflected reclassification adjustments related to gains or losses on commodities futures and options contracts in cost of sales. No gains or losses on commodities futures and options contracts resulted because we discontinued a hedge due to the probability that the forecasted hedged transaction would not occur. We recognized no components of gains or losses on commodities futures and options contracts in income due to excluding such components from the hedge effectiveness assessment. The amount of net losses on cash flow hedging derivatives, including foreign exchange forward contracts and commodities futures and options contracts, expected to be reclassified into earnings in the next twelve months was approximately $17.0 million after tax as of December 31, 2008. This amount is primarily associated with commodities futures contracts. 47 Table of Contents RETURN MEASURES We believe that two important measures of profitability are operating return on average stockholders equity and operating return on average invested capital. These operating return measures calculated in accordance with GAAP are presented on the SIX-YEAR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL SUMMARY on page 18 with the directly comparable Non-GAAP operating return measures. The Non-GAAP operating return measures are calculated using Non-GAAP Income excluding items affecting comparability. A reconciliation of Net Income presented in accordance with GAAP to Non-GAAP Income excluding items affecting comparability is provided on pages 19 and 20, along with the reasons why we believe that the use of Non-GAAP Income in these calculations provides useful information to investors. Operating Return on Average Stockholders Equity Operating return on average stockholders equity is calculated by dividing net income by the average of beginning and ending stockholders equity. To calculate Non-GAAP operating return on average stockholders equity, we define Non-GAAP Income as net income adjusted to exclude certain items. These items include the following: After-tax effect of the business realignment and impairment charges in 2008, 2007, 2006, 2005 and 2003 Adjustment to income tax contingency reserves which reduced the provision for income taxes in 2004 After-tax gain on the sale of a group of our gum brands in 2003 Our operating return on average stockholders equity, GAAP basis, was 68.4% in 2008. Our Non-GAAP operating return on average stockholders equity was 94.5% in 2008. The increase in operating return on average stockholders equity in 2008 compared with 2007 was principally due to a reduction in equity related to reduced pension plan assets and the impact of cumulative translation adjustments. Over the last six years, our Non-GAAP operating return on stockholders equity has ranged from 33.2% in 2003 to 94.5% in 2008. Operating Return on Average Invested Capital Operating return on average invested capital is calculated by dividing earnings by average invested capital. Average invested capital consists of the annual average of the beginning and ending balances of long-term debt, deferred income taxes and stockholders equity. For the calculation of operating return on average invested capital, GAAP basis, earnings is defined as net income adjusted to add back the after-tax effect of interest on long-term debt. For the calculation of the Non-GAAP operating return measure, we define earnings as net income adjusted to add back the after-tax effect of interest on long-term debt excluding the following: After-tax effect of the business realignment and impairment charges in 2008, 2007, 2006, 2005 and 2003 Adjustment to income tax contingency reserves on the provision for income taxes in 2004 After-tax gain on the sale of a group of our gum brands in 2003 Our operating return on average invested capital, GAAP basis, was 19.0% in 2008. Our Non-GAAP operating return on average invested capital was 25.1% in 2008. Over the last six years, our Non-GAAP operating return on average invested capital has ranged from 18.9% in 2003 to 26.8% in 2005 and 2006. 48 Table of Contents OUTLOOK The outlook section contains a number of forward-looking statements, all of which are based on current expectations. Actual results may differ materially. Refer to Risk Factors beginning on page 10 for information concerning the key risks to achieving our future performance goals. During 2008, we announced a new consumer-driven business model with a comprehensive approach intended to deliver sustainable growth over the coming years. Our financial targets include long-term consolidated net sales growth in the three to five percent range and increases in earnings per share-diluted, excluding items affecting comparability, at an annual rate of six to eight percent. Items affecting comparability include business realignment and impairment charges and credits, gains or losses on the sale of certain businesses, and certain other items. Our net sales growth will primarily leverage our core portfolio of brands in the United States. We expect to improve our price-value equation through package and product upgrades and merchandising innovation resulting in increased price realization. We also expect growth from our international businesses primarily in faster-growing emerging markets. For 2009, we expect net sales growth of two to three percent from our pricing actions and core brand sales growth. We expect unit sales volume to decline in the United States due to the elasticity effects of price increases implemented during 2008 which will result in higher everyday and promoted prices for consumers. The impact of the declines in unit sales volume is expected to be more than offset by price realization. We expect growth in net sales for our international business at rates greater than in the United States, offset somewhat by the impact of unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates. Considering the significant increases in raw material prices and other input costs and the extreme volatility in market prices, we expect substantial cost increases in 2009. While commodity spot prices have moderated somewhat, we expect costs for our key inputs to remain volatile and above historical averages on a spot basis. We now expect our commodity cost basket to increase by approximately $175 million in 2009 compared with 2008. The financial market and credit crisis have not had a material affect on our business operations or liquidity to-date. However, the extraordinary decline in the financial markets in 2008 significantly reduced the fair value of our pension plan assets which is expected to result in an increase in 2009 pension expense of approximately $70 million. Despite these increases we plan to continue to invest in our core brands in the U.S. and key international markets to build on our momentum. Specifically, advertising expense is expected to increase by $30 million to $35 million in 2009. These cost increases will be more than offset by higher net pricing, savings from the global supply chain transformation program and on-going operating productivity improvement. Earnings per share-diluted, excluding items affecting comparability, is expected to increase in 2009, however, due to the significant commodity and pension cost increases, higher levels of core brand investment spending and current macroeconomic conditions, we expect growth to be at a rate below our long-term objective of six to eight percent. For 2009, we expect total pre-tax business realignment and impairment charges for our global supply chain transformation program, including the increase in the scope of the program, to be in the range of $45 million to $70 million, excluding possible increases in pension settlement charges discussed below. Total charges associated with our business realignment initiatives in 2009 are expected to reduce earnings per share-diluted by $0.13 to $0.20. Outlook for Global Supply Chain Transformation Program We expect total pre-tax charges and non-recurring project implementation costs for the global supply chain transformation program to be at the upper end of the $575 million to $600 million range. This includes pension settlement charges recorded in 2007 and 2008 as required in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards 49 Table of Contents Board Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 88, Employers Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination Benefits (as amended) ( SFAS No. 88 ). Pension settlement charges are non-cash charges for the Company. Such charges accelerate the recognition of pension expenses related to actuarial gains and losses resulting from interest rate changes and differences in actual versus assumed returns on pension assets. The Company normally amortizes actuarial gains and losses over a period of about 13 years. The global supply chain transformation program charges recorded in 2007 and in 2008 have included pension settlement charges of approximately $24.6 million as employees leaving the Company under the program have been withdrawing lump sums from the defined benefit pension plans. These charges are included in the current global supply chain transformation program estimates of $575 million to $600 million. In addition to the settlement charges reflected above, additional SFAS No. 88 pension settlement charges of up to $65 million may be incurred depending on decisions of impacted hourly employees to withdraw funds during 2009 and 2010. The amount of the potential charges has increased significantly as a result of the recent declines in the financial markets. The likely range of possible additional charges for 2009` is zero to $50 million. There would be no charge if withdrawals by hourly employees are below the SFAS No. 88 settlement threshold level and $50 million, based on current market conditions, if they are above the threshold level. SUBSEQUENT EVENT On February 16, 2009, we announced that Kenneth L. Wolfe, our non-executive Chairman of the Board of Directors, had resigned from our Board effective immediately. His resignation followed a request from the Milton Hershey School Trust that he not stand for re-election at our annual meeting of stockholders on April 30, 2009. The Milton Hershey School Trust indicated that it wanted to have one of its representatives on our Board serve as Chairman of the Board. Our Board of Directors also announced its unanimous election of Director James E. Nevels to succeed Mr. Wolfe as non-executive Chairman of our Board of Directors. Mr. Nevels has served on our Board since November 2007. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations ( SFAS No. 141(R) ). The objective of SFAS No. 141(R) is to improve the relevance, representational faithfulness, and comparability of the information that a reporting entity provides in its financial reports about a business combination and its effects. SFAS No. 141(R) establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer: Recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree; Recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase; Determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination. SFAS No. 141(R) is effective for our Company as of January 1, 2009. We currently do not expect any significant impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows as a result of the adoption of this new accounting standard. However, the adoption of SFAS No. 141(R) will impact the accounting for any business combinations occurring subsequent to December 31, 2008. 50 Table of Contents In December 2007, the FASB also issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, an amendment of ARB No. 51 ( SFAS No. 160 ). The objective of SFAS No. 160 is to improve the relevance, comparability and transparency of the financial information that a reporting entity provides in its consolidated financial statements by establishing accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. SFAS No. 160 is effective for our Company as of January 1, 2009. We do not expect any significant impact on financial accounting or reporting as a result of the adoption of this new accounting standard. In March 2008, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133 ( SFAS No. 161 ). SFAS No. 161 requires enhanced disclosures about an entity derivative and hedging activities. Entities will be required to provide enhanced disclosures about how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, how these instruments are accounted for, and how they affect the entity financial position, financial performance and cash flows. This new standard is effective for our Company as of January 1, 2009 and we are currently evaluating the impact on disclosures associated with our derivative and hedging activities. In May 2008, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 162, The Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( SFAS No. 162 ). SFAS No. 162 identifies the sources of accounting principles and the framework for selecting the principles used in the preparation of financial statements of nongovernmental entities that are presented in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. We do not expect any significant changes to our financial accounting and reporting as a result of the issuance of SFAS No. 162.
