This investigation is pending. DCC Investigation. All issues relating to intra-regional or domestic consumer debit and credit card transactions acquired in the EEA were settled by commitments offered by Visa Europe Limited in 2010 and 2014 respectively, and endorsed by the EC. Those commitments have now expired, but the European Union rates on which those commitments were applied remain subject to limits imposed by the European Interchange Fee Regulation. The EC continues to claim that inter-regional interchange fees violate EEA competition law and may impose fines in the event that it adopts an infringement decision. The potential amount of any fine cannot be estimated at this time. The EC may also require Visa to reduce the default inter-regional interchange rates the Company sets, revise the Visa operating rules or the way in which the Company enforces its rules, or otherwise modify the way the Company does business. Visa responded in writing to the revised SSO in November 2017 and an oral hearing was held in February 2018. Visa continues to cooperate with the EC in its investigation. Following the issuance of a Statement of Objections in 2009 concerning, among other things, the alleged default application of Visa Inc. inter-regional interchange fees to intra-regional and domestic consumer debit and credit card transactions in the European Economic Area (EEA), the European Commission (EC) served a Supplementary Statement of Objections (SSO) on Visa Inc. and Visa International in 2013 and a revised SSO in August 2017.

Standstill agreements have been entered into with respect to some of those Merchants claims.

The Company has learned that several additional European entities have indicated that they may also bring similar claims and the Company anticipates additional claims in the future. 30 In addition, over separate MasterCard cases also involving interchange claims. On July 4, 2018, the Court of Appeal overturned the lower court rulings, finding that Visa UK domestic interchange restricted competition and the question of whether Visa UK domestic interchange was exempt from the finding of restriction under applicable law had been incorrectly decided. The Court of Appeal remitted the claim to the lower court to reconsider the exemption issue and the assessment of damages. On July 31, 2018, both Visa and the Merchant applied for permission to appeal aspects of the Court of Appeal judgment to the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom. two A trial took place from November 2016 to March 2017, relating to claims asserted by only one Merchant. In judgments published in November 2017 and February 2018, the court found as to that Merchant that Visa UK domestic interchange did not restrict competition, but that if it had been found to be restrictive it would not be exemptible under applicable law. In April 2018, the Court of Appeal heard the Merchant appeal of the decision alongside Merchants with outstanding claims. 300 Merchants, leaving more than 75 Merchants (the capitalized term Merchant, when used in this section, means a merchant together with subsidiary/affiliate companies that are party to the same claim) have commenced proceedings against Visa Europe, Visa Inc. and Visa International primarily relating to interchange rates in Europe.

The Company could incur judgments, enter into settlements or revise its expectations regarding the outcome of merchants claims, and such developments could have a material adverse effect on the Company financial results in the period in which the effect becomes probable and reasonably estimable.

In addition, some of the cases seek an injunction against the setting of default interchange rates; certain Visa operating rules relating to merchants, including the honor-all-cards rule; and various transaction fees, including the fixed acquirer network fee.

Thereafter, a new group of purported class plaintiffs, acting on behalf of the putative Injunctive Relief Class, filed a class action complaint seeking declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as attorneys fees.

U.S. Retrospective Responsibility Plan Note 2 U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans September 30, 2018 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) VISA INC. Table of Contents 70 In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-15, which requires implementation costs incurred by customers in cloud computing arrangements to be deferred and recognized over the term of the arrangement, if those costs would be capitalized by the customer in a software licensing arrangement under the internal-use software guidance. The standard will be effective for the Company on October 1, 2020. However, the Company is evaluating the effect that ASU 2018-15 will have on its consolidated financial statements and is considering early adoption of the standard. In March 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-05 to insert the SEC interpretive guidance from Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 into the income tax accounting codification under U.S. GAAP. The ASU permits companies to use provisional amounts for certain income tax effects of the Tax Act during a one-year measurement period. The provisional accounting impacts for the Company may change in future reporting periods until the accounting analysis is finalized, which will occur no later than the first quarter of fiscal 2019. In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-02, which allows a reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings for adjustments to tax effects that were originally recorded in other comprehensive income due to changes in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate resulting from the enactment of the U.S. tax reform legislation, commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act ). The Company will adopt the standard effective October 1, 2019. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In May 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-09, which amends the scope of modification accounting for share-based payment arrangements. Specifically, an entity would not apply modification accounting if the fair value, vesting conditions, and classification of the awards are the same immediately before and after the modification. The Company will adopt the standard effective October 1, 2018. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-07, which requires that the service cost component of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost be presented in the same line item as other employee compensation costs, while the other components be presented separately as non-operating income (expense). Currently, all net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs are presented in personnel expense on the Company consolidated statement of operations. The Company will adopt the standard effective October 1, 2018. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, which requires that a statement of cash flows includes the total of cash, cash equivalents, and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts. The Company will adopt the standard effective October 1, 2018. The adoption will impact the presentation of transactions related to the U.S. litigation escrow account on the consolidated statements of cash flows. In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16, which requires that entities recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset, other than inventory, when the transfer occurs. The Company will adopt the standard effective October 1, 2018. The Adoption is not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. September 30, 2018 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) VISA INC. Table of Contents 69 In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-07, which eliminates the requirement that an entity retroactively adopt the equity method of accounting if an investment qualifies for use of the equity method as a result of an increase in the level of ownership or degree of influence. The equity method investor is required to add the cost of acquiring the additional interest in the investee to the current basis of the investor previously held interest and adopt the equity method of accounting as of the date the investment becomes qualified for equity method accounting. The Company adopted the standard effective October 1, 2017. The adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-06, which clarifies the requirements for assessing whether contingent call/put options that can accelerate the payment of principal on debt instruments are clearly and closely related to their debt hosts. An entity performing the assessment is required to assess the embedded call/put options solely in accordance with a four-step decision sequence. The Company adopted the standard effective October 1, 2017. The adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. , does not, in and of itself, require dedesignation of that hedging relationship provided that all other hedge accounting criteria continue to be met. The Company adopted the standard effective October 1, 2017. The adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. Derivatives and Hedging In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-05, which clarifies that a change in the counterparty to a derivative instrument that has been designated as the hedging instrument under Topic 815, In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, which requires the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities arising from operating leases in the statement of financial position. The Company will adopt the standard effective October 1, 2019 and does not anticipate that this new accounting guidance will have a material impact on its consolidated statement of operations. The Company estimates the value of leased assets and liabilities that may be recognized could be in the hundreds of millions of dollars. The actual impact will depend on the Company lease portfolio at the time of adoption. In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-11, which provides entities with an additional transition method to adopt the new leases standard. Under this new transition method, an entity initially applies the new leases standard at the adoption date and recognizes a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption. Consequently, an entity reporting for the comparative periods presented in the financial statements will continue to be in accordance with the current leases standard. The optional transition method does not change the existing disclosure requirements. The Company is evaluating the effect that ASU 2018-11 will have on its consolidated financial statements. In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, which amends certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments, including the requirement to measure certain equity investments at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. The Company will adopt the standard effective October 1, 2018. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. The Company has completed an assessment of its existing customer contracts through September 30, 2018. Based on this assessment, application of the new standard to the consolidated financial statements for fiscal 2018 would not have resulted in a material impact. The impact of the new standard to future financial results is unknowable as it is not possible to estimate the impact of the standard to new customer contracts which may be executed in future periods. However, the new standard is not expected to have a material impact to the fiscal 2019 consolidated financial statements. In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09, which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of goods or services to customers. The ASU will replace existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective. Subsequently, the FASB also issued a series of amendments to the new revenue standard. The Company will adopt the standard effective October 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective transition method. The new standard will primarily impact the timing of recognition and classification of certain client incentives, including certain services provided as an incentive, and certain marketing-related funds paid to customers. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements September 30, 2018 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) VISA INC. Table of Contents 68 . Note 12 Earnings Per Share . The Company calculates earnings per share using the two-class method to reflect the different rights of each class and series of outstanding common stock. The dilutive effect of incremental common stock equivalents is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method. See Earnings per share . Note 13 Share-based Compensation . The Company recognizes share-based compensation cost using the fair value method of accounting. The Company recognizes compensation cost for awards with only service conditions on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period. Compensation cost for performance and market-condition-based awards is recognized on a graded-vesting basis. The amount is initially estimated based on target performance and is adjusted as appropriate based on management best estimate throughout the performance period. See Share-based compensation . Note 9 Derivative and Non-derivative Financial Instruments The Company designated the euro-denominated deferred cash consideration liability, a non-derivative financial instrument, as a hedge against a portion of the Company euro-denominated net investment in Visa Europe. Changes in the value of the deferred cash consideration liability, attributable to the change in exchange rates at the end of each reporting period, partially offset the foreign currency translation adjustments resulting from the euro-denominated net investment, are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss on the Company consolidated balance sheets. See Non-derivative financial instrument designated as a net investment hedge. . Note 9 Derivative and Non-derivative Financial Instruments Derivatives are carried at fair value on a gross basis in either prepaid and other current assets, non-current other assets, accrued liabilities or non-current other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. At September 30, 2018, derivatives outstanding mature within 12 months or less. Gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value of designated derivative instruments are accounted for either in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss on the consolidated balance sheets, or in the consolidated statements of operations in the corresponding account where revenue or expense is hedged, or to general and administrative for hedge amounts determined to be ineffective. Gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value of derivative instruments not designated for hedge accounting are recorded in general and administrative for hedges of operating activity, or non-operating income (expense) for hedges of non-operating activity. See . The Company uses foreign exchange forward derivative contracts to reduce its exposure to foreign currency rate changes on forecasted non-functional currency denominated operational cash flows. To qualify for cash flow hedge accounting treatment, the Company formally documents, at inception of the hedge, all relationships between the hedging transactions and the hedged items, as well as the Company risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedging transactions. The Company also formally assesses whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of the hedged items and whether those derivatives may be expected to remain highly effective in future periods. Derivative financial instruments Where a non-U.S. currency is the functional currency, translation from that functional currency to the U.S. dollar is performed for balance sheet accounts using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and for revenue and expense accounts using an average exchange rate for the period. Resulting translation adjustments are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss on the consolidated balance sheets. . The Company functional currency is the U.S. dollar for the majority of its foreign operations except for Visa Europe whose functional currency is the euro. Transactions denominated in currencies other than the applicable functional currency are converted to the functional currency at the exchange rate on the transaction date. At period end, monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured to the functional currency using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Resulting foreign currency transaction gains and losses related to conversion and remeasurement are recorded in general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations and were not material for fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016. Foreign currency remeasurement and translation . Note 7 Pension, Postretirement and Other Benefits The Company recognizes the funded status of its benefit plans in its consolidated balance sheets as other assets, accrued liabilities and other liabilities. The Company recognizes settlement losses when it settles pension benefit obligations, including making lump-sum cash payments to plan participants in exchange for their rights to receive specified pension benefits, when certain thresholds are met. See September 30, 2018 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) VISA INC. Table of Contents 67 years for the Visa Europe UK pension plan. Other assumptions involve demographic factors such as retirement age, mortality, attrition and the rate of compensation increases. The Company evaluates assumptions annually and modifies them as appropriate. 11 years for the U.S. plans and 9 corridor is recognized in net periodic pension cost over the expected average employee future service period, which is approximately 10% . The Company defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans are actuarially evaluated, incorporating various critical assumptions including the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets (for qualified pension plans). The discount rate is based on a cash flow matching analysis, with the projected benefit payments matching spot rates from a yield curve developed from high-quality corporate bonds. The expected rate of return on pension plan assets considers the current and expected asset allocation, as well as historical and expected returns on each plan asset class. Any difference between actual and expected plan experience, including asset return experience, in excess of a Pension and other postretirement benefit plans . Note 16 Income Taxes Where interpretation of the tax law may be uncertain, the Company recognizes, measures and discloses income tax uncertainties. The Company accounts for interest expense and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as non-operating expense in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company files a consolidated federal income tax return and, in certain states, combined state tax returns. The Company elects to claim foreign tax credits in any given year if such election is beneficial to the Company. See . The Company income tax expense consists of two components: current and deferred. Current income tax expense represents taxes paid or payable for the current period. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized to reflect the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the respective tax basis of existing assets and liabilities, and operating loss and credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. In assessing whether deferred tax assets are realizable, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. A valuation allowance is recorded for the portions that are not expected to be realized based on the level of historical taxable income, projections of future taxable income over the periods in which the temporary differences are deductible, and qualifying tax planning strategies. Income taxes The Company expenses costs for the production of advertising as incurred. The cost of media advertising is expensed when the advertising takes place. Sponsorship costs are recognized over the period in which the Company benefits from the sponsorship rights. Promotional items are expensed as incurred, when the related services are received, or when the related event occurs. Marketing. The Company enters into long-term contracts with financial institution clients, merchants and strategic partners for various programs designed to increase revenue by growing payments volume, increasing Visa product acceptance, winning merchant routing transactions over to Visa network and driving innovation. These incentives are primarily accounted for as reductions to operating revenues or as operating expenses if a separate identifiable benefit at fair value can be established. The Company generally capitalizes advance incentive payments under these agreements if select criteria are met. The capitalization criteria include the existence of future economic benefits to Visa, the existence of legally enforceable recoverability language (e.g., early termination clauses), management ability and intent to enforce the recoverability language and the ability to generate future earnings from the agreement in excess of amounts deferred. Capitalized amounts are amortized over the shorter of the period of contractual recoverability or the corresponding period of economic benefit. Incentives not yet paid are accrued systematically and rationally based on management estimate of each client performance. These accruals are regularly reviewed and estimates of performance are adjusted, as appropriate, based on changes in performance expectations, actual client performance, amendments to existing contracts or the execution of new contracts. Client incentives. Other revenues consist mainly of license fees for use of the Visa brand, fees for account holder services, licensing and certification and other activities related to the Company acquired entities. Other revenues also include optional service or product enhancements, such as extended account holder protection and concierge services. Other revenues are recognized in the same period the related transactions occur or services are rendered. Prior to the acquisition of Visa Europe, other revenues also included revenues earned from Visa Europe in connection with the Visa Europe Framework Agreement.

Cross-border transactions arise when the country of origin of the issuer is different from that of the merchant. International transaction revenues are primarily generated by cross-border payments and cash volume. Data processing revenues consist of revenues earned for authorization, clearing, settlement, network access and other maintenance and support services that facilitate transaction and information processing among the Company clients globally. Data processing revenues are recognized in the same period the related transactions occur or services are rendered. Service revenues consist of revenues earned for services provided in support of client usage of Visa products. Current quarter service revenues are primarily assessed using a calculation of current pricing applied to the prior quarter payments volume. The Company also earns revenues from assessments designed to support ongoing acceptance and volume growth initiatives, which are recognized in the same period the related volume is transacted. . The Company operating revenues consist of service revenues, data processing revenues, international transaction revenues and other revenues, reduced by costs incurred under client incentives arrangements. The Company recognizes revenue, net of sales and other similar taxes, when the price is fixed or determinable, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the service is performed and collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. Revenue recognition . Note 17 Legal Matters . The Company evaluates the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome in legal or regulatory proceedings to which it is a party and records a loss contingency when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. These judgments are subjective, based on the status of such legal or regulatory proceedings, the merits of the Company defenses and consultation with corporate and external legal counsel. Actual outcomes of these legal and regulatory proceedings may differ materially from the Company estimates.

Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized but are evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may exist. The Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets. The Company assesses each category of indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an aggregate basis, which may require the allocation of cash flows and/or an estimate of fair value to the assets or asset group. Impairment exists if the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than the carrying value. The Company relies on a number of factors when completing impairment assessments, including a review of discounted net future cash flows, business plans and the use of present value techniques. . Note 5 Intangible Assets and Goodwill . See September 30, 2018 years. No events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment existed as of 15 to 3 Finite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of customer relationships, reacquired rights, reseller relationships and trade names obtained through acquisitions.

If the sum of expected undiscounted net future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of an asset or asset group, an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds its fair value. See Technology includes purchased and internally developed software, including technology assets obtained through acquisitions. Internally developed software represents software primarily used by the VisaNet electronic payments network. Internal and external costs incurred during the preliminary project stage are expensed as incurred. Qualifying costs incurred during the application development stage are capitalized. Once the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use these costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the technology estimated useful life. Acquired technology assets are initially recorded at fair value and amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life. years.

Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. A company internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm (Continued) Table of Contents 54 Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Visa Inc. management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for their assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.

A material adverse decline in the value of pension plan assets and/or in the discount rate for benefit obligations would result in a decrease in the funded status of the pension plan, an increase in pension cost and an increase in required funding. A hypothetical $0.4 billion and $0.5 billion at each year end, and projected benefit obligations were $0.4 billion , our non-U.S. defined benefit pension plan assets were 2017 and September 30, 2018 At in pension cost. $35 million in the funded status and an increase of approximately $206 million decrease in the discount rate would result in an aggregate decrease of approximately 1% decrease in the value of pension plan assets and a 10% , respectively. A material adverse decline in the value of pension plan assets and/or in the discount rate for benefit obligations would result in a decrease in the funded status of the pension plan, an increase in pension cost and an increase in required funding. A hypothetical $0.9 billion and $0.8 billion at each year end, and projected benefit obligations were $1.1 billion , our U.S. defined benefit pension plan assets were 2017 and September 30, 2018 At Pension Plan Risk , respectively. 2017 and September 30, 2018 at $1.8 billion and $3.5 billion . The fair value balances of our adjustable-rate debt securities were September 30, 2018 on our investment securities at $31 million , respectively. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would create an estimated change in fair value of approximately $6.4 billion and $5.1 billion were 2017 and September 30, 2018 The fair value balances of our fixed-rate investment securities at Our investment portfolio assets are held in both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate securities. These assets are included in cash equivalents and short-term or long-term available-for-sale investments. Investments in fixed-rate instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk. The fair value of fixed-rate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates. Additionally, a falling-rate environment creates reinvestment risk because as securities mature, the proceeds are reinvested at a lower rate, generating less interest income. Historically, we have been able to hold investments until maturity. Neither our operating results or cash flows have been, nor are they expected to be, materially impacted by a sudden change in market interest rates. Interest Rate Risk We are also subject to foreign currency exchange risk in daily settlement activities. This risk arises from the timing of rate setting for settlement with clients relative to the timing of market trades for balancing currency positions. Risk in settlement activities is limited through daily operating procedures, including the utilization of Visa settlement systems and our interaction with foreign exchange trading counterparties. of this report.

Changes in the value of the deferred cash consideration liability, attributable to a change in exchange rates at the end of each reporting period, partially offset the foreign currency translation of the Company net investment recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income in the Company consolidated balance sheets. See September 30, 2018 in Visa Europe as of $18.8 billion . We designate a portion of our euro-denominated deferred consideration liability as a net investment hedge against a portion of the foreign exchange rate exposure of our net investment of $2.0 billion , would result in a foreign currency translation adjustment of September 30, 2018 change in the euro against the U.S. dollar compared to the exchange rate at 10% We are further exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk as the functional currency of Visa Europe is the euro. Translation from the euro to the U.S. dollar is performed for balance sheet accounts using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and for revenue and expense accounts using an average exchange rate for the period. Resulting translation adjustments are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss on the consolidated balance sheets. A hypothetical Table of Contents 51 , including interest. $130 million , would increase the deferred purchase consideration liability by September 30, 2018 decline in the U.S. dollar against the euro, compared to the exchange rate at 10% compounded annual interest. As such, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to fluctuations of the U.S. dollar against the euro.

However, actual results could materially differ from our forecast. The effect of a hypothetical September 30, 2018 , respectively.
