Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ORGANIZATION OF INFORMATION The following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD&A") was prepared to provide the reader with a view and perspective of our businesses through the eyes of management and should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes to those financial statements. Our MD&A is presented in the following sections: Executive Summary and Financial Highlights Results of Operations Restructuring and Other Charges Operating Segment Results Liquidity and Capital Resources Contractual Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments Off Balance Sheet Financing Application of Critical Accounting Estimates Recently Adopted and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements EXECUTIVE SUMMARY AND FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS We are a global power leader that designs, manufactures, distributes and services diesel and natural gas engines, electric power generation systems and engine-related component products, including filtration, exhaust aftertreatment, fuel systems, controls and air handling systems. We sell our products to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), distributors and other customers worldwide. We have long-standing relationships with many of the leading manufacturers in the markets we serve, including PACCAR Inc., Daimler Trucks North America, Chrysler Group, LLC, Volvo AB, Ford Motor Company, Komatsu, MAN Nutzfahrzeuge AG (formerly Volkswagen) and Case New Holland. We serve our customers through a network of more than 500 company-owned and independent distributor locations and approximately 5,200 dealer locations in more than 190 countries and territories. Our reportable operating segments consist of the following: Engine, Power Generation, Components and Distribution. This reporting structure is organized according to the products and markets each segment serves and allows management to focus its efforts on providing enhanced service to a wide range of customers. The Engine segment produces engines and parts for sale to customers in on-highway and various industrial markets. The engines are used in trucks of all sizes, buses and recreational vehicles, as well as various industrial applications including construction, mining, agriculture, marine, oil and gas, rail and military. The Power Generation segment is an integrated provider of power systems which sells engines, generator sets and alternators. The Components segment sells filtration products, exhaust aftertreatment systems, turbochargers and fuel systems. The Distribution segment includes wholly-owned and partially-owned distributorships engaged in wholesaling engines, generator sets and service parts, as well as performing service and repair activities on our products and maintaining relationships with various OEMs throughout the world. Our financial performance depends, in large part, on varying conditions in the markets we serve, particularly the on-highway, construction and general industrial markets. Demand in these markets tends to fluctuate in response to overall economic conditions and is particularly sensitive to changes in interest rate levels and our customers' access to credit. Our sales may also be impacted by OEM inventory levels and production schedules and stoppages. Economic downturns in markets we serve 29 Table of Contents generally result in reductions in sales and pricing of our products. As a worldwide business, our operations are also affected by political, economic and regulatory matters, including environmental and emissions standards, in the countries we serve. At the same time, our geographic diversity and broad product and service offerings have helped limit the impact from a drop in demand in any one industry or customer and the economy of any single country on our consolidated results. The global economic downturn in 2009 extensively challenged most of our businesses and the markets in which they operate. All of our operating segments incurred double digit declines in net sales and three business units incurred a decrease in EBIT ranging from 44 percent to 56 percent. Our joint ventures throughout the world also experienced severe downturns in operating results causing income from equity investees to decline 15 percent. We experienced significant decreases in market demand for many of our products. The challenging worldwide economy impacted all of our business units in different ways. Our Power Generation and Distribution businesses, which have longer lead times, began to see declines in 2009 while our other businesses started to experience declines in the second half of 2008, especially in the fourth quarter. Demand in most of our markets around the world appears to have reached bottom and we believe those markets have stabilized at these lower levels. We are also seeing improvements in emerging markets including China, India and Brazil. The economy in the United States (U.S.), while showing some signs of recovery, still remains fragile and unemployment continues to remain high. In the second half of 2009, we experienced increased sales in our global engine markets and in North America, we experienced a temporary increase in engine (and related component) demand prior to the 2010 emissions standard change. The increased demand was consistent with sales trends we observed in prior emissions implementations and was the primary reason for sales to U.S. markets increasing to 48 percent of total net sales in 2009, compared with 41 percent of total net sales in 2008. Throughout the year, we took actions to align our businesses with reduced customer demand, particularly in the first nine months of 2009. These actions included global workforce reductions and closing certain manufacturing operations. Costs associated with these restructuring actions, in conjunction with significantly reduced demand and volumes, negatively impacted our operating results in 2009 compared to 2008 and 2007 results. At the same time, we took actions which enabled us to end the year with a stronger balance sheet. We closely monitored our receivables and customer relationships, reduced inventories 25 percent, reduced capital expenditures 43 percent and increased our cash and marketable securities by over $0.6 billion, generating over $1.1 billion in cash from operations. At the same time, we lowered our debt to capital ratio, maintained our credit ratings, improved our pension funding through increased contributions and strong returns and our $1.1 billion line of credit remains unused. As a result of the temporary increase in sales in the second half of 2009, and the challenging economy, we expect new Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) emission compliant engine and component demand will be weak in the first half of 2010. Excluding the emerging markets, we expect overall demand in most of our businesses to remain at relatively low levels for the first half of 2010. While we expect overall demand for most of our products to be weak in the first half of 2010, with some improvements in demand in emerging markets, the actions that we initiated in late 2008 and throughout 2009 will continue to enable us to navigate through the challenging economic environment and will position us to respond to market conditions when and where they improve. Our short term priorities remain: continue to earn a solid profit; continue to align our cost structure and manufacturing capacity with real demand for our products; continue to invest in critical technologies, products and capacity; and continue to demonstrate that we care about our customers more than anyone else. 30 Table of Contents Net income attributable to Cummins Inc. was $428 million, or $2.16 per diluted share, on sales of $10.8 billion, compared to 2008 net income attributable to Cummins Inc. of $755 million, or $3.84 per diluted share, on sales of $14.3 billion. The decrease in income was driven by a 25 percent decrease in net sales and a 26 percent decrease in gross margin, as we were impacted by lower demand across most of our businesses. Focused cost reduction efforts helped mitigate the impact of lower volumes. Restructuring and other charges in 2009 were $99 million ($65 million after-tax, or $0.33 per diluted share). For a detailed discussion of restructuring see Note 3, "RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER CHARGES," to our Consolidated Financial Statements .

The primary drivers were: Engine segment sales declined by 27 percent primarily due to industrial sales decreasing by 40 percent and on-highway sales decreasing by 16 percent. Power Generation segment sales declined by 31 percent due to declines in all lines of business led by the commercial products line of business. Components segment sales declined by 25 percent due to declines in all lines of business led by the filtration and turbochargers businesses. Distribution segment sales declined by 18 percent. A more detailed discussion of sales by segment is presented in the "OPERATING SEGMENT RESULTS" section. Gross Margin Significant drivers of the change in gross margins were as follows: In millions 2009 vs. 2008 Increase (Decrease) Volume/Mix $ (1,228 ) Price 252 Production costs 132 Warranty expense 46 Material Costs 13 Currency 8 Other 6 Total $ (771 ) Gross margin decreased by $771 million, and as a percentage of sales decreased by 0.4 percentage points. The decrease was led by lower volumes which were partially offset by increased engine purchases ahead of the January 1, 2010, emissions standards change, improved pricing and decreased production costs. The overall decrease in volumes was due to lower sales resulting from the global economic downturn. Our warranty provision on sales in 2009 was 3.3 percent compared to 2.9 percent in 2008. Our 2008 warranty expense included $117 million recorded in the fourth quarter associated with increases in the estimated warranty liability primarily for certain mid-range engine products launched in 2007. The accrual rates in 2009 for these related engine products were higher than those recorded in 2008 before this change in estimate. As such, our warranty as a percent of sales for these engine families is higher on products sold in 2009 than it was in 2008. Overall, our relative product mix also impacted the rate as a percent of sales when comparing these two periods. A more detailed discussion of margin by segment is presented in the "OPERATING SEGMENT RESULTS" section. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased primarily due to a decrease of $74 million in discretionary spending, in order to conserve cash, and a decrease of $71 million in compensation and related expenses. Compensation and related expenses include salaries, fringe benefits and variable 32 Table of Contents compensation. Salaries and fringe benefits decreased due to severance actions taken throughout 2009. Overall selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales increased to 11.5 percent in 2009 from 10.1 percent in 2008, primarily due to the 25 percent decrease in net sales. Research, Development and Engineering Expenses Research, development and engineering expenses decreased primarily due to a decrease in the number of engineering projects to conserve cash while focusing on the development of critical technologies and new products and increased reimbursements from third parties for engineering projects. Overall, research, development and engineering expenses as a percentage of sales increased to 3.4 percent in 2009 from 2.9 percent in 2008, primarily due to the 25 percent decrease in net sales. Equity, Royalty and Interest Income from Investees Equity, royalty and interest income from investees decreased primarily due to the following changes in equity income: Increase/(Decrease) In millions 2009 vs. 2008 Dongfeng Cummins Engine Company, Ltd. (DCEC) $ (22 ) Cummins MerCruiser Diesel, LLC (MerCruiser) (13 ) These decreases were primarily due to lower demand as a result of the global economic conditions. The effects of the global economic downturn were partially offset by modest increases in some markets. Other Operating (Expense) Income, Net Other operating (expense) income was as follows: Years ended December 31, In millions 2009 2008 Flood damage gain (loss)(1) $ 12 $ (5 ) Royalty income 8 12 Royalty expense (7 ) (10 ) Amortization of other intangibles (7 ) (13 ) (Loss) gain on sale of fixed assets (8 ) 5 Other, net 1 (1 ) Total other operating (expense) income, net $ (1 ) $ (12 ) (1) The flood gain represents flood insurance proceeds received during the third and fourth quarters of 2009 which more than offset flood related expenses recognized in 2008 and 2009. Interest Income Interest income decreased primarily due to lower interest rates in 2009 compared to 2008. Interest Expense Interest expense decreased primarily due to declining short-term interest rates. 33 Table of Contents Other (Expense) Income, Net Other (expense) income was as follows: Years ended December 31, In millions 2009 2008 Foreign currency loss(1) $ (20 ) $ (46 ) Bank charges (14 ) (12 ) Change in cash surrender value of corporate owned life insurance(2) (4 ) (36 ) Dividend income 5 6 Other, net 18 18 Total other (expense) income, net $ (15 ) $ (70 ) (1) The foreign currency exchange losses in 2009 and 2008 were due to unfavorable currency fluctuations, especially with the British Pound and the Brazilian Real in 2009 and the British Pound, the Euro, the Australian Dollar and the Indian Rupee in 2008. (2) The change in the cash surrender value of corporate owned life insurance was due to market deterioration, especially in the fourth quarter of 2008, which included the write down of certain investments to zero. Income Tax Expense Our income tax rates are generally less than the 35 percent U.S. income tax rate primarily because of lower taxes on foreign earnings and research tax credits. Our effective tax rate for 2009 was 24.4 percent compared to 30.6 percent for 2008. The decrease is due to tax on foreign earnings, which are subject to lower tax rates, and an increase in research tax credits. Our 2009 income tax provision also includes a $29 million (4.5 percent) reduction in the fourth quarter related to adjustments to deferred tax accounts. We released $19 million (3.0 percent) of deferred tax liabilities on foreign earnings, now considered to be permanently reinvested outside the U.S. and recorded a deferred tax asset of $10 million (1.5 percent) related to prior period matters. We expect our 2010 effective tax rate to be 32 percent excluding any discrete items that may arise. The research tax credit expired December 31, 2009 and has not yet been renewed by Congress. If the research credit is extended, we would anticipate the 2010 effective tax rate to drop to 30 percent. Noncontrolling Interests Noncontrolling interests eliminate the income or loss attributable to non-Cummins ownership interests in our consolidated entities. Noncontrolling interests decreased primarily due to lower income of $8 million at Cummins India Limited, a publicly traded company at various exchanges in India, as a result of the decline in demand due to the global economic downturn. There were no other individual fluctuations in the subsidiaries that were significant. Net Income Attributable to Cummins Inc. and Diluted Earnings Per Share Attributable to Cummins Inc. Net income attributable to Cummins Inc. and diluted earnings per share attributable to Cummins Inc. decreased primarily due to significantly lower volumes, restructuring and other charges and decreased equity income partially offset by a lower effective tax rate. 34 Table of Contents Outlook Near-Term: Many of the markets we serve have slowed significantly as a result of the credit crisis and the challenging global economic environment; however, demand in most of our markets appears to have reached bottom and we are seeing signs that markets have stabilized at these levels. We are also seeing improvement in emerging markets including China, India and Brazil. Consistent with prior emissions standards implementation, the North American on-highway markets experienced increased demand prior to the implementation of the EPA's 2010 emissions standards. Based on our prior experience we expect EPA 2010 engine and component sales to on-highway OEM customers to be very weak in the first half of 2010. In most of our other markets we expect demand to remain stable with current levels for the first half of 2010, while we expect emerging markets to have sales comparable to 2008 levels. Long-Term: While there is uncertainty in the near-term market as a result of the current economic conditions and market dynamics surrounding the EPA 2010 emissions standards change, we are confident that opportunities for long-term growth and profitability will continue in the future. 2008 vs. 2007 Net Sales Net sales increased in all segments due to the following drivers. Our commercial power generation business experienced increased demand, especially internationally. We increased our market share in North American (includes the U.S. and Canada and excludes Mexico) heavy-duty truck and medium-duty truck and bus markets. Demand in industrial engine markets increased, particularly the international construction and commercial marine markets. Our Distribution segment benefited from increased demand as well as the acquisition of a majority interest in three previously independent distributors. Our turbocharger and emissions solutions businesses experienced increased demand. We had a favorable impact from foreign currency translation. A detailed discussion of sales by segment is presented in the "OPERATING SEGMENT RESULTS" section. 35 Table of Contents Gross Margin Significant drivers of the change in gross margin were as follows: In millions 2008 vs. 2007 Increase (Decrease) Price $ 402 Volume/Mix 227 Production costs 47 Currency 47 Warranty expense (179 ) Material costs (173 ) Other 13 Total $ 384 Gross margin increased by $384 million, and as a percentage of sales increased by 0.9 percentage points. Benefits from increased pricing and a more favorable volume/mix of products sold were partially offset by higher material costs reflecting the increase in commodity prices during the year and higher warranty expense. Our warranty expense reflected favorable warranty experience for some engine products and our provision related to sales in 2008 was 2.9 percent of sales, down from 3.1 percent in 2007. This result was more than offset by negative trends primarily in certain mid-range engine products launched in 2007 for which we recorded additional warranty liability of approximately $117 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. A more detailed discussion of margin by segment is presented in the "OPERATING SEGMENT RESULTS" section. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to increased consulting expenses of $36 million, increased compensation and related expenses of approximately $34 million and the acquisition of a majority ownership interest in three previously independent North American distributors. Increased headcount and compensation and related expenses included salaries, variable compensation and fringe benefits across the business in support of higher volumes and business growth. Overall, selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales increased to 10.1 percent in 2008 from 9.9 percent in 2007. Research, Development and Engineering Expenses Research, development and engineering expenses increased significantly, primarily due to higher spending on development programs for future products including increased headcount, compensation and related expenses. Compensation and related expenses include salaries, variable compensation and fringe benefits. Fluctuations in other miscellaneous research and development expenses were not significant individually or in the aggregate. Overall, research, development and engineering expenses as a percentage of sales increased to 2.9 percent in 2008 from 2.5 percent in 2007. 36 Table of Contents Equity, Royalty and Interest Income from Investees Equity, royalty and interest income from investees decreased primarily due to the following: Increase/(Decrease) In millions 2008 vs. 2007 North American Distributors $ 17 Dongfeng Cummins Engine Company, Ltd. (DCEC) 14 Royalty and interest income 9 Chongqing Cummins Engine Company, Ltd. (CCEC) 8 Shanghai Fleetguard Filter Co., Ltd. 2 Tata Cummins Ltd. (TCL) (6 ) MerCruiser (8 ) Results from our North American distributors increased primarily due to income from a joint venture which we formed in the fourth quarter of 2007. DCEC sales increased largely due to prebuy activity in the first half of 2008 prior to a mid-year emissions change. CCEC increased primarily due to increased sales volumes. TCL experienced decreased sales volumes for the year while MerCruiser profits declined due to significant deterioration in the recreational marine market and increased research, development and engineering expenses. Other Operating (Expense) Income, Net Other operating (expense) income was as follows: Years ended December 31, In millions 2008 2007 Royalty income $ 12 $ 7 Gain on sale of fixed assets(1) 5 22 Flood damage loss (5 ) Royalty expense (10 ) (4 ) Amortization of other intangibles(2) (13 ) (1 ) Other, net (1 ) (2 ) Total other operating (expense) income, net $ (12 ) $ 22 (1) The decrease in the gain on sale of fixed assets was primarily due to the $10 million gain on the sale of Universal Silencer in 2007. (2) The increase in amortization of other intangibles was primarily due to amortization of purchased premiums related to the acquisition of a North American distributor in 2008. Interest Income Interest income decreased primarily due to lower average cash balances in 2008 compared to 2007. Interest Expense Interest expense decreased primarily due to declining short-term interest rates and a benefit from our interest rate swap. 37 Table of Contents Other (Expense) Income, Net Other (expense) income was as follows: Years ended December 31, In millions 2008 2007 Change in cash surrender value of corporate owned life insurance(1) $ (36 ) $ Bank charges (12 ) (12 ) Foreign currency (losses) gains(2) (46 ) 28 Dividend income 6 5 Other, net 18 12 Total other (expense) income, net $ (70 ) $ 33 (1) The change in the cash surrender value of corporate owned life insurance was due to market deterioration, especially in the fourth quarter of 2008, which included the write down of certain investments to zero. (2) The foreign currency exchange losses in 2008 were due to unfavorable currency fluctuations in 2008, especially with the British Pound, the Euro, the Australian Dollar and the Indian Rupee. Income Tax Expense Our income tax rates are generally less than the 35 percent U.S. income tax rate primarily because of lower taxes on foreign earnings and research tax credits. Our effective tax rate for 2008 was 30.6 percent compared to 32.6 percent for 2007. The decrease is primarily due to greater foreign earnings in 2008, which are subject to lower tax rates. Our 2008 income tax provision also included a $10 million (0.8 percent) reduction in the fourth quarter due to the legislative reinstatement of the U.S. research tax credit. Noncontrolling Interests Noncontrolling interests eliminate the income or loss attributable to non-Cummins ownership interests in our consolidated entities. Noncontrolling interests increased primarily due to higher income of $10 million at Cummins India Limited, a publicly traded company at various exchanges in India, due to the creation of a new export business in 2008 and favorable price adjustments for high horsepower products. There were no other individual fluctuations in the subsidiaries that were significant. Net Income Attributable to Cummins Inc. and Diluted Earnings Per Share Attributable to Cummins Inc. Net income attributable to Cummins Inc. and diluted earnings per share attributable to Cummins Inc. increased primarily due to higher volumes, improved margins, higher equity income and a lower effective tax rate. These increases were partially offset by warranty expense, restructuring charges and investment losses primarily occurring during the fourth quarter of 2008, in addition to unfavorable foreign currency effects. RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER CHARGES 2009 Restructuring Actions In 2009, we executed restructuring actions in response to a reduction in orders in most of our U.S. and foreign markets due to the continuing deterioration in the global economy. We reduced our global workforce by approximately 1,000 professional employees. In addition, we took numerous employee 38 Table of Contents actions at many of our manufacturing locations, including approximately 3,200 hourly employees, significant downsizing at numerous facilities and complete closure of several facilities and branch distributor locations. Employee termination and severance costs were recorded based on approved plans developed by the businesses and corporate management which specified positions to be eliminated, benefits to be paid under existing severance plans, union contracts or statutory requirements and the expected timetable for completion of the plan. Estimates of restructuring were made based on information available at the time charges were recorded. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved, actual amounts paid for such activities may differ from amounts initially recorded and we may need to revise previous estimates. We incurred $2 million of restructuring expenses for lease terminations and $5 million of restructuring expenses for asset impairments in response to closures and downsizing noted above. During 2009, we recorded a total pre-tax restructuring charge of $85 million, comprising $90 million of charges related to 2009 actions net of the $3 million favorable change in estimate related to 2008 actions and the $2 million favorable change in estimate related to earlier 2009 actions, in "Restructuring and other charges" in our Consolidated Statements of Income . These restructuring actions included: In millions Year ended December 31, 2009 Workforce reductions $ 81 Exit activities 7 Other 2 Changes in estimate (5 ) Total restructuring charges 85 Curtailment loss 14 Total restructuring and other charges $ 99 In addition, as a result of the restructuring actions described above, we also recorded a $14 million curtailment loss in our pension and other postretirement plans. See Note 12, "PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS," to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail. At December 31, 2009, of the approximately 4,200 employees affected by this plan, all terminations were substantially complete. If the 2009 restructuring actions are successfully implemented, we expect the annualized savings from the professional actions to be approximately $50 million. Our charge related to the professional actions was approximately $30 million. Approximately 40 percent of the savings from the restructuring actions will be realized in cost of sales, 45 percent in selling, general and administrative expenses and 15 percent in research, development and engineering expenses. We expect the accrual to be paid in cash which will be funded with cash generated from operations. 39 Table of Contents The following table summarizes the balance of accrued restructuring charges by expense type and the changes in the accrued amounts for the applicable periods. The restructuring related accruals were recorded in "Other accrued expenses" in our Consolidated Balance Sheets .

The pre-tax impact of allocating restructuring and other charges to the segment results would have been as follows: In millions Year ended December 31, 2009 Engine $ 47 Power Generation 12 Components 35 Distribution 5 Total restructuring charges $ 99 2008 Restructuring Actions We executed restructuring actions primarily in the form of voluntary and involuntary separation programs in the fourth quarter of 2008. These actions were in response to the continued deterioration in our U.S. businesses and most key markets around the world in the second half of 2008, as well as a reduction in orders in most U.S. and global markets for 2009. We reduced our worldwide professional workforce by approximately 650 employees, or 4.5 percent. We offered a voluntary retirement package to certain active professional employees in the U.S. based on a clearly defined set of criteria. We also took voluntary and involuntary actions which included approximately 800 hourly employees, the majority of which received severance benefits. The compensation packages contained salary and continuation of benefits, including health care, life insurance and outplacement services. The voluntary retirement package was accepted by approximately 150 employees. The remaining professional reductions of 500 employees were involuntary. The expenses recorded during the year ended December 31, 2008, included severance costs related to both voluntary and involuntary terminations. During 2008, we incurred a pre-tax charge related to the professional and hourly restructuring initiatives of approximately $37 million. Employee termination and severance costs were recorded based on approved plans developed by the businesses and corporate management which specified positions to be eliminated, benefits to be paid under existing severance plans or statutory requirements and the expected timetable for completion of the plan. Estimates of restructuring were made based on information available at the time charges were recorded. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved, actual amounts paid for such activities may differ from amounts initially recorded and we may need to revise previous estimates. At December 31, 2008, of the approximately 1,450 employees affected by this plan, 1,250 had been terminated. All terminations were substantially complete as of December 31, 2009. We expect the 2008 restructuring actions to yield approximately $45 million to $50 million in annual savings from professional actions. Approximately 41 percent of the savings from the restructuring actions will be 40 Table of Contents realized in cost of sales, 44 percent in selling, general and administrative expenses, and 15 percent in research, development and engineering expenses. The table below summarizes the balance of accrued restructuring expenses for 2008 actions, which were included in the balance of "Other accrued expenses" in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2009 and 2008: In millions Severance Costs 2008 Restructuring charges $ 37 Cash payments for 2008 actions (3 ) Balance at December 31, 2008 34 2009 Cash payments for 2008 actions (31 ) Change in estimate (3 ) Balance at December 31, 2009 $ We do not include restructuring charges in the segment results. The pre-tax impact of allocating restructuring charges for the year ended December 31, 2008, would have been as follows: In millions Engine $ 17 Power Generation 3 Components 15 Distribution 2 Total restructuring charges $ 37 There were no material changes to the estimated savings, or periods under which we expect to recognize the savings, for the 2008 actions. OPERATING SEGMENT RESULTS Our reportable operating segments consist of the following: Engine, Power Generation, Components, and Distribution. This reporting structure is organized according to the products and markets each segment serves and allows management to focus its efforts on providing enhanced service to a wide range of customers. The Engine segment produces engines and parts for sale to customers in on-highway and various industrial markets. The engines are used in trucks of all sizes, buses and RVs, as well as various industrial applications including construction, mining, agriculture, marine, oil and gas, rail and military. The Power Generation segment is an integrated provider of power systems which sells engines, generator sets and alternators. The Components segment includes sales of filtration products, exhaust and aftertreatment systems, turbochargers and fuel systems. The Distribution segment includes wholly-owned and partially-owned distributorships engaged in wholesaling engines, generator sets, and service parts, as well as performing service and repair activities on our products and maintaining relationships with various OEMs. We use segment EBIT (defined as earnings before interest expense, taxes and noncontrolling interests) as a primary basis for the chief operating decision-maker to evaluate the performance of each of our operating segments. Segment amounts exclude certain expenses not specifically identifiable to segments. The accounting policies of our operating segments are the same as those applied in our Consolidated Financial Statements . We prepared the financial results of our operating segments on a 41 Table of Contents basis that is consistent with the manner in which we internally disaggregate financial information to assist in making internal operating decisions. We have allocated certain common costs and expenses, primarily corporate functions, among segments differently than we would for stand-alone financial information prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). These include certain costs and expenses of shared services, such as information technology, human resources, legal and finance. We also do not allocate debt-related items, actuarial gains or losses, prior service costs or credits, restructuring and other charges, investment gains or losses, flood damage gains or losses, or income taxes to individual segments. Segment EBIT may not be consistent with measures used by other companies.

The following are the primary drivers by market. Industrial market sales decreased due to deterioration in units sold in the construction, marine and mining markets by 63 percent, 45 percent and 50 percent, respectively. Stationary power market sales declined due to decreased sales to the Power Generation segment as it used existing inventory to meet declining customer demand. Medium-duty truck sales decreased significantly due to a 35 percent decline in international truck units sold as a result of the global economic downturn. The U.S. market was impacted by the economic downturn; however, this was partially offset by increased sales ahead of the January 1, 2010, emissions standards change and improving market share. Heavy-duty truck sales declined as international units sold were down 64 percent. We experienced a decline in Mexican heavy-duty sales due to an increase in heavy-duty truck sales in the first six months of 2008 resulting from the increased activity ahead of Mexico's July 1, 2008, new emissions requirements, appreciation of the U.S. dollar and an influx of used trucks into the market from the U.S. and Canada permitted under a new law. Although U.S. truck fleets experienced financial challenges due to a lack of freight and limited access to credit, our U.S. heavy-duty sales ended the year flat as a result of increased sales in the fourth quarter of 2009 ahead of the January 1, 2010, emissions standards change and improving market share. Total on-highway-related sales were 61 percent of total Engine segment sales, compared to 53 percent in 2008. Segment EBIT Engine segment EBIT decreased primarily due to lower gross margin and equity, royalty and interest income from investees which were partially offset by decreased selling, general and 43 Table of Contents administrative expenses and decreased research, development and engineering expenses. Changes in Engine segment EBIT and EBIT as a percentage of sales were as follows: Year ended December 31, 2009 vs. 2008 Favorable/(Unfavorable) Change In millions Amount Percent Percentage point change as a percent of sales Gross margin $ (330 ) (24 )% 0.6 % Selling, general and administrative expenses 57 9 % (1.7 )% Research, development and engineering expenses 45 16 % (0.6 )% Equity, royalty and interest income from investees (45 ) (45 )% NM The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to lower engine volumes in most markets as a result of the global economic downturn, which was partially offset by increased sales in the U.S. in the fourth quarter of 2009 ahead of the January 1, 2010, emissions standards change, price improvements and by cost reduction activities at our manufacturing plants. Equity, royalty and interest income from investees decreased due to significantly lower demand at DCEC, Komatsu-Cummins Engine Company (KCEC) and Cummins MerCruiser Diesel Marine LLC. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses and research, development and engineering expenses was primarily due to lower discretionary spending, higher recovery of engineering expenses from third parties and decreased payroll costs as the result of restructuring actions. 2008 vs. 2007 Net Sales Engine segment sales increased compared to 2007. The following are the primary drivers by market. Heavy-duty sales increased primarily due to an increase in our market share in the North American (includes the U.S. and Canada and excludes Mexico) heavy-duty truck markets, increased Mexican heavy-duty truck sales in the first six months of 2008 resulting from the pre-buy activity ahead of Mexico's July 1, 2008, new emissions requirements and weaker demand in the first six months of 2007 resulting from the 2006 pre-buy to replace trucks ahead of the 2007 emissions standards change. Industrial market sales increased primarily related to strength in commercial marine and construction markets. Medium-duty truck sales increased due to increased demand in global medium-duty truck markets, primarily due to our market share increases in the North American medium-duty truck market, weaker demand in the first six months of 2007 resulting from the 2006 pre-buy to replace trucks ahead of the 2007 emissions standards change and strong demand in Latin America driven by strong economic conditions in Brazil in 2008. Stationary power sales increased primarily from intersegment sales to our Power Generation segment, especially internationally. Medium-duty bus sales increased due to market share gains in the North American bus market. We had a favorable impact from foreign currency translation. These increases were partially offset by a 50 percent decline in units sold to Chrysler. This decline was due to the deteriorating demand for light duty trucks in North America as the result of the softening U.S. economy and concerns over fuel prices earlier in the year. 44 Table of Contents Total on-highway-related sales were 53 percent of total Engine segment sales in 2008, compared to 56 percent in 2007. Segment EBIT Engine segment EBIT decreased primarily due to increased research, development and engineering and increased selling, general and administrative expenses which were partially offset by increased gross margin. Changes in Engine segment EBIT and EBIT as a percentage of sales were as follows: Year ended December 31, 2008 vs. 2007 Favorable/(Unfavorable) Change In millions Amount Percent Percentage point change as a percent of sales Gross margin $ 73 6 % (0.3 )% Selling, general and administrative expenses (30 ) (5 )% (0.1 )% Research, development and engineering expenses (64 ) (29 )% (0.5 )% The increase in research, development and engineering expenses was the result of increased spending on emissions related programs. The increased selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to higher payroll costs as the result of salary increases and an increase in the number of segment employees during the year. The increase in gross margin was primarily due to price improvements, especially in industrial engines and parts, and favorable product mix in the on-highway market. The increase in gross margin was partially offset by increased warranty expense from the increased mix of newer emissions-driven products and higher repair costs on certain engines and increased material prices due to higher commodity prices during the year.

The following are the primary drivers by business. Commercial products business sales decreased due to lower demand across most regions, especially in North America, the United Kingdom (U.K.), the Middle East, Latin America and India. Alternator business sales decreased due to lower OEM demand in Western Europe, North America and India. Commercial projects business sales decreased due to lower demand in most regions, especially in North America, Western Europe and the U.K. Segment EBIT Power Generation segment EBIT decreased primarily due to a lower gross margin, which was partially offset by decreases in selling, general and administrative and research, development and 46 Table of Contents engineering expenses.

The decrease in selling, general and administrative and research, development and engineering expenses was primarily due to favorable foreign currency translation, lower variable compensation costs, implementation of severance programs and decreased discretionary spending. 2008 vs. 2007 Net Sales Power Generation segment sales increased compared to 2007 primarily due to the following drivers. Commercial products business sales increased due to strong demand across most regions, especially the U.K., India, Latin America and China. Commercial projects business sales increased as a result of strong demand across most regions, especially North America, the Middle East, the U.K. and Western Europe. Alternator business sales increased due to strong international growth, especially in Western Europe and Latin America, and growth in North America. These increases were partially offset by a significant sales decrease in our consumer business, primarily due to the softening U.S. economy. Segment EBIT Power Generation segment EBIT increased primarily due to higher gross margin partially offset by increases in selling, general and administrative and research, development and engineering expenses.

For the year ended 2009, the sales for the portion of the business included in emissions solutions were $86 million. Sales for the portion of the business included in filtration for the years ended 2008 and 2007 were $136 million and $222 million, respectively. The 2008 and 2007 balances were not reclassified. 2009 vs. 2008 Net Sales Components segment sales for the year ended 2009 decreased in all businesses versus 2008 as the result of the global economic downturn. The following are the primary drivers by business. Filtration business sales decreased significantly due to falling global aftermarket and OEM demand, especially in North America and Europe, and the transfer of a portion of the business to emissions solutions in 2009. Turbocharger business sales decreased significantly due to falling OEM demand in Europe and North America. Fuel systems business sales decreased primarily due to falling OEM demand in North America and Europe. 48 Table of Contents Emissions solutions business sales decreased due to falling OEM demand across Europe and North America. These decreases were partially offset by the transfer of a portion of the filtration business into emissions solutions in 2009. Segment EBIT Components segment EBIT decreased versus 2008, primarily due to a lower gross margin which was partially offset by decreased selling, general and administrative and research, development and engineering expenses. Changes in Components segment EBIT and EBIT as a percentage of sales were as follows: Year ended December 31, 2009 vs. 2008 Favorable/(Unfavorable) Change In millions Amount Percent Percentage point change as a percent of sales Gross margin $ (138 ) (28 )% (0.6 )% Selling, general and administrative expenses 43 19 % (0.6 )% Research, development and engineering expenses 7 7 % (0.7 )% The decrease in gross margin was due to lower volumes for most markets, partially offset by implementation of severance programs. The decrease in selling, general and administrative and research, development and engineering expenses was primarily due to implementation of severance programs, closing certain facilities, decreased discretionary spending and decreased research and development spending. 2008 vs. 2007 Net Sales Components segment sales increased compared to 2007 primarily due to the following drivers. Turbocharger business sales increased due to strong growth in North America, Europe and China, partially due to pre-buy activity in advance of new Euro III emissions standards, which fueled domestic sales in China. Emissions solutions business sales increased due to strong sales in North America as the result of price increases and North American market share gains. These increases were partially offset by the sale of Universal Silencer and the discontinuance of a product line in 2007, which contributed a combined $75 million in sales in the year ended December 31, 2007. Segment EBIT Components segment EBIT increased primarily due to higher gross margins which were partially offset by increased research, development and engineering expenses, as well as increased selling, 49 Table of Contents general and administration expenses.

Excluding the unfavorable currency impact and the net benefit resulting from full-year 2009 consolidated income from distributor acquisitions with only partial-year 2008 income, sales were down $309 million, or 14 percent. Decreased sales were led by decreased sales volumes primarily in Power Generation and Engines. Segment EBIT Distribution segment EBIT decreased primarily due to lower gross margin, partially offset by decreased selling, general and administrative expenses and higher equity, royalty and interest income from investees. Changes in Distribution segment EBIT and EBIT as a percentage of sales were as follows: Year ended December 31, 2009 vs. 2008 Favorable/(Unfavorable) Change In millions Amount Percent Percentage point change as a percent of sales Gross margin $ (86 ) (18 )% (0.2 )% Gross margin, excluding acquisition(1) (94 ) (20 )% (0.7 )% Selling, general and administrative expenses 54 16 % (0.3 )% Equity, royalty and interest income from investees 8 7 % NM (1) Represents the acquisition of one distributor in 2009 partially offset by three distributor acquisitions in 2008. The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to lower sales volumes as a result of the global economic downturn and unfavorable foreign currency translation. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased primarily due to favorable foreign currency translation, lower sales volumes and decreased discretionary spending. Acquisition of a business In January 2010, we purchased an additional 50 percent ownership interest in Cummins Western Canada, bringing our total ownership interest to 80 percent. A new owner purchased the other 20 percent interest from the previous owner. The total accounting purchase price of the business is expected to be approximately $105 million to $110 million. Western Canada recorded revenues of $226 million and we recorded equity earnings of $11 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. 2008 vs. 2007 Net Sales Distribution segment sales increased compared to 2007 as a result of strong organic growth in all regions, mainly in Europe, the South Pacific and the Middle East. We had higher sales of $260 million from the acquisition of a majority ownership interest in three previously independent distributors. We had a favorable impact from foreign currency translation. The higher sales were led by increased sales volumes in power generation, parts and engine volumes, followed by service. 51 Table of Contents Segment EBIT Distribution segment EBIT increased primarily due to higher margins which were partially offset by increased selling, general and administrative expenses.

The increase in gross margin was primarily due to the increase in sales volumes for power generation, parts and engines followed by service. These increases in gross margin were partially offset by unfavorable currency translation. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to higher payroll costs as the result of 2008 salary increases and an increase in the number of segment employees including increased costs related to the acquisition of three new distributors and the North American joint venture.

For the year ended December 31, 2008, unallocated corporate expenses include $37 million of restructuring charges, a $36 million decrease in cash surrender value in corporate owned life insurance and $5 million of losses related to flood damage recoveries. There were no significant unallocated corporate expenses in 2007. 52 Table of Contents LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Management's Assessment of Liquidity We believe our financial condition and liquidity remain strong despite the difficult environment in the U.S. and global economies. Our strong financial performance, particularly in the fourth quarter of 2009, enabled us to finish the year with minimal debt and sizable cash and marketable securities balances. This cash performance was driven primarily by improved inventory management, controls on capital and discretionary spending and lower repurchases of common stock. We assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate adequate cash to fund our operating, investing and financing activities. Cash provided by operations is our principal source of liquidity. As of December 31, 2009, other sources of liquidity include: cash and cash equivalents of $930 million, marketable securities of $190 million, $1.07 billion available under our revolving credit facility, $154 million, based on eligible receivables, available under our accounts receivable sales program and $229 million available under international and other domestic credit facilities. The maturity schedule of our existing long-term debt does not require significant cash outflows in the intermediate term. Required annual principal payments range from $17 million to $67 million over each of the next five years. While the impact of the continued market volatility cannot be predicted, we believe our liquidity will provide us with the financial flexibility needed to fund working capital, capital expenditures, projected pension obligations, dividend payments, common stock repurchases and debt service obligations. We have considered the impact of ongoing market instability and credit availability in assessing the adequacy of our liquidity and capital resources and are monitoring the impact on our customers and suppliers. We have noticed an impact as reflected in our days sales in receivables, but have not seen a significant impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows in 2009. We expect that general market conditions could impact the rate at which we realize our receivables in the future and could impact eligible receivables under our accounts receivable program, however, we expect to generate positive cash flow from operations in 2010. We will continue to diligently monitor our receivables for potential slowing in collections that could occur as a result of continued difficult economic conditions and our customer's access to credit. The overall decline in market valuations negatively impacted the current value of our pension trusts in 2008; however, pension assets produced strong positive returns in 2009. At this time, we are comfortable that the currently unused $1.07 billion credit capacity under our revolving credit facility is available to us. This assertion is based upon the fact that we drew upon our revolving credit facility, throughout the year, with a prompt repayment, to confirm participation by the banks included in the facility. We successfully tested the facility again in February 2010. As a result, we believe our access to liquidity sources has not been materially impacted by the current credit environment and we do not expect that it will be materially impacted in the near future. There can be no assurance, however, that the cost or availability of future borrowings, if any, in the debt markets or our credit facilities will not be materially impacted by the ongoing capital market disruptions. A significant portion of our cash flows is generated outside the U.S. More than half of our cash and cash equivalents and most of our marketable securities at December 31, 2009, are denominated in 53 Table of Contents foreign currencies. We manage our worldwide cash requirements considering available funds among the many subsidiaries through which we conduct our business and the cost effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed. The repatriation of cash balances from certain subsidiaries could have adverse tax consequences; however, those balances are generally available without legal restrictions to fund ordinary business operations at the local level. We have and will continue to transfer cash from these subsidiaries to us and to other international subsidiaries when it is cost effective to do so. Working Capital Summary We fund our working capital with cash from operations and short-term borrowings when necessary. Various assets and liabilities, including short-term debt, can fluctuate significantly from month to month depending on short-term liquidity needs. As a result, working capital is a prime focus of management attention. In millions 2009 2008 Change 2009 vs. 2008 Cash and cash equivalents $ 930 $ 426 $ 504 Accounts and notes receivable 2,004 1,782 222 Inventories 1,341 1,783 (442 ) Other current assets 728 722 6 Current assets 5,003 4,713 290 Accounts and loans payable 994 1,048 (54 ) Current portion of accrued warranty 428 434 (6 ) Other accrued expenses 1,010 1,157 (147 ) Current liabilities 2,432 2,639 (207 ) Working capital $ 2,571 $ 2,074 $ 497 Current ratio 2.06 1.79 0.27 Days' sales in receivables 64 48 16 Inventory turnover 5.2 6.2 (1.0 ) Current assets increased primarily due to an increase in cash and cash equivalents, caused by management's efforts to conserve cash, reduce inventories and limit discretionary spending during the global recession (see Cash Flows below) and an increase in receivables. The increase in receivables was due to higher sales in global engine markets, higher sales in the fourth quarter of 2009 than in the fourth quarter of 2008 as a result of a temporary increase in engine (and related component) demand prior to the 2010 emissions standards change and the significant decrease in sales in the fourth quarter of 2008 as a result of the onset of the economic recession. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in inventories as a result of our efforts to reduce our working capital. Current liabilities decreased primarily due to a decline in other accrued expenses and accounts payable as a result of reduced purchasing volume and controls around discretionary spending. 54 Table of Contents Cash Flows Cash and cash equivalents increased $504 million during the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to a $151 million decrease in cash and cash equivalents during the year ended December 31, 2008. The change in cash and cash equivalents is as follows: Operating Activities Change Years ended December 31, 2009 vs. 2008 2008 vs. 2007 In millions 2009 2008 2007 Net income $ 484 $ 818 $ 788 $ (334 ) $ 30 Depreciation 326 314 290 12 24 Equity in income of investees, net of dividends 23 (45 ) (75 ) 68 30 Pension expense, net of contributions (36 ) (31 ) (152 ) (5 ) 121 Changes in: Receivables (181 ) 88 (203 ) (269 ) 291 Inventory 482 (251 ) (255 ) 733 4 Accounts payable (75 ) (174 ) 136 99 (310 ) Accrued expenses (132 ) 124 217 (256 ) (93 ) Other, net 246 144 64 102 80 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,137 $ 987 $ 810 $ 150 $ 177 2009 vs. 2008 Net cash provided by operating activities increased for the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to 2008, primarily due to favorable working capital fluctuations, primarily inventories, as a result of management's response to the challenging global economy and increased dividends from our equity investees which were partially offset by decreased income as the result of declining sales. Management's priorities included reducing inventory, aligning our cost and capacity with the real demand for our products and managing the business to generate positive cash flows by improving our working capital. Pensions The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon a variety of variables and assumptions including return on invested assets, market interest rates and levels of voluntary contributions to the plans. As a result of the credit crisis and the related market recession, our pension assets experienced significant deterioration in 2008. The financial market distress of 2008 continued into early 2009 with the debt and equity markets bottoming out in the first quarter. In the second half of 2009, the financial markets began to rebound. The recovery helped to improve our plan performance. Thus, for the year ended December 31, 2009, the return for our U.S. plan was above 18 percent while our U.K. plan return was above 16 percent. The most recent three-year average return for all of our pension invested assets was slightly above one percent. Approximately 94 percent of our pension plan assets are invested in highly liquid investments such as equity and fixed income securities. The remaining six percent of our plan assets are invested in less liquid but market valued investments, including real estate and private equity. We made $129 million of pension contributions in 2009 and we anticipate making contributions of $175 million to $185 million to our pension plans in 2010. Expected contributions to our defined benefit pension plans in 2010 will meet or exceed the current funding requirements. Claims and premiums for other postretirement benefits are expected to approximate $53 million in 2010. The $129 million of pension contributions in 2009 included voluntary contributions of $108 million. These contributions and payments include payments from our funds either to increase pension plan assets or to make direct payments to participants. 55 Table of Contents 2008 vs. 2007 Net cash provided by operating activities increased for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to 2007, primarily due to decreased pension funding, increased net income as the result of increased sales and increased equity in earnings net of dividends, which was partially offset by unfavorable working capital fluctuations. The unfavorable working capital fluctuation was primarily due to an increase in inventory, which was primarily to support strong business growth while the decreases in accounts payable and accounts receivable were more reflective of early shutdowns in many of our manufacturing facilities at the close of 2008, as demand softened throughout the fourth quarter. The increase in accrued expenses was primarily due to an increase in warranty expense. Investing Activities Change Years ended December 31, 2009 vs. 2008 2008 vs. 2007 In millions 2009 2008 2007 Capital expenditures $ (310 ) $ (543 ) $ (353 ) $ 233 $ (190 ) Investments in and advances to equity investees (3 ) (89 ) (66 ) 86 (23 ) Acquisitions of businesses, net of cash acquired (2 ) (142 ) (20 ) 140 (122 ) Proceeds from the sale of businesses 64 35 (64 ) 29 Investments in marketable securities, net (96 ) 19 (10 ) (115 ) 29 Other, net (98 ) (157 ) (101 ) 59 (56 ) Net cash used in investing activities $ (509 ) $ (848 ) $ (515 ) $ 339 $ (333 ) 2009 vs. 2008 Net cash used in investing activities decreased for the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to 2008, primarily due to decreased capital expenditures and lower investments in the acquisition of businesses which were partially offset by increased cash paid for investments in marketable securities and lower cash proceeds from the sale of a business. These decreases primarily occurred as a result of management's decision to conserve cash and maintain liquidity during the recession. Capital expenditures decreased as management tightened capital spending substantially across all business by limiting expenditures to critical projects and investments in development of new products. Despite the expected challenges in some of our markets in 2010, our financial position allows us the flexibility to increase capital expenditures for 2010 to approximately $400 million. 2008 vs. 2007 Net cash used in investing activities increased for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to 2007, primarily due to an increase in capital expenditures and higher investments in businesses related to the purchase of three previously independent distributors and the acquisition of Consolidated Diesel Corporation, a manufacturing facility (see Note 22, "ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES," to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information). These increases were partially offset by an increase in cash generated from net investments in marketable securities and the proceeds from the sale of a business. Capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2008 increased 54 percent over 2007 to support our growth, and included investments to increase capacity and to fund development of our new products. Our investments in capacity improvements and development of new products accelerated across all of our businesses. 56 Table of Contents Financing Activities Change Years ended December 31, 2009 vs. 2008 2008 vs. 2007 In millions 2009 2008 2007 Proceeds from borrowings $ 76 $ 76 $ 15 $ $ 61 Payments on borrowings and capital lease obligations (97 ) (152 ) (144 ) 55 (8 ) Net (payments) borrowings under short-term credit agreements (2 ) 33 (12 ) (35 ) 45 Dividend payments on common stock (141 ) (122 ) (89 ) (19 ) (33 ) Proceeds from sale of common stock held by employee benefits trust 72 63 13 9 50 Repurchases of common stock (20 ) (128 ) (335 ) 108 207 Other, net (29 ) (7 ) (24 ) (22 ) 17 Net cash used in financing activities $ (141 ) $ (237 ) $ (576 ) $ 96 $ 339 2009 vs. 2008 Net cash used in financing activities decreased for the year ended December 31, 2009, compared to 2008, primarily due to the decrease in repurchases of common stock and lower payments on borrowings, which was partially offset by a decrease in proceeds from borrowings and higher dividend payments. Our total debt was $704 million as of December 31, 2009, compared with $698 million at December 31, 2008. Total debt as a percent of our total capital, including total long-term debt, was 14.9 percent at December 31, 2009, compared to 16.7 percent at December 31, 2008. 2008 vs. 2007 Net cash used in financing activities decreased for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to 2007, primarily due to the decrease in repurchases of common stock, the increase in proceeds from borrowings, the increase in proceeds from sale of stock held by employee benefit trust and an increase in net borrowings under short-term credit arrangements. These fluctuations were partially offset by the increase in dividend payments. Our total debt as of December 31, 2008, was $698 million compared to $674 million as of December 31, 2007. Total debt as a percent of our total capital, including long-term debt, was 16.7 percent at December 31, 2008, compared to 15.4 percent at December 31, 2007. The 2008 debt to capital ratio was negatively impacted by a $675 million ($433 after-tax) charge to Cummins Inc. shareholders' equity to recognize the funded status of our defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans. Revolving Credit Agreement On June 30, 2008, we entered into a three-year revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of lenders. The credit agreement provides us with a $1.1 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility, the proceeds of which are to be used by us for working capital or other general corporate purposes. The credit facility matures on June 30, 2011. Amounts payable under our revolving credit facility will rank pro rata with all of our other unsecured, unsubordinated indebtedness. Up to $100 million under our credit facility is available for swingline loans denominated in U.S. dollars. Advances under the facility bear interest at (i) a base rate or (ii) a rate equal to LIBOR plus an applicable margin based on the credit ratings of our outstanding senior unsecured long-term debt. Based on our current long-term debt ratings, the applicable margin on LIBOR loans was 0.75 percent per annum as of 57 Table of Contents December 31, 2009. Advances under the facility may be prepaid without premium or penalty, subject to customary breakage costs. The credit agreement includes various covenants, including, among others, maintaining a leverage ratio of no more than 3.0 to 1.0 and maintaining fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 1.5 to 1.0. As of December 31, 2009, we were in compliance with all such covenants, including our leverage ratio of 0.6 to 1.0 and our fixed charge coverage ratio of 22.5 to 1.0. Repurchase of Common Stock In July 2006, the Board of Directors authorized us to acquire up to eight million shares of Cummins common stock. In 2007, we repurchased approximately $335 million of common stock, at an average cost of $55.76 per share, representing approximately six million shares. This concluded the share repurchase program authorized by the Board of Directors in July 2006. In December 2007, the Board of Directors authorized the acquisition of up to $500 million of Cummins common stock. We began making purchases under the plan in March 2008 and purchased $128 million of stock during 2008 at an average cost of $55.49 per share. We announced in February 2009 that we had temporarily suspended our stock repurchase program to conserve cash. In the fourth quarter of 2009, we lifted the suspension and will from time to time repurchase stock. We purchased $20 million of common stock during the fourth quarter at an average cost of $46.52 per common share. Quarterly Dividends In July 2008, our Board of Directors voted to increase our quarterly cash dividend per share by 40 percent resulting in increasing our cash dividends from $0.125 per common share to $0.175 per common share. Cash dividends per share paid to common shareholders for the last three years were as follows: Quarterly Dividends 2009 2008 2007 First quarter $ 0.175 $ 0.125 $ 0.09 Second quarter 0.175 0.125 0.09 Third quarter 0.175 0.175 0.125 Fourth quarter 0.175 0.175 0.125 Total dividends paid to common shareholders in 2009, 2008 and 2007 were $141 million, $122 million, and $89 million, respectively. Declaration and payment of dividends in the future depends upon income and liquidity position, among other factors, and is subject to declaration by our Board of Directors, who meet quarterly to consider the dividend payment. We expect to fund dividend payments from cash from operations. Credit Rating Impact on our Credit Facilities A number of our contractual obligations and financing agreements, such as our revolving credit facility and our equipment sale-leaseback agreements have restrictive covenants and/or pricing modifications that may be triggered in the event of downward revisions to our corporate credit rating. There were no downgrades of our credit ratings in 2009 that have impacted these covenants or pricing modifications. On March 10, 2008, Standard & Poor's (S&P) upgraded our senior unsecured debt ratings from "BBB-" to "BBB" and revised our outlook to stable citing our improved operating performance over the past several years, including during the expected emissions-related downturn in heavy-duty truck 58 Table of Contents demand in 2007, combined with significant on- and off-balance sheet debt reduction, and increased business diversification. On June 17, 2008, Fitch upgraded our senior unsecured debt ratings from "BBB" to "BBB+" citing our recent market share gains and improving credit profile, including improvement in our geographic and business diversification. In the second quarter of 2009, Moody's Investor Service, Inc. and Fitch reaffirmed our credit ratings. Credit ratings are not recommendations to buy and are subject to change, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. In addition, we undertake no obligation to update disclosures concerning our credit ratings, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Our ratings and outlook as of December 31, 2009, from each of the credit rating agencies are shown in the table below.

In February of 2009, we renegotiated our sale and leaseback transaction to extend the term for an additional two years and removed the requirement to provide residual insurance. The lease obligations are included in this line item. See Note 14, "COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES," to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our sale and leaseback transaction. (2) We are contractually obligated to fund $70 million in 2010; however, our expected range of total pension contributions for 2010 is approximately $175 million to $185 million. After 2010 our contractual agreement is $65 million per year through 2015. The contractual obligations reported above exclude our unrecognized tax benefits of $56 million, all of which is non-current, as of December 31, 2009. We are not able to reasonably estimate the 59 Table of Contents period in which cash outflows relating to uncertain tax contingencies could occur. See Note 4, "INCOME TAXES," to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.

The agreement also provides us with an option to increase the purchase limitation up to $500 million upon approval. As necessary, CTR may transfer a direct interest in its receivables, without recourse, to the financial institution. To maintain a balance in the designated pools of receivables sold, we sell new receivables to CTR as existing receivables are collected. Receivables sold to CTR in which an interest is not transferred to the financial institution are included in "Receivables, net" on our Consolidated Balance Sheets . The maximum interest in sold receivables that can be outstanding at any point in time is limited to the lesser of $400 million or the amount of eligible receivables held by CTR. There are no provisions in this agreement that require us to maintain a minimum investment credit rating; however, the terms of the agreement contain the same financial covenants as our revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2009, the amount available under this program was $154 million. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, there were no amounts outstanding under this program. Financing Arrangements for Affiliated Parties In accordance with the provisions of various joint venture agreements, we may purchase and/or sell products and components from/to the joint ventures and the joint ventures may sell products and components to unrelated parties. The transfer price of products purchased from the joint ventures may differ from normal selling prices. Certain joint venture agreements transfer product to us at cost, some transfer product to us on a cost-plus basis and other agreements provide for the transfer of products at market value. APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES A summary of our significant accounting policies is included in Note 1, "SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES," to our Consolidated Financial Statements which discusses accounting policies that we have selected from acceptable alternatives. Our Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP which often requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the reported amounts presented and disclosed in the financial statements. Our management reviews these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience, changes in business conditions and other relevant factors they believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. In any given reporting period, our actual results may differ from the estimates and assumptions used in preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements . 60 Table of Contents Critical accounting estimates are defined as follows: the estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the estimate was made; different estimates reasonably could have been used; or if changes in the estimate are reasonably likely to occur from period to period and the change would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Our senior management has discussed the development and selection of our accounting policies, related accounting estimates and the disclosures set forth below with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. We believe our critical accounting estimates include those addressing the recoverability of an investment related to new products, the estimation of liabilities for warranty programs, accounting for income taxes, pension benefits and annual assessment of recoverability of goodwill. Recoverability of Investment Related to New Products We have capitalized $216 million associated with the future launch of our light-duty diesel engine product. Market uncertainty due to the global recession has resulted in some customers delaying or cancelling their vehicle programs. We concluded that events and circumstances indicated that these assets should be reviewed for possible impairment at December 31, 2009. We used projections to assess whether future cash flows on an undiscounted basis related to the assets are likely to exceed the related carrying amount to determine if a write-down is appropriate. These projections require estimates about product volume and the size of the market for vehicles that are not yet developed. We used input from our customers in developing alternative cash flow scenarios. Our analysis indicated that the assets are recoverable at December 31, 2009. If customer expectations or projected volumes deteriorate and we do not identify alternative customers and/or product applications, we could be required to write-down these assets to net realizable value. Warranty Programs We estimate and record a liability for warranty programs, primarily base warranty and other than product recalls, at the time our products are sold. Our estimates are based on historical experience and reflect management's best estimates of expected costs at the time products are sold and subsequent adjustment to those expected costs when actual costs differ. As a result of the uncertainty surrounding the nature and frequency of product recall programs, the liability for such programs is recorded when we commit to a recall action, which generally occurs when it is announced. Our warranty liability is generally affected by component failure rates, repair costs and the time of failure. Future events and circumstances related to these factors could materially change our estimates and require adjustments to our liability. New product launches require a greater use of judgment in developing estimates until historical experience becomes available. Product specific experience is typically available four or five quarters after product launch, with a clear experience trend evident eight quarters after launch. We generally record warranty expense for new products upon shipment using a factor based upon historical experience only in the first year, a blend of actual product and historical experience in the second year and product specific experience thereafter. Note 11, "PRODUCT WARRANTY LIABILITY," to our Consolidated Financial Statements contains a summary of the activity in our warranty liability account for 2009 and 2008 including adjustments to pre-existing warranties. Accounting for Income Taxes We determine our provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Future tax benefits of tax loss and credit carryforwards are also recognized as deferred tax assets. We evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax assets each quarter by assessing the likelihood of future profitability and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to 61 Table of Contents realize our net deferred tax assets. At December 31, 2009, we recorded net deferred tax assets of $729 million. These assets included $151 million for the value of tax loss and credit carryforwards. A valuation allowance of $44 million was recorded to reduce the tax assets to the net value management believed was more likely than not to be realized. In the event our operating performance deteriorates, future assessments could conclude that a larger valuation allowance will be needed to further reduce the deferred tax assets. In addition, we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to tax audits in these jurisdictions. These audits can involve complex issues, which may require an extended period of time to resolve. We reduce our net tax assets for the estimated additional tax and interest that may result from tax authorities disputing uncertain tax positions we have taken and we believe we have made adequate provision for income taxes for all years that are subject to audit based upon the latest information available. A more complete description of our income taxes and the future benefits of our tax loss and credit carryforwards is disclosed in Note 4, "INCOME TAXES," to our Consolidated Financial Statements . Pension Benefits We sponsor a number of pension plans primarily in the U.S. and the U.K. and to a lesser degree in various other countries. In the U.S. and the U.K. we have several major defined benefit plans that are separately funded. We account for our pension programs in accordance with employers' accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans under GAAP. GAAP requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined using an actuarial basis. As a result, our pension benefit programs are based on a number of statistical and judgmental assumptions that attempt to anticipate future events and are used in calculating the expense and liability related to our plans each year at December 31. These assumptions include discount rates used to value liabilities, assumed rates of return on plan assets, future compensation increases, employee turnover rates, actuarial assumptions relating to retirement age, mortality rates and participant withdrawals. The actuarial assumptions we use may differ significantly from actual results due to changing economic conditions, participant life span and withdrawal rates. These differences may result in a material impact to the amount of net periodic pension expense to be recorded in our Consolidated Financial Statements in the future. The expected long-term return on plan assets is used in calculating the net periodic pension expense. We considered several factors in developing our expected rate of return on plan assets. The long-term rate of return considers historical returns and expected returns on current and projected asset allocations and is generally applied to a 5-year average market value of return. The long-term rate of return on plan assets represents an estimate of long-term returns on an investment portfolio consisting of a mixture of equities, fixed income, real estate and other miscellaneous investments. The differences between the actual return on plan assets and expected long-term return on plan assets are recognized in the asset value used to calculate net periodic expense over five years. The table below sets forth the expected return assumptions used to develop our pension expense for the period 2007-2009 and our expected rate for 2010. Long-Term Expected Return Assumptions 2010 2009 2008 2007 U.S. Plans 8.00 % 8.25 % 8.25 % 8.50 % Non-U.S. Plans 7.25 % 7.25 % 7.25 % 7.24 % A lower expected rate of return will increase our net periodic pension expense and reduce profitability. The difference between the expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred from recognition in our results of operations and, under certain circumstances such as when the difference exceeds 10 percent of the market value of plan assets or the projected benefit obligation (PBO), 62 Table of Contents amortized over future years of service. This is also true of changes to actuarial assumptions. As of December 31, 2009, we had net pension actuarial losses of $801 million and $364 million for the U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans, respectively. Under GAAP, the actuarial gains and losses are recognized and recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss. As these amounts exceed 10 percent of our PBO, the excess is amortized over the average remaining service lives of participating employees. The table below sets forth the net periodic pension expense for the period 2007 through 2009 and our expected expense for 2010. Net Periodic Pension Expense In millions 2010 2009 2008 2007 Pension expense $ 71 $ 93 $ 71 $ 98 The increase in periodic pension expense in 2009 was due to lower than historical returns on assets driven by the global economic recession. Another key assumption used in the development of the net periodic pension expense is the discount rate. The discount rates used to develop our net periodic pension expense are set forth in the table below. Discount Rates 2010 2009 2008 2007 U.S. Plans 5.60 % 6.20 % 6.10 % 5.60 % Non-U.S. Plans 5.80 % 6.20 % 5.80 % 4.96 % Changes in the discount rate assumptions will impact the interest cost component of the net periodic pension expense calculation. The discount rate enables us to state expected future cash payments for benefits as a present value on the measurement date. The guidelines for setting this rate are discussed in GAAP which suggests the use of a high-quality corporate bond rate. We used bond information provided by Standard & Poors for the U.S. and iBoxx for the U.K. All bonds used to develop our hypothetical portfolio in the U.S. and U.K. were high-quality, non-callable bonds (AA- or better) as of December 31, 2009. The average yield of this hypothetical bond portfolio was used as the benchmark for determining the discount rate to be used to value the obligations of the plans subject to GAAP accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions. Our model called for 60 years of benefit payments. For the U.S. plans, the sum of the cash flows from the 60 bonds matched the cash flow from the benefit payment stream upon completion of the process. The number of bonds purchased for each issue was used to determine the price of the entire portfolio. The discount rate benchmark was set to the internal rate of return needed to discount the cash flows to arrive at the portfolio price. In developing the U.K. discount rate, excess cash flows resulted in the early years of the 60-year period when the sum of the cash flow from the bonds maturing in later years exceeded the benefit payments in early years, thus no bonds maturing in early years are needed. As a result, the price of the entire portfolio of bonds was too high because all benefit payments were covered with excess cash flow remaining. We made no adjustment to the cash flow and the discount rate was determined as the internal rate of return needed to discount the cash flows to arrive at the portfolio price. 63 Table of Contents The table below sets forth the estimated impact on our 2010 net periodic pension expense relative to a change in the discount rate and a change in the expected rate of return on plan assets. In millions Impact on Pension Expense Increase (Decrease) Discount rate used to value liabilities: 0.25 percent increase $ (5 ) 0.25 percent decrease 5 Expected rate of return on assets: 1 percent increase (28 ) 1 percent decrease 28 The above sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time. A higher discount rate decreases the plan obligations and decreases our net periodic pension expense. A lower discount rate increases the plan obligations and increases our net periodic pension expense. It should be noted that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear. Our investment policies in the U.S. and U.K. provide for the rebalancing of assets to maintain our long-term strategic asset allocation. We are committed to its long-term strategy and do not attempt to time the market given empirical evidence that asset allocation is more critical than individual asset or investment manager selection. Rebalancing of the assets has and continues to occur. The rebalancing is critical to having the proper weighting of assets to achieve the expected total portfolio returns. For the U.S. qualified pension plans, our assumptions for the expected return on assets was 8.25 percent in 2009. Projected returns are based primarily on broad, publicly traded equity and fixed income indices and forward-looking estimates of active portfolio and investment management. As of December 31, 2009, based upon our target asset allocations it is anticipated that our U.S. investment policy will generate an average annual return over the 20-year projection period equal to or in excess of 7.50 percent approximately 40 percent of the time while returns of 8.70 percent or greater are anticipated 25 percent of the time. We expect additional positive returns from active investment management. Except for the short-term adverse conditions in the equity markets in 2008, our recent three-year annual rates of return have all exceeded 8.50 percent. As a result, based on the historical returns and forward-looking return expectations, we believe an investment return assumption of 8.00 percent per year in 2010 for U.S. pension assets is reasonable. The methodology used to determine the rate of return on pension plan assets in the U.K. was based on establishing an equity-risk premium over current long-term bond yields adjusted based on target asset allocations. Our strategy with respect to our investments in pension plan assets is to be invested with a long-term outlook. Therefore, the risk and return balance of our asset portfolio should reflect a long-term horizon. Our pension plan asset allocation at December 31, 2009 and 2008 and target allocation for 2010 are as follows: Percentage of Plan Assets at December 31, Target Allocation 2010 Investment description 2009 2008 Equity securities 55.0 % 59.1 % 56.0 % Fixed income 33.6 % 34.6 % 39.6 % Real estate/Other 11.4 % 6.3 % 4.4 % Total 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 64 Table of Contents Actual cash funding for our U.S. pension plans is governed by employee benefit and tax laws and the Pension Protection Act of 2006 ("the Act"). The Act extends the use of an average corporate bond rate for determining current liabilities for funding purposes. Among its many provisions, the Act establishes a 100 percent funding target for plan years beginning after December 31, 2007, which has now been extended to 2011 by the U.S. Congress due to the recession. Our funding strategy is to make contributions to our various qualified plans in accordance with statutory funding requirements and any additional contributions we determine are appropriate. The table below sets forth our pension contributions for the period 2008-2009 and our expected range of contributions for 2010. Pension Contributions In millions 2010 2009 2008 Contributions $ 175 - 185 $ 129 $ 102 Contributions beyond 2010 will depend on the funded status of our U.S. plans at that time in relation to the targeted funding established under the Act and contractual obligations negotiated in the U.K. Our pension plans in the U.S. and outside the U.S. were under-funded at December 31, 2009, by a total of $522 million due to pension trust asset performance. Under GAAP, the actuarial gains and losses and prior service costs (credits) are recognized and recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss. Increases in actuarial losses reduced our shareholders' equity by $11 million (after-tax) in 2009. The increases resulted from lower discount rates and higher mortality assumptions partially offset by improved plan asset performance in 2009. Note 12, "PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS," to our Consolidated Financial Statements provides a summary of our pension benefit plan activity, the funded status of our plans and the amounts recognized in our Consolidated Financial Statements . Annual Assessment for Recoverability of Goodwill Under GAAP accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets, the carrying value of goodwill is reviewed annually. The fair value of each reporting unit was estimated by discounting the future cash flows less requirements for working capital and fixed asset additions. In accordance with GAAP, our reporting units are generally defined as one level below an operating segment. However, there were two situations where we have aggregated two or more components which share similar economic characteristics and thus are aggregated into a single reporting unit for testing purposes. These two situations are described further below. This analysis has resulted in the following reporting units for our goodwill testing: Within our Components operating segment, emissions solutions and filtration have been aggregated into a single reporting unit. This reporting unit accounts for almost 90 percent of our total goodwill balance at December 31, 2009. Also within our Components segment, our turbocharger business is considered a separate reporting unit. Within our Power Generation segment, our alternator business is considered a separate reporting unit. Within our Engine segment, our recon business is considered a separate reporting unit. This reporting unit is in the business of remanufacturing and reconditioning engines and certain engine components. Our Distribution segment is considered a single reporting unit as it is managed geographically and all regions share similar economic characteristics and provide similar products and services. 65 Table of Contents No other reporting units have goodwill. Our valuation method requires us to make projections of revenue, operating expenses, working capital investment and fixed asset additions for the reporting units over a multi-year period. Additionally, management must estimate a weighted-average cost of capital, which reflects a market rate, for each reporting unit for use as a discount rate. The discounted cash flows are compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit and, if less than the carrying value, a separate valuation of the goodwill is required to determine if an impairment loss has occurred. In addition, we also perform a sensitivity analysis to determine how much our forecasts can fluctuate before the fair value of a reporting unit would be lower than its carrying amount. As of the end of the third quarter in 2009, we performed the annual impairment assessment required by GAAP and determined that our goodwill was not impaired. At December 31, 2009, our recorded goodwill was $364 million, approximately 90 percent of which resided in the emissions solutions plus filtration reporting unit. For this reporting unit, a 10 percent reduction in our estimated future cash flows would not have impacted our assessment. Changes in our projections or estimates, a deterioration of our operating results and the related cash flow effect or a significant increase in the discount rate could decrease the estimated fair value of our reporting units and result in a future impairment of goodwill. RECENTLY ADOPTED AND RECENTY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted In December 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) amended its existing standards for business combinations, which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. The amended standards make significant changes to both the accounting and disclosures related to the acquisition of a business and could materially impact how we account for future business combination transactions. Because the standard will only impact transactions entered into after January 1, 2009, the amended standards did not impact our Consolidated Financial Statements upon adoption. In December 2007, the FASB amended its existing standards for noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements, which was effective for interim and annual fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2008. The new standard established accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the accounting for future ownership changes with respect to those subsidiaries. The new standard defined a noncontrolling interest, previously called a minority interest, as the portion of equity in a subsidiary not attributable, directly or indirectly, to a parent. The new standard required, among other items, that a noncontrolling interest be included in the consolidated balance sheet within equity, separate from the parent's equity; consolidated net income to be reported at amounts inclusive of both the parent's and noncontrolling interest's shares and, separately, the amounts of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and noncontrolling interest all on the consolidated statements of income; and if a subsidiary is deconsolidated, any retained noncontrolling equity investment in the former subsidiary be measured at fair value and a gain or loss be recognized in net income based on such fair value. We adopted the new standard effective January 1, 2009 and applied it retrospectively. As a result, we reclassified noncontrolling interests of $246 million, $292 million and $253 million, respectively, from the mezzanine section to equity in the December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 balance sheets. Certain reclassifications have been made to prior period amounts to conform to the presentation of the current period under the new standard. In March 2008, the FASB amended its existing standards for disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities, which was effective for interim and annual fiscal periods beginning after November 15, 2008. The new standards require enhanced disclosures about a company's derivative and hedging activities. We adopted the new standard effective January 1, 2009 and applied it prospectively. The new disclosures required are included in Note 20, "DERIVATIVES," to our Consolidated Financial Statements . 66 Table of Contents In June 2009, the FASB amended its existing standards for subsequent events, which was effective for interim and annual fiscal periods ending after June 15, 2009 and established general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued. The new standard established the period after the balance sheet date during which we should evaluate events or transactions that may occur for potential recognition or disclosure in the financial statements, the circumstances under which we should recognize events or transactions occurring after the balance sheet date and the disclosures that should be made about events or transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date. In preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements , we evaluated subsequent events through February 25, 2010, which is the date our annual report was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Accounting Pronouncements Issued But Not Yet Effective In June 2009, the FASB amended its standards for accounting for transfers of financial assets, which is effective for interim and annual fiscal periods beginning after November 15, 2009. The new standard removes the concept of a qualifying special-purpose entity from GAAP. The new standard modifies the financial-components approach used in previous standards and limits the circumstances in which a financial asset, or portion of a financial asset, should be derecognized. The new standard also requires enhanced disclosure regarding transfers of financial interests and a transferor's continuing involvement with transferred assets. The new standard will require us to report any future activity under our sale of receivables program as secured borrowings as of January 1, 2010. As of December 31, 2009, we had no amounts outstanding under this program. In June 2009, the FASB amended its existing standards related to the consolidation of variable interest entities, which is effective for interim and annual fiscal periods beginning after November 15, 2009. The new standard requires entities to analyze whether their variable interests give it a controlling financial interest of a variable interest entity (VIE) and outlines what defines a primary beneficiary. The new standard amends GAAP by: (a) changing certain rules for determining whether an entity is a VIE; (b) replacing the quantitative approach previously required for determining the primary beneficiary with a more qualitative approach; and (c) requiring entities to continuously analyze whether they are the primary beneficiary of a VIE among other amendments. The new standard also requires enhanced disclosures regarding an entity's involvement in a VIE. While we are still finalizing our evaluation of the impact of this amendment on our Consolidated Financial Statements , we believe the only impact will be the deconsolidation of Cummins Komatsu Engine Company (CKEC). This deconsolidation will not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements . Financial information about CKEC is included in Note 23, "VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES," to our Consolidated Financial Statements . In October 2009, the FASB amended its rules regarding the accounting for multiple element revenue arrangements. The objective of the amendment is to allow vendors to account for revenue for different deliverables separately as opposed to part of a combined unit when those deliverables are provided at different times. Specifically, this amendment addresses how to separate deliverables and simplifies the process of allocating revenue to the different deliverables when more than one deliverable exists. The new rules are effective for us beginning January 1, 2011. We are in the process of evaluating the impact that this amendment will have on our Consolidated Financial Statements .
