Item 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following Management Discussion and Analysis ( MD&A ) is intended to help the reader understand the results of our operations and financial condition. The MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements. Where NM is used in various percentage change computations, the computed percentage change has been determined not to be meaningful. Executive overview We operate as a financial services and bank holding company. Results in the businesses in which we operate are highly correlated to the general overall strength of economic conditions and, more specifically, to the direction of the U.S. equity and fixed income markets, the corporate and mortgage lending markets and commercial and residential credit trends. Overall market conditions, interest rates, economic, political and regulatory trends, and industry competition are among the factors which could affect us and which are unpredictable and beyond our control. These factors affect the financial decisions made by market participants which include investors, borrowers, and competitors, impacting their level of participation in the financial markets. These factors also impact the level of public offerings, trading profits, interest rate volatility and asset valuations, or a combination thereof. In turn, these decisions and factors affect our business results. Year ended September 30, 2013 compared with the year ended September 30, 2012 We achieved record net revenues of $4.5 billion , a $679 million, or 18% , increase compared to the prior year. All four operating segments achieved record net revenues and pre-tax earnings this fiscal year. Revenues were higher in fiscal year 2013 in part because the results include twelve months of Morgan Keegan operations as compared to six months in fiscal year 2012. In addition, fiscal year 2013 net revenues include a $65 million gain on a proprietary capital investment (a $22.7 million impact to RJF net revenues after noncontrolling interests), which further elevated our revenues. Our pre-tax income increased $93 million, or 20%, compared to the prior year, to $564 million. Excluding the acquisition related expenses primarily resulting from the Morgan Keegan acquisition, we generated adjusted pre-tax income of $644 million (a non-GAAP measure) (1) , a 21% increase over the prior year. Earnings per share increased 17% over the prior year, to $2.58 per share. Excluding the acquisition related expenses mentioned above, adjusted earnings per share (a non-GAAP measure) (1) increased 18%, to $2.95 per share. All of our operating segments performed well during the year, as each achieved record levels of pre-tax income. Total client assets under administration were a record $425.4 billion at September 30, 2013, a 10% increase over the prior year level. Non-interest expenses increased $553 million, or 17%, primarily as a result of the inclusion of a full year of expenses from legacy Morgan Keegan businesses. Increases in compensation related expenses, information technology expenses, and acquisition related expenses were partially offset by a decrease in the bank loan loss provision. Significant milestones achieved in fiscal year 2013 include the mid-February 2013 transfer of all of the Morgan Keegan financial advisors and client accounts from the Morgan Keegan platform to the RJ&A platform. Following that conversion and allowing time for the former Morgan Keegan financial advisors to become proficient in the use of the RJ&A platform, in the June 2013 quarter we implemented staff reductions. These reductions occurred mainly within our information technology groups where there was significant overlap in historic Morgan Keegan and RJ&A support staffing that we had elected to maintain through the platform conversion date in order to ensure the continued high levels of service to financial advisors and clients while we operated on two different platforms. Retention levels remain very high for the legacy Morgan Keegan financial advisors. The Morgan Keegan Capital Markets businesses were also integrated (primarily fixed income and public finance investment banking) during the year, and further staff reductions were made. Given these accomplishments, as of September 30, 2013 our various Morgan Keegan integration initiatives have been substantially and successfully completed. (1) Refer to the discussion and reconciliation of the GAAP results to the non-GAAP results in the Non-GAAP Reconciliation section of this MD&A. 34 Index A summary of the most significant items impacting our financial results as compared to the prior year, in addition to the impact of twelve months of Morgan Keegan operations in the current year compared to six months in the prior year, are as follows: Our Private Client Group segment generated net revenues of $2.9 billion, an 18% increase, while pre-tax income increased 7% to $230 million. The increase in revenues is primarily attributable to increased securities commissions and fee revenues, predominately arising from fee-based accounts. Pre-tax income was negatively impacted by an increase in commission expenses (driven primarily by the increase in corresponding commission revenues) as well as an increase in communication and information processing expense. Client assets under administration of the Private Client Group increased 9% over the prior year, to $402.6 billion at September 30, 2013. The Capital Markets segment generated net revenues of $927 million, a 15% increase, while pre-tax income increased 35% to $102 million. We experienced significant increases in institutional fixed income commission revenues, merger and acquisition fees, and fixed income investment banking revenues. Equity capital markets commission levels increased as a result of improved equity market conditions. Results from our equity capital markets investment banking business have been uneven throughout the year, characterized by intermittent periods of significant activity, and ending the year with strong results. Our fixed income operations improved overall, but were negatively impacted during times of adverse fixed income market conditions. These adverse conditions resulted from medium and longer term interest rate volatility, which negatively impacted our trading results. Our Asset Management segment generated revenues of $293 million, a 23% increase, while pre-tax income increased 43% to $96 million. Assets under management in managed programs increased 31% to a record $56 billion as of September 30, 2013. Strong net inflows of client assets in managed programs, including from legacy MK & Co. branches, market appreciation, and our acquisition of an interest in ClariVest, contributed to the increase. RJ Bank generated $268 million in pre-tax income, an 11%, increase. The increase resulted primarily from the significant decrease in the loan loss provision expense and an increase in net interest income. The decrease in the loan loss provision expense resulted from an improved credit environment, the favorable resolution of certain problem loans, and a significant reduction in residential mortgage delinquent loans. The increase in net interest income was primarily the result of an increase in average loans outstanding. In our non-operating Other segment, our results reflect a $6 million increase in our pre-tax loss. This segment includes certain corporate expenses, our principal capital and our private equity activities. Our results were favorably impacted by the sale of our indirect investment in Albion Medical Holdings, Inc. ( Albion ) in April, 2013. The Albion investment generated an increase of $18 million in pre-tax income (net of noncontrolling interests). We also experienced other less significant increases on other investments in our private equity portfolio. Those increases were more than offset by additional acquisition and integration related costs incurred from the Morgan Keegan acquisition, and a full year interest expense associated with debt financings executed in March 2012 to finance a portion of the acquisition. Our earnings benefited from a favorable effective tax rate in fiscal year 2013. Our effective tax rate in fiscal year 2013 decreased to 34.9% from 37.3% in fiscal year 2012. The tax rate decrease primarily resulted from a nonrecurring tax benefit resulting from a change in management repatriation strategy of certain foreign earnings as well as a significant increase in nontaxable income associated with the change in market value of company-owned life insurance. With regard to regulatory changes that could impact our businesses in the future, our view of the potential impact to us of future regulations is substantially unchanged by the regulatory activities that occurred during the year. Based on our review of the Dodd-Frank Act, and because of the nature of our businesses and our business practices, we presently do not expect the legislation to have a significant direct impact on our operations as a whole. However, because some of the implementing regulations have yet to be adopted by various regulatory agencies, the specific impact on some of our businesses remains uncertain. 35 Index Year ended September 30, 2012 compared with the year ended September 30, 2011 On April 2, 2012, we completed our acquisition of Morgan Keegan from Regions. This acquisition expands both our private client and our capital markets businesses. Morgan Keegan brings to us a strong private client business, one of the industry top fixed income and public finance groups, and a significant equity capital markets division. Headquartered in Memphis with 57 full-service offices in 20 states, Morgan Keegan had approximately 3,100 employees and over 900 financial advisors as of the date of our purchase, 892 of whom have been retained as of September 30, 2012. While an addition of this size is a departure from our focus on organic growth supplemented by individual hires and small acquisitions, it is not a departure from our overall strategy. We have used strategic mergers to grow throughout our history when the timing and pricing were right and, most importantly, when there was a strong cultural fit and clear path for integration. With the addition of Morgan Keegan, we are one of the country largest wealth management and investment banking firms, affording us even greater ability to support our financial advisors and retail and institutional clients. Our fiscal year 2012 results include six months of Morgan Keegan results, and therefore comparisons to prior years are not necessarily meaningful for many of our key financial and operating metrics. Furthermore, integration of both equity and fixed income capital markets began immediately following the Closing Date which precludes the determination of legacy Morgan Keegan results in those areas. Regarding our integration plans, our plan is to migrate all the private client financial advisors and client accounts off of the Morgan Keegan platforms and fully integrate those operations onto our RJ&A platform during the second quarter of fiscal year 2013. Despite the somewhat challenging market conditions during the fiscal year, most of our businesses performed relatively well as we accomplished record annual net revenue and net income levels. Our net revenues of $3.8 billion represent a 14% increase compared to the prior year. Excluding net revenues estimated to be attributable to the addition of Morgan Keegan, net revenues increased 2% compared to the prior year. All of our segments realized increased revenues over the prior year. Total client assets under administration increased to $386 billion, a 51% increase as compared to the prior year. Approximately $85 billion of the client assets under administration total are associated with legacy Morgan Keegan branches. Our Private Client Group and Capital Markets segments benefited significantly from the acquisition of Morgan Keegan. Non-interest expenses increased $455 million, or 16%, from the prior year primarily due to the addition of Morgan Keegan. The fiscal year 2012 non-interest expenses include $59 million of acquisition and integration related costs we incurred specifically associated with the Morgan Keegan acquisition, while the prior year includes $41 million pertaining to a nonrecurring loss on auction rate securities repurchased. The bank loan loss provision decreased $8 million from the prior year reflecting the overall improvement in the credit markets over that period. Inclusive of the impact of the acquisition of Morgan Keegan, our pre-tax income increased $10 million, or 2%, while our net income increased $18 million, or 6%, as compared to the prior year. After consideration of the acquisition related expenses we incurred and the $2 million of incremental interest expense we incurred as part of the pre-Closing Date execution of our Morgan Keegan purchase financing strategies, we generated adjusted pre-tax income of $533 million (a non-GAAP measure) (1) in fiscal year 2012. After adjusting fiscal year 2011 for the effect of the nonrecurring loss on auction rate securities repurchased, we generated adjusted pre-tax income of $503 million (a non-GAAP measure) (1) , reflecting an increase in adjusted pre-tax income (a non-GAAP measure) (1) of $30 million, or 6%, in fiscal year 2012 as compared to the prior year. Our financial results during fiscal year 2012 were most significantly impacted by: Our Private Client Group segment generated net revenues of $2.5 billion in fiscal year 2012, a 13% increase over the prior year. Pre-tax income of $215 million represents a 2% decrease compared to the prior year. The increase in revenues is in large part due to our acquisition of Morgan Keegan and the high levels of retention of the Morgan Keegan financial advisors since the acquisition Closing Date. Client assets under administration of the Private Client Group increased 44% at September 30, 2012 as compared to the prior year, to $368 billion, which is a result of both the assets brought on by Morgan Keegan branches and 19% growth in legacy RJF private client assets. Fiscal year 2012 pre-tax income was negatively impacted by a significant increase in our technology costs resulting from system enhancements to existing platforms and projects which address numerous regulatory requirements. (1) Refer to the discussion and reconciliation of the GAAP results to the non-GAAP results in the Non-GAAP Reconciliation section of this MD&A. 36 Index The Capital Markets segment realized a $7 million, or 8%, decrease in pre-tax income. After adjusting for the adverse impact of the emerging markets businesses, the segment generated an increase in pre-tax income of $5 million, or 6%, as compared to the prior year, this despite very challenging equity capital markets conditions throughout the year. As a result of our Morgan Keegan acquisition, we realized substantially increased fixed income institutional sales commissions as well an increase in trading profits compared to the prior year. Our acquisition of Morgan Keegan provides us with significantly increased scale in the capital markets industry, primarily as it pertains to fixed income operations and public finance. Weakness in the equity capital markets throughout the year significantly impacted both our institutional equity sales commission levels as well as our equity underwriting fee revenues. A decrease in fiscal year 2012 equity capital markets activity in Canada, which had a particularly strong prior year, also had a significant negative impact on our fiscal year 2012 segment results. Our Asset Management segment generated $67 million of pre-tax income in fiscal year 2012, a 2% increase compared to the prior year. Assets under management increased to record levels as of September 30, 2012. Net inflows of client assets, including assets of Morgan Keegan clients, and appreciation in the market values of assets drove the increase. RJ Bank generated a $67 million, or 39%, increase in pre-tax income over the prior year to a record $240 million. The increase primarily resulted from an increase in net interest revenues resulting from higher average loan balances while maintaining the net interest spread at a level consistent with the prior year, and a lower loan loss provision resulting primarily from improved credit characteristics both in our loan portfolio and in the markets as a whole. In our non-operating Other segment, our results reflect a $127 million pre-tax loss. This segment includes our principal capital and private equity activities which produced pre-tax income of $15 million (after consideration of the attribution to noncontrolling interests) generated by income received and positive valuation adjustments arising from certain of our investments in that portfolio. The segment also includes $59 million of acquisition and integration related costs we incurred in fiscal year 2012 that were associated with the Morgan Keegan acquisition, as well as $62 million of interest expense. The interest expense includes additional interest expense resulting from March 2012 financings to fund a portion of the Morgan Keegan acquisition. Our effective tax rate in fiscal year 2012 decreased to 37.3% from the prior year rate of 39.7%, primarily resulting from gains realized in fiscal year 2012 (as compared to losses in the prior year) on our company-owned life insurance investments, which are not subject to tax. During January 2012, RJF application to become a bank holding company and a financial holding company was approved by the Fed and RJ Bank conversion to a national bank was approved by the OCC. These changes became effective February 1, 2012. This status better represents the way RJ Bank has been conducting its business. 37 Index Segments Effective September 30, 2013, we implemented changes in our reportable segments. The changes are a result of management assessment of the usefulness and materiality of certain of our historic reportable segments. The effect of the change is that we now report the following five business segments: Private Client Group; Capital Markets; Asset Management; RJ Bank; and the Other segment. Prior period amounts related to the change in reportable segments have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. The following table presents our consolidated and segment gross revenues and pre-tax income, excluding noncontrolling interests, for the years indicated : Year ended September 30, 2013 2012 2011 (in thousands) Total company Revenues $ 4,595,798 $ 3,897,900 $ 3,399,886 Pre-tax income excluding noncontrolling interests 564,187 471,525 461,247 Private Client Group Revenues 2,930,603 2,484,670 2,192,422 Pre-tax income 230,315 215,091 220,299 Capital Markets Revenues 945,477 820,852 707,460 Pre-tax income 102,171 75,755 82,521 Asset Management Revenues 292,817 237,224 226,511 Pre-tax income 96,300 67,241 66,176 RJ Bank Revenues 356,130 345,693 281,992 Pre-tax income 267,714 240,158 172,993 Other Revenues 126,401 58,412 27,329 Pre-tax loss (132,313 ) (126,720 ) (80,742 ) Intersegment eliminations Revenues (55,630 ) (48,951 ) (35,828 ) 38 Index Reconciliation of the GAAP results to the non-GAAP measures We believe that the non-GAAP measures provide useful information by excluding those items that may not be indicative of our core operating results and that the GAAP and the non-GAAP measures should be considered together. The non-GAAP adjustments for the periods indicated are comprised of the one-time acquisition and integration costs incurred (primarily associated with the Morgan Keegan acquisition) and other non-recurring expenses, net of applicable taxes. Refer to the footnotes to the table below for further explanation of each non-recurring item. The following table provides a reconciliation of the GAAP basis to the non-GAAP measures: Year ended September 30, 2013 2012 2011 ($ in thousands, except per share amounts) Net income attributable to RJF, Inc. - GAAP basis $ 367,154 $ 295,869 $ 278,353 Non-GAAP adjustments : Acquisition related expenses (1) 73,454 59,284 RJF share of RJES goodwill impairment expense (2) 4,564 RJES restructuring expense (3) 1,902 Interest expense (4) 1,738 Loss on auction rate securities repurchased (5) 41,391 Pre-tax non-GAAP adjustments 79,920 61,022 41,391 Tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments (6) (27,908 ) (22,731 ) (16,412 ) Net income attributable to RJF, Inc. - Non-GAAP basis $ 419,166 $ 334,160 $ 303,332 Non-GAAP adjustments to common shares outstanding: Effect of the February 2012 share issuance on weighted average common shares outstanding (7) (1,396 ) Non-GAAP earnings per common share: Non-GAAP basic $ 3.01 $ 2.53 $ 2.40 Non-GAAP diluted $ 2.95 $ 2.51 $ 2.39 Average equity - GAAP basis (8) $ 3,465,323 $ 3,037,789 $ 2,472,726 Average equity - non-GAAP basis (9) $ 3,483,531 $ 3,027,259 $ 2,477,722 Return on equity 10.6 % 9.7 % 11.3 % Return on equity - non-GAAP basis (10) 12.0 % 11.0 % 12.2 % (1) The non-GAAP adjustment adds back to pre-tax income one-time acquisition and integration expenses associated with acquisitions that were incurred during each respective period. (2) The non-GAAP adjustment adds back to pre-tax income RJF share of the total goodwill impairment expense associated with our RJES reporting unit. See further discussion of this impairment expense in the Goodwill section of this Item 7 and in Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. (3) The non-GAAP adjustment adds back to pre-tax income restructuring expenses associated with our RJES operations. (4) The non-GAAP adjustment adds back to pre-tax income the incremental interest expense incurred during the March 31, 2012 quarter on debt financings that occurred in March 2012, prior to and in anticipation of, the closing of the Morgan Keegan acquisition. (5) The non-GAAP adjustment adds back to pre-tax income the loss associated with the resolution of the ARS matter. (6) The non-GAAP adjustment reduces net income for the income tax effect of all the pre-tax non-GAAP adjustments, utilizing the effective tax rate applicable to the respective year. (7) The non-GAAP adjustment to the weighted average common shares outstanding in the basic and diluted non-GAAP earnings per share computation reduces the actual shares outstanding for the effect of the 11,075,000 common shares issued by RJF in February 2012 as a component of our financing of the Morgan Keegan acquisition. (8) Computed by adding the total equity attributable to RJF, Inc. as of each quarter-end date during the indicated year to date period, plus the beginning of the year total, divided by five. (9) The calculation of non-GAAP average equity includes the impact on equity of the non-GAAP adjustments described in the table above, as applicable for each respective period. (10) Computed by utilizing the net income attributable to RJF, Inc.-non-GAAP basis and the average equity-non-GAAP basis, for each respective period. See footnote (9) above for the calculation of average equity-non-GAAP basis. 39 Index Net interest analysis We have certain assets and liabilities, not only held in our RJ Bank segment but also held in our PCG and Capital Markets segments, which are subject to changes in interest rates; these changes in interest rates have an impact on our overall financial performance. Given the relationship of our interest sensitive assets to liabilities held in each of these segments, an increase in short-term interest rates would result in an overall increase in our net earnings (we currently have more assets than liabilities with a yield that would be affected by a change in short-term interest rates). A gradual increase in short-term interest rates would have the most significant favorable impact on our PCG and RJ Bank segments (refer to the table in Item 7a - Interest Rate Risk in this Form 10-K, which presents an analysis of RJ Bank estimated net interest income over a 12 month period based on instantaneous shifts in interest rates using RJ Bank own internal asset/liability model). Based upon our analysis, we estimate that a 100 basis point instantaneous rise in short-term interest rates could result in an increase in our pre-tax income in the range of approximately $140 million to $170 million over a twelve month period. Approximately half of such an increase would be attributable to account and service fee revenues (resulting from an increase in the fees generated in lieu of interest income from our multi-bank sweep program with unaffiliated banks and the discontinuance of money market fee waivers) which are reported in the PCG segment, and the remaining portion of the increase attributable to net interest income reported in both our PCG and RJ Bank segments. This estimate is based on static balances as of September 30, 2013 and conservative assumptions related to interest rates earned by clients on their cash balances in various interest rate environments. The actual amount of any increase we would realize in the future will ultimately be based on a number of factors including but not limited to, the actual change in balances, the rapidity and magnitude of the increase in interest rates, the competitive landscape at such time, and the returns on comparable investments which will factor into the interest rates we pay on client cash balances. The vast majority of any incremental benefit to pre-tax income from a rise in short-term interest rates would be expected to arise from the first 100 basis point increase, as we presume that a significant portion of any further incremental increase in short-term interest rates would be passed along to clients, and thus such additional interest revenues and interest sensitive fees would be offset by increases of similar amounts in our interest expense. 40 Index The following table presents our consolidated average interest-earning asset and liability balances, interest income and expense balances, and the average yield/cost, for the years indicated: Year ended September 30, 2013 2012 2011 Average balance (1) Interest inc./exp.

Net interest income is earned primarily by our PCG and RJ Bank segments, which are discussed separately below. Net interest income in the PCG segment was also relatively unchanged as compared to the prior year. In the historically low rate interest environment that existed during fiscal year 2013, we earned a historically low interest spread on client cash balances, thus we experienced only a nominal favorable impact on our net interest revenues despite increases in client balances outstanding. RJ Bank net interest income increased $17 million, or 5%, primarily as a result of an increase in average loans outstanding, partially offset by a decrease in net interest margin. Refer to the discussion of the specific components of RJ Bank net interest income in the RJ Bank section of this MD&A. Interest income earned on our available for sale securities portfolio decreased from the prior year due to significantly lower yields on the portfolio which more than offset the increase resulting from higher investment balances. The average balance of the portfolio increased primarily as a result of the ARS we acquired halfway through the prior year as a part of the Morgan Keegan acquisition. Given the significantly lower yields from these securities, the weighted-average yield on the total available for sale securities portfolio declined. Interest expense on our senior notes increased approximately $18 million over the prior year. The increase primarily results from our March 2012 issuances of $350 million 6.9% senior notes and $250 million 5.625% senior notes. Both of the March 2012 debt offerings were part of our acquisition financing activities and other transactions associated with the Morgan Keegan acquisition. Year ended September 30, 2012 compared with the year ended September 30, 2011 Net Interest Analysis Net interest income in fiscal year 2012 increased $35 million, or 11%, as compared to the prior year. Net interest income in the PCG segment increased $13 million, or 18%, despite the impact of more client assets entering our multi-bank sweep program, which pays a fee in lieu of interest. The increase was primarily the result of an increase in client margin balances, a portion of which resulted from the addition of the balances associated with Morgan Keegan clients. RJ Bank net interest income in fiscal year 2012 increased $51 million, or 19%, primarily as a result of an increase in average loans outstanding. Refer to the discussion of the specific components of RJ Bank net interest income in the RJ Bank section of this MD&A. Interest income earned on our available for sale securities portfolio decreased in fiscal year 2012 due to significantly lower yields on the portfolio as compared to the prior year. The average balance of the portfolio increased primarily as a result of the ARS we repurchased during the quarter ended September 30, 2011 as well as the ARS we acquired in the Morgan Keegan transaction. The yield on ARS is significantly lower than the yield on historical available for sale securities. In addition, the yield on the portion of the portfolio that is not invested in ARS decreased substantially. The result is a substantially lower weighted-average yield on available for sale securities as compared to the prior year. Interest expense on our senior notes increased approximately $27 million in fiscal year 2012 over the prior year. The increase is primarily comprised of $21 million of interest expense resulting from our March 2012 issuance of $350 million 6.9% senior notes and $250 million 5.625% senior notes; and $6 million of additional interest expense in fiscal year 2012 associated with our April 2011 issuance of $250 million 4.25% senior notes. Both of the March 2012 debt offerings were part of our financing activities associated with funding the Morgan Keegan acquisition which closed on April 2, 2012. 42 Index Results of Operations Private Client Group The following table presents consolidated financial information for our PCG segment for the years indicated: Year ended September 30, 2013 % change 2012 % change 2011 ($ in thousands) Revenues: Securities commissions and fees: Equities $ 289,395 10 % $ 263,578 (5 )% $ 276,562 Fixed income products 98,994 18 % 83,698 39 % 60,193 Mutual funds 621,459 21 % 514,146 12 % 458,555 Fee-based accounts 1,016,340 26 % 808,361 18 % 685,672 Insurance and annuity products 338,666 12 % 303,628 16 % 261,045 New issue sales credits 90,747 10 % 82,811 10 % 75,590 Sub-total securities commissions and fees 2,455,601 19 % 2,056,222 13 % 1,817,617 Interest 96,926 1 % 95,866 17 % 82,272 Account and service fees: Client account and service fees 162,283 9 % 148,873 20 % 123,674 Mutual fund and annuity service fees 168,055 23 % 136,514 24 % 110,281 Client transaction fees 16,932 (21 )% 21,547 (37 )% 34,162 Correspondent clearing fees 3,059 9 % 2,812 (19 )% 3,454 Account and service fees all other 282 29 % 219 2 % 215 Sub-total account and service fees 350,611 13 % 309,965 14 % 271,786 Other 27,465 21 % 22,617 9 % 20,747 Total revenues 2,930,603 18 % 2,484,670 13 % 2,192,422 Interest expense 11,625 5 % 11,039 5 % 10,548 Net revenues 2,918,978 18 % 2,473,631 13 % 2,181,874 Non-interest expenses: Sales commissions 1,765,933 18 % 1,491,286 12 % 1,332,207 Admin & incentive compensation and benefit costs 481,253 14 % 420,553 22 % 344,063 Communications and information processing 163,125 43 % 113,931 62 % 70,472 Occupancy and equipment 113,573 19 % 95,551 24 % 77,186 Business development 65,679 65,505 18 % 55,542 Clearance and other 99,100 38 % 71,714 (13 )% 82,445 Total non-interest expenses 2,688,663 19 % 2,258,540 15 % 1,961,915 Income before taxes and including noncontrolling interests 230,315 7 % 215,091 (2 )% 219,959 Noncontrolling interests (340 ) Pre-tax income excluding noncontrolling interests $ 230,315 7 % $ 215,091 (2 )% $ 220,299 Margin on net revenues 7.9 % 8.7 % 10.1 % 43 Index The following table presents a summary of PCG financial advisors as of the periods indicated: Employees Independent contractors September 30, 2013 total September 30, 2012 total (1) RJ&A 2,443 2,443 1,594 MK & Co.

The prior year counts have been revised to provide consistency in the application of our current criteria. (2) We acquired Morgan Keegan on April 2, 2012. We successfully integrated the PCG operations of MK & Co. onto the RJ&A platform in February 2013. At that time, 863 financial advisors of MK & Co. became RJ&A financial advisors.

The prior year counts have been revised to provide consistency in the application of our current criteria. (2) We acquired Morgan Keegan on April 2, 2012. We successfully integrated the PCG operations of MK & Co. onto the RJ&A platform in February 2013. Year ended September 30, 2013 compared with the year ended September 30, 2012 Private Client Group Net revenues increased $445 million , or 18% , while pre-tax income increased $15 million, or 7% . PCG pre-tax margin on net revenues decreased to 7.9% as compared to 8.7% in fiscal year 2012. A full year of MK & Co. private client group operations are included in the current year results as compared to six months in fiscal year 2012. Therefore, comparisons of our legacy private client group operations to our current operations are not meaningful. As of mid-February 2013, all of the MK & Co. financial advisors and client accounts from the MK & Co. platform were transferred to, and integrated with, the RJ&A platform. Securities commissions and fees increased $399 million, or 19% . A significant portion of this increase resulted from our acquisition of Morgan Keegan on April 2, 2012, which brought over 900 financial advisors into PCG, 863 of whom were retained through the February 2013 integration of the Morgan Keegan operations into those of RJ&A. Securities commissions and fee revenues generated by our Canadian operations increased 6% over the prior year. Despite a small decrease in the total number of PCG financial advisors at September 30, 2013 compared to September 30, 2012 , the average productivity per financial advisor for the same comparable period has increased 9%. Client assets under administration of $402.6 billion in the PCG segment increased $34.9 billion, or 9%, as compared to September 30, 2012 , primarily resulting from equity market appreciation in the U.S. Client account and service fee revenues increased $13 million , or 9% , over the prior year. The increase primarily results from an increase in the fees we receive, in lieu of interest earnings, from our multi-bank sweep program. Balances in this program increased primarily as a result of the transfer of MK & Co. client accounts to the Raymond James program. Additional MK & Co. client accounts also resulted in an increase in service fee income, which increased as a result of the additional client account volume. In addition, we realized an increase in fees resulting from assets invested in alternative investment funds. 44 Index Mutual fund and annuity service fees increased $32 million, or 23% , primarily as a result of an increase in mutual fund omnibus fees, education and marketing support ( EMS ) fees, and no-transaction-fee ( NTF ) program revenues, all of which are paid to us by the mutual fund companies whose products we distribute. In addition to an increase in the mutual fund assets on which these fees are generally paid, during the past year we implemented changes in the data sharing arrangements with many mutual fund companies, converting from a networking to an omnibus arrangement. The fees earned from omnibus arrangements are greater than those under networking arrangements in order to compensate us for the additional reporting requirements performed by the broker-dealer under omnibus arrangements. The offsetting increased costs we have incurred to third parties to provide the additional information is included in communications and information processing expenses discussed below. Effective with our mid-February 2013 platform integration, the former Morgan Keegan client mutual fund investments became eligible for our omnibus and EMS programs, further increasing this revenue. Partially offsetting the increases in revenues described in the preceding two paragraphs, client transaction fees decreased $5 million , or 21% , primarily as a result of certain mutual fund relationships converting over the past year to a NTF program and an April 2012 reduction in transaction fees associated with certain non-managed fee-based accounts. Under the mutual fund NTF program, we receive increased fees from mutual fund companies which are included within mutual fund and annuity service fee revenue described above, but our clients no longer pay us transaction fees on mutual fund trades within certain of our managed programs. Other revenues increased by $5 million , or 21% , primarily as a result of spreads earned on cross-currency transactions within our Canadian operations. Total segment revenues increased 18% . The portion of total segment revenues that we consider to be recurring is approximately 68% at September 30, 2013 , as contrasted to the September 30, 2012 level of 64%. Recurring commission and fee revenues include asset based fees, trailing commissions from mutual funds and variable annuities/insurance products, mutual fund service fees, fees earned on funds in our multi-bank sweep program, and interest. Assets in fee-based accounts as of September 30, 2013 were $140 billion (a majority of which is included in our asset management programs) an increase of 21% as compared to the $116 billion of assets in fee-based accounts at September 30, 2012. The amount of net interest in the PCG segment was nearly unchanged from the prior year level. Increases in client margin balances and client cash balances outstanding over the year were nearly completely offset by further decreases in interest rates. As a result of the extremely low rate interest environment that existed during fiscal year 2013, there was only a nominal impact on our net interest revenues resulting from the client cash balance increase as the interest spread earned on client balances were at historically low levels. Refer to the discussion of how the pre-tax income of this segment could be favorably impacted by a 100 basis point instantaneous rise in short-term interest rates, in the net interest section of this MD&A. Non-interest expenses increased $430 million, or 19% , over the prior year. Sales commission expense increased $275 million, or 18% , consistent with the 19% increase in commission and fee revenues. Administrative and incentive compensation expenses increased $61 million, or 14% . This increase resulted primarily from the impact of a full year of salaries and benefits expense associated with the increased support staff and information technology and operations headcount arising from the addition of the Morgan Keegan associates. Communications and information processing expense increased $49 million, or 43% . Computer software development costs and other information technology related costs, which include consulting expenses, increased over $42 million as compared to the prior year as a result of various information technology enhancements to existing platforms, costs associated with operating two platforms for a portion of the year, additional reporting requirements including regulatory requirements, and expenses associated with omnibus arrangements (refer to the increase in mutual fund and annuity service fee revenue arising from these arrangements discussed above). Occupancy and equipment expense increased $18 million, or 19% , primarily due to a full year rent and other facility related expenses associated with the increase of approximately 140 branch office locations resulting from the Morgan Keegan acquisition. Clearance and other expenses increased $27 million, or 38% . These expense increases can generally be attributed to clearing and floor brokerage expenses resulting from the additional volume of client accounts and transactions arising from the Morgan Keegan acquisition, growth in our legacy operations, and the application of differing clearing charge allocation methodologies between segments than within the historic MK & Co. operations, which impacts prior year comparisons. 45 Index Year ended September 30, 2012 compared with the year ended September 30, 2011 Private Client Group Net revenues in fiscal year 2012 increased $292 million , or 13% , over the prior year. PCG pre-tax income decreased $5 million , or 2% , as compared to the prior year. PCG pre-tax margin on net revenues decreased to 8.7% as compared to 10.1% in fiscal year 2011. The PCG business of the Morgan Keegan broker-dealer operated on its historic Morgan Keegan platform throughout fiscal year 2012. Our plan is to migrate all the financial advisors and client accounts off of the Morgan Keegan platform and fully integrate those operations onto the RJ&A platform during the second quarter of fiscal year 2013. Securities commissions and fees increased $239 million in fiscal year 2012, or 13% , over the prior year amount. A significant portion of this increase resulted from our acquisition of Morgan Keegan on April 2, 2012, which brought over 900 financial advisors into PCG, over 95% of whom have been retained as of September 30, 2012. Overall, we have realized an 18.3% increase in the number of PCG financial advisors as of September 30, 2012 as compared to September 30, 2011. Client assets under administration increased $112 billion, or 44%, compared to the September 30, 2011 level, to $368 billion, in large part ($66 billion) as a result of the Morgan Keegan acquisition. Equity market conditions in the U.S., while volatile during the fiscal year, were improved as compared to September 30, 2011 levels. We realized a significant increase in commissions and asset-based fees over the prior year levels. Securities commissions and fees arising from our Canadian operations decreased 10% as compared to the prior year. Client account and service fee revenues increased $25 million in fiscal year 2012, or 20% , over the prior year. The portion of these revenues generated from Morgan Keegan clients is $10 million. Of the remaining increase, the primary component is the result of an increase in the fees we receive, in lieu of interest earnings, from our multi-bank sweep program; the fees increased as a result of higher balances in the program. Mutual fund and annuity service fees increased $26 million in fiscal year 2012, or 24% , over the prior year primarily as a result of an increase in mutual fund networking and omnibus fees, EMS fees, and NTF program revenues, all of which are paid to us by the mutual fund companies whose products we distribute. During the past year, we have been implementing a change in the data sharing arrangements with many mutual fund companies converting from networking to an omnibus arrangement. The fees earned from omnibus arrangements are greater than those under networking arrangements in order to compensate us for the additional reporting requirements performed by the broker-dealer under omnibus arrangements. The largest portion of this conversion occurred midway through fiscal year 2011. Excluding the impact of the revenues generated from Morgan Keegan clients, these revenues increased $23 million, or 21%, as compared to the prior year. The Morgan Keegan client mutual fund positions will be eligible for our omnibus program following conversion to the RJ&A platform. Partially offsetting the increases in revenues described above, client transaction fees decreased $13 million in fiscal year 2012, or 37% , compared to the prior year primarily as a result of certain mutual fund relationships converting over the past year to a NTF program and an April 2012 reduction in transaction fees associated with certain non-managed fee-based accounts. Under the mutual fund NTF program, we receive increased fees from mutual fund companies which are included within mutual fund and annuity service fee revenue described above, but our clients no longer pay us transaction fees on mutual fund trades within certain of our managed programs. While total segment revenues increased 13% , the portion that we consider to be recurring continues to increase and is approximately 64% of total segment revenues for the year ended September 30, 2012 as compared to 61% for the year ended September 30, 2011. Recurring commission and fee revenues include asset based fees, trailing commissions from mutual funds, variable annuities and insurance products, mutual fund service fees, fees earned on funds in our multi-bank sweep program, and interest. Assets in fee-based accounts at September 30, 2012 are $115.7 billion, an increase of 35% as compared to the $85.5 billion of assets in fee-based accounts at September 30, 2011. A portion (approximately $10 billion) of the increase in assets in fee-based accounts over the preceding year balances resulted from the addition of the assets in the fee-based accounts of Morgan Keegan. PCG net interest revenues increased $13 million in fiscal year 2012, or 18% , over the prior year primarily resulting from an increase in client margin balances. There was a decrease in net interest earned on client cash balances as more of these funds are being swept into our multi-bank sweep program, where a fee is earned by PCG instead of interest. A portion of the increase in client margin balances resulted from the addition of the balances associated with Morgan Keegan clients. 46 Index Non-interest expenses increased $297 million in fiscal year 2012, or 15% , over the prior year. Sales commission expense increased $159 million , or 12% , generally consistent with the increase in commission and fee revenues. Administrative and incentive compensation expenses increased $76 million , or 22% . The increase primarily results from increases in salaries and benefits due to increased support staff and information technology and operations headcount arising from the addition of Morgan Keegan associates. Communications and information processing expense increased $43 million in fiscal year 2012, or 62% , over the prior year primarily due to increases in information systems costs. Computer software development costs and other information technology related costs, which include consulting expenses, increased over $29 million as compared to the prior year as a result of various information technology enhancements to existing platforms and additional reporting requirements, including regulatory requirements and those under omnibus arrangements (refer to the increase in mutual fund and annuity service fee revenue arising from these arrangements discussed above). Expenses primarily associated with the increase in our number of offices and personnel arising from the Morgan Keegan acquisition resulted in an increase in office related expenses of $8 million. Occupancy and equipment expense increased $18 million in fiscal year 2012, or 24% , over the prior year primarily due to the increase of approximately 140 branch office locations resulting from the Morgan Keegan acquisition. Business development expense increased $10 million in fiscal year 2012, or 18% , over the prior year primarily due to increases in travel and related costs, and account transfer fees paid when a new client transfers their accounts from a competitor to us. Partially offsetting the increases described above, clearance and other expense decreased $11 million in fiscal year 2012, or 13% , compared to the prior year resulting primarily from favorable impacts on this segment resulting from Morgan Keegan allocation practices which allocate certain clearance costs to the capital markets operations. 47 Index Results of Operations Capital Markets The following table presents consolidated financial information for our Capital Markets segment for the years indicated: Year ended September 30, 2013 % change 2012 % change 2011 ($ in thousands) Revenues: Institutional sales commissions: Equity $ 246,588 7 % $ 230,080 (12 )% $ 261,321 Fixed income 326,792 22 % 266,884 109 % 127,436 Sub-total institutional sales commissions 573,380 15 % 496,964 28 % 388,757 Equity underwriting fees 84,099 14 % 73,976 (35 )% 113,751 Fixed income investment banking revenues 48,133 30 % 36,987 130 % 16,070 Mergers & acquisitions fees 115,366 64 % 70,226 (16 )% 83,131 Tax credit funds syndication fees 25,272 (20 )% 31,693 (12 )% 36,062 Private placement fees 14,249 29 % 11,005 467 % 1,940 Trading profit 28,117 (44 )% 50,426 108 % 24,230 Interest 22,145 (3 )% 22,930 22,962 Other 34,716 30 % 26,645 30 % 20,557 Total revenues 945,477 15 % 820,852 16 % 707,460 Interest expense 18,069 11 % 16,289 (3 )% 16,796 Net revenues 927,408 15 % 804,563 16 % 690,664 Non-interest expenses: Sales commissions 222,424 22 % 181,809 34 % 135,187 Admin & incentive compensation and benefit costs 428,215 10 % 388,755 15 % 339,181 Communications and information processing 65,728 13 % 58,305 27 % 46,050 Occupancy and equipment 36,435 14 % 31,865 29 % 24,701 Business development 39,308 3 % 38,019 5 % 36,279 Losses of real estate partnerships held by consolidated variable interest entities 26,180 27 % 20,579 20 % 17,166 Impairment of goodwill associated with RJES 6,933 NM Clearance and other 34,199 (18 )% 41,852 36 % 30,694 Total non-interest expenses 859,422 13 % 761,184 21 % 629,258 Income before taxes and including noncontrolling interests 67,986 57 % 43,379 (29 )% 61,406 Noncontrolling interests (34,185 ) (32,376 ) (21,115 ) Pre-tax income excluding noncontrolling interests $ 102,171 35 % $ 75,755 (8 )% $ 82,521 Year ended September 30, 2013 compared with the year ended September 30, 2012 Capital Markets Pre-tax income in the Capital Markets segment increased $26 million , or 35% , over the prior year. Certain of the Capital Markets businesses of Morgan Keegan were immediately integrated into RJ&A operations on the date of acquisition. Other Morgan Keegan Capital Markets businesses were integrated into RJ&A over time and were completed by mid-February 2013. A full year of Morgan Keegan equity capital markets and fixed income operations are included in the current year results, as compared to only six months in fiscal year 2012, impacting comparisons of our legacy capital markets results, especially fixed income operations, to our current results. 48 Index Our fixed income revenues were significantly higher for the current year as compared to the prior year primarily due to the inclusion of a full year Morgan Keegan results. The combination of our former fixed income operations with Morgan Keegan fixed income operations results in a combined department that is approximately three times the size of our legacy fixed income business. Net revenues increased by $123 million , or 15% . Total institutional sales commissions increased 15% over the prior year. Equity institutional sales commissions increased $17 million, or 7% , primarily due to improved equity market conditions. The $60 million , or 22% , increase in fixed income institutional sales commissions over the prior year is primarily due to the increased size of our fixed income operations after the Morgan Keegan acquisition and the inclusion of twelve months of the combined entities operations in the current year as compared to only six months in the prior year. Our significantly larger public finance fixed income operations as a result of the Morgan Keegan acquisition favorably impacted both our investment banking revenues and our securities commissions and fees. The number of lead and co-managed equity underwritings, as well as merger & acquisition transactions, during the current year increased significantly in our U.S. operations as compared to the prior year. In the latter part of the first quarter of our fiscal 2013, concerns related to the then pending fiscal cliff crisis had, at least in part, a favorable impact on our equity capital markets business as underwriting and merger and acquisition activity improved significantly as issuers sought to complete certain equity transactions in advance of any anticipated tax law changes. The activity levels experienced in the first quarter of fiscal year 2013 slowed considerably thereafter until a very active fourth quarter. For the year, the sectors in which we generated the most significant amounts of merger and acquisition fees were technology services, energy, technology, financial services, healthcare, and general industrials. Capital markets activities in our Canadian operations have remained sluggish throughout the year, continuing to reflect the adverse market conditions which existed throughout the prior fiscal year, particularly in the businesses in which we focus such as natural resources. The primary contributor to our fixed income investment banking revenues is our public finance investment banking operations. The volume of our lead and co-managed public finance underwritings increased significantly over the prior year. This favorable comparison is in part due to the positive impact of the inclusion of the public finance operations we acquired from Morgan Keegan in our results for an entire year. The decrease in tax credit syndication fee revenues results from an increase in the amount of fee revenues that have been deferred, to be recognized at later dates upon completion of certain revenue recognition criteria. The volume of tax credit fund partnership interests sold during the current year is slightly higher than in the prior year. Despite our increase in fixed income trading capacity resulting from the Morgan Keegan acquisition, our trading profit results for the year, while positive overall, have been unfavorably impacted by adverse conditions in the municipal fixed income market. This market has been impacted during the current year by a number of factors. Municipal fixed income markets were negatively impacted during first quarter by discussions and rumors regarding potential changes in the tax laws pertaining to limits, or caps, on the tax-exempt advantages of municipal fixed income instruments (the fiscal cliff ). In response to these uncertainties, interest rates on municipal securities increased during December 2012, which negatively impacted our trading results. During the third quarter, the 10-year benchmark interest rate increased over 60 basis points in a very short period of time (May through June 30, 2013), resulting in very little demand for municipal fixed income securities in the market and valuation losses on municipal securities held in inventory, which negatively impacted our third quarter trading results. During the fourth quarter interest rates retreated somewhat back to their early May 2013 levels, and our trading results were strong, especially in municipal products, during that period. All of these factors, considered in conjunction with what were strong municipal fixed income trading results in the prior year, resulted in unfavorable trading profits in year-over-year comparisons. 49 Index Non-interest expenses increased $98 million , or 13% , over the prior year primarily driven by the inclusion of twelve months of the Morgan Keegan fixed income operations. Sales commission expense increased $41 million , or 22% , which is correlated with the increase in overall institutional sales commission revenues of 15% , and includes the impact of the shift to a higher proportion of commissions being fixed income sales which are paid higher commissions including certain retention-related expenses implemented as part of the Morgan Keegan acquisition. Administrative and incentive compensation and benefit expense increased $39 million , or 10% , primarily driven by the significant increase in personnel from the Morgan Keegan acquisition. Communications and information processing expense increased $7 million , or 13% , as a result of new technology initiatives and a full year of Morgan Keegan expenses. Goodwill impairment expense associated with RJES of $7 million (see discussion below) and a $6 million increase in losses of real estate partnerships held by consolidated variable interest entities (discussed below) contributed to the increase in other expense. These increases are partially offset by a decrease in clearance and other expense of $8 million , or 18% . The decrease results primarily from the application of differing clearing charge allocation methodologies between the Capital Markets and the PCG segments within RJ&A as compared to the historic MK & Co. operations which favorably impact prior year comparisons (refer to the PCG results of operations herein for a discussion of an offsetting unfavorable prior year comparison within that segment). During the second quarter, we incurred impairment expense associated with the RJES operations of $6.9 million . However, since we did not own 100% of RJES as of March 31, 2013, $2.3 million of this expense is attributable to others and is included in the offsetting noncontrolling interests amount attributable to others. Therefore the net impact of this goodwill impairment on the pre-tax results after consideration of amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests is $4.6 million. Refer to the goodwill section of this Item 7 and Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for further information on this goodwill impairment expense. Losses of real estate partnerships held by consolidated VIEs result directly from the consolidation of certain low-income housing tax credit funds. Since we only hold an insignificant interest in these consolidated funds, nearly all of these losses are attributable to others and are therefore included in the offsetting noncontrolling interests. Refer to Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for further information on the consolidation of VIEs. Noncontrolling interests include the consolidation of RJES (for periods prior to April 2013, the period in which we acquired the interests previously held by others) as well as the impact of consolidating certain low-income housing tax credit funds, which impacts other revenue, interest expense, and losses of real estate partnerships held by consolidated VIEs (as described in the previous paragraph) by including the portion of these consolidated entities which we do not own. Total segment expenses attributable to noncontrolling interests increased by $2 million as compared to the prior year in part as a result of the portions of the RJES goodwill impairment expense attributable to others as well as the increase in losses of real estate partnerships held by VIEs. Year ended September 30, 2012 compared with the year ended September 30, 2011 Capital Markets Pre-tax income in fiscal year 2012 in the Capital Markets segment decreased $7 million , or 8% , as compared to the prior year. This segment includes the activities of our emerging markets businesses, whose operations generated a $7 million pre-tax loss in fiscal year 2012, which is $12 million worse than the pre-tax income generated by those operations in fiscal year 2011. Certain of the Capital Markets businesses of the Morgan Keegan broker-dealer we acquired on April 2, 2012 were immediately integrated into RJ&A operations on the date of acquisition. Other Morgan Keegan Capital Markets businesses are being integrated into RJ&A over time. Morgan Keegan equity capital markets and fixed income operations are included in the fiscal year 2012 results, therefore, comparisons of our legacy capital markets operations, especially fixed income operations, to our current operations, are not meaningful. Our plan is to fully integrate all of the historic Morgan Keegan Capital Markets businesses into RJ&A by the end of the second quarter of our fiscal year 2013. The weakness in the equity capital markets negatively impacted our results. Our fixed income results reflect significant improvement during the third and fourth quarter primarily driven by the acquisition of Morgan Keegan. The combination of our former fixed income operations with Morgan Keegan fixed income operations results in a combined department that is approximately three times the size of our legacy fixed income business. 50 Index Net revenues in fiscal year 2012 increased by $114 million , or 16% , primarily resulting from a $139 million , or 109% , increase in institutional fixed income sales commissions, a $26 million , or 108% , increase in trading profits, a $21 million , or 130% , increase in fixed income investment banking revenues and a $9 million increase in private placement fees. These revenue increases were partially offset by a $40 million , or 35% , decrease in equity underwriting fees, a $31 million , or 12% , decrease in institutional equity sales commissions, a $13 million , or 16% , decrease in merger and acquisitions fees, and a $4 million , or 12% , decrease in tax credit fund syndication fees. Lingering concerns over the EU debt crisis and the U.S. economy had a negative impact on the capital markets for most of fiscal year 2012. Fixed income sales commissions increased over the prior year primarily due to the increased size of our fixed income operations. The increase in fixed income investment banking revenues was primarily the result of the increase in underwriting fees of $23 million which arose from the Morgan Keegan fixed income public finance operations we acquired. Although equity market levels at the end of fiscal year 2012 finished at higher levels than the prior year, the market for public offerings during fiscal year 2012 has been erratic. The number of lead and co-managed underwritings during the year increased in our U.S. operations and decreased significantly in our Canadian operations. Fiscal year 2011 was a particularly strong year for our Canadian equity capital markets operations but market conditions in the industries in which they are concentrated (energy and mining) have slowed significantly since the prior year. Equity underwriting fees arising from our operations in emerging markets decreased $15 million in fiscal year 2012 as compared to the prior year. Fiscal year 2011 revenues include fees arising from our Argentine joint venture which acted as an advisor to institutional clients in several significant transactions during that prior year, resulting in the unfavorable comparison to fiscal year 2012. Our tax credit fund syndication subsidiary sold approximately $596 million in tax credit fund partnership interests to investors during fiscal year 2012, a decrease compared to the record volume of $616 million sold in fiscal year 2011. Trading profits for fiscal year 2012 increased $26 million , or 108% , as compared to the prior year. The year-over-year increase results in part from the acquisition of Morgan Keegan, as trading profits arise primarily from fixed income products. After our acquisition of Morgan Keegan, we have more fixed income trading professionals then we had prior to the acquisition, providing us a greater platform from which to generate trading profits. To support the increased number of trading professionals, our inventories of fixed income products has also increased. Non-interest expenses in fiscal year 2012 increased $132 million , or 21% , over the prior year primarily driven by the addition of the Morgan Keegan fixed income operations. Sales commission expense increased $47 million , or 34% , which is directly correlated to the increase in overall institutional sales commission revenues of 28% , and includes the shift to a higher percentage of fixed income sales. Administrative and incentive compensation and benefit expense increased $50 million , or 15% , primarily driven by the significant increase in personnel resulting from the Morgan Keegan acquisition, a full year of consolidation of RJES which became effective when we acquired a controlling interest in that subsidiary in April, 2011, and to a lesser extent, the annual increase in salary and benefits costs. The increase in clearance and other expense primarily resulted from an increase of approximately $15 million in clearance expenses arising from the larger combined fixed income operations, Morgan Keegan allocation methodology, and $2 million of expense in fiscal year 2012 arising from the amortization of various intangible assets which arose as a result of the Morgan Keegan acquisition. Noncontrolling interests represent the impact of consolidating certain low-income housing tax credit funds, which also impacts other revenue, interest expense, and other expenses within this segment (see Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for further details) as well as the impact of our consolidation of RJES, and reflects the portion of these consolidated entities which we do not own. Total segment expenses attributable to noncontrolling interest increased by approximately $11 million as compared to the prior year. 51 Index Results of Operations Asset Management The following table presents consolidated financial information for our Asset Management segment for the years indicated: Year ended September 30, 2013 % change 2012 % change 2011 ($ in thousands) Revenues: Investment advisory fees $ 247,162 25 % $ 198,369 5 % $ 188,817 Other 45,655 18 % 38,855 3 % 37,694 Total revenues 292,817 23 % 237,224 5 % 226,511 Expenses: Admin & incentive compensation and benefit costs 91,994 13 % 81,418 6 % 76,594 Communications and information processing 19,056 16 % 16,378 7 % 15,307 Occupancy and equipment 4,364 23 % 3,536 (4 )% 3,670 Business development 8,288 5 % 7,885 7 % 7,365 Investment sub-advisory fees 33,183 25 % 26,563 (4 )% 27,606 Other 37,342 12 % 33,353 17 % 28,392 Total expenses 194,227 15 % 169,133 6 % 158,934 Income before taxes and including noncontrolling interests 98,590 45 % 68,091 1 % 67,577 Noncontrolling interests 2,290 850 1,401 Pre-tax income excluding noncontrolling interests $ 96,300 43 % $ 67,241 2 % $ 66,176 Managed Programs As of September 30, 2013 , approximately 82% of investment advisory fees recorded in this segment are earned from assets held in managed programs. Of these revenues, approximately 55% of our investment advisory fees recorded each quarter are determined based on balances at the beginning of a quarter, approximately 30% are based on balances at the end of the quarter and the remaining 15% are computed based on average assets throughout the quarter. The following table reflects fee-billable financial assets under management in managed programs at the dates indicated: September 30, 2013 September 30, 2012 September 30, 2011 (in millions) Assets under management: Eagle Asset Management, Inc. $ 24,500 $ 19,986 $ 16,092 Raymond James Consulting Services 11,385 9,443 8,356 Unified Managed Accounts ( UMA ) 4,962 2,855 1,677 Freedom Accounts & other managed programs 16,555 11,884 9,523 ClariVest (1) 3,386 Sub-total assets under management 60,788 44,168 35,648 Less: Assets managed for affiliated entities (4,799 ) (4,185 ) (3,579 ) Sub-total net assets under management 55,989 39,983 32,069 MK & Co. managed fee-based assets (2) 2,801 Total assets under management $ 55,989 $ 42,784 $ 32,069 (1) Eagle acquired a 45% interest in ClariVest on December 24, 2012. (2) Revenues generated from the Closing Date of the Morgan Keegan acquisition through mid-February 2013 (the platform conversion date to RJ&A) arising from assets in what were during such time MK & Co. managed fee-based programs, were included in the PCG segment.

See Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for additional information regarding the ClariVest acquisition. The following table summarizes the activity impacting the total financial assets under management in managed programs (excluding activity in assets managed for affiliated entities and MK & Co. managed fee-based assets for the periods prior to the conversion of Morgan Keegan accounts to the RJ&A platform) for the periods indicated: Year ended September 30, 2013 2012 2011 (in millions) Assets under management at beginning of period $ 44,168 $ 35,648 $ 33,551 Net inflows of client assets 4,873 2,999 3,261 Net market appreciation (depreciation) in asset values 6,233 5,521 (1,164 ) Inflow resulting from the ClariVest acquisition (1) 3,113 Inflows resulting from the conversion of MK & Co. accounts to the RJ&A platform (2) 2,401 Assets under management at end of period $ 60,788 $ 44,168 $ 35,648 (1) Eagle acquired a 45% interest in ClariVest on December 24, 2012. (2) In mid-February 2013, the client accounts of MK & Co. were converted onto the RJ&A platform. Non-Managed Programs As of September 30, 2013 , approximately 18% of investment advisory fees revenue recorded in this segment are earned for administrative services on assets held in non-managed programs and all such investment advisory fees are determined based on balances at the beginning of the quarter. The following table reflects fee-billable assets under management in non-managed programs at the dates indicated: September 30, 2013 September 30, 2012 September 30, 2011 (in millions) Passport $ 32,121 $ 28,405 (1) $ 22,674 (1) Ambassador 30,043 16,772 (1) 12,713 (1) Other non-managed fee-based assets 2,517 3,191 (1) 2,214 (1) Sub-total assets under management 64,681 48,368 37,601 Less: Assets managed for affiliated entities (173 ) (88 ) (78 ) Sub-total net assets under management 64,508 48,280 37,523 MK & Co. non-managed fee-based assets (2) 6,772 Total assets under management $ 64,508 $ 55,052 $ 37,523 (1) Certain assets in non-managed accounts, predominately comprised of cash balances, are excluded from the calculation of the account value for fee billing purposes.

(2) Revenues generated from the Closing Date of the Morgan Keegan acquisition through mid-February 2013 (the platform conversion date to RJ&A) arising from assets in what were during such time MK & Co. non-managed fee-based programs, were included in the PCG segment. 53 Index The following table summarizes the activity impacting the fee-billable financial assets under management in non-managed programs (excluding activity in MK & Co. non-managed fee-based assets for the periods prior to the conversion of MK & Co. accounts to the RJ&A platform) for the periods indicated: Year ended September 30, 2013 2012 2011 (in millions) Assets under management at beginning of period $ 48,368 $ 37,601 (1) $ 33,309 (1) Net inflows of client assets 6,421 6,264 6,743 Net market appreciation (depreciation) in asset values 3,265 4,503 (2,451 ) Inflows resulting from the conversion of MK & Co. accounts to the RJ&A platform (2) 6,627 Assets under management at end of period $ 64,681 $ 48,368 $ 37,601 (1) Certain assets in non-managed accounts, predominately comprised of cash balances, are excluded from the calculation of the account value for fee billing purposes.

(2) In mid-February 2013, the client accounts of MK & Co. were converted onto the RJ&A platform. Year ended September 30, 2013 compared with the year ended September 30, 2012 Asset Management Pre-tax income in the Asset Management segment increased $29 million , or 43% , over the prior year. Investment advisory fee revenue increased by $49 million , or 25% , generated by an increase in assets under management. Assets under management in managed programs have increased $13.2 billion, or 31%, over the prior year. The increase results from a combination of net inflows, inflows resulting from our acquisition of an interest in ClariVest, inflows resulting from the conversion of MK & Co. accounts to the RJ&A platform, and market appreciation in asset values. Assets under management in non-managed programs have increased $9.4 billion, or 17%, over the prior year. The increase results from a combination of net inflows, inflows resulting from the conversion of MK & Co. accounts to the RJ&A platform, and market appreciation in asset values. Other revenue increased by $7 million , or 18% , primarily resulting from an increase in fee income generated by our RJT subsidiary reflecting a 19% increase in RJT client assets as compared to the prior year, to $2.92 billion as of September 30, 2013. Expenses increased by approximately $25 million , or 15% , resulting from a $11 million , or 13% , increase in administrative and incentive compensation and benefits costs, a $7 million , or 25% , increase in investment sub-advisory fees, a $4 million , or 12% , increase in other expenses and a $3 million , or 16% , increase in communications and information processing expense. The increase in administrative and incentive compensation expense is a result of the combination of increases in salary expenses resulting from the addition of ClariVest, annual increases and additions to staff associated with our legacy operations, as well as an increase in performance compensation which is directly related to the increase in investment advisory fee revenues. The increase in investment sub-advisory fee expense is directly related to the increase in advisory fees paid to the external managers associated with certain assets included within the UMA and Raymond James Consulting Services programs. The increase in other expense is primarily due to increases in the costs incurred so that certain funds sponsored by Eagle are available as investment choices on the platforms of other broker-dealers and increases in the expenses of RJT result from the increase in client assets. The increase in communication and information processing expense is primarily a result of the addition of ClariVest operations and costs associated with the implementation of a new back-office system supporting this segment. Year ended September 30, 2012 compared to the year ended September 30, 2011 Asset Management Pre-tax income in the Asset Management segment in fiscal year 2012 increased $1 million , or 2% , as compared to the prior year. 54 Index Investment advisory fee revenue in fiscal year 2012 increased by $10 million , or 5% , generated by an increase in assets under management. Total legacy Raymond James assets under management in managed programs were $8.5 billion more at September 30, 2012 than they were as of September 30, 2011, an increase of 24% (fee revenue excludes fees arising from fee-based assets in programs managed by Morgan Keegan as the revenues associated with these activities are reflected in our PCG segment until the PCG integration occurs in fiscal year 2013). Since the prior year, net inflows of client assets into managed programs approximated $3 billion while asset values have increased by $5.5 billion. Despite the decrease in assets under management in non-managed programs experienced during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011, resulting in lower revenue during our first quarter of fiscal year 2012, assets in non-managed programs steadily increased during fiscal year 2012. As a result of the manner in which our fee revenues are computed, the increase in assets under management experienced during the September 2012 quarter will have a positive impact on our billings for the first quarter of fiscal year 2013. Expenses increased by approximately $10 million , or 6% , in fiscal year 2012 resulting from a $5 million , or 6% , increase in administrative and performance based incentive compensation, and a $5 million , or 17% , increase in other expenses. The increase in other expense is primarily due to increases in various corporate overhead allocations to this segment, increases in the costs incurred so that certain funds sponsored by Eagle are available as investment choices on the platforms of other broker-dealers, and an increase in the third party expenses RJT incurred in the performance of certain of its obligations to clients.

Year ended September 30, 2013 compared with the year ended September 30, 2012 RJ Bank Pre-tax income generated by the RJ Bank segment increased $28 million , or 11% . The improvement in pre-tax income was primarily attributable to an increase of $11 million , or 3% , in net revenues and a $23 million , or 90% , decrease in the provision for loan losses, offset by a $7 million , or 9% , increase in non-interest expenses (excluding the provision for loan losses). The $11 million increase in net revenues was attributable to a $17 million increase in net interest income, partially offset by a $6 million decrease in other income. Net interest income increased $17 million , or 5% , primarily as a result of a $1.3 billion increase in average interest-earning banking assets. This increase in average interest-earning banking assets was driven by a $1.1 billion increase in average loans as well as increases in both average investments and cash. The significant increase in average loans resulted from a strong corporate lending market, including our Canadian lending operation (which began in late February 2012), and growth in the recently introduced securities based lending product. The yield on interest-earning banking assets decreased to 3.34% from 3.61% due to declines in both the loan and investment yields. The loan portfolio yield decreased to 3.86% from 4.20% due to a reduction in the corporate loan portfolio yield resulting from tightened credit spreads and the repricing of existing loans at lower rates. In addition, the yield of the residential mortgage loan portfolio declined as a result of adjustable rate loans resetting at lower rates as well as lower rates on new production. Primarily as a result of the decrease in the yield of the average interest-earning assets, the net interest margin decreased to 3.25% from 3.50%. Corresponding to the increase in interest-earning banking assets, average interest-bearing banking liabilities increased $1.2 billion to $9.3 billion. The decrease in other income was primarily due to a $7 million decrease in foreign currency gains/losses from prior year levels, a $2 million loss in the valuation of RJ Bank bank-owned life insurance, and a prior year gain of $2 million resulting from a settlement with a residential mortgage loan servicer. These were partially offset by a $3 million reduction in other-than-temporary impairment ( OTTI ) losses on our available for sale securities portfolio and a $2 million increase in income from the sale of held for sale loans. The significant reduction in the provision for loan losses resulted from improved credit quality in the loan portfolio including a decrease in corporate criticized loans, the favorable resolution of corporate problem loans, lower loan-to-value ( LTV ) ratios in the residential mortgage loan portfolio, and a significant reduction in residential mortgage delinquent loans. These credit characteristics reflected the positive impact from improved economic conditions. Net loan charge-offs decreased $11 million, or 45%, to $13 million. 58 Index The $7 million increase in non-interest expenses (excluding the provision for loan losses) was primarily attributable to a $3 million, or 18%, increase in compensation and benefits expenses related to staff additions to support increased loan activity, a $3 million increase in affiliate deposit account servicing fee expenses resulting from increased deposit balances, and a $1 million increase in affiliate fee expenses related to our securities based lending business. Year ended September 30, 2012 compared to the year ended September 30, 2011 RJ Bank Pre-tax income generated by the RJ Bank segment increased $67 million, or 39%, as compared to the prior year. The improvement in pre-tax income was primarily attributable to an increase of $67 million, or 25%, in net revenues and an $8 million, or 23%, decrease in the provision for loan losses, offset by an $8 million, or 13%, increase in other non-interest expenses. Net revenue was positively impacted by a $51 million increase in net interest income, $6 million less in OTTI losses on our available for sale securities portfolio, and an improvement of $8 million in foreign currency transaction gains on Canadian dollar denominated loans in the corporate loan portfolio. Net interest income increased $57 million over the prior year (excluding the impact of a $6 million correction recorded in the prior year), primarily as a result of a $1.2 billion increase in average interest-earning banking assets. This increase in average interest-earning banking assets was driven by a $1.2 billion increase in average corporate loans. While there were increases in the Small Business Administration ( SBA ) and consumer loan portfolios as well as cash and investments, these were largely offset by a decrease in residential mortgage loans. The yield on interest-earning banking assets of 3.61% was consistent with 3.60% in the prior year. The average loan portfolio yield was 4.20% as compared to 4.25% in the prior year. The loan portfolio yield decreased due to a decline in the yield on the residential mortgage loan portfolio resulting from adjustable rate loans resetting at lower rates, which offset an increase in the corporate loan portfolio yield. Average corporate loans outstanding include the impact of the purchase of $400 million of Canadian loans on February 29, 2012. The net interest margin increased 0.07% from the prior year to 3.50% due to a small increase in the yield on earning assets and a small decrease in the average cost of funds. Corresponding to the increase in interest-earning banking assets, average interest-bearing banking liabilities increased $1.1 billion to $8.1 billion. The provision for loan losses during the year was positively impacted by a reduction in both C&I and CRE nonperforming loans, improved credit characteristics of certain problem loans, and the reduction of the balance of residential mortgage nonperforming loans. In addition, somewhat improved economic conditions relative to the prior year has limited the number of new problem loans. Net loan charge-offs decreased $11 million, or 31%, to $24 million for fiscal year 2012. Nonperforming loans decreased $27 million, or 20%, compared to September 30, 2011. Corporate nonperforming loans decreased $14 million, or 33%, and residential nonperforming loans decreased $13 million, or 14%. The $8 million increase in non-interest expenses (excluding the provision for loan losses) as compared to the prior year was primarily attributable to a $3 million, or 23% increase in compensation and benefits expenses related to staff additions and a $6 million increase in affiliate deposit account servicing fee expenses resulting from increased deposit balances. The unrealized loss on our available for sale securities portfolio at September 30, 2012 was $17 million compared to $46 million as of September 30, 2011. This significant improvement was the result of higher market prices, despite the continued uncertainty in the residential non-agency collateralized mortgage obligation ( CMOs ) market. 59 Index The following table presents average balance, interest income and expense, the related interest yields and rates, and interest spreads for RJ Bank for the years indicated: Year ended September 30, 2013 2012 2011 Average balance Interest inc./exp.

Fee income on loans included in interest income for the years ended September 30, 2013 , 2012 and 2011 was $48 million, $51 million, and $38 million, respectively. (2) The CRE Construction yield was positively impacted by a loan payoff with a significant unearned discount. (3) Negotiable Order of Withdrawal ( NOW ) account. 61 Index Increases and decreases in interest income and interest expense result from changes in average balances (volume) of interest-earning banking assets and liabilities, as well as changes in average interest rates. The following table shows the effect that these factors had on the interest earned on RJ Bank interest-earning assets and the interest incurred on its interest-bearing liabilities. The effect of changes in volume is determined by multiplying the change in volume by the previous period average yield/cost. Similarly, the effect of rate changes is calculated by multiplying the change in average yield/cost by the previous year volume. Changes applicable to both volume and rate have been allocated proportionately.

Results from these activities are substantially determined by the valuations within Raymond James Capital Partners, L.P. ( Capital Partners ), Raymond James Employee Investment Funds I and II (the EIF Funds ), and our direct merchant banking and private equity investments (the Third Party Private Funds ). Year ended September 30, 2013 compared to the year ended September 30, 2012 Other The pre-tax loss generated by this segment increased by approximately $ 6 million , or 4% . Total revenues increased $68 million , or 116% . The increase primarily resulted from a $44 million increase in other revenues associated with our indirect investment in Albion, which was sold in April 2013. Fiscal year 2013 includes $74 million of favorable valuation adjustments and distributions received from Albion ($65 million of favorable valuation adjustments and $9 million of dividends received), compared to $30 million of favorable valuation adjustments and dividends received on Albion in the prior fiscal year. Revenues resulting from either distributions received or valuation adjustments related to certain private equity investments we acquired as part of the Morgan Keegan acquisition increased $16 million over the prior year. Interest expense increased $18 million , or 29% over the prior year. The increase primarily results from our March 2012 issuances of $350 million 6.9% senior notes and $250 million 5.625% senior notes, as well as interest expense associated with borrowings under certain credit agreements with Regions Bank (as more fully described in Notes 15 and 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K). Both of the March 2012 debt offerings and the borrowings from Regions Bank were part of our acquisition financing activities and other transactions associated with the Morgan Keegan acquisition. Acquisition related expenses increased $14 million , or 24% , over the prior year. These expenses are almost entirely comprised of expenses associated with our acquisition and integration of Morgan Keegan. These expenses include information systems integration and conversion costs, other integration related costs, occupancy and equipment costs which include costs incurred to abandon certain leased facilities that resulted from our integration activities, and severance related expenses (see Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for additional information). In mid-February 2013, the client accounts of MK & Co. were transferred to RJ&A pursuant to our Morgan Keegan acquisition integration strategy and at such time we commenced operations under one information systems platform. As of September 30, 2013, we consider the integration activities associated with the Morgan Keegan acquisition to be substantially complete. 63 Index Compensation and other expenses increased $8 million, or 21% , in the current period primarily as a result of an increase in incentive compensation expense. The noncontrolling interest line item captures the pre-tax income generated from investments included in this segment of which we do not own 100%. The income before tax attributable to noncontrolling interests increased $34 million over the prior year. This increase primarily resulted from the increase in revenues generated from the Albion investment, which resulted in a $26 million increase over the prior year in the attribution of pre-tax income to others. The remaining $8 million increase over the prior year resulted from increases in the pre-tax income generated by the other investments we hold in our private equity portfolio of which we do not own 100%. Year ended September 30, 2012 compared to the year ended September 30, 2011 Other The pre-tax loss generated by this segment increased by approximately $46 million , or 57% . In fiscal year 2012, total revenues increased $31 million, or 114% over the prior year. The increase primarily resulted from a $22 million increase in other revenues associated with our indirect investment in Albion (comprised of both favorable valuation adjustments and an increase in dividends received). The remaining net increase in revenues resulted from a combination of valuation adjustments and earnings received from the balance of our private equity investment portfolio. Interest expense in fiscal year 2012 increased $31 million , or 99%, over the prior year. The increase is primarily comprised of: $21 million of interest expense resulting from our March 2012 issuances of $350 million 6.9% senior notes and $250 million 5.625% senior notes and $6 million of additional interest expense in fiscal year 2012 associated with our April 2011 issuance of $250 million 4.25% senior notes, and $2 million of interest expense associated with a credit agreement entered into with Regions Bank (see Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for additional information on this borrowing). Both of the March 2012 debt offerings and the Regions Bank credit agreement were part of our acquisition financing activities and other transactions associated with the Morgan Keegan acquisition. Compensation and other expenses increased $10 million, or 38%, in fiscal year 2012 over the prior year primarily related to an increase in incentive compensation. Acquisition related expenses in fiscal year 2012, all associated with our acquisition of Morgan Keegan, include approximately $20 million of expense associated with our information systems integration and conversion costs and other integration related activities associated with integrating Morgan Keegan operations into our own, $19 million of net severance related expense, $7 million of financial advisory fee expenses, $6 million of transaction bridge financing facility expenses, $5 million of expense related to leased facilities and equipment dispositions, and $2 million of legal expense. Fiscal year 2011 included a non-recurring $41 million loss on ARS repurchased. The noncontrolling interest line item captures the pre-tax income generated from investments included in this segment of which we do not own 100%. In fiscal year 2012, the income before tax attributable to noncontrolling interests increased $18 million over the prior year. This increase primarily resulted from the increase in revenues generated from the Albion investment, which resulted in a $17 million increase over the prior year in the attribution of pre-tax income to others. 64 Index Certain statistical disclosures by bank holding companies As a financial holding company, we are required to provide certain statistical disclosures by bank holding companies pursuant to the Securities and Exchange Commission Industry Guide 3. Certain of those disclosures are as follows for the periods indicated: Year ended September 30, 2013 2012 2011 RJF return on assets (1) 1.7% 1.5% 1.6% RJF return on equity (2) 10.6% 9.7% 11.3% Equity to assets (3) 17.3% 16.8% 15.3% Dividend payout ratio (4) 21.7% 23.6% 23.7% (1) Computed as net income attributable to RJF, Inc. for the year indicated, divided by average assets (the sum of total assets at the beginning and end of the year, divided by two). (2) Computed by utilizing the net income attributable to RJF, Inc. and the average equity for each respective year. Average equity is computed by adding the total equity attributable to RJF, Inc. as of each quarter-end date during the indicated year, plus the beginning of the year total, divided by five. (3) Computed as average equity (the sum of total equity at the beginning and end of the year, divided by two), divided by average assets (the sum of total assets at the beginning and end of the year, divided by two). (4) Computed as dividends declared per common share during the year as a percentage of diluted earnings per common share. Refer to the RJ Bank section of this MD&A and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for the other required disclosures. Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity is essential to our business. The primary goal of our liquidity management activities is to ensure adequate funding to conduct our business over a range of market environments. Senior management establishes our liquidity and capital policies. These policies include senior management review of short- and long-term cash flow forecasts, review of monthly capital expenditures, the monitoring of the availability of alternative sources of financing, and the daily monitoring of liquidity in our significant subsidiaries. Our decisions on the allocation of capital to our business units consider, among other factors, projected profitability and cash flow, risk and impact on future liquidity needs. Our treasury departments assist in evaluating, monitoring and controlling the impact that our business activities have on our financial condition, liquidity and capital structure as well as maintain our relationships with various lenders. The objectives of these policies are to support the successful execution of our business strategies while ensuring ongoing and sufficient liquidity. Liquidity is provided primarily through our business operations and financing activities. Financing activities could include bank borrowings, repurchase agreement transactions or additional capital raising activities under our universal shelf registration statement. Cash provided by operating activities during the year ended September 30, 2013 was $660 million . Operating cash generated by successful operating results over the period resulted in a $457 million increase in cash. The increase in operating cash included an increase in brokerage client payables and other accounts payable of $1.31 billion, largely the result of an increase in client cash deposits during the period. A decrease in trading instruments held resulted in an increase of $252 million in operating cash. A decrease in brokerage client and other receivables resulted in an increase of $88 million in operating cash. Partially offsetting these activities which resulted in increases of cash, decreases in cash resulted from the following activities: an increase in assets segregated pursuant to regulations and other segregated assets resulted in a $1.28 billion use of cash due to the increase in brokerage client deposits; an increase in securities purchased under agreements to resell, net of securities sold under agreements to repurchase, resulted in a $191 million use of operating cash; and an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets resulted in a $66 million use of cash. All other components of operating activities combined to net a $94 million increase in operating cash. 65 Index Investing activities resulted in the use of $652 million of cash during the year ended September 30, 2013 . The primary investing activity was the use of $865 million in cash to fund an increase in bank loans (net of proceeds received from the sale of loans held for investment). We also invested $73 million in equipment assets which are comprised of buildings, including our new data center in the Denver, Colorado area (see Item 2, Properties, in this Form 10-K for additional information), equipment, and technology assets. Partially offsetting these uses of cash, we generated cash through the sale of private equity investments, net of purchases of additional equity investments, of $229 million, driven most significantly by the sale of our indirect investment in Albion (see the Other MD&A discussion in this Item 7 for additional information). We received proceeds from the maturation, repayment, redemption or sale of securities in our available for sale security portfolio of $55 million, net of purchases of additional securities. All other components of investing activities combined to net a $2 million increase in cash. Financing activities provided $615 million of cash during the year ended September 30, 2013 . Increases in deposit liabilities of RJ Bank provided $696 million in cash. We received $56 million in cash upon the exercise of stock options and employee stock purchases. Partially offsetting the increases, we used $77 million in payment of dividends to our shareholders and $51 million of cash was used to repay borrowings (included in the net repayment is a $128 million repayment of a borrowing from Regions Bank, which was subsequently converted to a secured revolving credit facility. Refer to Notes 15 and 17 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for additional information). All other components of financing activities combined to net a $9 million use of cash. We believe our existing assets, most of which are liquid in nature, together with funds generated from operations and committed and uncommitted financing facilities, should provide adequate funds for continuing operations at current levels of activity. Sources of Liquidity Approximately $1.02 billion of our total September 30, 2013 cash and cash equivalents (a portion of which is invested on behalf of the parent company by RJ&A) was available to us without restrictions. The cash and cash equivalents held were as follows: Cash and cash equivalents: September 30, 2013 (in thousands) RJF $ 274,747 RJ&A (1) 1,052,268 RJ Bank 974,175 Other subsidiaries 295,426 Total cash and cash equivalents $ 2,596,616 (1) RJF has loaned $760 million to RJ&A as of September 30, 2013 , which RJ&A has invested on behalf of RJF in cash and cash equivalents. In addition to the liquidity on hand described above, we have other various potential sources of liquidity which are described below. Liquidity Available from Subsidiaries Liquidity is principally available to the parent company from RJ&A and RJ Bank. RJ&A is required to maintain net capital equal to the greater of $1 million or 2% of aggregate debit balances arising from customer transactions. Covenants in RJ&A committed secured financing facilities require its net capital to be a minimum of 10% of aggregate debit balances. At September 30, 2013 , RJ&A exceeded both the minimum regulatory and its financing covenants net capital requirements. At that date, RJ&A had excess net capital of approximately $398 million , of which approximately $153 million is available for dividend while still maintaining its desired net capital ratio of 15% of aggregate debit items. There are also limitations on the amount of dividends that may be declared by a broker-dealer without FINRA approval. RJ Bank may pay dividends to the parent company without prior approval by its regulator as long as the dividend does not exceed the sum of RJ Bank current calendar year and the previous two calendar years retained net income, and RJ Bank maintains its targeted capital to risk-weighted assets ratios. During the year ended September 30, 2013 , RJ Bank made $100 million in dividend payments to RJF. RJ Bank had approximately $48 million of capital in excess of the amount it would need as of September 30, 2013 to maintain its targeted total capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 12.5%. Liquidity available to us from our subsidiaries, other than RJ&A and RJ Bank, is relatively insignificant and in certain instances may be subject to regulatory requirements. 66 Index Borrowings and Financing Arrangements The following table presents our domestic financing arrangements with third party lenders that we generally utilize to finance a portion of our fixed income securities trading instruments held, and the outstanding balances related thereto, as of September 30, 2013 : Committed secured (1) Uncommitted secured (1)(2) Uncommitted unsecured (1)(2) Total Financing Amount Outstanding balance Financing Amount Outstanding balance Financing Amount Outstanding balance Financing Amount Outstanding balance ($ in thousands) RJ&A $ 400,000 $ 70,000 $ 1,750,000 $ 203,933 $ 350,000 $ $ 2,500,000 $ 273,933 RJ Securities, Inc.

(2) Lenders are under no contractual obligation to lend to us under uncommitted credit facilities. (3) RJ Securities, Inc. is the borrower under the New Regions Credit Agreement, see Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for discussion of the terms of this committed secured borrowing facility. The committed domestic financing arrangements are in the form of either tri-party repurchase agreements or a secured line of credit. The uncommitted domestic financing arrangements are in the form of secured lines of credit, secured bilateral or tri-party repurchase agreements, or unsecured lines of credit. We maintain three unsecured settlement lines of credit available to our Argentine joint venture in the aggregate amount of $13 million . Of the aggregate amount, one settlement line for $9 million is guaranteed by RJF. There were no borrowings outstanding on any of these lines of credit as of September 30, 2013 . RJ Bank has $994 million in immediate credit available from the FHLB on September 30, 2013 and total available credit of 30% of total assets, with the pledge of additional collateral to the FHLB. RJ Bank is eligible to participate in the Fed discount-window program; however, RJ Bank does not view borrowings from the Fed as a primary means of funding. The credit available in this program is subject to periodic review and may be terminated or reduced at the discretion of the Fed. From time to time we purchase short-term securities under agreements to resell ( Reverse Repurchase Agreements ) and sell securities under agreements to repurchase ( Repurchase Agreements ). We account for each of these types of transactions as collateralized financings with the outstanding balances on the Repurchase Agreements included in securities sold under agreements to repurchase. At September 30, 2013 , collateralized financings outstanding in the amount of $301 million are included in securities sold under agreements to repurchase on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. Of this total, outstanding balances on the committed and uncommitted Repurchase Agreements (which are reflected in the table of domestic financing arrangements above) were $70 million and $129 million , respectively, as of September 30, 2013 . Such financings are generally collateralized by non-customer, RJ&A owned securities. The required market value of the collateral associated with the committed secured facilities ranges from 102% to 133% of the amount financed. 67 Index The average daily balance outstanding during the five most recent successive quarters, the maximum month-end balance outstanding during the quarter and the period end balances for Repurchase Agreements and Reverse Repurchase Agreements of RJF are as follows: Repurchase transactions Reverse repurchase transactions For the quarter ended: Average daily balance outstanding Maximum month-end balance outstanding during the quarter End of period balance outstanding Average daily balance outstanding Maximum month-end balance outstanding during the quarter End of period balance outstanding (in thousands) September 30, 2013 $ 267,984 $ 300,933 $ 300,933 $ 643,422 $ 709,120 $ 709,120 June 30, 2013 335,497 397,398 248,382 689,219 744,084 578,147 March 31, 2013 287,797 397,712 397,712 585,824 742,498 623,966 December 31, 2012 377,775 459,567 373,290 647,885 753,041 598,579 September 30, 2012 346,654 349,495 348,036 600,959 588,740 565,016 At September 30, 2013 , in addition to the financing arrangements described above, we had corporate debt of $1.2 billion . The balance is comprised of $350 million outstanding on our 6.90% senior notes due 2042, $249 million outstanding on our 5.625% senior notes due 2024, $300 million outstanding on our 8.60% senior notes due August 2019, $250 million outstanding on our 4.25% senior notes due April 2016, and $46 million outstanding on a mortgage loan for our home-office complex. Our current senior long-term debt ratings are: Rating Agency Rating Outlook Standard & Poor Ratings Services ( S&P ) BBB Negative Moody Investors Services ( Moody ) Baa2 Stable The S&P rating and outlook reflected above are as presented in their December, 2012 report. The Moody rating and outlook reflected above are as presented in their July, 2013 report. Our current long-term debt ratings depend upon a number of factors including industry dynamics, operating and economic environment, operating results, operating margins, earnings trends and volatility, balance sheet composition, liquidity and liquidity management, our capital structure, our overall risk management, business diversification and our market share, and competitive position in the markets in which we operate. Deteriorations in any of these factors could impact our credit ratings. Any rating downgrades could increase our costs in the event we were to pursue obtaining additional financing. Should our credit rating be downgraded prior to a public debt offering it is probable that we would have to offer a higher rate of interest to bond holders. A downgrade to below investment grade may make a public debt offering difficult to execute on terms we would consider to be favorable. The New Regions Credit Agreement includes, as an event of default, the failure of RJF as a guarantor of the repayment of the loan, to maintain an investment grade rating on its unsecured senior debt. Otherwise, none of our credit agreements contain a condition or event of default related to our credit ratings. A downgrade below investment grade could also result in the termination of certain derivative contracts and the counterparties to the derivative instruments could request immediate payment or demand immediate and ongoing overnight collateralization on our derivative instruments in liability positions (see Note 18 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for additional information). A credit downgrade could create a reputational issue and could also result in certain counterparties limiting their business with us, result in negative comments by analysts and potentially impact investor perception of us, and resultantly impact our stock price and/or our clients perception of us. Other sources of liquidity We own life insurance policies which are utilized to fund certain non-qualified deferred compensation plans and other employee benefit plans. The policies which we could readily borrow against have a cash surrender value of approximately $179 million as of September 30, 2013 and we are able to borrow up to 90% , or $161 million of the September 30, 2013 total, without restriction. There are no borrowings outstanding against any of these policies as of September 30, 2013 . On May 24, 2012 we filed a universal shelf registration statement with the SEC to be in a position to access the capital markets if and when necessary or perceived by us to be opportune. 68 Index See the contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies section below for information regarding our commitments. Potential impact of Morgan Keegan matters subject to indemnification by Regions on our liquidity On April 2, 2012, we completed the purchase of all of the issued and outstanding shares of Morgan Keegan from Regions (for additional information, see Note 3 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K). Under the terms of the SPA, in addition to customary indemnity for breaches of representations and warranties and covenants, the SPA also provides that Regions will indemnify RJF for losses incurred in connection with any litigation or similar matter related to pre-closing actions. As a result of these indemnifications, we do not anticipate the resolution of any pre-Closing Date Morgan Keegan litigation matters to negatively impact our liquidity (see Notes 3 and 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K, and Part I Item 3 - Legal Proceedings, in this Form 10-K for further information regarding the indemnifications and the nature of the pre-Closing Date matters). As of September 30, 2013 we consider the integration activities associated with the Morgan Keegan acquisition to be substantially complete. Accordingly, we do not anticipate any further integration activities to have a significant adverse impact on our liquidity. Statement of financial condition analysis The assets on our consolidated statement of financial condition consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents (a large portion of which is segregated for the benefit of customers), receivables including bank loans, financial instruments held for either trading purposes or as investments, and other assets. A significant portion of our assets are liquid in nature, providing us with flexibility in financing our business. Total assets of $23.2 billion at September 30, 2013 are approximately $2.0 billion , or 10% , greater than our total assets as of September 30, 2012 . The increase in total assets primarily results from the following. Segregated assets pursuant to federal regulations increased $1.28 billion, which was prompted by an inflow of cash into client accounts during the year ended September 30, 2013 (refer to the related increase in payables to clients discussed in the following paragraph). Net bank loans receivable increased $830 million due to growth of RJ Bank net loan portfolio during the year. Cash and cash equivalents increased $617 million , refer to the discussion of the various sources and uses of cash during the year discussed in the preceding liquidity and capital resources section of this Item 7. Partially offsetting the increases in assets described above, compared to September 30, 2012 trading instruments decreased $225 million as we reduced our inventory levels in fiscal year 2013 primarily within fixed income securities. The fair value of derivative instruments associated with offsetting matched book positions decreased by $208 million (refer to the decrease in the offsetting liability related to these derivative instruments described in the discussion of the change in liabilities below). Private equity investments at fair value decreased by $121 million as compared to the prior year, primarily resulting from the sale of one of our portfolio investments, our indirect investment in Albion, during fiscal year 2013 (refer to the Other section of MD&A in this item 7 for further information regarding the sale of our indirect investment in Albion). As of September 30, 2013, our liabilities of $19.2 billion are $1.7 billion , or 10% greater than our liabilities as of September 30, 2012 . The increase in liabilities as compared to the prior year is primarily due to the following. Payables to clients increased $1.36 billion, which resulted from an inflow of client cash over the year. Bank deposit liabilities increased $696 million, reflecting increased deposits at RJ Bank. Other borrowings increased $84 million as we borrowed under certain of our available credit facilities at September 30, 2013, primarily to finance a portion of our inventory of fixed income securities. Partially offsetting these increases, derivative instruments associated with offsetting matched book positions decreased by $208 million, and our corporate debt decreased by $135 million, primarily as a result of the conversion of a loan provided by Regions Bank as of September 30, 2012 into that of a revolving credit facility under which we had relatively minimal borrowings outstanding as of September 30, 2013 (refer to the discussion of the New Regions Credit Agreement in Notes 15 and 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K). 69 Index Contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies We have contractual obligations to make future payments in connection with debt, non-cancelable lease agreements, partnership and limited liability company investments, commitments to extend credit, underwriting commitments, a naming rights agreement, and facilities arrangements pertaining to future corporate conference sites. The following table sets forth these contractual obligations by fiscal year: Year ended September 30, Total 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 Thereafter (in thousands) Corporate debt (1) $ 1,194,508 $ 3,530 $ 4,067 $ 254,050 $ 4,556 $ 4,823 $ 923,482 Interest on debt (1) 1,017,294 62,294 74,638 74,638 64,012 64,012 677,700 Loans payable of consolidated variable interest entities (2) 62,938 19,061 17,949 13,331 8,240 3,668 689 Other short-term borrowings (3) 84,076 79,076 5,000 Operating leases 402,830 75,050 69,678 62,818 52,552 40,887 101,845 Investments - private equity partnerships 46,795 46,795 Certificates of deposit (4) 313,374 51,490 69,041 61,277 83,092 48,474 Commitments to extend credit - RJ Bank (5) 2,913,107 2,913,107 RJ Bank loans purchased, not yet settled 76,391 76,391 Commitments to real estate entities 60,274 60,274 Commitment to purchase real estate in Pasco County, Florida (6) 3,500 3,500 Underwriting commitments 27,476 27,476 Naming rights for Raymond James stadium 9,183 3,988 4,148 1,047 Commitments for company hosted conferences 9,797 2,555 4,028 1,606 1,608 Loans and commitments to financial advisors 33,340 26,748 3,446 2,738 166 119 123 Total $ 6,254,883 $ 3,451,335 $ 251,995 $ 471,505 $ 214,226 $ 161,983 $ 1,703,839 (1) See Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for additional information.

We are authorized by the Board of Directors to repurchase our common stock for general corporate purposes. There is no formal stock repurchase plan at this time. From time to time our Board of Directors has authorized specific dollar amounts for repurchases at the discretion of our Board Securities Repurchase Committee. As of September 30, 2013 the unused portion of the current authorization was $49.4 million . In the normal course of business, certain subsidiaries of ours act as general partner and may be contingently liable for activities of various limited partnerships. These partnerships engage primarily in real estate activities. In our opinion, such liabilities, if any, for the obligations of the partnerships will not in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position. 70 Index Regulatory RJ&A, RJFS, Eagle Fund Distributors, Inc. and Raymond James (USA) Ltd. all had net capital in excess of minimum requirements as of September 30, 2013 . RJ Ltd. was not in Early Warning Level 1 or Level 2 as of or during the year ended September 30, 2013 . We currently invest in selected private equity and merchant banking investments (refer to Item 1, Reportable Segments, Other section in this Form 10-K additional information). As a financial holding company, the magnitude of such investments will be subject to certain limitations. At our current investment levels, we do not anticipate having to make any otherwise unplanned divestitures of these investments in order to comply with regulatory limits; however, the amount of future investments may be limited in order to maintain compliance within regulatory specified levels. The maintenance of certain risk-based regulatory capital levels could impact various capital allocation decisions impacting one or more of our businesses. However, due to our strong capital position, we do not anticipate these capital requirements will have any negative impact on our future business activities. RJF and RJ Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements. Under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, RJF and RJ Bank met the requirements to be categorized as well capitalized as of September 30, 2013 . See the Item 1 Business, Regulation section in this Form 10-K, for a discussion of the regulatory environment in which RJF and RJ Bank operate. One of RJ Bank U.S. subsidiaries is an agreement corporation and is also subject to regulation by the Fed. As of September 30, 2013 , this RJ Bank subsidiary met the capital adequacy guideline requirements. The Dodd-Frank Act has the potential to impact certain of our current business operations, including, but not limited to, its impact on RJ Bank which is discussed in the Item 1 Business, Regulation section in this Form 10-K. Because of the nature of our business and our business practices, we do not expect the Dodd-Frank Act to have a significant direct impact on our operations as a whole. However, because some of the implementing regulations have yet to be adopted by various regulatory agencies, the specific impact on some of our businesses remains uncertain. See Note 25 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for further information on regulatory and capital requirements. Critical accounting estimates The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. For a description of our accounting policies, see Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. We believe that of our significant accounting estimates, those described below involve a high degree of judgment and complexity. These estimates and assumptions affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses reported in the consolidated financial statements. Due to their nature, estimates involve judgment based upon available information. Actual results or amounts could differ from estimates and the difference could have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. Therefore, understanding these critical accounting estimates is important in understanding the reported results of our operations and our financial position. Valuation of financial instruments, investments and other assets The use of fair value to measure financial instruments, with related gains or losses recognized in our Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income, is fundamental to our financial statements and our risk management processes. Trading instruments and available for sale securities are reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value. Unrealized gains and losses related to these financial instruments are reflected in our net income or our other comprehensive income, depending on the underlying purpose of the instrument. We measure the fair value of our financial instruments in accordance with GAAP, which defines fair value, establishes a framework that we use to measure fair value and provides for certain disclosures we provide about our fair value measurements included in our financial statements. Refer to Notes 5 and 6 in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for these disclosures. 71 Index Fair value is defined by GAAP as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between willing market participants on the measurement date. We determine the fair values of our financial instruments and any other assets and liabilities required by GAAP to be recognized at fair value in the financial statements as of the close of business of each financial statement reporting period. These fair value determination processes also apply to any of our impairment tests or assessments performed for nonfinancial instruments such as goodwill, identifiable intangible assets, certain real estate owned and other long-lived assets. In determining the fair value of our financial instruments in accordance with GAAP, we use various valuation approaches, including market and/or income approaches. Fair value is a market-based measure considered from the perspective of a market participant. As such, even when assumptions from market participants are not readily available, our own assumptions reflect those that we believe market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. GAAP provides for the following three levels to be used to classify our fair value measurements: Level 1-Financial instruments included in Level 1 are highly liquid instruments with quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. These include equity securities traded in active markets and certain U. S. Treasury securities, other governmental obligations, or publicly traded corporate debt securities. Level 2-Financial instruments reported in Level 2 include those that have pricing inputs that are other than quoted prices in active markets, but which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date (i.e. prices for similar instruments). Instruments that are generally included in this category are equity securities that are not actively traded, corporate obligations infrequently traded, certain government and municipal obligations, interest rate swaps, certain asset-backed securities ( ABS ), certain CMOs, certain MBS, and our derivative instruments and nonrecurring fair value measurements for certain loans held for sale, impaired loans and other real estate owned ( OREO ). Level 3-Financial instruments reported in Level 3 have little, if any, market activity and are measured using our best estimate of fair value, where the inputs into the determination of fair value are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable. These valuations require significant judgment or estimation. Instruments in this category generally include: equity securities with unobservable inputs such as those investments made in our proprietary capital activities, certain non-agency CMOs, certain non-agency ABS, pools of interest-only SBA loan strips ( I/O Strips ), certain municipal and corporate obligations which include ARS, and nonrecurring fair value measurements for certain impaired loans. GAAP requires that we maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when performing our fair value measurements. The availability of observable inputs can vary from instrument to instrument and in certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, an instrument level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement of an instrument requires judgment and consideration of factors specific to the instrument. Valuation techniques The fair value for certain of our financial instruments is derived using pricing models and other valuation techniques that involve significant management judgment. The price transparency of financial instruments is a key determinant of the degree of judgment involved in determining the fair value of our financial instruments. Financial instruments for which actively quoted prices or pricing parameters are available will generally have a higher degree of price transparency than financial instruments that are thinly traded or not quoted. In accordance with GAAP, the criteria used to determine whether the market for a financial instrument is active or inactive is based on the particular asset or liability. For equity securities, our definition of actively traded is based on average daily volume and other market trading statistics. We have determined the market for certain other types of financial instruments, including certain CMOs, ABS, certain collateralized debt obligations and ARS, to be volatile, uncertain or inactive as of both September 30, 2013 and 2012 . As a result, the valuation of these financial instruments included significant management judgment in determining the relevance and reliability of market information available. We considered the inactivity of the market to be evidenced by several factors, including a continued decreased price transparency caused by decreased volume of trades relative to historical levels, stale transaction prices and transaction prices that varied significantly either over time or among market makers. The specific valuation techniques utilized for the categorization of financial instruments presented in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition are described below. 72 Index Trading instruments and trading instruments sold but not yet purchased Trading securities Trading securities are comprised primarily of the financial instruments held by our broker-dealer subsidiaries (see Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for more information). When available, we use quoted prices in active markets to determine the fair value of these securities. Such instruments are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Examples include exchange traded equity securities and liquid government debt securities. When instruments are traded in secondary markets and quoted market prices do not exist for such securities, we utilize valuation techniques, including matrix pricing, to estimate fair value. Matrix pricing generally utilizes spread-based models periodically re-calibrated to observable inputs such as market trades, or to dealer price bids in similar securities in order to derive the fair value of the instruments. Valuation techniques may also rely on other observable inputs such as yield curves, interest rates and expected principal repayments, and default probabilities. Instruments valued using these inputs are typically classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. We utilize prices from independent services to corroborate our estimate of fair value. Depending upon the type of security, the pricing service may provide a listed price, a matrix price, or use other methods including broker-dealer price quotations. The fair value for SBA loan securitizations is determined by utilizing observable prices obtained from a third party pricing service. The third party pricing service provides comparable price evaluations utilizing observable market data for similar securities. We substantiate the prices obtained from the third party pricing service by comparing such prices for a sample of securities to observable market trades obtained from external sources. The instruments valued using these observable inputs are typically classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Positions in illiquid securities that do not have readily determinable fair values require significant judgment or estimation. For these securities, which include ARS, we use pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques. Assumptions utilized by these techniques include estimates of future delinquencies, loss severities, defaults and prepayments. Securities valued using these techniques are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. For certain CMOs, where there has been limited activity or less transparency around significant inputs to the valuation, such as assumptions regarding performance of the underlying mortgages, these securities are currently classified as Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. I/O Strip securities do not trade in an active market with readily observable prices. Accordingly, we use valuation techniques that consider a number of factors including: (a) the original cost of the pooled underlying SBA loans from which the I/O Strip securities were created, and any changes from the original to the hypothetical cost of buying similar loans under current market conditions; (b) seasoning of the underlying SBA loans in the pool that back the I/O strip securities; (c) the type and nature of the pooled SBA loans backing the I/O Strip securities; (d) actual and assumed prepayment rates on the underlying pools of SBA loans; and (e) market data for past trades in comparable I/O Strip securities. Prices from independent sources are used to corroborate our estimates of fair value. Our I/O Strip securities are recorded in other securities within our trading instruments on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. These fair value measurements use significant unobservable inputs and accordingly, we classify them as Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Derivative contracts We enter into interest rate swaps and futures contracts either as part of our fixed income business to facilitate customer transactions, to hedge a portion of our trading inventory, or to a limited extent, for our own account. See Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for more information. Fair values for the interest rate derivative contracts arising from our legacy operations are obtained from internal pricing models that consider current market trading levels and the contractual prices for the underlying financial instruments, as well as time value, yield curve and other volatility factors underlying the positions. Since our model inputs can be observed in a liquid market and the models do not require significant judgment, such derivative contracts are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. We utilize values obtained from third party counterparty derivatives dealers to corroborate the output of our internal pricing models. The fair value of any cash collateral exchanged as part of the interest rate swap contract is netted, by counterparty, against the fair value of the derivative instrument. 73 Index We also facilitate matched book derivative transactions through RJSS. RJSS enters into derivative transactions (primarily interest rate swaps) with customers of RJ&A. For every derivative transaction RJSS enters into with a customer, it enters into an offsetting transaction with terms that mirror the customer transaction, with a credit support provider who is a third party financial institution. We record the value of each derivative position held at fair value, as either an asset or an offsetting liability, presented as derivative instruments associated with offsetting matched book positions , as applicable, on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. Fair value is determined using an internal model which includes inputs from independent pricing sources to project future cash flows under each underlying derivative contract. The cash flows are discounted to determine the present value. Since any changes in fair value are completely offset by an opposite change in the offsetting transaction position, there is no net impact on our Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income from changes in the fair value of these derivative instruments. RJ Bank enters into three month forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the risk related to their investment in their Canadian subsidiary. These derivatives are recorded at fair value on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition, the majority of which are designated as net investment hedges. Available for sale securities Available for sale securities are comprised primarily of MBS, CMOs, and other equity securities held predominately by RJ Bank (the RJ Bank AFS Securities ) and ARS held by a non-broker-dealer subsidiary of RJF (collectively referred to as the RJF AFS Securities ). Debt and equity securities classified as available for sale are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of deferred taxes, recorded through other comprehensive income and thereafter presented in shareholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income ( AOCI ) unless the loss is considered to be other-than-temporary, in which case the related credit loss portion is recognized as a loss in other revenue. Realized gains and losses on sales of such securities are recognized using the specific identification method and reflected in other revenue in the period they are sold. The fair value of agency and senior non-agency securities included within the RJ Bank AFS Securities is determined by obtaining third party pricing service bid quotations from two independent pricing services. Third party pricing service bid quotations are based on either current market data, or for any securities traded in markets where the trading activity has slowed such as the CMO market, the most recently available market data. The third party pricing services provide comparable price evaluations utilizing available market data for similar securities. The market data the third party pricing services utilize for these price evaluations includes observable data comprised of benchmark yields, reported trades, broker-dealer quotes, issuer spreads, two-sided markets, benchmark securities, bids, offers, reference data including market research publications, and loan performance experience. In order to validate that the pricing information used by the primary third party pricing service is observable, we request, on a quarterly basis, some of the key market data available for a sample of senior securities and compare this data to that which we observed in our independent accumulation of market information. Securities valued using these valuation techniques are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. For senior non-agency securities within the RJ Bank AFS Securities where a significant difference exists between the primary third party pricing service bid quotation and the secondary third party pricing service, we utilize a discounted cash flow analysis to determine which third party price quote is most representative of fair value under the current market conditions. The fair values for most senior non-agency securities at September 30, 2013 were based on the respective primary third party pricing service bid quotation. Securities measured using these valuation techniques are generally classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. ARS are long-term variable rate securities tied to short-term interest rates that were intended to be reset through a Dutch auction process, which generally occurs every seven to 35 days. Holders of ARS were previously able to liquidate their holdings to prospective buyers by participating in the auctions. During 2008, the Dutch auction process failed and holders were no longer able to liquidate their holdings through the auction process. The fair value of the ARS holdings is estimated based on internal pricing models. The pricing model takes into consideration the characteristics of the underlying securities, as well as multiple inputs including the issuer and its credit quality, data from any recent trades, the expected timing of redemptions and an estimated yield premium that a market participant would require over otherwise comparable securities to compensate for the illiquidity of the ARS. These inputs require significant management judgment and, accordingly, these securities are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. 74 Index For any RJF AFS Securities in an unrealized loss position at the reporting period end, we make an assessment whether these securities are impaired on an other-than-temporary basis. In order to evaluate our risk exposure and any potential impairment of these securities, on at least a quarterly basis, we review the characteristics of each security owned such as, where applicable, collateral type, delinquency and foreclosure levels, credit enhancement, projected loan losses, collateral coverage, the presence of U.S. government or government agency guarantees, and issuer credit rating. The following factors are considered to determine whether an impairment is other-than-temporary: our intention to sell the security, our assessment of whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before the recovery of its amortized cost basis, and whether the evidence indicating that we will recover the amortized cost basis of a security in full outweighs evidence to the contrary. Evidence considered in this assessment includes the reasons for the impairment, the severity and duration of the impairment, changes in value subsequent to period end, recent events specific to the issuer or industry, and forecasted performance of the security. Securities on which there is an unrealized loss that is deemed to be other-than-temporary are written-down to fair value with the credit loss portion of the write-down recorded as a realized loss in other revenue and the non-credit portion of the write-down recorded net of deferred taxes in other comprehensive income and are thereafter presented in equity as a component of AOCI. The credit loss portion of the write-down is the difference between the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis of the security. The previous amortized cost basis of the security less the other-than-temporary impairment recognized in earnings establishes the new cost basis for the security. For any RJF AFS Securities, we estimate the portion of loss attributable to credit using a discounted cash flow model. For RJ Bank AFS Securities, our discounted cash flow model utilizes relevant assumptions such as prepayment rate, default rate, and loss severity on a loan level basis. These assumptions are subject to change depending on a number of factors such as economic conditions, changes in home prices, and delinquency and foreclosure statistics, among others. Events that may trigger material declines in fair values or additional credit losses for these securities in the future would include, but are not limited to, deterioration of credit metrics, significantly higher levels of default and severity of loss on the underlying collateral, deteriorating credit enhancement and loss coverage ratios, or further illiquidity. Private equity investments Private equity investments, held in our Other segment, consist of various direct and third party private equity and merchant banking investments. The valuation of these investments requires significant management judgment due to the absence of quoted market prices, inherent lack of liquidity and long-term nature of these assets. As a result, these values cannot be determined with precision and the calculated fair value estimates may not be realizable in a current sale or immediate settlement of the instrument. Private equity investments are carried at estimated fair value. They are valued initially at the transaction price until significant transactions or developments indicate that a change in the carrying values of these investments is appropriate. The carrying values of these investments are adjusted based on financial performance, investment-specific events, financing and sales transactions with third parties and/or discounted cash flow models incorporating changes in market outlook. Investments in funds structured as limited partnerships are generally valued based on our proportionate share of the net assets of the partnership as provided by the fund manager. Investments valued using these valuation techniques are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Other investments Other investments consist primarily of marketable securities we hold that are associated with a deferred compensation program which was formerly sponsored by MK &Co., term deposits with Canadian financial institutions, or investments in other securities arising from the operations of RJ Ltd., and certain investments in limited partnerships (or funds) for which in a number of instances, one of our affiliates serves as the managing member or general partner (see Note 11 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for information regarding such funds). Certain employees who were at one-time associated with MK & Co., participate in deferred compensation plans. The balances associated with these plans are invested in certain marketable securities that are held by RJF until the vesting date, typically five years from the date of the deferral. We use quoted prices in active markets to determine the fair value of these investments. Such instruments are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. The Canadian financial institution term deposits are recorded at cost, which approximates market value. These investments are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Certain other investments in financial instruments held by RJ Ltd. include non-agency ABS that have little, if any, market activity and are measured using our best estimate of fair value, where the inputs into the determination of fair value are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable. These valuations require significant judgment or estimation and are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. 75 Index Level 3 assets and liabilities As of September 30, 2013 , 9% of our total assets and 3% of our total liabilities are instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis categorized as Level 3 amount to $470 million as of September 30, 2013 and represent 24% of our assets measured at fair value. Our ARS positions comprise $242 million , or 51% , and our private equity investments comprise $216 million , or 46% , of the Level 3 assets as of September 30, 2013 . Level 3 assets represent 11.7% of total equity as of September 30, 2013 . Financial instruments which are liabilities categorized as Level 3 amount to $60 thousand as of September 30, 2013 and represent less than 1% of liabilities measured at fair value. See Notes 5, 6 and 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for additional information on our financial instruments. Goodwill Goodwill involves the application of significant management judgment. Of our total goodwill of $295 million : $230 million arose from our fiscal year 2012 acquisition of Morgan Keegan (see Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for further information regarding the Morgan Keegan acquisition) and as of September 30, 2013 is part of RJ&A, $33 million arose from our acquisition of Goepel McDermid, Inc. (now RJ Ltd.) which occurred during fiscal year 2001, $30 million arose from our acquisition of Roney & Co. (now part of RJ&A) which occurred during fiscal year 1999, and $2 million arose from our acquisition of Howe Barnes which occurred in April 2011 and is now a part of RJ&A. This goodwill was allocated to reporting units; $174 million is included in the PCG segment and $121 million is included in the Capital Markets segment. Goodwill is subject to an evaluation of potential impairment on an annual basis, or more often if events or circumstances indicate there may be impairment. We performed our annual goodwill impairment testing as of December 31, 2012 . We elected to not exercise the option to perform a qualitative assessment, but instead to perform a quantitative assessment of the equity value of each reporting unit that includes an allocation of goodwill. In our determination of the reporting unit fair value of equity, we used a combination of the income approach and the market approach. Under the income approach, we used discounted cash flow models applied to each respective reporting unit. Under the market approach, we calculated an estimated fair value based on a combination of multiples of earnings of guideline companies in the brokerage and capital markets industry that are publicly traded on organized exchanges, and the book value of comparable transactions. The estimated fair value of the equity of the reporting unit resulting from each of these valuation approaches was dependent upon the estimates of future business unit revenues and costs, such estimates were subject to critical assumptions regarding the nature and health of financial markets in future years as well as the discount rate to apply to the projected future cash flows. In estimating future cash flows, a balance sheet as of the test date and a statement of operations for the last twelve months of activity for each reporting unit (or for the nine month period since the Closing Date for Morgan Keegan reporting units) were compiled. Future balance sheets and statements of operations were then projected, and estimated future cash flows were determined by the combination of these projections. The cash flows were discounted at the reporting units estimated cost of equity which was derived through application of the capital asset pricing model. The valuation result from the market approach was dependent upon the selection of the comparable guideline companies and transactions and the earnings multiple applied to each respective reporting units projected earnings. Finally, significant management judgment was applied in determining the weight assigned to the outcome of the market approach and the income approach, which resulted in one single estimate of the fair value of the equity of the reporting unit. Based upon the outcome of our quantitative assessments as of December 31, 2012 , we concluded that with the exception of our RJES reporting unit, there was no other impairment of goodwill and the fair values of the equity of the reporting units to be substantially in excess of their book carrying values, which include the allocated goodwill. See Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K, for a summary of certain key assumptions utilized in our quantitative analysis performed as of December 31, 2012. The assumptions and estimates utilized in determining the fair value of reporting unit equity are sensitive to changes, including, but not limited to, a decline in overall market conditions, adverse business trends and changes in regulations. 76 Index We concluded the goodwill associated with the RJES reporting unit to be completely impaired. The impairment expense recorded in the year ended September 30, 2013 of $6.9 million is included in other expense on our Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. Since we did not own 100% of RJES as of the annual testing date, our share of this impairment expense after consideration of the noncontrolling interests amounts to $4.6 million . RJES is an entity that provides research coverage on European corporations as well as having sales and trading operations. The decline in value of RJES is primarily due to the continuing economic slowdown experienced in Europe which has had a negative impact on the financial services entities operating therein, as well as certain management decisions that were made during the quarter ended March 31, 2013 which impact RJES operating plans on a going forward basis. In April 2013, we purchased all of the outstanding equity in RJES that was held by others, thus we now have sole control over RJES. In mid-February 2013, the client accounts and financial advisors of MK & Co. were transferred to RJ&A pursuant to our Morgan Keegan acquisition integration strategies. As a result, certain RJ&A and MK & Co. reporting units, which have an allocation of both private client group as well as capital markets goodwill, were combined. We assessed whether these transfers, which occurred after our annual goodwill impairment testing date, could change our conclusions regarding no impairment of goodwill in the reporting units effected by the transfers. Based upon our qualitative analysis related to those reporting units, we concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the combined reporting units equity exceeds the combined reporting units carrying value including goodwill after the effect of such transfers. The change in our reportable segments, which was effective as of September 30, 2013 (see Notes 1 and 28 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for additional information), did not cause us to update the annual impairment testing we performed as the reporting units which were impacted by this change do not have an allocation of goodwill. No other events have occurred since December 31, 2012 that would cause us to update the annual impairment testing we performed as of that date. Loss provisions Loss provisions arising from legal proceedings We recognize liabilities for contingencies when there is an exposure that, when fully analyzed, indicates it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. The estimated range of possible loss is based upon currently available information and is subject to significant judgment, a variety of assumptions, and uncertainties. When a range of possible loss can be estimated, we accrue the most likely amount of possible loss within that range; if the most likely amount within that range is not determinable, we accrue a minimum based on the range of possible loss. No liability is recognized for those matters which, in management judgment, the determination of a reasonable estimate of loss is not possible. We record liabilities related to legal proceedings in trade and other payables within our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. The determination of whether a loss is probable, and if so the possible loss amount, requires significant judgment. We consider many factors including, but not limited to: the amount of the claim; the amount of the loss in the client account; the basis and validity of the claim; the possibility of wrongdoing on the part of one of our employees or financial advisors; previous results in similar cases; and legal precedents and case law. Each legal proceeding is reviewed with counsel in each accounting period and the liability is adjusted as we consider appropriate. Any change in the liability amount is recorded in the consolidated financial statements and is recognized as either a charge or a credit to net income in that period. The actual costs of resolving legal proceedings may be substantially higher or lower than the recorded liability amounts for those matters. We expense our cost of defense related to such matters in the period they are incurred. Loss provisions arising from operations of our Broker-Dealers We offer loans to financial advisors and certain key revenue producers, primarily for recruiting and retention purposes. These loans are generally repaid over a five to eight year period with interest recognized as earned. We assess future recoverability of these loans through analysis of individual financial advisor production or other performance standards. In the event that the financial advisor is no longer affiliated with us, any unpaid balance of such loan becomes immediately due and payable to us. In determining the allowance for doubtful accounts from former employees or independent contractors, management considers a number of factors including; any amounts due at termination, the reasons for the terminated relationship, the former financial advisor overall financial position, and our historical collection experience. When the review of these factors indicates that further collection activity is highly unlikely, the outstanding balances of such loans are written off and the corresponding allowance is reduced. 77 Index We also record reserves or allowances for doubtful accounts related to client receivables. Client receivables at our broker-dealer subsidiaries are generally collateralized by securities owned by the brokerage clients. Therefore, when a receivable is considered to be impaired, the amount of the impairment is generally measured based on the fair value of the securities acting as collateral, which is measured based on current prices from independent sources such as listed market prices or broker-dealer price quotations. Loan loss provisions arising from operations of RJ Bank RJ Bank provides an allowance for loan losses which reflects our continuing evaluation of the probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio. Refer to Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for discussion of RJ Bank policies regarding the allowance for loan losses, and refer to Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for quantitative information regarding the allowance balances as of September 30, 2013 . The current year provision for loan losses includes $5.6 million resulting from the impact of our internal corporate loan classification changes as a result of the banking regulators annual Shared National Credit ( SNC ) examination. The SNC exam included a review, which represented 80% of the total held for investment corporate portfolio at such time. The impact of the SNC exam results from differences in judgment applicable to a limited number of the credits reviewed in the annual exam. We incorporate all regulatory trends observed during each annual SNC exam into our internal ratings methodology. The limited number of loans with ratings differences, the lengthy period between SNC exams, and the lack of a consistent pattern of credit characteristics leading to the loan ratings differences from year to year will cause the results of any year exam to be unpredictable and result in some changes from our internal ratings. Based on these factors, however, we do not believe the SNC exam results to be indicative of current policies resulting in inaccurate loan classifications that need to be changed, rather, are differences in judgment and are not indicative of future trends in the subsequent year. We do not always incorporate loan classification upgrades that result from the SNC exam. Thus, based on this policy, the results of the annual SNC exam on our portfolio may result in an increase to our provision for loan losses for the respective period these results become known. Given the relatively high percentage of SNC loans in our total corporate loan portfolio and the probability that regulators are likely to have a different view on some loans in our portfolio, the impact from each annual SNC exam may be material to any fiscal year provision for loan losses should the credit ratings changes resulting from such exam be numerous, significant (meaning more than a one notch classification change), or associated with considerably large loans in our portfolio. The prior year provision for loan losses included $4 million resulting from the impact of the respective period annual SNC exam. This prior year exam included a review, which was approximately 84% of the held for investment corporate loan portfolio. At September 30, 2013 , the amortized cost of all RJ Bank loans was $9 billion and an allowance for loan losses of $137 million was recorded against that balance. The total allowance for loan losses is equal to 1.52% of the amortized cost of the loan portfolio. The condition of the real estate and credit markets continues to influence the complexity and uncertainty involved in estimating the losses inherent in RJ Bank loan portfolio. If our underlying assumptions and judgments prove to be inaccurate, the allowance for loan losses could be insufficient to cover actual losses. In such an event, any losses would result in a decrease in our net income as well as a decrease in the level of regulatory capital at RJ Bank. Income taxes The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year. We utilize the asset and liability method to provide income taxes on all transactions recorded in the consolidated financial statements. This method requires that income taxes reflect the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities for book and tax purposes. Accordingly, a deferred tax asset or liability for each temporary difference is determined based on the tax rates that we expect to be in effect when the underlying items of income and expense are realized. Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns, including the repatriation of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries. Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity. See Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for further information on our uncertain tax positions. 78 Index Effects of recently issued accounting standards, and accounting standards not yet adopted In December 2011, the FASB issued new guidance amending the existing pronouncement by requiring additional disclosures regarding the nature of an entity rights of setoff and related arrangements associated with its financial instruments and derivative instruments. Specifically, this new guidance will require additional information about financial instruments and derivative instruments that are either; 1) offset or 2) subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement, irrespective of whether they are currently offset. The additional disclosure is intended to provide greater transparency on the effect or potential effect of netting arrangements on an entity financial position, including the effect or potential effect of rights of setoff associated with certain financial instruments and derivative instruments within the scope of this amendment. This new guidance is first effective for our financial report covering the quarter ending December 31, 2013. The adoption of this new guidance will impact certain presentations of assets and liabilities within the notes to our consolidated financial statements, but will not impact our determinations of asset or liability amounts presented on our consolidated statements of financial condition. These additional disclosures will be presented in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period ended December 31, 2013. In February 2013, the FASB issued new guidance intended to improve the reporting of reclassifications out of AOCI. The new guidance requires an entity to report the effect of significant reclassifications out of AOCI on the respective line items in net income if the amount being reclassified is required under GAAP to be reclassified in its entirety to net income. For other amounts that are not required under GAAP to be reclassified in their entirety to net income in the same reporting period, an entity is required to cross-reference other disclosures required under GAAP that provide additional detail about those amounts. This new guidance is first effective for our financial report covering the quarter ending December 31, 2013. The adoption of this new guidance will result in an increase in certain financial statement disclosures, but will not have any impact on our financial position or results of operations. These additional disclosures will be presented in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period ended December 31, 2013. In March 2013, the FASB issued new guidance intended to clarify the applicable guidance for the release of the cumulative translation adjustment when either an entity ceases to have a controlling financial interest in a subsidiary or involving an equity method investment that is a foreign entity. The new guidance is intended to resolve the diversity in current practice in the accounting for the release of the cumulative translation adjustment into net income for sales or transfers of a controlling financial interest that is a foreign entity. This new guidance is first effective for our financial report covering the quarter ending December 31, 2014, however early adoption is permitted as long as an entity that adopts the guidance early applies the new guidance as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. To the extent that we have any future transactions with our foreign entities that fall within the scope of this clarifying guidance, we will evaluate the option of adopting this guidance early. Given that this guidance applies to entity specific transactions, we are unable to estimate the financial impact, if any, this clarifying guidance may have on our financial position or results of operations. In June 2013, the FASB issued new guidance intended to amend the scope, measurement and disclosure requirements for investment companies. The new guidance is intended to change the approach to the investment company assessment, clarify the characteristics of an investment company, require an investment company to measure noncontrolling ownership interests in other investment companies at fair value and requires additional disclosures about the investment company. This new guidance is first effective for our financial report covering the quarter ending December 31, 2014, early adoption is prohibited. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this new guidance will have on our financial position and results of operations. Off-Balance Sheet arrangements Information concerning our off-balance sheet arrangements is included in Note 26 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. Effects of inflation Our assets are primarily liquid in nature and are not significantly affected by inflation. However, the rate of inflation affects our expenses, including employee compensation, communications and occupancy, which may not be readily recoverable through charges for services we provide to our clients. 79 Index
