The Company revenues, operating results, cash flows from operations, capital spending, and future growth rates are highly dependent on commodity prices, which affect the value the Company receives from its sales of oil, natural gas, and NGLs. The Company continues to efficiently allocate capital in order to generate attractive returns on, and of, capital while investing within cash flow. Anadarko also continues to focus on cash-margin improvement and has actively managed its portfolio to focus on higher-return, oil-levered opportunities in areas where it possesses both scale and competitive advantages, namely in the Delaware and DJ basins in the U.S. onshore and in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. The Company plans to deploy a portion of its cash flow generated from its Gulf of Mexico, Algeria, Ghana, and DJ basin assets to fund investments in other assets that generate attractive cash returns, thereby improving the Company overall long-term cash-flow profile and ability to continue returning cash to investors. 2019 Outlook The Company plans to continue focusing on returning capital directly to its investors. The Company demonstrated this focus in 2018 by increasing its quarterly cash dividend from $0.05 to $0.30 per share, expanding its authorized Share-Repurchase Program to $5 billion , and increasing its debt-reduction program to $2 billion. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had repurchased 65 million shares of its common stock for an average price of $57.69 per share. The Company expects to complete the remaining $1.25 billion of authorized share repurchases by mid-year 2020. As of December 31, 2018, Anadarko had retired more than $600 million of debt and plans to repay $900 million of debt maturing in the first half of 2019. An additional $500 million of debt reduction is anticipated through mid-year 2020. These actions demonstrate the cash-flow-generating strength of the Company asset portfolio and the Company ongoing commitment to capital efficiency and returns. At the end of 2018, the Company announced the planned contribution and sale of substantially all of its midstream assets not owned by WES, which are largely associated with Anadarko's two premier U.S. onshore oil plays in the Delaware and DJ basins, to WES for approximately $4.0 billion, with approximately $2.0 billion of cash proceeds and the balance to be paid in WES common units. This transaction is expected to increase WES cash distributions paid to Anadarko in 2019 and reduce Anadarko future midstream capital funding requirements associated with the divested assets. Additionally, WES announced that a wholly owned subsidiary of WGP will merge with and into WES to simplify its structure and lower the weighted-average cost of capital for the midstream entity via the elimination of incentive distribution rights. These transactions are expected to close in the first quarter of 2019 and should result in enhanced liquidity of Anadarko residual ownership of WGP securities. APC 2018 FORM 10-K | 57 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS MANAGEMENT OVERVIEW Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The Company 2019 capital program is consistent with the Company focus on enhancing shareholder value by delivering attractive cash returns on invested capital in a $50 oil (for both WTI and Brent) and $3 natural-gas (Henry Hub) price environment while advancing the development of the Company core assets. Anadarko currently estimates a 2019 capital spending range of $4.3 billion to $4.7 billion, excluding WES. Anadarko expects to allocate approximately 70% of this 2019 capital investment to the U.S. onshore upstream and midstream resource plays; 16% to conventional oil plays in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, Algeria, and Ghana; 10% to future value areas, which includes 6% to exploration and 4% to Mozambique LNG activities, excluding post-FID incremental spend; and 4% to corporate activities. The Company asset footprint and strong balance sheet are intended to perform through commodity cycles. Delaware Basin Anadarko plans to allocate approximately $1.4 billion toward upstream activities. The successful expansion of the Company infrastructure footprint, including oil gathering and treating facilities throughout West Texas, is paving the way to transition to multi-well pad development. This phased development approach is expected to deliver incremental oil sales volume in 2019. DJ Basin Anadarko expects to invest approximately $1.3 billion on upstream activities, with continued development of its minerals-interest ownership and infrastructure-advantaged position in the Wattenberg field. Anadarko expects to deliver incremental oil sales volume from the DJ basin in 2019. Powder River Basin Anadarko expects to invest approximately $250 million toward upstream activities, including appraisal and delineation of its 300,000 gross acre position in the southern Powder River basin primarily targeting the Turner formation. Gulf of Mexico Anadarko expects to allocate approximately $500 million toward its deepwater Gulf of Mexico operations. Although the capital allocation is lower than in 2018, the Company plans to deliver a similar number of wells in 2019 and maintain production levels around 140 MBOE/d. The majority of these investments are expected to be directed toward high-return oil development opportunities near operated infrastructure at Constellation, Holstein, Horn Mountain, K2, Lucius, and North Hadrian. International Anadarko plans to allocate approximately $200 million toward its international operations in Algeria and Ghana. The investment in Ghana will be focused on adding incremental wells to optimize capacity at the Jubilee and TEN FPSO vessels. Exploration The Company's exploration investments in 2019 are expected to total approximately $250 million. Exploration spending will primarily be focused on identifying material and scalable opportunities in the U.S. onshore and tie-back opportunities near existing operated facilities in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. LNG The Company expects to invest approximately $200 million in the Mozambique LNG project in 2019 on pre-FID activities. This includes Anadarko portion of the cost associated with ongoing site preparation for the shared onshore facilities. The Company remains on track for making a final investment decision in the first half of 2019, and anticipates adjusting its capital investment expectations associated with the Mozambique LNG project if the project is sanctioned. WES currently estimates a 2019 total capital spending range of $1.3 to $1.4 billion. WES capital investment will be primarily focused in the DJ and Delaware basins, with over 90% of the estimated 2019 total capital expenditures allocated to these two basins. 58 | APC 2018 FORM 10-K MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS MANAGEMENT OVERVIEW Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Significant 2018 Operating and Financial Activities Total Company The Company oil sales volume averaged 385 MBbls/d, representing a 9% increase from 2017 , primarily due to increased volume from the DJ and Delaware basins, partially offset by the divestiture of certain U.S. onshore assets in 2017. The Company overall oil sales-volume product mix increased to 58% in 2018 , compared to 53% in 2017 . The overall liquids sales-volume product mix increased to 73% in 2018, compared to 67% in 2017. U.S. Onshore Total sales volume in the Delaware basin averaged 109 MBOE/d, representing a 68% increase from 2017 , and oil sales volume in the Delaware basin increased 27 MBbls/d, representing a 71% increase from 2017 , primarily due to continued drilling and completion activities. In the Delaware basin, the Reeves and Loving County ROTFs were completed, with 138 total wells flowing into the facilities by the end of 2018. In addition, the first train at the WES-owned Mentone natural-gas processing plant was placed in service during the fourth quarter, adding 200 MMcf/d of natural-gas processing capacity. Oil sales volume in the DJ basin increased 14 MBbls/d, representing a 17% increase from 2017, primarily due to continued drilling and completion activities. In the DJ basin, the sixth COSF train was placed in service, adding 30 MBbls/d of oil-stabilization capacity. The Company received net proceeds of approximately $370 million from the divestiture of its nonoperated interest in Alaska. Gulf of Mexico Oil sales volume averaged 121 MBbls/d, remaining relatively flat compared to 2017 , primarily due to natural production declines and planned downtime at various platforms, partially offset by new wells coming online at Horn Mountain, Holstein, Marlin, and Caesar Tonga. Ghana In the TEN field, the operator resumed drilling operations in early 2018, with one well brought online in 2018. Two additional wells were drilled in 2018, with completion activities ongoing at year end. In the Jubilee field, the operator drilled two production wells during the second quarter of 2018, with the first of these wells brought online in the third quarter. The second well was brought online in the fourth quarter. Additionally, a previously drilled water injector well was brought online during the fourth quarter of 2018. The operator of the Jubilee FPSO completed two shutdowns to effectively stabilize the turret and rotate the FPSO to its permanent heading. Completion of the spread-mooring anchoring system is expected in early 2019, with no further shutdowns anticipated. APC 2018 FORM 10-K | 59 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS MANAGEMENT OVERVIEW Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Mozambique During 2018 and subsequent to year end, additional LNG sales and purchase agreements were executed, increasing contracted volumes to more than 7.5 MTPA, with an additional 2.0 MTPA of contracted volume anticipated prior to FID. The Government of Mozambique approved the Development Plan for the Anadarko-operated, initial two-train Golfinho/Atum project. The preferred offshore construction and installation contractor was selected in the fourth quarter of 2018, and the contracts with the onshore and offshore construction and installation contractors are being finalized ahead of making a final investment decision in the first half of 2019. Site preparation activities are fully underway at the Afungi onshore site, as major infrastructure and resettlement projects are proceeding as planned, positioning the area for construction of the LNG facilities. In the third quarter of 2018, Offshore Area 4, which is owned and operated by third parties, joined the Anadarko-led resettlement and airstrip projects as a 50% participant. Financial The Company generated $5.9 billion of cash flow from operations and ended 2018 with $1.3 billion of cash. The Company completed $2.7 billion of share repurchases and retired more than $600 million of debt. 60 | APC 2018 FORM 10-K MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements FINANCIAL RESULTS millions except per-share amounts 2018 2017 2016 Oil, natural-gas, and NGL sales $ 11,482 $ 8,969 $ 7,153 Gathering, processing, and marketing sales 1,588 2,000 1,294 Gains (losses) on divestitures and other, net 312 939 (578 ) Revenues and other $ 13,382 $ 11,908 $ 7,869 Costs and expenses 10,763 12,473 10,241 Other (income) expense 1,134 1,123 1,457 Income tax expense (benefit) 733 (1,477 ) (1,021 ) Net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders $ 615 $ (456 ) $ (3,071 ) Net income (loss) per common share attributable to common stockholders diluted $ 1.20 $ (0.85 ) $ (5.90 ) Average number of common shares outstanding diluted 504 548 522 The following discussion pertains to Anadarko results of operations, financial condition, and changes in financial condition.

For additional information, see Note 11 Derivative Instruments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Production of oil, natural gas, and NGLs is usually not affected by seasonal swings in demand. 62 | APC 2018 FORM 10-K MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Oil Sales Revenues, Average Prices, and Volume 2018 2017 2016 Oil sales revenues (millions) $ 9,206 $ 6,552 $ 4,668 Price per barrel United States $ 64.01 $ 49.62 $ 39.06 International 70.38 53.77 43.93 Total $ 65.51 $ 50.66 $ 40.34 Sales volume (MMBbls) United States 108 97 85 International 33 32 31 Total 141 129 116 Sales volume per day (MBbls/d) United States 294 266 233 International 91 89 83 Total 385 355 316 Oil Prices Anadarko realized oil price increased in late 2016 through 2017, primarily due to the expectation of decreasing global oversupply as a result of OPEC agreement to reduce production through the end of 2018. Oil prices continued to increase during most of 2018 , primarily due to concerns of a supply shortfall as a result of reductions in output from Iran as the U.S. reimposed sanctions, as well as decreased production from Venezuela. Oil prices declined in the fourth quarter of 2018 due to concerns of oil demand weakness from a slowing global economy. APC 2018 FORM 10-K | 63 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Oil Sales Volume 2018 vs. 2017 The Company oil sales volume increased by 30 MBbls/d, primarily due to the following: U.S. Onshore Sales volume for the Delaware basin increased by 27 MBbls/d, primarily due to continued drilling and completion activities and midstream infrastructure additions in 2018. Sales volume for the DJ basin increased by 14 MBbls/d, primarily due to continued drilling and completion activities in 2018. Divestitures resulted in decreased sales volume of 16 MBbls/d, primarily related to the sale of the Alaska nonoperated assets in the first quarter of 2018 and the Eagleford and West Chalk assets in the first half of 2017. Gulf of Mexico Sales volume for the Gulf of Mexico remained flat, primarily due to natural production declines and planned downtime at various platforms, partially offset by new wells coming online at Horn Mountain, Holstein, Marlin, and Caesar Tonga throughout 2018. 2017 vs. 2016 The Company oil sales volume increased by 39 MBbls/d, primarily due to the following: U.S. Onshore Sales volume for the Delaware basin increased by 13 MBbls/d, primarily due to continued drilling and completion activities in 2017. Divestitures resulted in a decrease in sales volume of 29 MBbls/d, primarily related to the sale of the Eagleford assets in the first half of 2017. Gulf of Mexico Sales volume increased by 56 MBbls/d, primarily due to the GOM Acquisition in December 2016 and continued tie-back activity at several facilities, partially offset by deferred production as a result of Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Nate and nonoperated field downtime during the second half of 2017. International Sales volume for Ghana increased by 9 MBbls/d, primarily due to a full year of liftings from the TEN development, which came online late in the third quarter of 2016, and downtime in 2016 to address new production and offtake procedures resulting from issues associated with the Jubilee field FPSO turret bearing. 64 | APC 2018 FORM 10-K MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Natural-Gas Sales Revenues, Volume, and Average Prices 2018 2017 2016 Natural-gas sales revenues (millions) $ 1,005 $ 1,348 $ 1,564 Price per Mcf $ 2.57 $ 2.82 $ 2.04 Sales volume (Bcf) (1) 390 478 766 Sales volume per day (MMcf/d) (1) 1,069 1,309 2,093 (1) All natural-gas sales volume originates in the United States. Natural-Gas Prices Anadarko realized natural-gas price increased from 2016 to 2017, primarily due to a reduction of U.S. natural-gas storage resulting from production declines across the industry from mid-2016 through early 2017 and stable exports to Mexico throughout 2017. In 2018, NYMEX prices were higher due to strong demand growth and low U.S. natural-gas storage. However, Anadarko realized natural-gas price decreased in 2018 due to wider regional differentials in its operated basins as strong production growth in the Delaware and DJ basins required higher utilization of gas pipeline takeaway capacity. Natural-Gas Sales Volume 2018 vs. 2017 The Company natural-gas sales volume decreased by 240 MMcf/d, primarily due to the sale of the Marcellus, Eagleford, and Utah CBM assets in the first half of 2017 and the Moxa assets in the second half of 2017. 2017 vs. 2016 The Company natural-gas sales volume decreased by 784 MMcf/d, primarily due to the sale of the Marcellus and Eagleford assets in the first half of 2017, the Carthage and Elm Grove assets in the second half of 2016, and the Wamsutter assets in the first half of 2016. APC 2018 FORM 10-K | 65 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Natural-Gas Liquids Sales Revenues, Volume, and Average Prices 2018 2017 2016 Natural-gas liquids sales revenues (millions) $ 1,271 $ 1,069 $ 921 Price per barrel $ 33.93 $ 29.54 $ 19.64 Sales volume (MMBbls) (1) 37 36 46 Sales volume per day (MBbls/d) (1) 103 99 128 (1) Approximately 95% of NGL sales volume was from the United States. NGL Prices Anadarko realized NGL price increased from 2016 to 2017, primarily due to increased domestic demand and higher exports. The average NGL price continued to increase during most of 2018 , primarily due to increased demand for ethane to supply newly-constructed ethane cracker facilities. NGL prices declined in the fourth quarter of 2018 due to higher gas plant production of NGLs and loosening of infrastructure constraints. NGL Sales Volume 2018 vs. 2017 The Company NGL sales volume increased by 4 MBbls/d, primarily due to the following: U.S. Onshore Sales volume for the Delaware basin increased by 9 MBbls/d, primarily due to continued drilling and completion activities and midstream infrastructure additions in 2018. Sales volume for other U.S. onshore assets decreased by 5 MBbls/d, primarily due to the sale of the Eagleford and West Chalk assets in the first half of 2017 and the Moxa assets in the second half of 2017. 2017 vs. 2016 The Company NGL sales volume decreased by 29 MBbls/d, primarily due to the sale of the Eagleford assets in the first half of 2017 and the Carthage assets in the second half of 2016. 66 | APC 2018 FORM 10-K MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Gathering, Processing, and Marketing millions 2018 2017 2016 Gathering, processing, and marketing sales (1) $ 1,588 $ 2,000 $ 1,294 Gathering, processing, and marketing expense (1) 1,047 1,552 1,083 Gathering, processing, and marketing, net $ 541 $ 448 $ 211 (1) As a result of adopting ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) , as of January 1, 2018, gathering, processing, and marketing sales decreased by $1.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018 , and gathering, processing, and marketing expenses decreased by $1.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018 . Refer to Note 2 Revenue from Contracts with Customers in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information. Gathering and processing sales include fee revenue earned by providing gathering, processing, compression, and treating services to third parties as well as revenue from the sale of NGLs and remaining residue gas extracted from natural gas purchased from third parties and processed by Anadarko. The net margin from the sale of NGLs and residue gas for service customers when Anadarko is acting as an agent is also included. Gathering and processing expense includes the cost of third-party natural gas purchased and processed by Anadarko as well as transportation and other operating expenses related to the Company costs to perform gathering and processing activities for third parties. Marketing sales include the margin earned from purchasing and selling third-party oil and natural gas. Marketing expense includes transportation and other operating expenses related to the Company costs to perform third-party marketing activities. 2018 vs. 2017 Gathering, processing, and marketing, net increased by $93 million . This increase primarily related to higher third-party throughput volume at the West Texas Complex, which were partially due to increased capacity from the 200 MMcf/d cryogenic train that commenced service in December 2017, and increased third-party throughput volume and rates at the DJ Basin Complex. These increases were partially offset by decreased marketing margins related to pricing on NGL inventory. 2017 vs. 2016 Gathering, processing, and marketing, net increased by $237 million. This increase primarily related to higher third-party throughput volume and prices at the DBM Complex due to increased processing capacity from the start-up of newly constructed facilities in May and October 2016 and previously existing facilities returning to service after the 2016 outage at the DBM Complex.

APC 2018 FORM 10-K | 71 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Income Tax Expense (Benefit) Total income taxes differed from the amounts computed by applying the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate to income (loss) before income taxes. The following summarizes the sources of these differences for the years ended December 31: millions except percentages 2018 2017 2016 Income tax expense (benefit) $ 733 $ (1,477 ) $ (1,021 ) Income (loss) before income taxes $ 1,485 $ (1,688 ) $ (3,829 ) Effective tax rate 49 % 88 % 27 % In 2017, as a result of the Tax Reform Legislation, the Company recognized a one-time deferred tax benefit of $1.2 billion primarily due to the remeasurement of its U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities, resulting in an 88% effective tax rate. Excluding this one-time benefit, the Company effective tax rate would have been 18%. The Company remeasured its U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the reduction of the U.S. corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% . After completing the accounting for income tax effects related to the adoption of the Tax Reform Legislation in 2018, the Company revised the provisional amount and recognized an additional current tax benefit of $26 million offset by deferred tax expense of $121 million . Excluding the impact from the Tax Reform Legislation, the Company 2018 effective tax rate would have been 43%. The Company effective tax rate is impacted each year by the relative pre-tax income (loss) earned by the Company operations in the U.S., Algeria, and the rest of the world. The Company is subject to statutory tax rates of 38% in Algeria and 35% in Ghana. These higher-taxed foreign operations as well as non-deductible Algerian exceptional profits tax for Algerian income tax purposes generally cause the Company effective tax rate to vary significantly from the U.S. corporate tax rate. Additionally, the Company effective tax rate is typically impacted by net changes in uncertain tax positions, income attributable to noncontrolling interests, state income taxes (net of federal benefit), and dispositions of non-deductible goodwill. Excluding the impact related to the Tax Reform Legislation in 2017 and 2018, the Company effective tax rate increased from 18% in 2017 to 43% in 2018 primarily due to higher-taxed income earned in Algeria relative to the Company pretax income in the United States. The Company effective tax rate decreased from 27% in 2016 to 18% in 2017, primarily due to the higher-taxed income earned in Algeria relative to the Company pretax losses in the U.S. and Ghana as well as the impact of international exploration pretax losses with no associated tax benefit. The Company received an $881 million tentative refund in 2016 related to its $5.2 billion Tronox settlement payment in 2015. In April 2018, the IRS issued a final notice of proposed adjustment denying the deductibility of the settlement payment. In September 2018, the Company received a statutory notice of deficiency from the IRS disallowing the net operating loss carryback and rejecting the Company refund claim. As a result, the Company filed a petition with the U.S. Tax Court to dispute the disallowances in November 2018, and pursuant to standard U.S. Tax Court procedures, is not required to repay the $881 million refund to dispute the IRS position. Accordingly, the Company has not revised its estimate of the benefit that will ultimately be realized. After the case is tried and briefed in the Tax Court, the court will issue an opinion and then enter a decision. If the Company does not prevail on the issue, the earliest potential date the Company might be required to repay the refund received, plus interest, would be 91 days after entry of the decision. At such time, the Company would reverse the portion of the $346 million net benefit previously recognized in its consolidated financial statements to the extent necessary to reflect the result of the Tax Court decision. It is reasonably possible the amount of uncertain tax position and/or tax benefit could materially change as the Company asserts its position in the Tax Court proceedings. Although management cannot predict the timing of a final resolution of the Tax Court proceedings, the Company does not anticipate a decision to be entered within the next three years.

In addition, an effective registration statement is available to Anadarko covering the sale of WGP common units owned by the Company. WGP and WES function with capital structures that are separate from Anadarko, consisting of their own debt instruments and publicly traded common units. During 2018, Anadarko repurchased $2.7 billion of shares under the Share-Repurchase Program, retired more than $600 million of debt, and received net proceeds of $417 million from divestitures, primarily related to the sale of the Company nonoperated interests in Alaska. Anadarko had $1.3 billion of cash at December 31, 2018 . Following the expiration of the 364-Day Facility in January 2019, the Company has $3.0 billion of borrowing capacity under the APC RCF. Anadarko believes that its current available cash, anticipated proceeds from the sale of midstream assets to WES, and future operating cash flows will be sufficient to fund the Company projected long-term operational and capital programs, fund the increased dividends, and complete both the Share-Repurchase Program and the debt-reduction program. The Company continuously monitors its liquidity position and evaluates available funding alternatives in light of current and expected conditions. In order to reduce commodity-price risk and increase the predictability of 2019 cash flows, the Company entered into strategic derivative positions covering approximately 21% of its anticipated oil sales volume for 2019. The Company entered into three-way collars for 87 MBbls/d, consisting of a sold call at $72.98 , a purchased put at $56.72 , and a sold put at $46.72 . See Note 11 Derivative Instruments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Credit Rating As of December 31, 2018 , the Company long-term debt was rated investment grade (BBB) by both S&P and Fitch and below investment grade (Ba1) by Moody s. Subsequent to year end, Moody changed its outlook with respect to its rating from stable to positive. As a result of Moody Ba1 rating, Anadarko is more likely to be required to post collateral in the form of letters of credit or cash under certain contractual arrangements, such as derivative instruments, pipeline transportation contracts, and oil and gas sales contracts. Collateral related to credit-risk-related contingent features for which a net liability position existed was $66 million at December 31, 2018 , and $170 million at December 31, 2017 . For more information on credit-risk considerations, see Note 11 Derivative Instruments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. The amount of letters of credit or cash provided as assurance of the Company performance under pipeline transportation contracts and oil and gas sales contracts with respect to credit-risk-related contingent features was $260 million at December 31, 2018 , and $263 million at December 31, 2017 . APC 2018 FORM 10-K | 73 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Operating Activities One of the primary sources of variability in the Company cash flows from operating activities is the fluctuation in commodity prices, the impact of which Anadarko partially mitigates by periodically entering into commodity derivatives. Sales-volume changes also impact cash flow but historically have not been as volatile as commodity prices. Anadarko cash flows from operating activities are also impacted by the costs related to operations and interest payments related to the Company outstanding debt. Cash flows from operating activities were $5.9 billion for 2018 , $1.9 billion higher compared to 2017 , primarily due to higher sales revenues resulting from higher oil prices. Cash flows from operating activities were $4.0 billion for 2017, $1.0 billion higher compared to 2016, primarily due to higher sales revenues resulting from higher commodity prices. Additional significant items impacting operating activities for 2016 were the $159.5 million payment of the Clean Water Act (CWA) penalty, $247 million related to severance costs and retirement benefits paid in connection with the workforce reduction program, and the receipt of an $881 million tax refund related to the income tax benefit associated with the Company 2015 tax net operating loss carryback. See Note 14 Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for discussion related to the potential repayment of the 2016 tax refund. Pension and Other Postretirement Contributions Contributions to the pension and other postretirement plans were $244 million in 2018, $276 million in 2017, and $120 million in 2016. The Company expects to contribute $155 million in 2019 to its pension and other postretirement plans. 74 | APC 2018 FORM 10-K MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Investing Activities Capital Expenditures The following presents the Company capital expenditures: millions 2018 2017 2016 Cash Flows from Investing Activities Additions to properties and equipment (1) $ 6,183 $ 5,031 $ 3,505 Adjustments for capital expenditures Changes in capital accruals (3 ) 275 (205 ) Other 5 (6 ) 14 Total capital expenditures (2) $ 6,185 $ 5,300 $ 3,314 Exploration and Production and other capital expenditures $ 4,264 $ 3,884 $ 2,763 WES Midstream capital expenditures 1,178 956 491 Other Midstream capital expenditures 743 460 60 (1) Additions to properties and equipment as presented within Anadarko cash flows from investing activities include cash payments for cost of properties, equipment, and facilities. The cost of properties includes the initial capitalization of drilling costs associated with all exploratory wells, whether or not they were deemed to have a commercially sufficient quantity of proved reserves. (2) Capital expenditures exclude the FPSO capital lease asset; see Financing Activities Capital Lease Obligations below. 2018 vs. 2017 The Company capital expenditures increased by $885 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 . Exploration and Production capital expenditures increased primarily due to higher development costs of $809 million driven by increased drilling and completion activities primarily in the DJ and Delaware basins and the Gulf of Mexico. Exploration costs decreased by $485 million primarily related to decreased exploration drilling in the Gulf of Mexico, C te d Ivoire, and Colombia. Other Midstream capital expenditures increased $283 million due to infrastructure build-out primarily in the Delaware basin. WES Midstream capital expenditures increased $222 million primarily related to infrastructure build-out in the Delaware and DJ basins. 2017 vs. 2016 The Company capital expenditures increased by $2.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017 . Exploration and Production capital expenditures increased primarily due to higher development costs of $925 million driven by increased U.S. onshore drilling activity primarily in the DJ basin and operatorship capture in the Delaware basin as well as higher exploration costs of $356 million primarily driven by U.S. onshore acreage acquisitions and $172 million primarily due to exploration drilling in the Gulf of Mexico. These increases were partially offset by decreased development costs of $227 million driven by the TEN development in Ghana, which achieved first oil in the third quarter of 2016. WES Midstream capital expenditures increased primarily due to $465 million related to the development of assets primarily in the Delaware and DJ basins. Other Midstream capital expenditures increased $400 million due to asset development primarily in the Delaware basin. Property Exchange On March 17, 2017, WES acquired a third party 50% nonoperated interest in the DBJV System, now part of the West Texas Complex, in exchange for WES 33.75% interest in nonoperated Marcellus midstream assets and $155 million in cash. WES funded the cash consideration with cash on hand and recognized a gain of $126 million as a result of this transaction. After the acquisition, the DBJV System was 100% owned by WES and consolidated by Anadarko. See Note 4 Divestitures and Assets Held for Sale in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Acquisitions In December 2016, the Company closed the GOM Acquisition for $1.8 billion .

APC 2018 FORM 10-K | 79 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Insurance Coverage and Other Indemnities Anadarko maintains property and casualty insurance that includes coverage for physical damage to the Company properties, blowout/control of a well, restoration and redrill, sudden and accidental pollution, third-party liability, workers compensation and employers liability, and other risks. Anadarko insurance coverage includes deductibles that must be met prior to recovery. Additionally, the Company insurance is subject to exclusions and limitations, and there is no assurance that such coverage will adequately protect the Company against liability or loss from all potential consequences and damages. The Company current insurance coverage includes (a) $400 million per occurrence from Oil Insurance Limited (OIL) for physical damage to Anadarko properties on a replacement cost basis, blowout/control of well, restoration and redrill, and sudden and accidental pollution; (b) $1.2 billion per occurrence from the commercial markets for the items described in item (a) above, which is in excess of the OIL coverage and which follows the form of OIL coverage with certain exceptions; (c) $500 million from the commercial markets, which scales to Anadarko working interest, for third-party liabilities, including sudden and accidental pollution and aviation liability; and (d) $275 million for aircraft liability (in addition to the third-party liability limits described in item (c) above). Anadarko does not carry significant coverage for loss of production income from any of the Company facilities or for any losses that result from the effects of a named windstorm. The Company service agreements, including drilling contracts, generally indemnify Anadarko for injuries and death to employees of the service provider and subcontractors hired by the service provider as well as for property damage suffered by the service provider and its contractors. Also, these service agreements generally indemnify Anadarko for pollution originating from the equipment of any contractors or subcontractors hired by the service provider. 80 | APC 2018 FORM 10-K MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements Anadarko may enter into off-balance-sheet arrangements and transactions that can give rise to material off-balance-sheet obligations.

APC 2018 FORM 10-K | 81 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make informed judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for discussion of the Company significant accounting policies. Changes in facts and circumstances or additional information may result in revised estimates, and actual results may differ from these estimates. Management considers the following to be its most critical accounting estimates that involve judgment. The selection, development, and disclosure of these estimates is discussed with the Company Audit Committee. Proved Reserves Methodology Anadarko estimates its proved oil and gas reserves according to the definition of proved reserves provided by the SEC and the FASB. This definition includes oil, natural gas, and NGLs that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be economically producible in future periods from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions, operating methods, government regulations, etc. (at prices and costs as of the date the estimates are made). Prices include consideration of price changes provided only by contractual arrangements, and do not include adjustments based on expected future conditions. For reserves information, see Oil and Gas Properties and Activities Proved Reserves under Items 1 and 2 of this Form 10-K and the Supplemental Information on Oil and Gas Exploration and Production Activities under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Judgments and uncertainties Engineering estimates of the quantities of proved reserves are inherently imprecise and represent only approximate amounts because of the judgments involved in developing such information. The Company estimates of proved reserves are made using available geological and reservoir data as well as production performance data. The reliability of these estimates at any point in time depends on both the quality and quantity of the technical and economic data and the efficiency of extracting and processing the hydrocarbons. These estimates are reviewed annually by internal reservoir engineers and revised, either upward or downward, as warranted by additional data. Revisions are necessary due to changes in, among other things, development plans, reservoir performance, prices, economic conditions, and governmental restrictions as well as changes in the expected recovery associated with infill drilling. Decreases in prices, for example, may cause a reduction in some proved reserves due to reaching economic limits at an earlier projected date. A material adverse change in the estimated volume of proved reserves could have a negative impact on DD&A and could result in property impairments. If the estimates of proved reserves used in the UOP calculations had been lower by 10% across all properties, DD&A in 2018 would have increased by approximately $390 million. 82 | APC 2018 FORM 10-K MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Exploratory Costs Methodology Under the successful efforts method of accounting, exploratory drilling costs are initially capitalized pending the determination of proved reserves. If proved reserves are found, drilling costs remain capitalized and are classified as proved properties. For exploratory wells that find reserves that cannot be classified as proved when drilling is completed, costs continue to be capitalized as suspended exploratory drilling costs if there have been sufficient reserves found to justify completion as a producing well and sufficient progress is being made in assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project. At the end of each quarter, management reviews the status of all suspended exploratory drilling costs in light of ongoing exploration activities, in particular, whether the Company is making sufficient progress in its ongoing exploration and appraisal efforts or, in the case of discoveries requiring government sanctioning, analyzing whether development negotiations are underway and proceeding as planned. Judgments and uncertainties Significant management judgment is required to determine whether sufficient progress has been made in assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project to continue capitalization of the exploratory drilling costs. In making this determination all relevant facts and circumstances shall be evaluated, and no single indicator is determinative. Relevant facts and circumstances include, but are not limited to, commitment of project personnel, costs being incurred to assess the reserves and their potential development, assessment in progress covering the economic, legal, political, and environmental aspects of the potential development, and the existence or active negotiations of agreements with governments or sales contracts with customers. The determination of proved reserves may take longer than one year in certain areas (generally in deepwater and international locations) depending on, among other things, the amount of hydrocarbons discovered, the outcome of planned geological and engineering studies, the need for additional appraisal drilling activities to determine whether the discovery is sufficient to support an economic development plan, and government sanctioning of development activities in certain international locations. If management determines that future appraisal drilling or development activities are unlikely to occur, associated suspended exploratory well costs are expensed. Therefore, at any point in time, the Company may have capitalized costs on its Consolidated Balance Sheets associated with exploratory wells that may be charged to exploration expense in future periods. See Note 7 Suspended Exploratory Well Costs in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information. Fair Value Methodology The Company estimates fair value of long-lived assets for impairment testing, reporting units for goodwill impairment testing when necessary, assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination or exchanged in non-monetary transactions, pension plan assets, and initial measurements of AROs. Judgments and uncertainties When the Company is required to measure fair value and there is not a market-observable price for the asset or liability or for a similar asset or liability, the Company uses the cost or income approaches depending on the quality of information available to support management assumptions. The cost approach is based on management best estimate of the current asset replacement cost. The income approach is based on management best assumptions regarding expectations of future net cash flows and discounts the expected cash flows using a commensurate risk-adjusted discount rate. Such evaluations involve significant judgment, and the results are based on expected future events or conditions such as sales prices, estimates of future oil and gas production or throughput, development and operating costs and the timing thereof, economic and regulatory climates, and other factors, most of which are often outside of management control. However, assumptions used reflect a market participant view of long-term prices, costs, and other factors and are consistent with assumptions used in the Company business plans and investment decisions. APC 2018 FORM 10-K | 83 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Impairments of Proved Oil and Natural-Gas Properties Methodology Proved oil and natural-gas properties are assessed for impairment when facts and circumstances indicate that net book values may not be recoverable. When impairment indicators are present, an undiscounted future net cash flow test is performed at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are independent of cash flows from other assets. If the sum of the undiscounted future net cash flows is less than the net book value of the property, the property fair value is estimated and an impairment loss is recognized for the excess, if any, of the property net book value over its estimated fair value. Judgments and uncertainties The primary assumptions used to estimate undiscounted future net cash flows include anticipated future production, commodity prices, and capital and operating costs. In most cases, the assumption that generates the most variability in undiscounted future net cash flows is future commodity prices. For impairment testing, the Company used the five-year forward strip prices for oil and natural gas, with prices subsequent to the fifth year held constant as the benchmark price in the undiscounted future net cash flows. Capital and operating costs were estimated assuming no escalation for years where the average oil strip price was below $50 per Bbl and 1% escalation for the years where the average oil strip price exceeded $50 per Bbl and held constant thereafter. Due to the volatility of crude oil, natural gas, and NGL prices, these cash flow estimates are inherently imprecise. Unfavorable changes in any of the primary assumptions could result in a reduction in undiscounted future cash flows and could indicate property impairment. Uncertainties related to the primary assumptions could affect the timing of an impairment. Impairments of Unproved Oil and Natural-Gas Properties Methodology Acquisition costs of unproved oil and natural-gas properties are periodically assessed for impairment and are transferred to proved oil and gas properties to the extent the costs are associated with successful exploration activities. The Company has classified unproved oil and natural-gas properties into three categories: significant, significant where probable and possible reserves estimations are available, and individually insignificant. Significant undeveloped leases are assessed individually for impairment and a valuation allowance is provided if impairment is indicated. In situations where fair values have been allocated to a significant unproved property based on estimations of probable and possible reserves as the result of a business combination or other purchase of proved and unproved properties, an undiscounted future net cash flow analysis is used to assess the property for impairment in addition to consideration of reserves volume needed to transfer the balance of unproved property to proved property. Unproved oil and gas properties with individually insignificant lease acquisition costs are amortized on a group basis (thereby establishing a valuation allowance) over the average lease terms at rates that provide for full amortization of unsuccessful leases upon lease expiration or abandonment. Judgments and uncertainties In determining whether a significant unproved property is impaired numerous factors are considered including, but not limited to, current exploration plans, favorable or unfavorable exploration activity on the property being evaluated and/or adjacent properties, geologists evaluation of the property, and the remaining months in the lease term for the property. In situations where probable and possible reserves are available, undiscounted future net cash flows used in the impairment analysis are determined based upon management estimates of probable and possible reserves, future commodity prices, and future costs to produce the reserves. If undiscounted future net cash flows are less than the carrying value of the property, indicating impairment, the future net cash flows are discounted and compared to the carrying value for determining the amount of the impairment loss to record. The Company utilizes the same pricing and cost assumptions discussed above in Impairments of Proved Oil and Natural-Gas Properties. Uncertainties related to the primary assumptions or unfavorable revisions in estimated reserves quantities could cause a reduction in the value of a property and therefore indicate an impairment. Management assessment of the results of exploration activities, availability of funds for future activities, and the current and projected political and regulatory climate in areas in which the Company operates also impact the amounts and timing of impairment provisions. 84 | APC 2018 FORM 10-K MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Income Taxes Methodology The Company is subject to income taxes in numerous taxing jurisdictions worldwide. The amount of income taxes recorded by the Company requires interpretations of complex rules and regulations of various tax jurisdictions throughout the world. The Company has recognized deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences, operating losses, and tax-credit carryforwards. The deferred tax assets may be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company routinely assesses the realizability of its deferred tax assets by analyzing the reversal periods of available net operating loss carryforwards and credit carryforwards, temporary differences in tax assets and liabilities, the availability of tax planning strategies, and estimates of future taxable income and other factors. The Company also routinely assesses potential uncertain tax positions and, if required, establishes accruals for such amounts, including interest where appropriate. The Company recognizes a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, based on the technical merits of the position. Judgments and uncertainties The accruals for deferred tax assets and liabilities, including deferred state income tax assets and liabilities, are subject to significant judgment by management and are reviewed and adjusted routinely based on changes in facts and circumstances. The assessment of potential uncertain tax positions requires a significant amount of judgment and are reviewed and adjusted on a periodic basis, taking into consideration the progress of ongoing tax audits, case law, and new legislation. Although management considers its tax accruals adequate, material changes in these accruals may occur in the future based on the progress of ongoing tax audits, changes in legislation, and resolution of pending tax matters. Additionally, numerous judgments and assumptions are inherent in management estimates of future taxable income used to assess the realizability of certain deferred tax assets. The estimates used are based on assumptions of proved oil and gas reserves, commodity prices, and development assumptions that are consistent with the Company internal business plans. Contingencies Methodology The Company is subject to various legal proceedings, claims, and liabilities that arise in the ordinary course of business. Except for contingencies acquired in a business combination, which are recorded at fair value at the time of acquisition, the Company accrues losses when such losses are probable and reasonably estimable. If the Company determines that a loss is probable and cannot estimate a specific amount for that loss, but can estimate a range of loss, the best estimate within the range is accrued. If no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other, the minimum amount of the range is accrued. The Company in-house legal counsel personnel regularly assess contingent liabilities and, in certain circumstances, consult with third-party legal counsel or consultants to assist in the evaluation of the Company liability for these contingencies. Judgments and uncertainties Management makes judgments and estimates when it establishes liabilities for litigation and other contingent matters. Estimates of litigation-related liabilities are based on the facts and circumstances of the individual case and on information currently available to the Company. The extent of information available varies based on the status of the litigation and the Company evaluation of the claim and legal arguments. In future periods, a number of factors could significantly change the Company estimate of litigation-related liabilities, including discovery activities; briefings filed with the relevant court; rulings from the court made pre-trial, during trial, or at the conclusion of any trial; and similar cases involving other plaintiffs and defendants that may set or change legal precedent. As events unfold throughout the litigation process, the Company evaluates the available information and may consult with third-party legal counsel to determine whether liability accruals should be established or adjusted.
