These statements include, among other things, statements concerning our expectations: that our service revenues may become a larger portion of our total revenue and may increase as we renew existing services contracts and expand our customer base; regarding the percentage of our revenue attributable to ratable product and services revenue; regarding our royalty payments to Trend Micro; regarding trends in our costs of revenues and gross margins; regarding increases in our operating expenses; regarding our investment in our support infrastructure; and regarding the hiring of new employees; as well as other statements regarding our future operations, financial condition and prospects and business strategies. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those reflected in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and, in particular, the risks discussed under the heading Risk Factors in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and those discussed in other documents we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We undertake no obligation to revise or publicly release the results of any revision to these forward-looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. Business Overview We are a leading provider of network security appliances and the market leader in UTM network security solutions. We provide broad, integrated and high performance protection against dynamic security threats while simplifying the IT security infrastructure for enterprises, service providers and government entities worldwide. As of December 31, 2009, we had shipped over 500,000 appliances to more than 5,000 channel partners and 75,000 end-customers worldwide, including a majority of the 2009 Fortune Global 100. Our core UTM product line of FortiGate appliances ships with a set of security and networking capabilities, including firewall, VPN, antivirus, intrusion prevention, Web filtering, antispam and WAN acceleration functionality. We derive a substantial majority of product sales from our FortiGate appliances, which range from the FortiGate-30 designed for small businesses and branch offices to the FortiGate-5000 series for large enterprises and service providers. Sales of FortiGate products have generally been balanced across entry-level (FortiGate-30 to -100 series), mid-range (FortiGate-200 to -800 series) and high-end (FortiGate-1000 to -5000 series) models with each product category representing approximately one third of FortiGate sales for each of the last three fiscal years. Our UTM solution also includes our FortiGuard security subscription services, which end-customers can subscribe to in order to obtain access to dynamic updates to the antivirus, intrusion prevention, Web filtering and antispam functionality included in our appliances. End-customers can also choose to purchase FortiCare technical support services for our products. We complement our core FortiGate product line with other appliances and software that offer additional protection from security threats to other critical areas of the enterprise, such as messaging, Web-based traffic and databases, and employee computers or handheld devices. In November 2009, we completed our initial public offering, whereby 14,375,000 shares of common stock were sold to the public at a price of $12.50 per share. We sold 7,656,683 shares of our common stock and received $87.4 million in net proceeds, and the selling shareholders sold 6,718,317 shares of our common stock. Our total revenue increased from $155.4 million in fiscal 2007 to $252.1 million in fiscal 2009. We achieved profitability in the third quarter of fiscal 2008 and have remained profitable each quarter since. Our total deferred revenue increased by $30.3 million from $171.6 million at December 28, 2008 to $201.9 at December 31, 2009. Revenue recognized plus the change in deferred revenue from the beginning to the end of the period is a useful metric that management identifies as billings. Billings drive deferred revenue, which is an important indicator of the health and visibility of our business, and has historically represented a majority of the quarterly revenue that we recognize. We also ended fiscal 2009 with $260.3 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments and have had positive cash flow from operations every fiscal year since 2005. 50 Table of Contents Our Business Model Our sales strategy is based on a distribution model whereby we primarily sell our products and services directly to distributors who sell to resellers and service providers, who, in turn, sell to our end-customers. In certain cases, we sell directly to government-focused resellers, large service providers and major systems integrators, who have significant purchasing power and unique customer deployment requirements. Typically, FortiGuard security subscription services and FortiCare technical support services are purchased along with our appliances. We invoice at the time of our sale for the total price of the products and subscription and support services, and the invoice generally becomes payable within 30 to 90 days. We generally recognize product revenue up-front but defer revenue for the sale of new and renewal subscription and support services contracts and recognize the related services revenue over the service period, which is typically one year from the date the end-customer registers for these services, as that is the date on which the services can first be used by the customer. As a result, our sales of new and renewal services increase our deferred revenue balance, which contributes significantly to our positive cash flow from operations. Services revenue provides a source of recurring revenue for us, representing 55.2% of total revenue for fiscal 2009 and 49.7% of total revenue for fiscal 2008, and is important to our future revenue and profitability. We are a global, geographically diversified business, with more than 60% of our total revenue generated outside of the Americas region since fiscal 2006. For fiscal 2009, 37% of our total revenue was generated from the Americas, 38% from EMEA, and 25% from APAC. We sell globally in U.S. dollars, while our international expenses are denominated in local currencies. 51 Table of Contents Key Metrics We monitor the key financial metrics set forth below to help us evaluate growth trends, establish budgets, measure the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts and assess operational efficiencies. We discuss revenue, gross margin, and the components of operating income and margin below under Components of Operating Results, and we discuss our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments under Liquidity and Capital Resources. Deferred revenue and cash flow from operations are discussed immediately below the table. Fiscal Year or as of Fiscal Year End 2009 (2) 2008 2007 (dollars in thousands) Revenue $ 252,115 $ 211,791 $ 155,366 Gross margin 72.2 % 69.1 % 63.5 % Operating income (loss) (1) $ 25,334 $ 4,927 $ (21,577 ) Operating margin 10.0 % 2.3 % (13.9 )% Total deferred revenue $ 201,930 $ 171,617 $ 131,255 Increase in total deferred revenue 30,313 40,362 37,879 Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments 260,314 124,190 90,161 Cash flow from operations 61,971 37,686 27,669 (1) Includes: Stock-based compensation expense: $ 7,461 $ 5,299 $ 9,332 Non-cash asset acquisition related write-offs: $ 2,387 $ $ The non-cash asset acquisition related write-offs are expenses for intangible assets that have no future value. (2) We made the decision in the first quarter of 2009 to change our financial reporting periods from a fiscal to calendar year basis. This change was implemented in the third quarter of 2009 upon completion of required system changes. Commencing in the third quarter of fiscal 2009, we began operating and reporting financial results on a calendar quarter and year basis. Our third quarter of fiscal 2009 ended on September 30, 2009, and our fiscal 2009 ended on December 31, 2009. The impact of the reporting period change had the effect of increasing the number of days in the 12 month period ended December 31, 2009 by four days. This change in period end had the effect of increasing services revenue by approximately $1.6 million. Although a significant volume of shipments occurs during the final few days of each of our quarterly reporting periods, including during the year ended December 31, 2009, management believes that the four days added to the year ended December 31, 2009 from the effect of such conversion to a calendar year end did not materially impact our product revenue, as we manage our year-end sales cycle based on our financial reporting period end. Deferred revenue. Our deferred revenue consists of amounts that have been invoiced but that have not yet been recognized as revenue. The majority of our deferred revenue balance consists of the unamortized portion of services revenue from subscription and support service contracts. We monitor our deferred revenue balance because it represents a significant portion of revenue to be recognized in future periods. We also assess the increase in our deferred revenue balance plus revenue we recognized in a particular period as a measure of our sales activity for that period. Cash flow from operations. We monitor cash flow from operations as a measure of our overall business performance. Our cash flow from operations is driven in large part by advance payments for both new and renewal contracts for subscription and support services. Monitoring cash flow from operations enables us to analyze our financial performance without the non-cash effects of certain items such as depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation expenses, thereby allowing us to better understand and manage the cash needs of our business. Our cash flow from operations was $62.0 million in fiscal 2009, $37.7 million in fiscal 2008, $27.7 million in fiscal 2007 and $3.4 million in each of fiscal 2006 and 2005. 52 Table of Contents Non-GAAP Financial Measures To supplement our consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ), we consider certain financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, including non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP income from operations and operating margin, and non-GAAP operating expenses. These non-GAAP measures are not based on any standardized methodology prescribed by GAAP and are not necessarily comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. Non-GAAP gross margin is gross margin as reported on our consolidated statements of operations, excluding the impact of non-cash stock-based compensation and the non-cash asset acquisition related write-offs described below. Non-GAAP income from operations is operating income, as reported on our consolidated statements of operations, excluding the impact of non-cash stock-based compensation and the non-cash asset acquisition related write-offs described below. The non-cash asset acquisition related write-offs that we exclude from these non-GAAP financial measures are expenses for intangible assets that have no future value, but these expenses do not include amortization related to the intangible assets that provide an ongoing benefit to our recurring operations. Non-GAAP operating margin is defined as non-GAAP income from operations divided by revenue. Non-GAAP operating expenses exclude the impact of non-cash stock-based compensation expense. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures are appropriate to enhance an overall understanding of our past financial performance, as they help illustrate underlying trends in our business that could otherwise be masked by the effect of the expenses that we exclude in these non-GAAP financial measures. Furthermore, we use many of these measures to establish budgets and operational goals for managing our business and evaluating our performance. We believe that the expenses that we exclude in these non-GAAP financial measures are not reflective of these underlying business trends or useful measures for determining our operational performance and overall business strategy. By excluding these expenses, we believe that our management and investors can better compare our recurring core business operating results over multiple periods. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. There are a number of limitations related to the use of these non-GAAP financial measures versus the nearest GAAP equivalent of these financial measures. First, these non-GAAP financial measures exclude some costs, namely, non-cash stock-based compensation, that are recurring. Non-cash stock-based compensation has been and will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant recurring expense in our business and is an important part of our employees compensation that impacts their performance. Second, the expenses that we exclude in our calculation of these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from the expenses, if any, that our peer companies may exclude when they report their results of operations. We compensate for these limitations by providing the nearest GAAP equivalents of these non-GAAP financial measures and describing these GAAP equivalents in our Results of Operations below. 53 Table of Contents The following tables reconcile GAAP gross margin, income from operations, operating margin and certain operating expenses as reported on our consolidated statements of operations to non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP operating margin and certain non-GAAP operating expenses for fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Further presentation of quarterly non-GAAP gross margin is included in the Quarterly Results of Operations section below.

We recognize our revenue in accordance with the guidance in ASC 985-605-25 (formerly referred to as Statement of Position, or SOP 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition and SOP 98-9, Modification of SOP 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, With Respect to Certain Transactions) which is discussed in further detail in Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Revenue Recognition below. According to ASC 985-605-25, revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the price is fixed or determinable and collection is probable. Our total revenue is comprised of the following: Product revenue . Product revenue is generated from sales of our appliances and software. The substantial majority of our product revenue has been generated by our FortiGate line of appliances and we do not expect this to change in the foreseeable future. Product revenue also includes revenue derived from sales of FortiManager, FortiAnalyzer, FortiMail, FortiDB, FortiWeb and FortiScan appliances, and our FortiClient and virtual domain, or VDOM, software. We generally recognize revenue for products sold to distributors through the sell-in method upon shipment to the distributor and, for sell-through distributors, upon sale to their end-customer. As a percentage of total revenue, we expect our product revenue may vary from quarter-to-quarter based on seasonal and cyclical factors discussed below under Quarterly Results of Operations but generally may remain at comparable levels or decline modestly, as services revenue becomes a larger portion of our business as we renew existing services contracts and expand our customer base. Services revenue . Services revenue is generated primarily from FortiCare technical support services for software updates, maintenance releases and patches, Internet access to technical content, telephone and Internet access to technical support personnel and hardware support and FortiGuard security subscription services related to antivirus, intrusion prevention, Web filtering and antispam updates. We recognize revenue from subscription and support services over the service performance period. Our typical contractual support and subscription term is one year from the date of registration. We also generate a small portion of our revenue from professional services and training services and we recognize this revenue upon completion of the project. As a percentage of total revenue, we expect our services revenue may remain at comparable levels or increase as we renew existing services contracts and expand our customer base. Ratable product and services revenue . Ratable product and services revenue is generated from sales of our products and services in cases where the fair value of the services being provided cannot be segregated from the value of the entire sale. In these cases, the value of the entire sale is deferred and recognized ratably over the life of the service performance period. See Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Revenue Recognition. In fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2009, ratable product and service revenue represented approximately six percent of total revenue and we do not expect this percentage to change significantly in the near future. Cost of revenue Our total cost of revenue is comprised of the following: Cost of product revenue. A substantial majority of the cost of product revenue consists of third-party manufacturing costs. Our cost of product revenue also includes product testing costs, write-offs for excess and obsolete inventory, royalty payments, amortization and any impairment of applicable acquired intangible assets, warranty costs, shipping and allocated facilities costs, stock-based compensation costs, and personnel costs associated with logistics and quality control. Personnel costs include cash-based personnel costs such as salaries, benefits and bonuses. Royalties reflect amounts related to Trend Micro since 2006, which Trend Micro claims are owed through 2015, as discussed in Item 3 Legal Proceedings. For fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2009, this royalty represented approximately 1% of total revenue and, if such payments are made in accordance with the terms of the 2006 settlement agreement with Trend Micro, we would not expect this percentage to increase substantially in the foreseeable future. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, we incurred a non-cash charge of approximately $1.7 million, related to certain warrants issued in connection with acquisitions of technology assets. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements. Cost of services revenue. Cost of services revenue is primarily comprised of cash-based personnel costs associated with our FortiGuard Labs team and our technical support, professional services and training teams, as well as depreciation, supplies, data center, data communications, facility-related costs and stock-based compensation costs. We expect our cost of services revenue will increase as we continue to invest in subscription and support services to meet the needs of our growing customer base. Cost of ratable product and services revenue . Cost of ratable product and services revenue is comprised primarily of deferred product costs and services-related costs. 55 Table of Contents Gross profit . Gross profit as a percentage of revenue, or gross margin, has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors, including the average sales price of our products, any excess inventory write-offs, manufacturing costs, the mix of products sold and the mix of revenue between products and services. We believe our overall gross margin for the near term may decline modestly or be relatively flat compared to that achieved in fiscal 2009 as we do not anticipate in the near term any significant change in the factors positively influencing gross margin. Services revenue has increased as a percentage of total revenue since inception and this trend has had a positive effect on our total gross margin given the higher services gross margins compared to product gross margins. Our services gross margins have been increasing, but we do not expect these margins to increase substantially in the future as we continue to invest in our support infrastructure. Operating expenses . Our operating expenses consist of research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses. Personnel costs are the most significant component of operating expenses and consist of cash-based personnel costs such as salaries, benefits, bonuses and, with regard to the sales and marketing expense, sales commissions. They also include non-cash stock-based compensation. We expect personnel costs to continue to increase in absolute dollars as we hire new employees. Research and development. Research and development expense consists primarily of cash-based personnel costs. Additional research and development expenses include ASIC and system prototypes and certification-related expenses, depreciation of capital equipment, facility-related expenses and stock-based compensation expenses. The majority of our research and development is focused on both software development and the ongoing development of our hardware platform. We record all research and development expenses as incurred, except for capital equipment which is depreciated over time. Our development teams are primarily located in Canada, China, and California. We expect our spending for research and development to increase in absolute dollars but intend for research and development expenses to remain comparable to recent periods as a percentage of total revenue. 56 Table of Contents Sales and marketing . Sales and marketing expense is the largest component of our operating expenses and primarily consists of cash-based personnel costs. Additional sales and marketing expenses include stock-based compensation, promotional and other marketing expenses, travel, depreciation of capital equipment and facility-related expenses. We intend to hire additional personnel focused on sales and marketing and expand our sales and marketing efforts worldwide in order to add new customers and increase penetration within our existing customer base. Accordingly, we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars and to continue to be our largest operating expense. General and administrative . General and administrative expenses consist of cash-based personnel costs as well as professional fees, stock-based compensation, depreciation of capital equipment and software, and facility-related expenses. General and administrative personnel include our executive, finance, human resources, information technology and legal organizations. Our professional fees principally consist of outside legal, auditing, accounting, information technology and other consulting costs. We expect that general and administrative expense will increase in absolute dollars as we hire additional personnel, make improvements to our information technology infrastructure and incur significant additional costs for the compliance requirements of operating as a public company, including the costs associated with SEC reporting, Sarbanes-Oxley Act compliance and insurance. Interest income. Interest income consists of income earned on our cash, cash equivalents and investments. We have historically invested our cash in money-market funds and other short-term, investment-grade investments. Other income (expense), net . Other income (expense), net consists primarily of foreign exchange gains and losses. Foreign exchange gains and losses relate to transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the associated entity. Provision for (benefit from) income taxes. We are subject to tax in the United States as well as other tax jurisdictions or countries in which we conduct business. Earnings from our non-U.S. activities are subject to local country income tax and may be subject to current U.S. income tax. Our effective tax rates differ from the statutory rate primarily due to the provision or release of the valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets, state taxes, foreign taxes, research and development tax credits and nondeductible compensation. For periods going forward, given we have fully reversed our net deferred tax asset valuation allowance as discussed below, we expect that our effective tax rate will approximate the U.S. federal statutory tax rates plus the impact of state taxes. As of December 31, 2009, we had $3.5 million of federal and $33.4 million of state net operating loss carry-forwards available to reduce future taxable income. These net operating loss carry-forwards begin to expire in 2021 and 2012 for federal and state tax purposes, respectively. Our ability to use our net operating loss carry-forwards to offset any future taxable income could be subject to limitations attributable to equity transactions that would result in a change of ownership as defined by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Internal Revenue Code. In addition, the State of California has suspended the ability of companies to utilize net operating losses to offset 2008 and 2009 state taxable income. At December 31, 2009, we had a total deferred tax asset of approximately $41.3 million, primarily comprised of deferred revenue, non-deductible reserves and accruals and net operating loss carryforward. During the fourth quarter of 2009 we concluded that it was more likely than not that we would be able to realize the benefit of these deferred tax assets in the future. Consequently, we recognized a $44.2 million benefit in the fourth quarter of 2009 primarily from the release of substantially all of the net deferred tax asset valuation allowance. This reversal resulted in recognition of an income tax benefit totaling $37.8 million for fiscal 2009. We based this conclusion on historical and projected operating performance, as well as our expectation that our operations will generate sufficient taxable income in future periods to realize the tax benefits associated with the deferred tax assets. We will continue to assess the need for a valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset by evaluating both positive and negative evidence that may exist. Any adjustment to the net deferred tax asset valuation allowance would be recorded in the income statement of the periods that the adjustment is determined to be required. We make estimates and judgments about our future taxable income that are based on assumptions that are consistent with our forecasted operating plans. Should the actual amounts differ from our estimates, the amount of our income tax provision could be materially impacted. We have $3.4 million in unrecognized tax benefits, which would impact the effective tax rate if recognized. Our policy is to classify interest accrued or penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. 57 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These principles require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, cash flow and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Our estimates include those related to revenue recognition, stock-based compensation, valuation of inventory, warranty liabilities and accounting for income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and our actual results, our future financial statements will be affected. We believe that of our significant accounting policies, which are described in Note 1 to the financial statements included in this 10-K, the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, we believe these are the most critical to fully understand and evaluate our financial condition and results of operations. Revenue Recognition We derive revenue from sales of products, including appliances and software, and services, including subscription, support and other services. Our appliances include operating system software that is integrated into the appliance hardware and is deemed essential to its functionality. As a result, we account for revenue in accordance with ASC 985-605 and all related interpretations. See Recent Accounting Pronouncements for a discussion of new revenue recognition standards that we will be required to adopt by fiscal 2011. We are still assessing the impact of the new standards and have not reflected in this 10-K any impact such standards may have on our consolidated financial statements. No revenue can be recognized until all of the following criteria have been met: Persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists. Binding contracts or purchase orders are generally used to determine the existence of an arrangement. Delivery has occurred. Delivery occurs when we fulfill an order and title and risk of loss has been transferred or upon delivery of the service contract registration code. 58 Table of Contents The fee is fixed or determinable. We assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction. In the event payment terms differ from our standard business practices, the fees are deemed to be not fixed or determinable and revenue is recognized when the payments become due, provided the remaining criteria for revenue recognition have been met. Collectability is probable. We assess collectability based primarily on creditworthiness as determined by credit checks and analysis, as well as payment history. Payment terms generally range from 30 to 90 days from invoice date. For arrangements which include customer acceptance criteria, no revenue is recognized prior to acceptance. We recognize product revenue on sales to distributors that have no rights of return and end-customers upon shipment of the appliance, once all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. We also make sales through distributors under agreements that allow for rights of return. We recognize product revenue on sales made through such distributors upon sale by the distributor to the end-customer, at which time rights of return generally lapse. Substantially all of our products have been sold in combination with subscription or support services. Subscription services provide access to our antivirus, intrusion prevention, Web filtering, and antispam functionality. Support services include rights to unspecified software upgrades, maintenance releases and patches, telephone and Internet access to technical support personnel, and hardware support. We commence our subscription and support services on the date the customer registers the appliance. The customer is then entitled to service for the stated contractual period beginning on the registration date. We use the residual method to recognize revenue when an arrangement includes one or more elements to be delivered at a future date and vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE) of the fair value of all undelivered elements exists. Under the residual method, the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the contract fee is recognized as product revenue. In cases where VSOE of fair value of the undelivered elements does not exist, typically for subscription and support services, revenue for the entire arrangement is recognized ratably over the performance period of the undelivered elements. Revenue related to these arrangements is included in ratable product and services revenue in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. VSOE of fair value for elements of an arrangement is based upon the pricing for those services when sold separately. Revenue for professional services and training is recognized upon completion of the related services. We offer certain sales incentives to channel partners. Additionally, in limited circumstances we may permit end-customers, distributors and resellers to return our products, subject to varying limitations, for a refund within a reasonably short period from the date of purchase. We reduce revenue for estimates of sales returns and allowances. We estimate and record reserves for these sales incentives and sales returns based on our historical experience. In each accounting period, we must make judgments and estimates of sales incentives and potential future sales returns related to current period revenue. These estimates affect our net revenue line item on our consolidated statement of operations and affect our net accounts receivable, deferred revenue or accrued liabilities line items on our consolidated balance sheet. Historically, there have been no significant adjustments to these estimates related to prior periods. At December 31, 2009, our allowance for sales returns was $5.0 million compared to $2.7 million at December 28, 2008. If our allowance for sales returns was to increase by 10%, or $0.5 million, our net revenue would decrease by $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Stock-Based Compensation Our stock-based compensation expense is as follows: Fiscal Year 2009 2008 2007 (in thousands) Cost of product revenue $ 102 $ 67 $ 553 Cost of services revenue 658 400 416 Research and development 1,963 1,049 1,452 Sales and marketing 3,020 2,512 3,928 General and administrative 1,718 1,271 2,983 Total stock-based compensation $ 7,461 $ 5,299 $ 9,332 Employees. Prior to January 2, 2006, we accounted for stock-based awards to employees using the intrinsic value method in accordance with ASC 718 (formerly referred to as Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25 and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS No. 44). Effective January 2, 2006, we adopted ASC 718 (SFAS 123R). For stock option grants made subsequent to January 2, 2006, we have accounted for such stock-based awards to employees in accordance with ASC 718 (SFAS 123R), which requires compensation expense related to share-based transactions, including employee stock options, to be measured and recognized in the financial statements based on a determination of the fair value of the stock options. The grant date fair value is determined using the Black-Scholes-Merton ( Black-Scholes ) pricing model. 59 Table of Contents We adopted ASC 718 (SFAS 123R) using the prospective method, in which non-public entities that previously applied ASC 718 (SFAS 123R) using the minimum value method, whether for financial statement recognition or pro forma disclosure purposes, would continue to account for unvested stock options outstanding at the date of adoption of ASC 718 (SFAS 123R) in the same manner as they had been accounted for prior to the adoption of ASC 718 (SFAS 123R). We will continue to apply ASC 718 (APB 25) in future periods to stock options issued and outstanding at January 2, 2006. For all employee stock options, we recognize expense over the requisite service period using the straight-line method. There is a risk that our estimates of the fair values of our stock-based compensation awards on the grant dates may bear little resemblance to the actual values realized upon exercise. Stock options may expire or otherwise result in zero intrinsic value as compared to the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements. Alternatively, value may be realized from these instruments that are significantly higher than the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements. As of the end of fiscal years 2009, 2008 and 2007, there was approximately $17.5 million, $13.6 million and $4.1 million, respectively, of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to non-vested stock option awards, net of estimated forfeitures, that we expect to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.61, 2.77 and 1.47 years, respectively. 60 Table of Contents For fiscal years 2009, 2008 and 2007, we calculated the fair value of options granted to employees using the Black-Scholes pricing model with the following assumptions: Fiscal Year 2009 2008 2007 (1) Volatility 43 - 52 % 44 - 47 % 49 % Expected term, in years 4.5 - 4.6 4.5 - 4.6 6.1 Dividend yield Risk-free interest rate 1.3 - 2.3 % 2.3 - 3.3 % 4.9 % (1) There was only one grant date in fiscal 2007. Non-employees. During the years ended December 31, 2009 and December 28, 2008, we issued to non-employees in exchange for services, options to purchase 13,000 and 29,000 shares of common stock, respectively, at a range of exercise prices from $7.47 to $11.00 per share. No options were granted to non-employees in exchange for services during the year ended December 30, 2007. These options vest over periods of up to 48 months, and in accordance with ASC 505-50 (formerly referred to as Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 96-18 ), we accounted for these options as variable awards. The options were valued using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions: Fiscal Year 2009 2008 2007 Volatility 43 - 52 % 44 - 51 % 49 - 56 % Expected term, in years 5.2 - 7.5 6.0 - 8.5 6.0 - 9.0 Dividend yield Risk-free interest rate 1.3 - 2.3 % 2.3 - 3.6 % 4.3 - 4.9 % Valuation of Inventory Inventory is recorded at the lower of cost (using the first-in, first-out method) or market, after we give appropriate consideration to obsolescence and inventory in excess of anticipated future demand. In assessing the ultimate recoverability of inventory, we are required to make estimates regarding future customer demand, the timing of new product introductions, economic trends and market conditions. If the actual product demand is significantly lower than forecasted, we could be required to record additional inventory write-downs which would be charged to cost of product revenue. Any write-downs could have an adverse impact on our gross margins and profitability. During fiscal 2007, we wrote-off $6.3 million of excess inventory, of which $6.0 million was written-off in the second half of fiscal 2007. Warranty Liabilities We generally provide a one-year warranty on hardware products and a 90-day warranty on software. A provision for estimated future costs related to warranty activities is charged to cost of product revenue based upon historical product failure rates and historical costs incurred in correcting product failures. If we experience an increase in warranty claims compared with our historical experience, or if the cost of servicing warranty claims is greater than expected, our gross margin could be adversely affected. Accounting for Income Taxes We record income taxes using the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. In estimating future tax consequences, generally all expected future events other than enactments or changes in the tax law or rates are considered. Valuation allowances are provided when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. We operate in various tax jurisdictions and are subject to audit by various tax authorities. We provide for tax contingencies whenever it is deemed probable that a tax asset has been impaired or a tax liability has been incurred for events such as tax claims or changes in tax laws. Tax contingencies are based upon their technical merits, relevant tax law and the specific facts and circumstances as of each reporting period. Changes in facts and circumstances could result in material changes to the amounts recorded for such tax contingencies. On January 1, 2007, we adopted ASC 740-10 (FIN 48), which defines the confidence level that a tax position must meet in order to be recognized in the financial statements. ASC 740-10 requires that the tax effects of a position be recognized only if it is more likely than not to be sustained based solely on its technical merits as of the reporting date. We consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes. 61 Table of Contents As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. We estimate actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items, such as accruals and allowances not currently deductible for tax purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets, which are included in our consolidated balance sheets. In general, deferred tax assets represent future tax benefits to be received when certain expenses previously recognized in our consolidated statements of operations become deductible expenses under applicable income tax laws, or loss or credit carryforwards are utilized. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. During the fourth quarter of 2009 we concluded that it was more likely than not that we would be able to realize the benefit of our deferred tax assets in the future. We based this conclusion on historical and projected operating performance, as well as our expectation that our operations will generate sufficient taxable income in future periods to realize the tax benefits associated with the deferred tax assets. As a result, we released all of the valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets. We will continue to assess the need for a valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset by evaluating both positive and negative evidence that may exist. Any adjustment to the net deferred tax asset valuation allowance would be recorded in the income statement for the period that the adjustment is determined to be required. We make estimates and judgments about our future taxable income that are based on assumptions that are consistent with our plans and estimates. Should the actual amounts differ from our estimates, the amount of our tax expense and liabilities could be materially impacted. 62 Table of Contents Results of Operations The following tables set forth our results of operations for the periods presented and as a percentage of our total revenue for those periods. The period-to-period comparison of financial results is not necessarily indicative of financial results to be achieved in future periods.

(2) We made the decision in the first quarter of 2009 to change our financial reporting periods from a fiscal to calendar basis. This change was implemented in the third quarter of 2009 upon completion of required system changes. Commencing in the third quarter of fiscal 2009, we began operating and reporting financial results on a calendar quarter and year basis. This change in period end had the effect of increasing the number of days in fiscal 2009 by four days. 63 Table of Contents Fiscal Year 2009 2008 2007 (as % of revenue) Revenue Product 39.1 % 44.7 % 45.1 % Services 55.2 49.7 47.7 Ratable product and services 5.7 5.6 7.2 Total revenue 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Total cost of revenue 27.8 % 30.9 % 36.5 % Total gross profit 72.2 % 69.1 % 63.5 % Operating expenses Research and development 16.7 % 17.5 % 17.8 % Sales and marketing 38.2 41.4 46.4 General and administrative 7.3 7.9 13.2 Total operating expenses 62.2 % 66.8 % 77.4 % Operating income (loss) 10.0 % 2.3 % (13.9 )% Interest income 0.8 % 1.3 % 2.3 % Other income (expense), net 0.1 0.8 (1.3 ) Income (loss) before provision for income taxes 10.9 % 4.4 % (12.9 )% Provision for (benefit from) income taxes (13.0 ) 0.9 1.2 Net income (loss) 23.9 % 3.5 % (14.1 )% Fiscal Years 2009 and 2008 Revenue Fiscal Year 2009 2008 Amount % of Revenue Amount % of Revenue $ Change % Change (dollars in thousands) Revenue Product $ 98,686 39.1 % $ 94,587 44.7 % $ 4,099 4.3 % Services 139,172 55.2 105,292 49.7 33,880 32.2 Ratable product and services 14,257 5.7 11,912 5.6 2,345 19.7 Total revenue $ 252,115 100.0 % $ 211,791 100.0 % $ 40,324 19.0 % Revenue by Geography Americas $ 92,621 36.7 % $ 75,367 35.6 % $ 17,254 22.9 % EMEA 95,886 38.1 79,755 37.7 16,131 20.2 APAC 63,608 25.2 56,669 26.7 6,939 12.2 Total revenue $ 252,115 100.0 % $ 211,791 100.0 % $ 40,324 19.0 % Total revenue increased $40.3 million, or 19.0%, in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008, primarily due to growth in services revenue. The Americas and EMEA regions contributed the largest portion of this growth. Product revenue increased $4.1 million, or 4.3%, compared to fiscal 2008. The increase in product revenue was primarily driven by higher product sales volume, predominantly in the Americas region, as we expanded our distributor base to include those that focus on high volume sales of entry-level products. While there were no material price changes between the periods, the shift in product mix towards our entry-level products had the effect of decreasing our average sales price. Services revenue increased $33.9 million, or 32.2%, in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 due to recognition of revenue from our growing deferred revenue balance consisting of subscription and support contracts sold to a larger customer base. The increase in services revenue also reflects additional services revenue amortization of approximately $1.6 million due to our reporting period transition discussed above. The growth in ratable product and services revenue was due to a slight decrease in the weighted-average service period over which such revenue was recognized, due to a decrease in the average contractual term of support contracts for arrangements in which we recognized product and services revenue ratably over the performance period. 64 Table of Contents Cost of revenue and gross margin Fiscal Year 2009 2008 $ Change % Change (dollars in thousands) Cost of revenue Product $ 42,166 $ 41,397 $ 769 1.9 % Services 22,265 19,441 2,824 14.5 Ratable product and services 5,544 4,634 910 19.6 Total cost of revenue $ 69,975 $ 65,472 $ 4,503 6.9 % Gross margin Product 57.3 % 56.2 % 1.1 % Services 84.0 81.5 2.5 Ratable product and services 61.1 61.1 Total gross margin 72.2 69.1 3.1 Total gross margin increased 3.1 percentage points in fiscal 2009 primarily due to improved product and service margins and a higher mix of services revenue in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008. Product gross margin increased 1.1 percentage points in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 primarily due to lower warranty-related return costs which resulted in a savings of $3.2 million, partially offset by $2.4 million of asset acquisition related write-offs. The 2.5 percentage point increase in services gross margin was primarily due to growth in services revenue resulting from a larger customer base to leverage our support cost structure. Services cost increased by $2.8 million primarily due to $2.0 million of higher cash-based personnel costs related to headcount increases in our professional services and training teams and an increase of $0.3 million in stock-based compensation. Ratable product and services gross margin was unchanged in the period.

We also had an increase of $0.9 million in stock-based compensation expense, an increase of $0.2 million in depreciation expense and $0.2 million in supplies and other expenses. Sales and marketing expense Sales and marketing expense increased $8.6 million, or 9.8%, in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 primarily due to increased cash-based personnel costs of $5.4 million based on increased headcount primarily in the U.S., a $1.3 million increase in promotional and other marketing-related expenses, a $0.5 million increase in rent and occupancy-related expenses, a $0.4 million increase in travel, higher depreciation costs of $0.4 million, and a $0.5 million increase in stock-based compensation expense. As a percentage of revenue, sales and marketing expenses decreased 3.2 percentage points. General and administrative expense In fiscal 2009, general and administrative expense increased $1.7 million, or 10.1%, compared to fiscal 2008. The increase was primarily due to a $0.9 million increase in external legal services, a $0.5 million increase in accounting-related services, a $0.5 million increase in rent and occupancy-related expenses and a $0.4 million increase in stock-based compensation. These increases were partially offset by a $0.5 million decrease in computer related supplies and a $0.2 million decrease in travel expenses. 65 Table of Contents Interest income and other income (expense), net Fiscal Year 2009 2008 $ Change % Change (dollars in thousands) Interest income $ 1,981 $ 2,614 $ (633 ) (24.2 )% Other income (expense), net 198 1,710 (1,512 ) (88.4 ) The $0.6 million decrease in interest income in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 was due to lower interest rates earned, despite higher balances of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. The change in other income (expense), net for fiscal 2009 was the result of a stronger U.S. dollar compared to the Euro, British Pound and the Canadian dollar in 2008 when compared to 2009. 66 Table of Contents Provision for income taxes Fiscal Year $ Change % Change 2009 2008 (dollars in thousands) Provision for income taxes $ (32,666 ) $ 1,888 $ (34,554 ) * Effective tax rate (118.7 )% 20.4 % * * not meaningful The effective tax rate was negative 118.7% for fiscal 2009, compared with an effective tax rate of 20.4% for fiscal 2008. The provision for income taxes for fiscal 2009 is comprised primarily of federal, state and foreign income taxes as well as the release of the valuation allowance. The decrease in the provision for income taxes for fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 was attributable to the release of the valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets. We generated pretax income in fiscal 2009 and 2008. As a result of this positive earnings trend and projected future taxable income, we reversed approximately $44.2 million of deferred tax asset valuation allowance; having determined that it was more likely than not that our deferred tax assets would be realized. This reversal resulted in recognition of an income tax benefit totaling $37.8 million. Our estimates of future taxable income represent critical accounting estimates because such estimates are subject to change and a downward adjustment could have a significant impact on future earnings. Furthermore, we continue to evaluate our net deferred tax asset position, in regards to the likelihood of realization of our deferred tax assets.

Product revenue increased $24.5 million, or 34.9%, in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007, largely driven by increased sales of our higher-end products, consisting of our FortiGate-1000 to 5000 series, to large enterprises and service providers. While there were no material price changes between the periods, the shift in product mix towards our higher-end products had the effect of increasing our average sales price. In addition we experienced modest overall growth in sales volume. Services revenue increased $31.1 million, or 42.0%, due to an increase in our installed customer base. The modest growth in ratable product and services revenue was due to the incremental amortization of new ratable product and services sales. 67 Table of Contents Cost of revenue and gross margin Fiscal Year $ Change % Change 2008 2007 (dollars in thousands) Cost of revenue Product $ 41,397 $ 35,948 $ 5,449 15.2 % Services 19,441 15,941 3,500 22.0 Ratable product and services 4,634 4,763 (129 ) (2.7 ) Total cost of revenue $ 65,472 $ 56,652 $ 8,820 15.6 % Gross margin Product 56.2 % 48.7 % 7.5 % Services 81.5 78.5 3.0 Ratable product and services 61.1 57.0 4.1 Total gross margin 69.1 63.5 5.6 Total gross margin increased 5.6 percentage points in fiscal 2008 primarily due to improving product margins based on enhanced inventory management and a higher mix of services revenue. The 7.5 percentage point increase in product gross margin in fiscal 2008 was primarily due to a $6.3 million excess inventory write-off taken in fiscal 2007 which reduced product gross margin by approximately 9.0 percentage points in fiscal 2007. The 3.0 percentage point increase in services gross margin in fiscal 2008 was primarily due to higher revenue and a larger customer base which enabled us to leverage our support cost structure. Services cost increased $3.5 million in fiscal 2008 primarily due to an increase of $2.5 million in cash-based personnel costs resulting from increased headcount in our threat research centers and in our technical support centers in both the EMEA and Americas regions. Additional costs included a $0.4 million increase in stock-based compensation expense and $0.5 million of higher facility-related expenses to support the additional staffing requirements. Ratable gross margin increased in accordance with the respective product and services gross margin increases.

See Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Stock-Based Compensation. Research and development expense Research and development expense increased $9.4 million, or 34.2%, in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007, primarily due to an increase of $8.1 million in cash-based personnel costs as a result of increased headcount, an increase of $0.7 million in higher external test and certification costs and an increase of $0.7 million for rent and occupancy-related expenses. These increases were partially offset by a $0.4 million decrease in stock-based compensation expense. Sales and marketing expense Sales and marketing expense increased $15.6 million, or 21.6%, in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007, primarily due to increased cash-based personnel costs of $12.2 million resulting from increased headcount in an effort to help drive our overall revenue growth. In fiscal 2008 we also had $2.5 million in additional promotional and other marketing-related expenses, $1.3 million of incremental rent and occupancy-related expenses and $0.5 million from increased travel expenses. These increases were partially offset by a $1.4 million decrease in stock-based compensation expense. As a result, sales and marketing expense as a percent of revenue decreased 5.0 percentage points in fiscal 2008. 68 Table of Contents General and administrative expense The $3.9 million decrease in general and administrative expense was primarily due to $3.6 million in lower external accounting and legal services expenses in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 when we made investments in the automation of our financial processes. Cash-based personnel costs increased $1.2 million as we incurred the full year costs from increased headcount in fiscal 2007 to support our growth and bad debt expense of $0.2 million, offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation expense of $1.7 million. As a result, general and administrative expense as a percent of revenue decreased 5.3 percentage points in fiscal 2008. 69 Table of Contents Interest income and other income (expense), net Fiscal Year $ Change % Change 2008 2007 (dollars in thousands) Interest income $ 2,614 $ 3,507 $ (893 ) (25.5 )% Other income (expense), net 1,710 (1,991 ) 3,701 * * not meaningful The $0.9 million decrease in interest income in fiscal 2008 was due to lower interest rates earned, despite higher balances of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. The gain in fiscal 2008 in other income (expense), net was the result of an increase in foreign exchange gains primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Euro, British Pound and the Canadian dollar.

The provision for income taxes for fiscal 2008 is comprised primarily of foreign income taxes and state taxes. We incurred tax expense despite a consolidated loss before income taxes for fiscal 2007 primarily due to foreign income taxes paid based on profits realized by our foreign subsidiaries. The increase in the provision for income taxes for fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 was attributable to an increase in state income taxes due to improved results in fiscal 2008, offset by a reduction in foreign income tax expense driven by the realization of certain foreign tax credits. Quarterly Results of Operations The following table set forth unaudited quarterly statements of operations data for the last eight fiscal quarters. The information for each of these quarters has been prepared on the same basis as the audited annual financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report and, in the opinion of management, includes all adjustments, which includes only normal recurring adjustments, necessary for the fair presentation of the results of operations for these periods. This data should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report.

In general, a pattern of increased customer buying at year-end has positively impacted sales activity in the fourth quarter, which can make it difficult to achieve sequential growth in the first quarter. Our product revenue in the third quarter has also been negatively affected by reduced economic activity in the summer months, particularly in Europe. Similarly, our gross margins and operating income have been affected by these historical trends because expenses are relatively fixed in the near-term. Although these seasonal factors are common in the technology sector, historical patterns should not be considered a reliable indicator of our future sales activity or performance. On a quarterly basis, we have usually generated the majority of our product revenue in the final month of each quarter and a significant amount in the last two weeks of a quarter. We believe this is due to customer buying patterns typical in this industry. Our total quarterly revenue has increased sequentially during seven of the last eight quarters. Although a significant volume of shipments occurs towards the end of each of our quarterly reporting periods, including during the quarter ended December 31, 2009, management believes that the transition from a fiscal quarter ending on the Sunday closest to the calendar quarter end to a calendar quarter end basis (which transition added three days to the quarter ended September 30, 2009), did not materially impact our product revenue as we manage our quarter end sales cycle based on our financial reporting period end. We believe the declines in the third quarter of fiscal 2008 and in Europe in the third quarter of fiscal 2009 are based on seasonality as discussed above. Product revenue in each of the first two quarters of fiscal 2009 was essentially flat compared to the same periods in fiscal 2008, which we believe was due in part to adverse global economic conditions. Additionally, product revenue was lower in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 due to a delay in the availability of a new product which delayed revenue recognition on orders until the second quarter of fiscal 2009. Services revenue has generally increased sequentially each quarter, as new support and subscription contracts have been entered into, and existing customers have renewed their contracts. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, product revenue increased 12% compared to the same period in the prior year, due to increased product sales in all three regions and, in particular, increased sales to enterprise and service provider customers. Services revenue in the fourth quarter of 2009 increased by 25% compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, due to recognition of revenue from our growing deferred revenue balance as our subscription and support services were sold to a larger customer base. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, we also benefited from an additional day of amortization of approximately $0.4 million due to the change in our reporting period discussed above.

Product gross margins in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 decreased due to higher discounts and a $0.5 million write-off for excess and obsolete inventory that we incurred in that period. Product gross margins in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 also decreased due to asset acquisition related costs of $1.7 million. Services gross margins have increased or remained relatively flat from the first quarter of fiscal 2008 through the third quarter of fiscal 2009 due to higher revenue and a larger customer base over which to spread related costs. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, services gross margin decreased due to an increase in headcount as we continue to invest in support personnel.

In November 2009, we completed our initial public offering and raised net proceeds of $87.4 million. At December 31, 2009, our cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments of $260.3 million were held for working-capital purposes and were invested primarily in money market funds, commercial paper, corporate debt securities and U.S. government debt securities. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next twelve months. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our growth rate, the timing and extent of spending to support development efforts, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the introduction of new and enhanced products and services offerings, the costs to ensure access to adequate manufacturing capacity and the continuing market acceptance of our products. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected. Operating Activities In fiscal 2009, operating activities provided $62.0 million in cash as a result of net income of $60.2 million, decreased by non-cash items such as the tax benefit from the release of our valuation allowance of $30.2 million, excess tax benefit from employee stock option plans of $1.6 million; increased by stock-based compensation amounts of $7.5 million, depreciation and amortization amounts of $5.9 million, write-off of intangible assets of $2.4 million, and amortization of investment premiums of $0.8 million. Changes in operating assets and liabilities provided $16.9 million in cash. Sources of cash totaled $38.7 million and were related to a $30.3 million increase in deferred revenue which was attributable primarily to increased sales of our subscription and support services, a $3.0 million increase in accounts payable due to timing of payments, a $2.8 million increase in accrued liabilities and accrued payroll and compensation primarily related to increased headcount, and a $2.6 million increase in taxes payable. Uses of cash totaled $21.8 million and were related to a $9.6 million increase in deferred tax assets, a $8.5 million increase in accounts receivable due to the overall growth of our business, a $1.1 million increase in deferred cost of revenue related to the increase in ratable products and services deferred revenue, a $2.0 million increase in inventory, and a $0.6 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets. In fiscal 2008, operating activities provided $37.7 million in cash as a result of net income of $7.4 million, increased by non-cash items such as depreciation and amortization amounts of $4.2 million and stock-based compensation amounts of $5.3 million.

Changes in operating assets and liabilities provided $36.0 million in cash. Sources of cash totaled $48.2 million and were related to a $37.9 million increase in deferred revenue which was attributable to increased sales of our subscription and support services, an $8.6 million increase in accrued liabilities and accrued payroll and compensation primarily related to increased headcount, and $0.9 million and $0.5 million increases in accounts payable and income taxes payable, respectively. Uses of cash totaled $12.2 million and were related to a $6.6 million increase in inventory which relates to the growth of our business, a $2.3 million increase in accounts receivable due to the overall growth of our business offset by a 13 day decrease (from 70 to 57 days) in days sales outstanding driven primarily by improved collections experience, a $1.8 million increase in deferred cost of revenue which relates to the increase in ratable products and services deferred revenue, and a $1.2 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets. Investing Activities Our investing activities consisted primarily of purchases and sales of short-term investments associated with our investment balances and capital expenditures. The $13.8 million of cash provided by investing activities during fiscal 2009 was due primarily to net maturities of short-term investments of $18.9 million. Additionally, we used cash of $4.6 million for capital expenditures and $0.5 million for the purchase of certain technology assets. The $53.7 million of cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2008 was due primarily to $48.8 million in net purchases of short-term investments.

The $2.3 million of cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2007 related to capital expenditures of $2.0 million and $0.3 million in net purchases of short-term investments. 75 Table of Contents Financing Activities Our financing activities in fiscal 2009 resulted in net cash provided of $78.0 million as a result of receiving proceeds of $88.3 million, net of issuance costs paid of $2.4 million, from the sale of common stock in connection with our initial public offering in November 2009. In addition, we received proceeds of $4.0 million from the exercise of warrants and stock options to purchase our common stock and had an in excess tax benefit from employee stock option plans of $1.6 million, all partially offset by $15.8 million related to the repurchase of our preferred and common stock in the first half of fiscal 2009. Our financing activities in fiscal 2008 related to proceeds of $2.1 million, as a result of exercises of stock options to purchase our common stock. We had no material financing activities in 2007. Contractual Obligations and Commitments The following summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2009: Payments Due by Period Total Less Than 1 Year 1-3 Years 4-5 Years More Than 5 Years (in thousands) Operating leases (1) $ 18,422 $ 6,220 $ 10,850 $ 1,352 $ Purchase commitments (2) 11,797 11,797 Royalty commitments (3) 7,000 3,000 3,000 1,000 Total (4) $ 37,219 $ 21,017 $ 13,850 $ 2,352 $ (1) Consists of contractual obligations from non-cancelable office space under operating leases.

As of December 31, 2009, we had approximately $3.4 million of tax liabilities, including interest, related to uncertain tax positions. Because of the high degree of uncertainty regarding the settlement of these liabilities, we are unable to estimate the years in which future cash outflows may occur. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements During fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated organizations or financial partnerships, such as structured finance or special purpose entities that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.
