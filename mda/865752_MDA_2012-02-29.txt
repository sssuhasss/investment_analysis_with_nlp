ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A ) is provided as a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the accompanying notes ( Notes ) included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based on management current expectations, estimates and projections about our business and operations. Our actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated and expressed in such forward-looking statements. See Forward-Looking Statements and Part I. Item 1A Risk Factors. This overview provides our perspective on the individual sections of MD&A. MD&A includes the following sections: Our Business a general description of our business; the value drivers of our business; and opportunities and risks facing our Company; Results of Operations an analysis of our consolidated results of operations for the three years presented in our financial statements; Liquidity and Capital Resources an analysis of our cash flows, sources and uses of cash and contractual obligations; Accounting Policies and Pronouncements a discussion of accounting policies that require critical judgments and estimates including newly issued accounting pronouncements; Sales details of our sales measured on a quarterly basis in both dollars and cases; Inflation information about the impact that inflation may or may not have on our results; Forward-Looking Statements cautionary information about forward-looking statements and a description of certain risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the Company historical results or our current expectations or projections; and Market Risks information about market risks and risk management. (See Forward-Looking Statements and Part II, Item 7A Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures About Market Risks ). Our Business Overview We develop, market, sell and distribute alternative beverage category beverages primarily under the following brand names: Monster Energy Hansen Monster Rehab Hansen Natural Soda Monster Energy Extra Strength Nitrous Technology Junior Juice Java Monster Blue Sky X-Presso Monster Hubert Worx Energy Vidration Peace Tea 34 Table of Contents Our Monster Energy drinks, which represented 91.2%, 89.9% and 90.0% of our net sales for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, include the following: Monster Energy Java Monster Kona Blend Lo-Carb Monster Energy Java Monster Loca Moca Monster Energy Assault Java Monster Mean Bean Monster Khaos Java Monster Vanilla Light Monster M-80 (named RIPPER in certain countries) Java Monster Irish Blend Monster MIXXD Java Monster Toffee Monster Energy Absolutely Zero Monster Energy Extra Strength Nitrous Monster Energy Import Technology Super Dry Monster Energy Import Light Monster Energy Extra Strength Nitrous Monster Energy Dub Edition Technology Anti-Gravity Monster Rehab Tea + Lemonade + Energy Monster Energy Extra Strength Nitrous Monster Rehab Rojo Tea + Energy Technology Killer B Monster Rehab Green Tea + Energy Monster Energy Extra Strength Nitrous Monster Rehab Protean + Energy Technology Black Ice Monster Energy M3 Super Concentrate X-Presso Monster Hammer X-Presso Monster Midnite We have two reportable segments, namely Direct Store Delivery ( DSD ), whose principal products comprise energy drinks, and Warehouse ( Warehouse ), whose principal products comprise juice based and soda beverages. The DSD segment develops, markets and sells products primarily through an exclusive distributor network, whereas the Warehouse segment develops, markets and sells products primarily direct to retailers. During the year ended December 31, 2011, we continued to expand our existing product lines and flavors and further developed our markets. In particular, we continued to focus on developing and marketing beverages that fall within the category generally described as the alternative beverage category. During the year ended December 31, 2011, we introduced the following products: Monster Rehab Tea + Lemonade + Energy, a non-carbonated rehydration energy drink (February 2011). Peace Tea Caddy Shack , a non-carbonated tea + lemonade drink (February 2011). Monster Rehab Rojo Tea + Energy, a non-carbonated rehydration energy drink (October 2011). Monster Rehab Green Tea + Energy, a non-carbonated rehydration energy drink (October 2011). Monster Rehab Protean + Energy, a non-carbonated protein rehydration energy drink (October 2011). Hubert Half & Half, a line of premium ready-to-drink lemonade + teas (October 2011). Angeleno Aguas Fresca, a line of premium ready-to-drink aguas frescas (December 2011). Our gross sales* of $1,950.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 represented record annual sales. The vast majority of our gross sales are derived from our Monster Energy brand energy drinks. Gross sales of our Monster Energy brand energy drinks were $1,788.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, an increase of $446.7 million, or 96.7% of our overall increase in gross sales for the year ended December 31, 2011. Any decrease in gross sales of our Monster Energy brand energy drinks could have a significant adverse effect on our future revenues and net income. Competitive pressure in the energy drink category could also adversely affect our operating results. 35 Table of Contents Our gross sales of $1,488.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 were negatively impacted by advance purchases made by our customers in the 2009 fourth quarter due to our announcement of a new per case marketing contribution program for our Monster Energy distributors commencing January 1, 2010, as well as to avoid potential interruptions in product supply due to our announcement to transition our North American operations to the SAP enterprise resource planning system commencing January 2010 (the Advance Purchases ). We previously estimated that gross sales for the three-months ended December 31, 2009 were increased by approximately 4% to 6% as a result of the Advance Purchases. We did not limit the amount of our customers purchases during the fourth quarter of 2009. Our DSD segment represented 94.4%, 93.0% and 91.4% of our consolidated net sales for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Our Warehouse segment represented 5.6%, 7.0% and 8.6% of our consolidated net sales for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Competitive pressure in the energy drink category could adversely affect our operating results. Our sales and marketing strategy for all our beverages is to focus our efforts on developing brand awareness through image enhancing programs and product sampling. We use our branded vehicles and other promotional vehicles at events where we offer samples of our products to consumers. We utilize push-pull methods to enhance shelf and display space exposure in sales outlets (including advertising, in-store promotions and in-store placement of point-of-sale materials, racks, coolers and barrel coolers) to enhance demand from consumers for our products. We also support our brands with prize promotions, price promotions, competitions, endorsements from selected public and extreme sports figures, personality endorsements (including from television and other well known sports personalities), coupons, sampling and sponsorship of selected causes, events, athletes and teams. In-store posters, outdoor posters, print, radio and television advertising and coupons, may also be used to promote our brands. We believe that one of the keys to success in the beverage industry is differentiation, making our brands and products visually distinctive from other beverages on the shelves of retailers. We review our products and packaging on an ongoing basis and, where practical, endeavor to make them different, better and unique. The labels and graphics for many of our products are redesigned from time to time to maximize their visibility and identification, wherever they may be placed in stores, which we will continue to reevaluate from time to time. All of our beverage products are manufactured by various third party bottlers and co-packers situated throughout the United States and abroad, under separate arrangements with each party. Our growth strategy includes expanding our international business. Gross sales to customers outside the United States amounted to $381.0 million, $240.6 million and $168.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Such sales were approximately 20%, 16% and 13% of gross sales for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Gross sales to customers in EMEA (Europe, the Middle East and Africa) for the year ended December 31, 2011 were 87.5% higher than gross sales in EMEA for the year ended December 31, 2010. Our customers are primarily full service beverage distributors, retail grocery and specialty chains, wholesalers, club stores, drug chains, mass merchandisers, convenience chains, health food distributors, food service customers and the military. Gross sales to our various customer types for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 are reflected below. Such information reflects sales made by us directly to the customer types concerned, which include our full service beverage distributors in the United States. Such full service beverage distributors in turn sell certain of our products to the same customer types listed below. We do not have complete details of such full service distributors sales of our products to their respective customers and therefore limit our description of our customer types to include only our sales to such full service distributors without reference to such distributor sales to their own customers. 36 Table of Contents 2011 2010 2009 Full service distributors 64% 64% 66% Club stores, drug chains & mass merchandisers 10% 12% 12% Outside the U.S. 20% 16% 13% Retail grocery, specialty chains and wholesalers 4% 6% 6% Other 2% 2% 3% On October 2, 2010, TCCC completed its acquisition of the North American business operations of CCE, through a merger with a wholly owned subsidiary of TCCC. The surviving wholly owned subsidiary was subsequently renamed CCR, and currently distributes certain of our products in those portions of the United States in which CCE previously distributed certain of our products. Concurrently with this acquisition, New CCE was formed, which currently distributes certain of our products in Great Britain, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Monaco and Sweden (Sweden was added during the first quarter of 2011). Our customers include the TCCC North American Bottlers, Wal-Mart, Inc. (including Sam Club), the AB Distributors, Coca-Cola Hellenic, Kalil Bottling Group, Trader Joe s, John Lenore & Company, Swire Coca-Cola, Costco, SUPERVALU INC, The Kroger Co. and Safeway, Inc. A decision by any large customer to decrease amounts purchased from us or to cease carrying our products could have a material negative effect on our financial condition and consolidated results of operations. CCR accounted for approximately 29% of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2011. CCE, which included their operations in the U.S. for the relevant periods (see distribution agreement (g) in Item 1 Business Distribution Agreements ), accounted for approximately 28% and 27% our net sales for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. We continue to incur expenditures in connection with the development and introduction of new products and flavors. Value Drivers of our Business We believe that the key value drivers of our business include the following: Profitable Growth We believe functional , image based and/or better for you brands properly supported by marketing and innovation, targeted to a broad consumer base, drive profitable growth. We continue to broaden our family of brands. In particular, we are expanding our energy drinks and specialty beverages to provide more alternatives to consumers. We are focused on maintaining profit margins and believe that tailored branding, packaging, pricing and distribution channel strategies help achieve profitable growth. We are implementing these strategies with a view to continuing profitable growth. International The profitable introduction and development of our Monster Energy brand internationally remains a key value driver for our corporate growth. Cost Management The principal focus of cost management will continue to be on reducing input supply and production costs on a per-case basis, including raw material costs and co-packing fees. Another key area of focus is to decrease promotional allowances, selling and general and administrative costs, including sponsorships, sampling, promotional and marketing expenses, as a percentage of net sales. The reduction of accounts receivable and inventory days on hand also remains a further key area of focus. 37 Table of Contents Efficient Capital Structure Our capital structure is intended to optimize our working capital to finance expansion, both domestically and internationally. We believe our strong capital position, our ability to raise funds, if necessary, at low effective cost and low overall costs of borrowings provide a competitive advantage. We believe that, subject to increases in the costs of certain raw materials being contained, these value drivers, when properly implemented in the U.S. and internationally, will result in: (1) maintaining our product gross profit margins; (2) providing additional leverage over time through reduced expenses as a percentage of net operating revenues; and (3) optimizing our cost of capital. The ultimate measure of success is and will be reflected in our current and future results of operations. Gross and net sales, gross profits, operating income, net income and net income per share represent key measurements of the above value drivers. These measurements will continue to be a key management focus in 2012 and beyond ( See Part II, Item 7 Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2011 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2010 ). As of December 31, 2011, the Company had working capital of $916.6 million compared to $769.3 million as of December 31, 2010. The increase in working capital was primarily the result of retained profits reflected in an overall increase in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. For the year ended December 31, 2011, our net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $333.8 million as compared to $229.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. Principal uses of cash flows in 2011 were purchases of investments, repurchases of our common stock, purchases of inventory, development of our Monster Energy brand internationally, acquisition of property and equipment and acquisition of trademarks. These principal uses of cash flows are expected to be and remain our principal recurring use of cash and working capital funds in the future (See Part II, Item 7 Liquidity and Capital Resources ). Opportunities, Challenges and Risks Looking forward, our management has identified certain challenges and risks that demand the attention of the beverage industry and our Company. Uncertainty and volatility in domestic and international economic markets could negatively affect both the stability of our industry and our Company. Our growth strategy includes expanding our international business which exposes us to risks inherent in conducting international operations (See Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors ). Decreased consumer discretionary spending represents a challenge to the successful marketing and purchase of our products. Increases in consumer and regulatory awareness of the health problems arising from obesity and inactive lifestyles continue to represent a challenge. We recognize that obesity is a complex and serious public health problem. Our commitment to consumers begins with our broad product line and a wide selection of diet, light and low carbohydrate beverages, juices and juice drinks, waters and energy drinks. We continuously strive to meet changing consumer needs through beverage innovation, choice and variety. Our historical success is attributable, in part, to our introduction of different and innovative beverages. Our future success will depend, in part, upon our continued ability to develop and introduce different and innovative beverages, although there can be no assurance of our ability to do so. In order to retain and expand our market share, we must continue to develop and introduce different and innovative beverages and be competitive in the areas of quality, health, method of distribution, brand image and intellectual property protection. The beverage industry is subject to changing consumer preferences that may adversely affect us if we misjudge such preferences. 38 Table of Contents In addition, other key challenges and risks that could impact our Company future financial results include, but are not limited to: changes in consumer preferences and demand for our products; economic uncertainty in the United States, Europe and other countries in which we operate; the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; maintenance of our brand image and product quality; profitable expansion and growth of our family of brands in the competitive market place (See Part I, Item 1 Business - Competition and Sales and Marketing ); costs of establishing and promoting our brands internationally; restrictions on imports and sources of supply; duties or tariffs; changes in government regulations; protection of our existing intellectual property portfolio of trademarks and copyrights and the continuous pursuit to develop and protect new and innovative trademarks and copyrights for our expanding product lines; limitations on available quantities of certain package containers such as the 12-ounce and 24-ounce cap-can, the 18.6-ounce BRE can, the 32-ounce can, and co-packing availability; the imposition of additional regulatory restrictions; increasing concern over obesity and changes in regulation and consumer preferences in response to those concerns; and legislation that would limit or restrict the sale of energy drinks to minors and/or persons below a specified age and/or the venues in which energy drinks can be sold and/or impose taxation of the sale of energy drinks. See Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors for additional information about risks and uncertainties facing our Company. We believe that the following opportunities exist for us: growth potential of the energy drink category, both domestically and internationally; growth potential of other segments of the alternative beverage category including sparkling beverages, carbonated soft drinks, ready-to-drink iced teas, juice drinks and enhanced waters; planned and future new product and product line introductions with the objective of contributing to higher profitability; the introduction of premium packages designed to generate strong revenue growth; significant package, pricing and channel opportunities to increase profitable growth; effective strategic positioning to capitalize on industry growth; broadening distribution/expansion opportunities in both domestic and international markets; launching our products into new geographic markets; and continued focus on reducing our cost base. 39 Table of Contents Results of Operations (in thousands, except per share information) Percentage Change 2011 2010 2009 11 vs. 10 10 vs. 09 Gross sales, net of discounts & returns* $ 1,950,490 $ 1,488,516 $ 1,309,335 31.0% 13.7% Less: Promotional and other allowances** 247,260 184,574 166,036 34.0% 11.2% Net sales 1,703,230 1,303,942 1,143,299 30.6% 14.1% Cost of sales 808,921 623,702 530,983 29.7% 17.5% Gross profit*** 894,309 680,240 612,316 31.5% 11.1% Gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales 52.5% 52.2% 53.6% Operating expenses 437,886 332,426 275,007 31.7% 20.9% Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales 25.7% 25.5% 24.1% Operating income 456,423 347,814 337,309 31.2% 3.1% Operating income as a percentage of net sales 26.8% 26.7% 29.5% Other income (expense): Interest and other income, net 1,619 2,246 2,273 (27.9% ) (1.2% ) Loss on investments and put option, net (772 ) (758 ) (3,887 ) 1.8% (80.5% ) Total other income (expense) 847 1,488 (1,614 ) Income before provision for income taxes 457,270 349,302 335,695 30.9% 4.1% Provision for income taxes 171,051 137,273 126,979 24.6% 8.1% Net income $ 286,219 $ 212,029 $ 208,716 35.0% 1.6% Net income as a percentage of net sales 16.8% 16.3% 18.3% Net income per common share : Basic $1.62 $1.20 $1.16 35.6% 3.3% Diluted $1.53 $1.14 $1.10 34.5% 3.4% Case sales (in thousands) (in 192-ounce case equivalents) 164,661 129,031 109,985 27.6% 17.3% Stock Split - On January 11, 2012, the Company announced that its Board of Directors had approved a two-for-one stock split of its common stock (the stock split ) to be effected in the form of a 100% stock dividend. The stock dividend was issued on February 15, 2012. Net income per common share has been adjusted retroactively to reflect the stock split. (See Part II, Item 8, Note 1 in our consolidated financial statements). *Gross sales is used internally by management as an indicator of and to monitor operating performance, including sales performance of particular products, salesperson performance, product growth or declines and overall Company performance. The use of gross sales allows evaluation of sales performance before the effect of any promotional items, which can mask certain performance issues. We therefore believe that the presentation of gross 40 Table of Contents sales provides a useful measure of our operating performance. Gross sales is not a measure that is recognized under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net sales, which is determined in accordance with GAAP, and should not be used alone as an indicator of operating performance in place of net sales. Additionally, gross sales may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies, as gross sales has been defined by our internal reporting practices. In addition, gross sales may not be realized in the form of cash receipts as promotional payments and allowances may be deducted from payments received from certain customers. (See Part II, Item 6 Selected Financial Data ). ** Although the expenditures described in this line item are determined in accordance with GAAP and meet GAAP requirements, the disclosure thereof does not conform with GAAP presentation requirements. Additionally, our definition of promotional and other allowances may not be comparable to similar items presented by other companies. The presentation of promotional and other allowances facilitates an evaluation of their impact on the determination of net sales and the spending levels incurred or correlated with such sales. Promotional and other allowances constitute a material portion of our marketing activities. ***Gross profit may not be comparable to that of other entities since some entities include all costs associated with their distribution process in cost of sales, whereas others exclude certain costs and instead include such costs within another line item such as operating expenses. We include out-bound freight and warehouse costs in operating expenses rather than in cost of sales. Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2011 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2010. Gross Sales. Gross sales were $1,950.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, an increase of approximately $462.0 million, or 31.0% higher than gross sales of $1,488.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase in the gross sales of our Monster Energy brand energy drinks represented approximately $446.7 million, or 96.7%, of the overall increase in gross sales. Gross sales of our Monster Energy brand energy drinks increased primarily due to increased sales by volume as a result of increased consumer demand in both our existing domestic and international markets as well as our expansion into new international markets. Pricing changes did not have a material impact on the increase in gross sales. No other individual product line contributed either a material increase or decrease to gross sales for the year ended December 31, 2011. Promotional and other allowances were $247.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, an increase of $62.7 million, or 34.0% higher than promotional and other allowances of $184.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. Promotional and other allowances as a percentage of gross sales increased to 12.7% from 12.4% for the year ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. As a result, the percentage increase in gross sales for the year ended December 31, 2011 was higher than the percentage increase in net sales. Net Sales. Net sales were $1,703.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, an increase of approximately $399.3 million, or 30.6% higher than net sales of $1,303.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase in net sales of our Monster Energy brand energy drinks represented approximately $380.0 million, or 95.2%, of the overall increase in net sales. Net sales of our Monster Energy brand energy drinks increased primarily due to increased sales by volume as a result of increased consumer demand in both our existing domestic and international markets as well as our expansion into new international markets. Pricing changes did not have a material impact on the increase in net sales. No other individual product line contributed either a material increase or decrease to net sales for the year ended December 31, 2011. Case sales, in 192-ounce case equivalents, were 164.7 million cases for the year ended December 31, 2011, an increase of approximately 35.6 million cases or 27.6% higher than case sales of 129.0 million cases for the year ended December 31, 2010. The overall average net sales per case increased to $10.34 for the year ended December 31, 2011, which was 2.4% higher than the average net sales per case of $10.11 for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase in the average net sales per case was attributable to an increase in the proportion of case sales derived from higher priced products, primarily our Monster Energy brand energy drinks. 41 Table of Contents Net sales for the DSD segment were $1,608.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, an increase of approximately $395.7 million, or 32.6% higher than net sales of $1,212.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase in the net sales of our Monster Energy brand energy drinks represented approximately $380.0 million, or 96.0%, of the overall increase in net sales for the DSD segment. Net sales for the DSD segment of our Monster Energy brand energy drinks increased primarily due to increased sales by volume as a result of increased consumer demand in both our existing domestic and international markets as well as our expansion into new international markets. Pricing changes did not have a material impact on the increase in net sales for the DSD segment. No other individual product line contributed either a material increase or decrease to net sales for the DSD segment for the year ended December 31, 2011. Net sales for the Warehouse segment were $94.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, an increase of approximately $3.6 million, or 4.0% higher than net sales of $91.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase in net sales for the Warehouse segment was primarily attributable to decreased promotional and other allowances. Gross Profit. Gross profit was $894.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, an increase of approximately $214.1 million, or 31.5% higher than the gross profit of $680.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased slightly to 52.5% for the year ended December 31, 2011 from 52.2% for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase in gross profit dollars was primarily the result of the $446.7 million increase in gross sales of our Monster Energy brand energy drinks. Operating Expenses . Total operating expenses were $437.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, an increase of approximately $105.5 million, or 31.7% higher than total operating expenses of $332.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase in operating expenses was partially attributable to increased payroll expenses of $14.3 million, increased out-bound freight and warehouse costs of $13.9 million, increased expenditures of $13.6 million for sponsorships and endorsements, increased expenditures of $13.0 million for advertising, increased expenditures of $12.3 million for allocated trade development, increased expenditures of $10.5 million for commissions, increased expenditures for promotional items of $7.1 million, increased expenditures of $6.5 million for merchandise displays, increased expenditures of $3.6 million for samples and increased expenditures of $10.7 million for other operating expenses. Total operating expenses as a percentage of net sales was 25.7% for the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to 25.5% for the year ended December 31, 2010. Contribution Margin. Contribution margin for the DSD segment was $543.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, an increase of approximately $106.5 million, or 24.4% higher than the contribution margin of $436.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase in the contribution margin for the DSD segment was primarily the result of the $380.0 million increase in net sales of our Monster Energy brand energy drinks. Contribution margin for the Warehouse segment was $4.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, approximately $5.1 million higher than the contribution margin of ($0.8) million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase in the contribution margin for the Warehouse segment was primarily attributable to decreased promotional and other allowances and lower selling expenses. Operating Income. Operating income was $456.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, an increase of approximately $108.6 million, or 31.2% higher than operating income of $347.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. Operating income as a percentage of net sales was 26.8% and 26.7% for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The increase in operating income was primarily due to an increase in gross profit of $214.1 million, partially offset by a $105.5 million increase in operating expenses. Operating income was negatively affected by combined operating losses of $15.4 million and $9.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, in relation to our new and existing markets in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Australasia and South America. 42 Table of Contents Other Income (Expense) . Other income (expense) was $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, a decrease of $0.6 million from $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. This decrease was primarily attributable to an increase in foreign currency losses. Provision for Income Taxes . Provision for income taxes was $171.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, an increase of $33.8 million or 24.6% higher than the provision for income taxes of $137.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The effective combined federal, state and foreign tax rate decreased to 37.4% from 39.3% for the year ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily the result of a lower effective combined state tax rate and the establishment of a full valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets of a foreign subsidiary established during the second fiscal quarter of 2010. The decrease in the effective tax rate was partially offset by the increase in the reserve for certain uncertain tax benefits. Net Income . Net income was $286.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, an increase of $74.2 million or 35.0% higher than net income of $212.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase in net income was primarily attributable to an increase in gross profit of $214.1 million. The increase in net income was partially offset by an increase in operating expenses of $105.5 million and an increase in the provision for income taxes of $33.8 million. Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2010 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2009. Gross Sales. Gross sales were $1,488.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of approximately $179.2 million, or 13.7% higher than gross sales of $1,309.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase in the gross sales of our Monster Energy brand energy drinks represented approximately $162.1 million, or 90.5%, of the overall increase in gross sales. Gross sales of our Monster Energy brand energy drinks increased primarily due to increased sales by volume as a result of increased consumer demand in both our existing domestic and international markets, as well as our expansion into new international markets. Pricing changes did not have a material impact on the increase in gross sales. No other individual product line contributed either a material increase or decrease to gross sales for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase in gross sales was negatively affected by the Advance Purchases made by customers in the 2009 fourth quarter. Promotional and other allowances were $184.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of $18.5 million, or 11.2% higher than promotional and other allowances of $166.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Promotional and other allowances as a percentage of gross sales decreased to 12.4% from 12.7% for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. As a result, the percentage increase in gross sales for the year ended December 31, 2010 was lower than the percentage increase in net sales. Net Sales. Net sales were $1,303.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of approximately $160.6 million, or 14.1% higher than net sales of $1,143.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase in net sales of our Monster Energy brand energy drinks represented approximately $143.3 million, or 89.2%, of the overall increase in net sales. Net sales of our Monster Energy brand energy drinks increased primarily due to increased sales by volume as a result of increased consumer demand in both our existing domestic and international markets, as well as our expansion into new international markets. Pricing changes did not have a material impact on the increase in net sales. No other individual product line contributed either a material increase or decrease to net sales for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase in net sales was negatively affected by the Advance Purchases made by customers in the 2009 fourth quarter. 43 Table of Contents Case sales, in 192-ounce case equivalents, were 129.0 million cases for the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of approximately 19.0 million cases or 17.3% higher than case sales of 110.0 million cases for the year ended December 31, 2009. The average net sales price per case decreased to $10.11 for the year ended December 31, 2010 which was 2.8% lower than the average net sales price per case of $10.40 for the year ended December 31, 2009. The decrease in the average net sales price per case was attributable to an increase in the proportion of case sales derived from lower priced products and geographic mix. Net sales for the DSD segment were $1,212.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of approximately $167.5 million, or 16.0% higher than net sales of $1,045.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase in the net sales of our Monster Energy brand energy drinks represented approximately $143.3 million, or 85.5%, of the overall increase in net sales for the DSD segment. Net sales for the DSD segment of our Monster Energy brand energy drinks increased primarily due to increased sales by volume as a result of increased consumer demand in both our existing domestic and international markets as well as our expansion into new international markets. Pricing changes did not have a material impact on the increase in net sales for our DSD segment. No other individual product line contributed either a material increase or decrease to net sales for our DSD segment for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase in net sales for the DSD segment was negatively affected by the Advance Purchases made by customers in the 2009 fourth quarter. Net sales for the Warehouse segment were $91.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, a decrease of approximately $6.9 million, or 7.0% lower than net sales of $98.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The decrease in net sales for the Warehouse segment was primarily attributable to decreased sales by volume of apple juice and Rumba , Samba and Tango energy juices as well as increased promotional allowances. The decrease in net sales for the Warehouse segment was partially offset by increased sales by volume of our juice blends. Gross Profit. Gross profit was $680.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of approximately $67.9 million, or 11.1% higher than the gross profit of $612.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to 52.2% for the year ended December 31, 2010 from 53.6% for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase in gross profit dollars was primarily the result of the $162.1 million increase in gross sales of our Monster Energy brand energy drinks. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to production variances and increased costs of goods including the costs of raw materials in the DSD and Warehouse segments as well as product mix and geographic mix. Operating Expenses . Total operating expenses were $332.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of approximately $57.4 million, or 20.9% higher than total operating expenses of $275.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Total operating expenses as a percentage of net sales was 25.5% for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to 24.1% for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase in operating expenses was partially attributable to increased payroll expenses of $15.0 million (of which $2.8 million was related to an increase in stock-based compensation) and increased expenditures of $13.4 million for professional service fees, including legal and accounting costs. Expenditures for professional service fees, including legal and accounting costs and SAP implementation costs for the year ended December 31, 2010 were $21.5 million as compared to $8.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 (the 2009 comparative period included a $4.7 million credit related to reimbursements to the Company of legal expenses previously paid by the Company). In addition, the increase in operating expenses was partially attributable to increased expenditures of $11.2 million for sponsorships and endorsements, increased out-bound freight and warehouse costs of $9.6 million, increased expenditures of $6.2 million for point-of-sale materials, increased expenditures of $4.5 million for allocated trade development, increased depreciation expense of $1.6 million and increased expenditures of $2.2 million for other operating expenses. The increase in operating expenses was partially offset by decreased expenditures of $1.6 million related to the costs associated with distributor terminations, decreased expenditures of $1.7 million for advertising, decreased expenditures of $1.5 million for samples and decreased expenditures of $1.5 million for commissions. 44 Table of Contents Contribution Margin. Contribution margin for the DSD segment was $436.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of approximately $45.0 million, or 11.5% higher than contribution margin of $391.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase in the contribution margin for the DSD segment was primarily the result of the $162.1 million increase in net sales of our Monster Energy brand energy drinks. Contribution margin for the Warehouse segment was ($0.8) million for the year ended December 31, 2010, approximately $4.4 million lower than contribution margin of $3.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The decrease in the contribution margin for the Warehouse segment was primarily attributable to decreased net sales, increased off-invoice and promotional allowances and increased costs of goods. Operating Income. Operating income was $347.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of approximately $10.5 million, or 3.1% higher than operating income of $337.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Operating income as a percentage of net sales decreased to 26.7% for the year ended December 31, 2010 from 29.5% for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase in operating income was primarily due to an increase in gross profit of $67.9 million, partially offset by a $57.4 million increase in operating expenses. The decrease in operating income as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to a decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales and an increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net sales. Operating income was negatively affected by operating losses of $9.2 million and $6.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, in relation to our operations in Europe, Australia and Brazil. Other Income (Expense) . Other income (expense) was $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of $3.1 million from ($1.6) million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase was primarily attributable to a loss on investments and put option of ($0.8) million for the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to a loss on investments and put option of ($3.9) million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase in other income (expense) was partially offset by decreased interest revenue earned on our cash balances and short- and long-term investments for the year ended December 31, 2010. Provision for Income Taxes . Provision for income taxes was $137.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of $10.3 million or 8.1% higher than the provision for income taxes of $127.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The effective combined federal and state and foreign tax rate increased to 39.3% from 37.8% for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily the result of the establishment of a full valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets of a foreign subsidiary during the year ended December 31, 2010, lower state tax benefits and the release of certain unrecognized tax benefits that arose in the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase in tax rates was partially offset by the increase in tax benefits resulting from the Domestic Production Deduction. The effect of the valuation allowance and its related impact on the Company overall tax rate increased the provision for income taxes by $3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. Net Income . Net income was $212.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of $3.3 million or 1.6% higher than net income of $208.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase in net income was primarily attributable to an increase in gross profit of $67.9 million and an increase in other income (expense) of $3.1 million. The increase in net income was partially offset by an increase in operating expenses of $57.4 million and an increase in the provision for income taxes of $10.3 million. 45 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash flows provided by operating activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $333.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, as compared with net cash provided by operating activities of $229.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. For the year ended December 31, 2011, cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to net income earned of $286.2 million and adjustments for certain non-cash expenses consisting of $19.4 million of stock-based compensation and $17.0 million of depreciation and other amortization. For the year ended December 31, 2011, cash provided by operations also increased due to a $28.4 million increase in accrued promotional allowances, a $26.3 million increase in accounts payable, a $13.9 million increase in income taxes payable, a $9.5 million decrease in prepaid income taxes, an $8.1 million increase in accrued liabilities and a $2.9 million increase in accrued compensation. For the year ended December 31, 2011, cash provided by operating activities was reduced due to a $56.8 million increase in accounts receivable, a $6.3 million decrease in deferred revenue, a $6.2 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets, a $4.5 million increase in inventory and a $3.8 million increase in tax benefit from the exercise of stock options. For the year ended December 31, 2010, cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to net income earned of $212.0 million and adjustments for certain non-cash expenses consisting of $16.9 million of stock-based compensation, $11.7 million of depreciation and other amortization, a $4.5 million impairment loss on investments and $1.7 million of bad debt expense. For the year ended December 31, 2010, cash provided by operations also increased due to a $33.4 million increase in accounts payable, a $14.7 million increase in accrued promotional allowances, a $13.2 million increase in accrued liabilities, a $12.5 million increase in income taxes payable and a $4.3 million decrease in distributor receivables. For the year ended December 31, 2010, cash provided by operating activities was reduced due to a $45.0 million increase in inventory, a $12.7 million increase in accounts receivable, a $12.4 million increase in tax benefit from the exercise of stock options, a $10.0 million increase in prepaid income taxes, a $5.5 million decrease in deferred revenue, a $3.8 million gain on the Put Option (defined below), a $2.8 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets, a $2.6 million decrease in accrued distributor terminations and a $1.4 million decrease in deferred income taxes. Cash flows used in investing activities Net cash used in investing activities was $173.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, as compared to net cash used in investing activities of $212.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. For the year ended December 31, 2011, cash used in investing activities was primarily attributable to purchases of held-to-maturity investments, purchases of available-for-sale investments, purchases of property and equipment and additions to intangibles. For the year ended December 31, 2010 cash used in investing activities was primarily attributable to purchases of held-to-maturity investments, additions to intangibles and purchases of property and equipment. For both the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, cash provided by investing activities was primarily attributable to maturities of held-to-maturity investments, sales of available-for-sale investments and sales of trading investments. For both the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, cash used in investing activities included the acquisitions of fixed assets consisting of vans and promotional vehicles, coolers and other equipment to support our marketing and promotional activities, production equipment, furniture and fixtures, office and computer equipment, computer software, and equipment used for sales and administrative activities, as well as certain leasehold improvements. For the year ended December 31, 2011, cash used in investing activities also included acquisitions of real property. We expect to continue to use a portion of our cash in excess of our requirements for operations for purchasing short-term and long-term investments, and for other corporate purposes, including, the acquisition of capital equipment, specifically, vans, trucks and promotional vehicles, coolers, other promotional equipment, merchandise displays, warehousing racks as well as items of production equipment required to produce certain of our existing and/or new products and to develop our brand in international markets. From time to time, we may also purchase real property related to our beverage business and/or acquire compatible businesses as a use of cash in excess of our requirements for operations. 46 Table of Contents Cash flows (used in) provided by financing activities Net cash used in financing activities was $154.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $9.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. For the year ended December 31, 2011 cash used in financing activities was primarily attributable to $176.4 million of purchases of common stock. For the year ended December 31, 2011 cash provided by financing activities was primarily attributable to $20.3 million received from the issuance of common stock in connection with the exercise of certain stock options. For the year ended December 31, 2010, cash used in financing activities was primarily attributable to $23.5 million of purchases of common stock. For the year ended December 31, 2010, cash provided by financing activities was primarily attributable to proceeds of $20.8 million received from the issuance of common stock in connection with the exercise of certain stock options and a $12.4 million excess tax benefit in connection with the exercise of certain stock options. Purchases of inventories, increases in accounts receivable and other assets, acquisition of property and equipment, acquisition and maintenance of trademarks, payments of accounts payable, income taxes payable and purchases of our common stock are expected to remain our principal recurring use of cash. Cash and cash equivalents, short-term and long-term investments At December 31, 2011, we had $359.3 million in cash and cash equivalents and $434.5 million in short-term and long-term investments. We have historically invested these amounts in U.S. Treasury bills, U.S. government agency securities and municipal securities (which may have an auction reset feature), corporate notes and bonds, commercial paper and money market funds meeting certain criteria. We maintain our investments for cash management purposes and not for purposes of speculation. Our risk management policies emphasize credit quality (primarily based on short-term ratings by nationally recognized statistical organizations) in selecting and maintaining our investments. We regularly assess market risk of our investments and believe our current policies and investment practices adequately limit those risks. However, certain of these investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks. These market risks associated with our investment portfolio may have an adverse effect on our future results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. Our long-term investments are comprised of auction rate securities. A large portion of these auction rate securities carry an investment grade credit rating and are additionally backed by various federal agencies and/or monoline insurance companies. The applicable interest rate is reset at pre-determined intervals, usually every 7 to 35 days. Liquidity for these auction rate securities was typically provided by an auction process which allowed holders to sell their notes at periodic auctions. Since 2008, the auctions for these auction rate securities failed. The securities for which auctions have failed will continue to accrue and/or pay interest at their pre-determined rates and be auctioned every 7 to 35 days until their respective auction succeeds, the issuer calls the securities, they mature or we are able exercise the Put Options (as defined below), or we are able to sell the securities to third parties. As a result, our ability to liquidate and fully recover the carrying value of our auction rate securities in the near term may be limited. Consequently, these securities, except those that we intend to sell prior to December 31, 2012 as a result of the agreements described below, or those that were redeemed at par after December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, are classified as long-term investments in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. In June 2011, we entered into an agreement (the 2011 ARS Agreement ) related to $24.5 million of par value auction rate securities (the 2011 ARS Securities ). Under the 2011 ARS Agreement, we have the right to sell the 2011 ARS Securities including all accrued but unpaid interest thereon (the 2011 Put Option ) as follows: (i) on or after July 1, 2013, up to $1.0 million aggregate par value; (ii) on or after October 1, 2013, up to an additional $1.0 million aggregate par value; and (iii) in quarterly installments thereafter based on a formula of the then outstanding 2011 ARS Securities, as adjusted for normal market redemptions, with full sale rights available on or after April 1, 2016. The 2011 ARS Securities will continue to accrue interest until redeemed through the 2011 Put Option, or as determined by the auction process or the terms outlined in the prospectus of the respective 2011 ARS Securities when the auction process fails. Under the 2011 ARS Agreement, we have the obligation, 47 Table of Contents should we receive written notification from the put issuer, to sell the 2011 ARS Securities at par plus all accrued but unpaid interest. During the year ended December 31, 2011, $3.7 million of par value 2011 ARS Securities were redeemed at par through normal market channels. In March 2010, we entered into an agreement (the 2010 ARS Agreement ) related to $54.2 million of par value auction rate securities (the 2010 ARS Securities ). Under the 2010 ARS Agreement, we have the right, but not the obligation, to sell the 2010 ARS Securities including all accrued but unpaid interest thereon (the 2010 Put Option ) as follows: (i) on or after March 22, 2011, up to $13.6 million aggregate par value; and (ii) equal semi-annual or annual installments thereafter with full sale rights available on or after March 22, 2013. The 2010 ARS Securities will continue to accrue interest until redeemed through the 2010 Put Option, or as determined by the auction process or the terms outlined in the prospectus of the respective 2010 ARS Securities when the auction process fails. During the year ended December 31, 2011, $27.1 million of par value 2010 ARS Securities were redeemed at par through the exercise of the 2010 Put Option and $4.0 million of par value 2010 ARS Securities were redeemed at par through normal market channels ($7.4 million of par value 2010 ARS Securities were redeemed at par through normal market channels during the year ended December 31, 2010). At December 31, 2011, we held auction rate securities with a face value of $44.8 million (amortized cost basis of $35.9 million). A Level 3 valuation was performed on our auction rate securities as of December 31, 2011 resulting in a fair value of $3.3 million for our available-for-sale auction rate securities (after a $5.0 million impairment) and $32.5 million for our trading auction rate securities (after a $4.0 million impairment), which are included in short-term and long-term investments. This valuation utilized a mark-to-model approach which included estimates for interest rates, timing and amount of cash flows, credit and liquidity premiums, as well as expected holding periods for the auction rate securities. These assumptions are typically volatile and subject to change as the underlying data sources and market conditions evolve. As of December 31, 2011, we recorded $3.0 million in aggregate as the fair market value of the 2011 Put Option and the 2010 Put Option (collectively the Put Options ). The net effect of (i) the acquisition of the 2011 Put Option during the second fiscal quarter of 2011; (ii) the revaluation of the Put Options as of December 31, 2011; (iii) the transfer from available-for-sale to trading of the 2011 ARS Securities during the second fiscal quarter of 2011; (iv) the revaluation of our trading auction rate securities as of September 30, 2011; (v) the redemption at par of certain 2011 ARS Securities and 2010 ARS Securities, including those redeemed at par through the exercise of the 2010 Put Option; and (vi) a recognized gain resulting from the redemption at par of a previously other-than-temporary impaired security during the first fiscal quarter of 2011, resulted in a (loss) of ($0.8) million included in other income (expense) for the year ended December 31, 2011. The net effect of (i) the acquisition of the 2010 Put Option during the first fiscal quarter of 2010; (ii) the revaluation of the 2010 Put Option as of December 31, 2010; (iii) the transfer from available-for-sale to trading of the 2010 ARS Securities during the first fiscal quarter of 2010; (iv) the revaluation of the Company trading auction rate securities as of December 31, 2010; (v) the redemption at par of certain 2010 ARS Securities; (vi) a recognized gain resulting from the redemption at par of a previously other-than-temporary impaired security during the first fiscal quarter of 2010; and (vii) an increase in the other-than-temporary impairment of certain auction rate securities, resulted in a (loss) of ($0.8) million included in other income (expense) for the year ended December 31, 2010. We hold additional auction rate securities that do not have a related put option. These auction rate securities continue to be classified as available-for-sale securities. We intend to retain our investment in these securities until the earlier of the anticipated recovery in market value or maturity. 48 Table of Contents Based on our ability to access cash and cash equivalents and other short-term investments and based on our expected operating cash flows, we do not anticipate that the current lack of liquidity of our auction rate securities will have a material adverse effect on our liquidity or working capital. If uncertainties in the credit and capital markets continue, or uncertainties in the expected performance of the issuers of the Put Options arise, or there are rating downgrades on the auction rate securities held by us, we may be required to recognize additional impairments on these investments. The Company purchased 5.0 million shares of its common stock at an average purchase price of $35.63 per share, as adjusted for the stock split, for a total amount of $176.4 million, during the year ended December 31, 2011. The Company purchased 1.2 million shares of the Company common stock at an average purchase price of $18.84 per share, as adjusted for the stock split, for a total amount of $23.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2010. We believe that cash available from operations, including our cash resources and the revolving line of credit, will be sufficient for our working capital needs, including purchase commitments for raw materials and inventory, increases in accounts receivable, payments of tax liabilities, expansion and development needs, purchases of shares of our common stock, as well as any purchases of capital assets, equipment and properties, through at least the next 12 months. Based on our current plans, at this time we estimate that capital expenditures are likely to be less than $40.0 million through December 31, 2012. However, future business opportunities may cause a change in this estimate. The following represents a summary of the Company contractual commitments and related scheduled maturities as of December 31, 2011: Payments due by period (in thousands) Obligations Total Less than 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than 5 years Contractual Obligations $ 95,082 $ 48,716 $ 46,366 $ - $ - Capital Leases 1,099 1,099 - - - Operating Leases 18,043 3,996 9,853 3,533 661 Purchase Commitments 44,197 44,197 - - - $ 158,421 $ 98,008 $ 56,219 $ 3,533 $ 661 Contractual obligations include our obligations related to sponsorships and other commitments. Purchase commitments include obligations made by us and our subsidiaries to various suppliers for raw materials used in the production of our products. These obligations vary in terms, but are generally satisfied within one year. During October 2011, the Company entered into an agreement to acquire an approximately 75,425 square foot, free standing, three-story office building, including the real property thereunder and improvements thereon, located in Corona, CA for a purchase price of approximately $8.2 million. The purchase is subject to various conditions precedent that must be satisfied prior to the closing. If the building is ultimately acquired by the Company, the Company intends to complete any necessary improvements thereon and occupy the building as the Company new corporate headquarters at some time in the future. In addition, approximately $1.9 million of recognized tax benefits have been recorded as liabilities as of December 31, 2011. We expect $0.5 million of recognized tax benefits will be settled within the next 12 months, and we are uncertain as to if or when the remaining amounts may be settled. Related to the unrecognized tax benefits not included in the table above, we have also recorded a liability for potential penalties and interest of $0.5 million as of December 31, 2011. 49 Table of Contents Accounting Policies and Pronouncements Critical Accounting Policies Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements. The following summarizes our most significant accounting and reporting policies and practices: Investments Our investments in debt securities are classified as either held-to-maturity, available-for-sale or trading, in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 320. Held-to-maturity securities are those securities that we have the positive intent and ability to hold until maturity. Trading securities are those securities that we intend to sell in the near term. All other securities not included in the held-to-maturity or trading category are classified as available-for-sale. Held-to-maturity securities are recorded at amortized cost which approximates fair market value. Trading securities are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses charged to earnings. Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recorded within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as a separate component of stockholders equity. ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs, where available (see Note 3 Fair Value of Certain Financial Assets and Liabilities in the notes to consolidated financial statements). Under ASC 320-10-35, a security is considered to be other-than-temporarily impaired if the present value of cash flows expected to be collected are less than the security amortized cost basis (the difference being defined as the Credit Loss ) or if the fair value of the security is less than the security amortized cost basis and the investor intends, or will be required, to sell the security before recovery of the security amortized cost basis. If an other-than-temporary impairment exists, the charge to earnings is limited to the amount of Credit Loss if the investor does not intend to sell the security, and will not be required to sell the security, before recovery of the security amortized cost basis. Any remaining difference between fair value and amortized cost is recognized in other comprehensive income (loss), net of applicable taxes. We evaluate whether the decline in fair value of our investments is other-than-temporary at each quarter-end. This evaluation consists of a review by management, and includes market pricing information and maturity dates for the securities held, market and economic trends in the industry and information on the issuer financial condition and, if applicable, information on the guarantors financial condition. Factors considered in determining whether a loss is temporary include the length of time and extent to which the investment fair value has been less than its cost basis, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer and guarantors, including any specific events which may influence the operations of the issuer and our intent and ability to retain the investment for a reasonable period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery of fair value. Accounts Receivable We evaluate the collectability of our trade accounts receivable based on a number of factors. In circumstances where we become aware of a specific customer inability to meet its financial obligations to us, a specific reserve for bad debts is estimated and recorded, which reduces the recognized receivable to the estimated amount we believe will ultimately be collected. In addition to specific customer identification of potential bad debts, bad debt charges are recorded based on our recent loss history and an overall assessment of past due trade accounts receivable outstanding. 50 Table of Contents Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost to purchase and/or manufacture the inventory or the current estimated market value of the inventory. We regularly review our inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand, production availability and/or our ability to sell the product(s) concerned. Demand for our products can fluctuate significantly. Factors that could affect demand for our products include unanticipated changes in consumer preferences, general market and economic conditions or other factors that may result in cancellations of advance orders or reductions in the rate of reorders placed by customers and/or continued weakening of economic conditions. Additionally, management estimates of future product demand may be inaccurate, which could result in an understated or overstated provision required for excess and obsolete inventory. Long-Lived Assets Management regularly reviews property and equipment and other long-lived assets, including certain definite-lived identifiable intangible assets, for possible impairment. This review occurs annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. If there is indication of impairment of property and equipment or amortizable intangible assets, then management prepares an estimate of future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. If these cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized to write down the asset to its estimated fair value. The fair value is estimated at the present value of the future cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with management estimates of the business risks. No impairment indicators were identified as of December 31, 2011 or 2010. Management believes that the accounting estimate related to impairment of its long-lived assets, including its trademarks (as discussed below), is a critical accounting estimate because: (1) the estimate is highly susceptible to change from period to period because it requires company management to make assumptions about cash flows and discount rates; and (2) the impact that recognizing an impairment would have on the assets reported on our consolidated balance sheet, as well as net income, could be material. Management assumptions about cash flows and discount rates require significant judgment because actual revenues and expenses have fluctuated in the past and are expected to continue to do so. Intangibles Intangibles are comprised primarily of trademarks that represent our exclusive ownership of the Monster Energy trademark, the Hansen trademark, the Blue Sky trademark, and the Junior Juice trademark, all used in connection with the manufacture, sale and distribution of supplements and beverages. We also own in our own right, a number of other trademarks in the United States, as well as in a number of countries around the world. During 2002, we adopted ASC 350. Under the provisions of ASC 350, we discontinued amortization on indefinite-lived trademarks while continuing to amortize remaining definite-lived trademarks over one to 25 years. In accordance with ASC 350, we evaluate our trademarks annually for impairment or earlier if there is an indication of impairment. If there is an indication of impairment of identified intangible assets not subject to amortization, management compares the estimated fair value with the carrying amount of the asset. An impairment loss is recognized to write down the intangible asset to its fair value if it is less than the carrying amount. The fair value is calculated using the income approach. However, preparation of estimated expected future cash flows is inherently subjective and is based on management best estimate of assumptions concerning expected future conditions. Based on management impairment analysis performed for the year ended December 31, 2011, the estimated fair values of trademarks exceeded the carrying values. In estimating future revenues, we use internal budgets. Internal budgets are developed based on recent revenue data and future marketing plans for existing product lines and planned timing of future introductions of new products and their impact on our future cash flows. 51 Table of Contents Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. Generally, ownership of and title to our products pass to customers upon delivery of the products to customers. Certain of our distributors may also perform a separate function as a co-packer on our behalf. In such cases, ownership of and title to our products that are co-packed on our behalf by those co-packers who are also distributors, passes to such distributors when we are notified by them that they have taken transfer or possession of the relevant portion of our finished goods. Net sales have been determined after deduction of promotional and other allowances in accordance with ASC 605-50. Amounts received pursuant to new and/or amended distribution agreements entered into with certain distributors, relating to the costs associated with terminating our prior distributors, are accounted for as revenue ratably over the anticipated life of the respective distribution agreement, generally 20 years. Management believes that adequate provision has been made for cash discounts, returns and spoilage based on our historical experience. Cost of Sales Cost of sales consists of the costs of raw materials utilized in the manufacture of products, co-packing fees, repacking fees, in-bound freight charges, as well as certain internal transfer costs, warehouse expenses incurred prior to the manufacture of our finished products and certain quality control costs. Raw materials account for the largest portion of the cost of sales. Raw materials include cans, bottles, other containers, ingredients and packaging materials. Operating Expenses Operating expenses include selling expenses such as distribution expenses to transport products to customers and warehousing expenses after manufacture, as well as expenses for advertising, commissions, sampling and in-store demonstration costs, costs for merchandise displays, point-of-sale materials and premium items, sponsorship expenses, other marketing expenses and design expenses. Operating expenses also include payroll costs, travel costs, professional service fees including legal fees, termination payments made to certain of our prior distributors, entertainment, insurance, postage, depreciation and other general and administrative costs. Stock-Based Compensation The Company accounts for stock-based compensation under the provisions of ASC 718. The Company records compensation expense for employee stock options based on the estimated fair value of the options on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing formula. The Company records compensation expense for non-employee stock options based on the estimated fair value of the options as of the earlier of (1) the date at which a commitment for performance by the non-employee to earn the stock option is reached or (2) the date at which the non-employee performance is complete, using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing formula. Stock-based compensation cost for restricted stock awards and restricted stock units is measured based on the closing fair market value of the Company common stock at the date of grant. In the event that the Company has the option and intent to settle a restricted stock unit in cash, the award is classified as a liability and revalued at each balance sheet date. Income Taxes We utilize the liability method of accounting for income taxes as set forth in ASC 740. Under the liability method, deferred taxes are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using tax rates expected to be in effect during the years in which the basis differences reverse. A valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that some of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In determining the need for valuation allowances we consider projected future taxable income and the availability of tax planning strategies. If in the future we determine that we would not be able to realize our recorded deferred tax assets, an increase in the valuation allowance would be recorded, decreasing earnings in the period in which such determination is made. 52 Table of Contents We assess our income tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon our evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. For those tax positions where there is a greater than 50% likelihood that a tax benefit will be sustained, we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit that may potentially be realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where there is less than 50% likelihood that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Part II, Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 1 Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements including the respective expected dates of adoption and expected effects on the Company consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity. Sales The table set forth below discloses selected quarterly data regarding sales for the past five years. Data from any one or more quarters is not necessarily indicative of annual results or continuing trends. Sales of beverages are expressed in unit case volume. A unit case means a unit of measurement equal to 192 U.S. fluid ounces of finished beverage (24 eight-ounce servings). The Company defines unit case volume as the number of unit cases (or unit case equivalents) of beverages directly or indirectly sold by us. Our quarterly results of operations reflect seasonal trends that are primarily the result of increased demand in the warmer months of the year. It has been our experience that beverage sales tend to be lower during the first and fourth quarters of each fiscal year. Because the primary historical market for our products is California, which has a year-long temperate climate, the effect of seasonal fluctuations on quarterly results may have been mitigated; however, such fluctuations may become more pronounced with the expansion of the distribution of our products outside of California. In addition, our experience with our energy drink products suggests they are less seasonal than the seasonality expected from traditional beverages. Quarterly fluctuations may also be affected by other factors including the introduction of new products, the opening of new markets where temperature fluctuations are more pronounced, the addition of new bottlers and distributors, changes in the sales mix of our products and changes in and/or increased advertising and promotional expenses. (See Part I, Item 1 Business Seasonality ). 53 Table of Contents 2011 2010 2009 2008 2007 Unit Case Volume / Case Sales (in Thousands) Quarter 1 34,681 24,205 23,468 22,274 19,396 Quarter 2 44,272 35,861 29,256 28,726 26,950 Quarter 3 46,277 37,856 29,800 28,009 26,450 Quarter 4 39,431 31,109 27,461 23,650 25,657 Total 164,661 129,031 109,985 102,659 98,453 Net Sales (in Thousands) Quarter 1 $ 356,419 $ 238,110 $ 244,206 $ 212,178 $ 165,853 Quarter 2 462,145 365,701 300,250 282,244 244,763 Quarter 3 474,709 381,466 307,929 284,986 247,211 Quarter 4 409,957 318,665 290,914 254,372 246,638 Total $ 1,703,230 $ 1,303,942 $ 1,143,299 $ 1,033,780 $ 904,465 Average Net Sales Per Case Quarter 1 $ 10.28 $ 9.84 $ 10.41 $ 9.53 $ 8.55 Quarter 2 10.44 10.20 10.26 9.83 9.08 Quarter 3 10.26 10.08 10.33 10.17 9.35 Quarter 4 10.40 10.24 10.59 10.76 9.61 Total $ 10.34 $ 10.11 $ 10.40 $ 10.07 $ 9.19 Net Revenues for the fourth quarter of 2008 included the recognition of $11.6 million of revenue related to the acceleration of the deferred revenue balance associated with certain of our prior distributors terminated in the fourth quarter of 2008. Average net sales per case exclusive of this recognition were $10.26 and $9.96 for the three-months and year ended December 31, 2008, respectively.
