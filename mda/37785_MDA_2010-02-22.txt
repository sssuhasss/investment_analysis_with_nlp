ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview We are a diversified, global chemical company providing innovative solutions, applications and market leading products to a wide variety of markets. We operate in three distinct business segments: Agricultural Products, Specialty Chemicals and Industrial Chemicals. Our Agricultural Products segment develops, markets and sells all three major classes of crop protection chemicals insecticides, herbicides, and fungicides with particular strength in insecticides and herbicides. These products are used in agriculture to enhance crop yield and quality by controlling a broad spectrum of insects, weeds and disease, as well as pest control in non-agricultural markets. Specialty Chemicals consists of our BioPolymer and Lithium businesses and focuses on food ingredients that are used to enhance texture, structure and physical stability, pharmaceutical additives for binding, encapsulation and disintegrant applications, ultrapure biopolymers for medical devices and lithium specialties for pharmaceutical synthesis, specialty polymers and energy storage. Our Industrial Chemicals segment manufactures a wide range of inorganic materials, including soda ash, hydrogen peroxide, specialty peroxygens and phosphorus chemicals. 2009 Highlights Our businesses this year have each been affected by the downturn in the global economy but to varying degrees. Revenues in the aggregate are down nine percent versus 2008. Our Industrial Chemicals segment has been the most impacted with revenues down 21 percent as a result of lower volume due to weak global demand particularly in end markets for flat glass, detergents and pulp and paper. Our Specialty Chemicals segment had mixed results with lithium volumes down on weak end markets in industrial and electronics. BioPolymer continued to grow revenue based on good commercial performance and the alginates acquisition made in the third quarter of 2008. Our Agricultural Products segment also had mixed results as lower revenues in Europe and Asia were mostly offset by growth in the Americas. Despite the lower revenues, we did have higher operating profits compared to the prior year in both our Agricultural Products and Specialty Chemicals segments of 18 percent and five percent, respectively. However the decrease in revenues due to volume declines across our Industrial Chemicals businesses led to a decrease in operating profits in this segment of 55 percent from prior year. See Segment Results section starting on page 30 for further discussion on the results of our operating segments. In response to these weaker market conditions, we made a number of decisions this year to realign some of our operating assets. During the first quarter, we made the decision to shut down the peroxygens manufacturing facility in Santa Clara, Mexico and the lithium facility in Bayport, Texas. During the second quarter, we decided to shut down Foret operations in Barcelona, Spain and in the third quarter, we made the decision to curtail soda ash operations at our Granger, Wyoming facility and to shut down our Lithium metal production unit in Bromborough, UK. As a result of these decisions, we incurred significantly higher restructuring and other income (charges) in 2009 compared to 2008. During the first half of 2009, we completed two acquisitions in our Agricultural Products business. We acquired the CB Professional Products line of insect control products from Waterbury Companies, Inc. and the proprietary fungicide Benalaxyl from Isagro S.p.A. Both of these acquisitions fit our strategic goal of offering an expanding product portfolio in focused markets. Additionally, we announced plans at the beginning of this year to realign our BioPolymer alginates manufacturing operations in Norway and the United Kingdom as the company continues the integration of the International Specialty Products (ISP) alginates business acquired in August 2008. 2010 Outlook In 2010, despite what is expected to be a tempered recovery of the downturn in global economic conditions experienced in 2009, we expect a year of solid performance. We expect to have an increase to our revenues 28 Table of Contents driven by higher volumes in most regions, particularly Brazil, in our Agricultural Products segment, volume growth and higher selling prices in Biopolymer in our Specialty Chemicals segment and flat revenue in our Industrial Chemicals segment driven by stronger volumes but offset by reduced selling prices. We expect an increase in earnings, driven by higher sales in our Agricultural Products segment, volume driven growth and productivity improvements in our Specialty Chemicals segment and volume growth and favorable raw material and energy costs in our Industrial Chemicals segment. Our earnings growth is expected to be offset by less favorable product and geographic mix and increased spending on growth initiatives in our Agricultural Products segment, reduced selling prices in our Industrial Chemicals segment and higher pension expenses. We expect cash flow from our business segments to remain strong. Results of Operations 2009, 2008 and 2007 Overview The following presents a reconciliation of our segment operating profit to net income attributable to FMC stockholders as seen through the eyes of our management. For management purposes, we report the operating performance of each of our business segments based on earnings before interest and income taxes excluding corporate expenses, other income (expense), net and corporate special income/(charges). Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 (in Millions) Revenue Agricultural Products $ 1,051.6 $ 1,058.7 $ 889.7 Specialty Chemicals 753.1 764.5 659.5 Industrial Chemicals 1,026.7 1,296.9 1,087.1 Eliminations (5.2 ) (4.8 ) (3.4 ) Total $ 2,826.2 $ 3,115.3 $ 2,632.9 Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes Agricultural Products $ 289.0 $ 245.2 $ 207.0 Specialty Chemicals 159.6 152.0 142.7 Industrial Chemicals 89.7 201.4 92.5 Eliminations (0.1 ) (0.1 ) Segment operating profit (1) 538.2 598.5 442.2 Corporate (44.1 ) (49.8 ) (52.3 ) Other income (expense), net (27.5 ) (8.6 ) (12.0 ) Interest expense, net (27.0 ) (31.9 ) (34.9 ) Corporate special income (charges): Restructuring and other income (charges) (132.8 ) (49.6 ) (164.9 ) Impairment of Perorsa joint venture (1.4 ) LIFO inventory correction adjustment 6.1 Purchase accounting inventory fair value impact and other related inventory adjustments (7.1 ) (2.3 ) Gain from Astaris joint venture 0.4 Noncontrolling interest associated with restructuring and other income (charges) 1.4 Loss on extinguishment of debt (0.3 ) Provision for income taxes (53.0 ) (125.4 ) (29.0 ) Discontinued operations, net of income taxes (18.2 ) (24.9 ) (24.3 ) Net income attributable to FMC stockholders $ 228.5 $ 304.6 $ 132.4 (1) Results for all segments are net of noncontrolling interests in 2009, 2008 and 2007 of $10.3 million, $17.0 million and $11.0 million, respectively. The majority of these noncontrolling interests pertain to our Industrial Chemicals segment. 29 Table of Contents The below chart, which is provided to assist the readers of our financial statements, depicts certain after-tax charges (gains). These items are excluded by us in the measures we use to evaluate business performance and determine certain performance-based compensation. These after-tax items are discussed in detail within the Other results of operations section that follows. Additionally, the below chart discloses our Non-GAAP financial measure After-tax income from continuing operations, excluding restructuring and other income and charges reconciled from the GAAP financial measure Net income attributable to FMC stockholders . We believe that this measure provides useful information about our operating results to investors and securities analysts. We also believe that excluding the effect of restructuring and other income and charges from operating results allows management and investors to compare more easily the financial performance of our underlying businesses from period to period. This measure should not be considered as a substitute for net income (loss) or other measures of performance or liquidity reported in accordance with GAAP. Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 (in Millions) Net income attributable to FMC stockholders $ 228.5 $ 304.6 $ 132.4 Corporate special charges (income), pre-tax 139.9 53.3 157.0 Income tax expense (benefit) on Corporate special charges (income) (38.8 ) (23.0 ) (58.8 ) Corporate special charges (income), net of income taxes 101.1 30.3 98.2 Loss on extinguishment of debt, net of income taxes 0.2 Discontinued operations, net of income taxes 18.2 24.9 24.3 Tax adjustments (43.7 ) (8.7 ) (15.4 ) After-tax income from continuing operations excluding restructuring and other income and charges $ 304.1 $ 351.1 $ 239.7 Year Ended December 31, 2009 compared to December 31, 2008 In the following discussion, year refers to the year ended December 31, 2009 and prior year refers to the year ended December 31, 2008. Additionally, in the discussion below, please refer to our chart on page 29 under Overview . All comparisons are between the periods unless otherwise noted. Segment Results For management purposes, segment operating profit is defined as segment revenue less operating expenses (segment operating expenses consist of costs of sales and services, selling, general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses). We have excluded the following items from segment operating profit: corporate staff expense, interest income and expense associated with corporate debt facilities and investments, income taxes, gains (or losses) on divestitures of businesses, restructuring and other charges (income), investment gains and losses, loss on extinguishment of debt, asset impairments, LIFO inventory adjustments, amortization of inventory step-up from business acquisitions and other related inventory adjustments, and other income and expense items. Information about how each of these items relates to our businesses at the segment level and results by segment are discussed below and in Note 19 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K. Agricultural Products Year Ended December 31, Increase/ (Decrease) 2009 2008 $ % (in Millions) Revenue $ 1,051.6 $ 1,058.7 $ (7.1 ) (1 )% Operating Profit 289.0 245.2 43.8 18 30 Table of Contents Revenue of $1,051.6 million was one percent lower than the prior year period as sales gains in North America, Latin America (which is primarily Brazil) and non-crop markets and generally higher pricing across the entire business were more than fully offset by lower sales in Europe and Asia, which also included unfavorable currency impacts in these two regions. North American revenues increased three percent on new product introductions, price increases and sales from the CB Professional Products line acquisition. Revenues in Europe declined 11 percent due to weaker markets and unfavorable currency impacts. In Latin America, revenues increased two percent primarily due to improved second half market conditions in Brazil, partially offset by unfavorable currency impacts. In Asia, revenues declined two percent due mainly to unfavorable weather conditions, weak pest pressures and unfavorable currency impacts. Segment operating profit of $289.0 million was 18 percent higher than the prior year, driven by growth from new products, particularly in North America and Brazil, better second half market conditions in Brazil, higher selling prices in most regions, continued global supply chain productivity improvements, the benefit of indirect tax recoveries in Brazil, lower raw material costs and lower selling and administrative expenses. In 2010, we expect full-year revenue growth in the mid-single digits, reflecting increased volumes in most regions, particularly in Brazil, due to projected improving market conditions and growth in new and recently introduced products. Full-year segment operating profit growth is expected in the mid to high single digits as a result of higher projected sales in most regions, partially offset by less favorable product and geographic mix, and increased spending on growth initiatives. Certain Regulatory Issues In our Agricultural Products segment, several products are undergoing re-registration in the U.S. and/or a comparable regulatory review by the European Union ( EU ) governmental authorities. In August 2006, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency issued its Interim Reregistration Eligibility Decision ( IRED ) for our carbofuran insecticide. The IRED proposes cancellation of all carbofuran uses in the United States, subject to a phase out period for certain minor crop uses while maintaining tolerances for imported commodities (bananas, coffee, rice and sugarcane). The EPA reiterated its proposal in January 2008 with the issuance of a draft Notice of Intent to Cancel. In February 2008, the EPA convened a Scientific Advisory Panel meeting to evaluate scientific issues relevant to the draft Notice of Intent to Cancel carbofuran. Separately, the U.S. Department of Agriculture issued its comments on the draft cancellation notice, stating that carbofuran should continue to be registered. On July 24, 2008, the EPA published a proposal to revoke all carbofuran tolerances under the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act in advance of any issuance of a final Notice of Intent to Cancel under the federal pesticide law. We responded to that notice, expressing our strong disagreement with the EPA proposal to revoke tolerances and our belief that carbofuran residues on food do not pose a threat to human health. In May 2009, the EPA published its final revocation of all carbofuran tolerances effective December 31, 2009. We filed our objections to this revocation and requested a hearing before an administrative law judge. On October 30, 2009, EPA issued its decision to deny our objections and request for a hearing. We believe that we are entitled to a hearing and we have challenged this decision by seeking judicial review in the U.S. federal courts. The Court of Appeals granted expedited review of our case and will hear arguments in Spring 2010. In light of the December 31, 2009 tolerance revocation, FMC has now ceased sales of carbofuran in the United States. FMC sales of carbofuran in the United States are not significant. The outcome of any litigation to compel a hearing is uncertain. We do not know the EPA timing on a final Notice of Intent to Cancel the carbofuran registration, though the EPA has said it intends to issue such notice after the tolerance revocation decision. In June 2007, the European Commission published its decisions not to include carbofuran and carbosulfan on the official list of active ingredients approved for continued sale in the EU. The published decisions required EU Member States to de-register the products within six months, and so FMC ceased its sales of these products in December 2007. We disagreed with the Commission decisions and underlying assessment. We have re-submitted carbosulfan for approval on the official list. The outcome of our regulatory resubmission is 31 Table of Contents uncertain. We have decided not to continue pursuing a carbofuran resubmission due to various considerations, including our plans to substitute the most significant EU carbofuran uses with other FMC products and/or applications. Also in the EU, in March 2009 the Commission proposed not to include our pyrethroid insecticide bifenthrin on the official list, but the Standing Committee rejected that proposal. The regulatory decision was referred to the EU Council of Ministers. In July 2009, the process concluded whereby the Commission non-inclusion proposal will now be implemented. The non-inclusion decision was adopted on November 30, 2009. FMC has an additional six months to sell bifenthrin (i.e., through end-May 2010), and subsequently, in most countries, there will be up to 6-12 months for further sale and use. Accordingly, we do not anticipate a material sales impact in 2010. We have re-submitted for reconsideration and will seek to minimize any interruption in sales. We intend to defend vigorously all our products in the U.S., EU and other countries regulatory processes where FMC pesticide products will be reviewed in the ordinary course of regulatory programs during 2010 as part of the ongoing cycle of re-registration in countries around the world. Recently, the Brazilian health agency has informed us that they intend to review carbofuran along with 13 other major pesticides, but has yet to issue any required formal announcement that identifies their specific concerns or preliminary position on re-registration. FMC is cooperating and defending our product in this process. Under the Brazilian regulatory process, any recommendation would need public notice and comment as well as concurrence from the Brazilian environmental and agricultural ministries before any regulatory change is effective. Thus, we do not expect a potential sales impact in 2010. Specialty Chemicals Year Ended December 31, Increase/ (Decrease) 2009 2008 $ % (in Millions) Revenue $ 753.1 $ 764.5 $ (11.4 ) (1 )% Operating Profit 159.6 152.0 7.6 5 Specialty Chemicals revenue of $753.1 million decreased one percent versus the prior year period. The decrease was driven primarily by lower volumes across the Lithium business mostly offset by higher selling prices and a full year of revenue related to the acquisitions in the mid-third quarter of 2008 in BioPolymer. BioPolymer revenues increased to $579.2 million which is eight percent higher than prior year. This change was due to the benefit of a full year of revenue related to the acquisitions in the mid-third quarter of 2008 which increased revenue by ten percent. Improved pricing and mix increased revenue by an additional five percent. These benefits were partially offset by volume declines of approximately three percent and the impact of a weaker euro. Lithium revenues of $173.9 million declined 24 percent from the prior year primarily due to weak demand across the business. Segment operating profit of $159.6 million was five percent higher than the prior year as favorable commercial performance in BioPolymer, the benefits of acquisitions in Biopolymer, productivity initiatives and a recovery of export taxes in Argentina were partially offset by lower lithium volumes, temporary plant curtailments to reduce inventories and unfavorable currency translation. In 2010, we expect full-year revenue to increase approximately 10 percent driven by volume growth across BioPolymer markets and lithium primaries, augmented by higher BioPolymer selling prices. Full-year segment operating profit is expected to be up in the mid-teens, reflecting volume-driven sales growth and productivity improvements. 32 Table of Contents Industrial Chemicals Year Ended December 31, Increase/ (Decrease) 2009 2008 $ % (in Millions) Revenue $ 1,026.7 $ 1,296.9 $ (270.2 ) (21 )% Operating Profit 89.7 201.4 (111.7 ) (55 ) Industrial Chemicals revenue of $1,026.7 million decreased 21 percent versus the prior year period due primarily to volume declines across the segment. These volume declines reduced segment revenues by approximately 15 percent, while pricing remained flat, despite a significant year-over-year reduction in pricing for phosphates. The remaining decline of approximately six percent was driven primarily by unfavorable currency impacts and reduced freight billings in line with the volume declines noted above. Soda ash revenues were down on lower volumes with pricing improvements, partially offsetting these unfavorable impacts. Foret revenues were down on lower volumes and pricing, particularly for phosphates and an unfavorable euro. Finally, North American Peroxygens revenue decreased primarily due to volume declines, partially offset by pricing improvements. Segment operating profit of $89.7 million was 55 percent lower than the prior period, driven by lower volumes across the segment. For 2010, we expect full-year revenue to be level compared to 2009 as stronger volumes in every business are offset by reduced selling prices. Full-year segment operating profit is expected to be up 5-15 percent to prior year, as volume growth and favorable raw material and energy costs are partially offset by lower selling prices. Other Results of Operations Corporate Expenses We recorded charges of $44.1 million in 2009 compared to $49.8 million in 2008. The decrease was primarily due to reduced incentive compensation expense and reductions in discretionary spending compared to the prior year. Corporate expenses are included as a component of the line item Selling, general and administrative expenses on our consolidated statements of income. Other income (expense), net Other income (expense), net is comprised primarily of LIFO inventory adjustments and pension expense. Other expense was $27.5 million in 2009 compared to $8.6 million in 2008. The increase was due primarily to higher charges related to our LIFO inventory reserves, higher pension expense and an increase to the mark to market impact of our deferred compensation liability. Other income (expense), net is included as a component of the line item Costs of sales and services on our consolidated statements of income. Interest Expense, net The 2009 net interest expense decreased to $27.0 million compared to $31.9 million in 2008 primarily due to lower interest rates on the borrowings under our credit agreements as compared to the prior period. 33 Table of Contents Corporate special income (charges) Restructuring and other charges (income) were $132.8 million in 2009 compared to $49.6 million in 2008. Please see the table and further discussion regarding our restructuring and other charges (income) in Note 7 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K. Charges in this category for the year ended December 31, 2009, include the following: Restructuring Charges and Asset Impairments A $1.8 million charge in our Agricultural Products segment due to our decision to phase-out operations at our Baltimore, Maryland agricultural chemicals facility.

Corporate charges of $20.2 million relating to environmental remediation at operating sites. Charges of $2.0 million related to our Agricultural Products segment acquiring further rights under a collaboration and license agreement with a third-party company. $2.5 million of other charges primarily representing the accrual of interest associated with the European Commission fine. The restructuring and other charges (income) of $49.6 million recorded in 2008 were a result of the following: Restructuring Charges and Asset Impairments A $31.5 million charge in our Agricultural Products segment due to our decision in 2007 to phase-out operations at our Baltimore, Maryland agricultural chemicals facility. These charges consisted of (i) accelerated depreciation on fixed assets of $27.0 million, (ii) severance and employee benefits of $1.4 million, and (iii) other shutdown charges of $3.1 million. A $5.6 million charge in our Agricultural Products segment due to our decision in 2008 to phase-out operations at our Jacksonville, Florida facility. The charge consisted of (i) accelerated depreciation on fixed assets of $3.8 million, (ii) severance and employee benefits of $1.0 million and (iii) other shutdown charges of $0.8 million. Severance costs due to workforce restructurings of $8.1 million, of which $3.2 million related to our Agricultural Products segment, $0.7 million related to our Specialty Chemicals segment and $4.2 million related to our Industrial Chemicals segment. Asset abandonment charges of $7.0 million, of which $2.2 million related to our Agricultural Products segment, $1.5 million related to our Industrial Chemicals segment and $3.3 million related to our Specialty Chemicals segment. Other Charges (Income), Net A gain on the sale of the Princeton property of $29.0 million, completed on March 18, 2008. A gain on the sale of Foret sodium sulfate assets of $3.6 million. Foret is part of our Industrial Chemicals segment. A $10.0 million charge related to an agreement in principle to settle a class action alleging violations of antitrust law involving our hydrogen peroxide product in our Industrial Chemicals segment. $16.2 million of charges relating to environmental remediation at operating sites as a Corporate charge. A $1.0 million charge related to our Agricultural Products segment extending their rights associated with the collaboration and license agreement discussed below. $2.8 million of other charges primarily representing the accrual of interest associated with the European Commission fine. Impairment of Perorsa joint venture represents a $1.4 million charge related to the impairment of our Perorsa joint venture in our Industrial Chemicals segment. On the consolidated statements of income this charge is included in Equity in (earnings) loss of affiliates for the year ended December 31, 2008. There is no such comparable charge in 2009. Purchase accounting inventory fair value impact and other related inventory adjustments for the year ended December 31, 2009, totaled $7.1 million. In purchase accounting, inventory is stepped up from its cost value to estimated selling prices less costs to sell. This line item represented charges related to amortization of the 35 Table of Contents inventory fair value step-up associated with the third quarter 2008 acquisition in our Specialty Chemicals segment and the first quarter 2009 acquisition in our Agricultural Products segment. Additionally the amount in 2009 includes inventory adjustments related to the third quarter 2008 acquisition in our Specialty Chemicals segment and subsequent alginates business restructuring. For the year ended December 31, 2008, the charges of $2.3 million represented the amortization of the inventory fair value step-up resulting from the application of purchase accounting associated with the third quarter 2008 acquisition in our Specialty Chemicals segment. On the consolidated statements of income, these charges are included in Costs of sales and services . Provision for income taxes We recorded a provision of $53.0 million in 2009 compared with a provision of $125.4 million in 2008 resulting in effective tax rates of 17.1 percent and 26.6 percent, respectively. The change in the effective tax rate was a result of a change in the mix of domestic income compared to income earned outside of the U.S. and favorable tax adjustments partially offset by a charge in 2009 related to the resolution of a regulatory matter in our Industrial Chemicals segment that is nondeductible for tax purposes. Income we earn domestically is typically taxed at rates higher than income earned outside the U.S. The effective tax rates were also impacted by tax adjustments recorded during 2009 and 2008. These tax adjustments are described below. 2009 tax adjustments were favorable in the amount of $43.7 million and are primarily a result of a reduction in our liability for unrecognized tax benefits due to favorable settlements of tax audits and the expiration of statutes of limitations as well as the reversal of certain tax valuation allowances. These valuation allowances were no longer necessary because of our expectation that the related deferred tax assets were likely to be realized. 2008 tax adjustments were favorable in the amount of $8.7 million and primarily result from a benefit to adjust our reserve for unrecognized tax benefits due to favorable settlements of tax audits. Partially offsetting this benefit are charges associated with adjustments for prior years tax matters. Discontinued operations, net of income tax Our discontinued operations represent adjustments to retained liabilities primarily related to operations discontinued between 1976 and 2001. The primary liabilities retained include environmental liabilities, other post-retirement benefit liabilities, self-insurance and long-term obligations related to legal proceedings. Discontinued operations, net of income tax totaled a loss of $18.2 million in 2009 versus a loss of $24.9 million in 2008. The 2009 loss is primarily related to environmental charges associated with our Front Royal and Middleport sites and operating and maintenance activities partially offset by recoveries related to our Front Royal site. The 2009 loss also includes charges for legal reserves and expenses related to discontinued operations. The 2008 loss is primarily related to environmental charges associated with our Front Royal and Middleport sites and charges for legal reserves and expenses related to discontinued operations. Discontinued environmental charges include environmental remediation costs at sites of discontinued businesses for which we are responsible for environmental compliance. Net income attributable to FMC stockholders Net income attributable to FMC stockholders decreased to $228.5 million in 2009 compared with $304.6 million in 2008. The decrease was primarily due to lower Industrial Chemicals segment operating profit and significantly higher restructuring and other charges (income). Partially offsetting these decreases were higher profits in our Agricultural Products segment and to a lesser extent, our Specialty Chemicals segment. Year Ended December 31, 2008 compared to December 31, 2007 In the following discussion, year refers to the year ended December 31, 2008 and prior year refers to the year ended December 31, 2007. Additionally, in the discussion below, please refer to our chart on page 29 under Overview . All comparisons are between the periods unless otherwise noted. 36 Table of Contents Segment Results Agricultural Products Year Ended December 31, Increase/ (Decrease) 2008 2007 $ % (in Millions) Revenue $ 1,058.7 $ 889.7 $ 169.0 19 % Operating Profit 245.2 207.0 38.2 18 Revenue of $1,058.7 million increased 19 percent versus the prior year period. North America revenues grew by nine percent, Europe, Middle East and Africa by 33 percent, Asia by 12 percent and Latin America by 22 percent. Revenue benefited from favorable global agrochemical market conditions, increased planted acres in key crops, new product introductions and selective price increases to offset higher input costs. Segment operating profit of $245.2 million was 18 percent higher than the prior year. The earnings from the higher revenue coupled with supply chain productivity improvements from the shutdown of the Baltimore manufacturing facility were partially offset by higher raw materials costs. To a lesser extent, higher selling costs to support the higher revenues also impacted operating profit in 2008. Specialty Chemicals Year Ended December 31, Increase/ (Decrease) 2008 2007 $ % (in Millions) Revenue $ 764.5 $ 659.5 $ 105.0 16 % Operating Profit 152.0 142.7 9.3 7 Revenue of $764.5 million increased 16 percent versus the prior year period of which four percent was the result of revenue from the two acquisitions that closed in the third quarter of 2008. Excluding the effects of these acquisitions, BioPolymer revenues increased 14 percent on volume growth, particularly in food and personal care and price increases to partially offset rising input costs. Lithium revenues increased eight percent versus the prior period where volumes, particularly in primary compounds and specialty organics, have increased. Segment operating profit of $152.0 million was seven percent higher than the prior year. Price increases were offset by rising raw material and energy costs particularly for seaweed and wood pulp during the period of $41.3 million. To a lesser extent, the introduction of export taxes in Argentina in 2008 also reduced operating profits. Industrial Chemicals Year Ended December 31, Increase/ (Decrease) 2008 2007 $ % (in Millions) Revenue $ 1,296.9 $ 1,087.1 $ 209.8 19 % Operating Profit 201.4 92.5 108.9 118 Revenue of $1,296.9 million increased 19 percent versus the prior year period. Alkali revenues increased 16 percent period-over-period primarily due to higher pricing. Soda ash volumes were up marginally. Peroxygen revenues period-over-period were higher by six percent with higher pricing being partially offset by volume declines in the fourth quarter due to the economic downturn. Foret revenues period-over-period were higher by 37 Table of Contents 31 percent due mainly to higher pricing for phosphates, the effect of a stronger euro and improved electricity selling prices. Foret operates electricity cogeneration facilities and sells excess electricity into the Spanish electrical grid. Segment operating profit of $201.4 million was 118 percent higher than the prior period. Higher pricing in Alkali and Foret more than offset the increase in raw materials, particularly for phosphate rock for the segment of $54.6 million period over period. Other Results of Operations Corporate Expenses We recorded charges of $49.8 million in 2008 compared to $52.3 million in 2007. The decrease was primarily due to reduced legal costs associated with the legal settlement with Solutia that occurred in 2007. Corporate expenses are included as a component of the line item Selling, general and administrative expenses on our consolidated statements of income. Other income (expense), net Other income (expense), net is comprised primarily of LIFO inventory adjustments and pension expense. Other expense was $8.6 million in 2008 compared to $12.0 million in expense in 2007. This decrease was primarily due to the mark to market impact of our deferred compensation liability, reduced incentive accruals, lower pension expense partially offset by a charge related to LIFO inventory reserves. Other income (expense), net is included as a component of the line item Costs of sales and services on our consolidated statements of income. Interest Expense, net The 2008 amount decreased to $31.9 million compared to $34.9 million in 2007 primarily due to the replacement of high-interest fixed-rate U.S. debt with lower interest floating-rate U.S. debt. Corporate special income (charges) Restructuring and other charges (income) were $49.6 million in 2008 compared to $164.9 million in 2007. Refer to page 35 for a list of the charges in this category for the year ended December 31, 2008. The restructuring and other charges (income) of $164.9 million recorded in 2007 were a result of the following: Restructuring Charges and Asset Impairments Charges totaling $104.9 million for our phase-out of the Agricultural Products chemical facility in Baltimore, Maryland in our Agricultural Products segment. These charges consisted of (i) plant and equipment impairment charges and accelerated depreciation on fixed assets of $98.7 million and (ii) severance and employee benefits of $6.2 million. Asset abandonment charges of $12.2 million at Foret which is part of our Industrial Chemicals business. These charges include an impairment charge of $8.2 million related to a co-generation facility at Foret. This facility produced electric power and thermal energy by co-generation for use at one of Foret production properties. Additionally, we abandoned certain fixed assets also at Foret and recorded impairment charges of $4.0 million. $6.8 million of severance costs, of which $5.6 million related to our Industrial Chemicals segment and $1.2 million related to our Agricultural Products segment. $1.1 million of asset abandonment charges in our Industrial Chemicals segment. 38 Table of Contents Other Charges (Income), Net Solutia legal settlement of $22.5 million in our Industrial Chemicals segment. This settlement was approved by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in the Southern District of New York (where Solutia had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 2003) on May 1, 2007, without any appeal having been taken. We recorded $1.8 million of charges related to an agreement to settle state court cases alleging violations of antitrust law involving our microcrystalline cellulose product ( MCC ) in our Specialty Chemicals segment. $10.2 million relating to environmental remediation at operating sites as a Corporate charge. A $2.0 million charge related to our Agricultural Products segment acquiring the original rights under a collaboration and license agreement with a third-party company for the purpose of obtaining certain technology and intellectual property rights as well as acquiring the rights from a third-party company to develop their proprietary fungicide. $3.4 million of other charges primarily in our Industrial Chemicals and Specialty Chemicals segments. Impairment of Perorsa joint venture represents a $1.4 million charge related to the impairment of our Perorsa joint venture in our Industrial Chemicals segment. On the consolidated statements of income this charge is included in Equity in (earnings) loss of affiliates for the year ended December 31, 2008. There were no comparable charges in 2007. LIFO inventory correction adjustment represents a non-cash gain of $6.1 million related to an adjustment to our last in, first out (LIFO) inventory reserves as a result of a correction in determining our initial LIFO inventory base year. This gain was recorded to Costs of sales and services for the year ended December 31, 2007 in the consolidated statements of income. There were no comparable gains in 2008. Purchase accounting inventory fair value impact and other related inventory adjustments was a $2.3 million charge related to amortization of the inventory step-up resulting from purchase accounting associated with acquisitions that closed in the third quarter of 2008 in our Specialty Chemicals segment. On the consolidated statements of income, this charge is included in Costs of sales and services for the year ended December 31, 2008. There were no comparable charges in 2007. Gain from Astaris joint venture represents a gain of $0.4 million representing the difference between the carrying value of our remaining investment in the Astaris joint venture and cash received from the joint venture. This gain is included in Equity in (earnings) of affiliates in the consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2007. In 2005, Astaris sold substantially all of the assets of its businesses and the buyers also assumed certain of the liabilities of Astaris. There were no comparable gains in 2008. Noncontrolling interest associated with restructuring and other income (charges) represents $1.4 million associated with our decision to abandon a co-generation facility at Foret during the second quarter of 2007. This amount is shown in Noncontrolling interests on the consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2007. There were no comparable charges in 2008. Loss on extinguishment of debt We recorded a loss of $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, which represented losses related to the write off of certain deferred financing fees related to our previous credit agreement which was replaced in the third quarter of 2007 with our new Domestic Credit Agreement. These fees were previously a component of Other assets in our consolidated balance sheets. We did not incur any comparable charges for the year ended December 31, 2008. 39 Table of Contents Provision for income taxes We recorded a provision of $125.4 million in 2008 compared with a provision of $29.0 million in 2007 resulting in effective tax rates of 26.6 percent and 14.8 percent, respectively. The change in the effective tax rate is primarily a result of a change in the mix of domestic income compared to income earned outside the U.S. The mix of domestic income was impacted by significantly lower Baltimore restructuring charges incurred during 2008 compared to 2007. The effective tax rates were also impacted by tax adjustments recorded during 2008 and 2007. These tax adjustments are described below. 2008 tax adjustments were favorable in the amount of $8.7 million and primarily result from a benefit to adjust our reserve for unrecognized tax benefits due to favorable settlements of tax audits. Partially offsetting this benefit are charges associated with adjustments for prior years tax matters. 2007 tax adjustments were favorable in the amount of $15.4 million and primarily include tax benefits related to the reversal of certain tax valuation allowances. These valuation allowances were no longer necessary because of our expectation that the related deferred tax assets were likely to be realized. Partially offsetting these valuation adjustments were charges associated with adjustments for prior years tax matters. Discontinued operations, net of income tax Discontinued operations, net of income tax totaled a loss of $24.9 million in 2008 versus a loss of $24.3 million in 2007. The 2008 loss is primarily related to environmental charges associated with our Front Royal and Middleport sites and charges for legal reserves and expenses related to discontinued operations. The 2007 loss is primarily related to environmental charges associated with our Middleport, Front Royal and Modesto sites and charges for legal reserves and expenses related to discontinued operations. Net income attributable to FMC stockholders Net income attributable to FMC stockholders increased to $304.6 million in 2008 compared with $132.4 million in 2007 primarily due to higher profits in all three of our segments and significantly reduced restructuring and other charges (income). Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2009 and 2008 were $76.6 million and $52.4 million, respectively. We had total debt of $643.9 million and $623.6 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. This included $588.0 million and $592.9 million of long-term debt (excluding current portions of $22.5 million and $2.1 million) at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The $15.5 million increase in total long-term debt at December 31, 2009 from December 31, 2008 was primarily due to the proceeds from the 2009 senior notes offering partially offset by the full pay down of existing indebtedness under our revolving credit agreements. Short-term debt, which consists of foreign borrowings, increased to $33.4 million at December 31, 2009 compared to $28.6 million at December 31, 2008. 2009 Senior Notes Offering On November 30, 2009, we issued $300 million aggregate principal amount of 5.20% Senior Notes due 2019. The net proceeds from the offering were used to pay down existing indebtedness under our revolving credit agreements and for general corporate purposes. Domestic Credit Agreement On August 28, 2007, we executed a credit agreement (the Domestic Credit Agreement ) which provided for a five-year, $600 million revolving credit facility. The proceeds from this facility are available for general 40 Table of Contents corporate purposes, including issuing letters of credit up to a $300 million sub-limit. The Domestic Credit Agreement also contains an option under which, subject to certain conditions, we may request an increase in the facility to $1 billion. Loans under the facility bear interest at a floating rate, either a base rate as defined, or the applicable euro currency rate for the relevant term plus an applicable margin. The margin is 0.27 percent per year, subject to adjustment based on the credit rating assigned to our senior unsecured debt. At December 31, 2009, the applicable borrowing rates under our Domestic Credit Agreement ranged from 0.5 to 3.3 percent per annum. We had no borrowings under our Domestic Credit Agreement at December 31, 2009 compared to $203.0 million in borrowings at December 31, 2008. Letters of credit outstanding under the Domestic Credit Agreement totaled $153.2 million and $151.5 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Available funds under the Domestic Credit Agreement were $446.8 million at December 31, 2009 and $245.5 million at December 31, 2008. European Credit Agreement On December 16, 2005, our Dutch finance subsidiary executed a credit agreement (the European Credit Agreement ) which provides for an unsecured revolving credit facility in the amount of 220 million. Borrowings may be denominated in euros or U.S. dollars. FMC and our Dutch finance subsidiary direct parent provide guarantees of amounts due under the European Credit Agreement. Loans under the European Credit Agreement bear interest at a euro currency base rate, which for loans denominated in euros is the Euro InterBank Offered Rate, and for loans denominated in dollars is London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ) in each case plus a margin. The applicable margin under our European Credit Agreement is subject to adjustment based on the rating assigned to FMC by each of Moody and S&P. At December 31, 2009 the applicable margin was 0.30 percent and the applicable borrowing rates under the European Credit Agreement ranged from 0.8 to 5.6 percent per annum. At December 31, 2009, we had no borrowings compared to $157.2 million in U.S. dollar equivalent revolving credit facility borrowings at December 31, 2008 under the European Credit Agreement, resulting in available funds of $315.4 million and $150.2 million, respectively. Among other restrictions, the Domestic Credit Agreement and the European Credit Agreement contain financial covenants applicable to FMC and its consolidated subsidiaries related to leverage (measured as the ratio of debt to adjusted earnings) and interest coverage (measured as the ratio of adjusted earnings to interest expense). Our actual leverage for the four consecutive quarters ended December 31, 2009 was 1.4 which is below the maximum leverage of 3.5. Our actual interest coverage for the four consecutive quarters ended December 31, 2009 was 19.0 which is above the minimum interest coverage of 3.5. We were in compliance with all covenants at December 31, 2009. Statement of Cash Flows Cash provided by operating activities for 2009 was $343.5 million. Income from continuing operations of $257.0 million included net charges of $132.8 million, of which $46.3 million was for non-cash asset write-downs on exit of various facilities during the year and $35.2 million of other facilities exit costs to be settled in cash, mainly for severance costs. Cash spending on restructuring and other charges during 2009 was $37.4 million. Also included in restructuring and other income and charges was $20.2 million for environmental remediation at our operating sites, which will be spent in years beyond 2009. Cash spending on environmental remediation at our operating sites in 2009 was $7.4 million, against pre-existing reserves. 41 Table of Contents Receivables in 2009 were a use of cash of $59.3 million as lower receivables in Industrial Chemicals due to the revenue decline was more than offset by increased receivables in Agricultural Products in Brazil, where sales have grown and terms are significantly longer. Inventories were a source of cash of $20.2 million due to lower inventory costs in Industrial Chemicals, particularly for phosphate rock. Accounts Payable were a use of cash of $71.5 million as the higher cost phosphate rock in payables at the end of 2008 was replaced with lower cost phosphate rock at the end of 2009. Accrued pension and other post retirement benefits was a use of cash of $93.4 million which included a voluntary contribution to our US defined benefit plan of $75 million. Cash provided by operating activities for 2008 was $357.4 million. Income from continuing operations of $346.5 million included net charges of $49.6 million, of which $37.5 million was for non-cash asset write-downs on exit of various facilities during the year and $14.7 million of other facilities exit costs to be settled in cash, mainly for severance costs. Cash spending on restructuring and other charges during 2008 was $21.3 million. Also included in restructuring and other income and charges was $16.2 million for environmental remediation at our operating sites, which will be spent in years beyond 2008. Cash spending on environmental remediation at our operating sites in 2009 was $13.6 million, against pre-existing reserves. Receivables in 2008 were a use of cash of $99.0 million due to the higher revenue in all of our businesses and particularly in Agricultural Products in Brazil where terms are significantly longer than in rest of our businesses. Inventories were a use of cash of $91.6 million as inventories were built to support the stronger trading levels experienced in 2008 prior to the global economic turndown. Additionally, inventories in Industrial Chemicals increased due to the rising cost of phosphate rock during 2008. Accounts Payable were a source of cash of $52.0 million reflecting the higher inventory levels and phosphate rock in our accounts payable at year end 2008. Accrued pension and other post retirement benefits were a use of cash of $46.8 million which included a voluntary contribution to our US defined benefit plan of $30 million. Cash provided by operating activities for 2007 was $314.7 million. Income from continuing operations of $166.3 million included net charges of $164.9 million, of which $110.6 million was for non-cash asset write-downs on exit of various facilities during the year and $14.4 million of other facilities exit costs to be settled in cash, mainly for severance costs. Cash spending on restructuring and other charges during 2007 was $29.8 million. Also included in restructuring and other income and charges was $10.2 million for environmental remediation at our operating sites, which will be spent in years beyond 2007. Cash spending on environmental remediation at our operating sites in 2009 was $8.3 million, against pre-existing reserves. Receivables in 2007 were a use of cash of $48.6 million due to the higher revenue in all of our businesses and particularly in Agricultural Products in Brazil where terms are significantly longer than in rest of our businesses. Inventories were a use of cash of $39.6 million as inventories were built to support the stronger trading levels experienced in 2007. Accounts Payable were a source of cash of $10.5 million reflecting the higher inventory levels at year end 2007. Accrued pension and other post retirement benefits were a use of cash of $42.1 million which included a voluntary contribution to our US defined benefit plan of $30 million. 42 Table of Contents Cash required by operating activities of discontinued operations was $42.0 million, $49.8 million and $45.1 million for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The change in 2009 compared to 2008 was due to decreased environmental spending for discontinued sites in 2009. The change in 2008 compared to 2007 was due to increased environmental spending for discontinued sites in 2008. Discontinued environmental spending was $22.1 million in 2009 compared to $32.2 million in 2008 and $22.4 million in 2007. The remaining discontinued cash outflows primarily represents spending against reserves for legal proceedings associated with discontinued operations. Cash required by investing activities was $200.7 million, $191.7 million and $120.6 million for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The increase in cash required in 2009 was driven primarily by significant reduction of proceeds from the sale of the properties and assets during 2009 as compared to 2008 partially offset by reduced spending on acquisitions in 2009. Additionally, capital expenditures in 2009 were approximately $14 million less than the prior year period. The increase in cash required in 2008 was driven primarily by our net acquisition spending of $90.6 million and an increase in our capital expenditure spending primarily in our Industrial Chemicals segment partially offset by proceeds from the sale of the Princeton property of $59.4 million and the sale of sodium sulfate assets of $16.7 million. Cash required by financing activities was $77.8 million, $137.5 million and $243.4 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The change in 2009 compared to 2008 was due primarily to the proceeds from our borrowings of long-term debt, a reduction in repurchases of common stock, and a reduction in repayments of long-term debt partially offset by higher repayments under our committed credit facilities. The change in 2008 compared to 2007 was due primarily to increased borrowings under our committed credit facilities partially offset by higher repayments of long-term debt and repurchases of common stock. Other potential liquidity needs Our cash needs for 2010 include operating cash requirements, capital expenditures, scheduled mandatory payments of long-term debt, dividend payments, contributions to our pension plans, environmental spending and restructuring. We plan to meet our liquidity needs through available cash, cash generated from operations and borrowings under our committed revolving credit facilities. We continually evaluate our options for divesting real estate holdings and property, plant and equipment that are no longer integral to any of our core operating businesses. Projected 2010 capital expenditures are expected to be approximately 20 percent lower than 2009 levels. Projected 2010 spending includes approximately $35 million of net environmental remediation spending. This spending does not include expected spending of approximately $9 million in 2010 on capital projects relating to environmental control facilities. Also, we expect to spend approximately $26 million in 2010 for environmental compliance costs, which we will include as a component of costs of sales and services in our consolidated statements of income since these amounts are not covered by established reserves. Capital spending to expand, maintain or replace equipment at our production facilities may trigger requirements for upgrading our environmental controls, which may increase our spending for environmental controls above the foregoing projections. During 2008, the world equity markets were down significantly, exemplified by the S&P 500 index in the U.S. being down 37 percent. Our U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan ( U.S. Plan ) assets fell from $829.4 million at December 31, 2007 to $563.9 million at December 31, 2008. These same equity markets 43 Table of Contents rebounded significantly in 2009, exemplified by the S&P 500 index in the U.S. being up 26 percent. As a result our U.S. Plan assets increased to $708.4 million at December 31, 2009. Our U.S. Plan assets comprise approximately 93 percent of our total plan assets with the difference representing plan assets related to foreign pension plans. We have reduced our expected return on our U.S. Plan assets from 8.75 percent in 2008 to 8.5 percent in 2009 and will maintain the 8.5 percent assumption in 2010. In developing the assumption for the long-term rate of return on assets for our U.S. Plan, we take into consideration the technical analysis performed by our outside actuaries, including historical market returns, information on the assumption for long-term real returns by asset class, inflation assumptions, and expectations for standard deviation related to these best estimates. We also consider the historical performance of our own plan trust, which has earned a compound annual rate of return of approximately 9.71 percent over the last 20 years (which is in excess of comparable market indices for the same period) as well as other factors. Given an actively managed investment portfolio, the expected annual rates of return by asset class for our portfolio, using geometric averaging, and after being adjusted for an estimated inflation rate of approximately 2.50 percent, is between 8.25 percent and 10.25 percent for equities, and between 4.75 percent and 6.0 percent for fixed-income investments, which generates a total expected portfolio return that is in line with our assumptions for the rate of return on assets. Under The Pension Protection Act of 2006, we are not required to make a minimum level of funding into the U.S. Plan during 2010, however, in order to reduce future funding volatility we intend to contribute $80 million in 2010 versus $75 million contributed in 2009 and $30 million contributed in 2008. We do not believe that the additional contribution will have a significant negative impact on our current and future liquidity needs. However a continuation of the volatility of interest rates and negative equity returns under current market conditions may require greater contributions to the Plan in the future. In April 2007, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $250 million of our common stock. In October 2008, the Board authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $250 million of our common stock. Although the repurchase program does not include a specific timetable or price targets and may be suspended or terminated at any time, we expect that the program will be accomplished over the next two years. Shares may be purchased through open market or privately negotiated transactions at the discretion of management based on its evaluation of market conditions and other factors. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2009, we repurchased 684,681 shares under the publicly announced repurchase program for $35.0 million. The remaining dollar value of shares that may yet be purchased under this program was $189.8 million at December 31, 2009. We also reacquire shares from time to time from employees and non-employee directors to pay taxes owed in connection with the vesting and exercise of awards under our equity compensation plans. Commitments We guarantee repayment of some of the borrowings of certain foreign affiliates accounted for using the equity method. We also guarantee the repayment of a borrowing of a minority partner in a foreign affiliate that we consolidate in our financial statements. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, these guarantees had maximum potential payments of $5.8 million and $6.8 million, respectively. We also provide guarantees to financial institutions on behalf of certain Agricultural Product customers, principally in Brazil, for their seasonal borrowing. The total of these guarantees was $49.5 million and $20.3 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets for each date as Guarantees of vendor financing . Short-term debt consisted of foreign credit lines at December 31, 2009 and 2008. We provide parent-company guarantees to lending institutions providing credit to our foreign subsidiaries. In connection with our property and asset sales and divestitures, we have agreed to indemnify the buyer for certain liabilities, including environmental contamination and taxes that occurred prior to the date of sale. Our 44 Table of Contents indemnification obligations with respect to these liabilities may be indefinite as to duration and may or may not be subject to a deductible, minimum claim amount or cap. As such, it is not possible for us to predict the likelihood that a claim will be made or to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential loss or range of loss. If triggered, we may be able to recover certain of the indemnity payments from third parties. We have not recorded any specific liabilities for these guarantees. We spun off FMC Technologies, Inc. ( Technologies ) in 2001. At this time, we entered into a tax sharing agreement wherein each company is obligated for those taxes associated with its respective business, generally determined as if each company filed its own consolidated, combined or unitary tax returns for any period where Technologies is included in the consolidated, combined or unitary tax return of us or our subsidiaries. The statute of limitations for the 2001 U.S. federal income tax year has now closed and no questions regarding the spin-off were raised during the IRS audit for 2000-2001, therefore any liability for taxes if the spin-off of Technologies were not tax free due to an action taken by Technologies has been favorably concluded. The tax sharing agreement continues to be in force with respect to certain items, which we do not believe would have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Our total significant committed contracts that we believe will affect cash over the next four years and beyond are as follows: Contractual Commitments Expected Cash Payments by Year 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 & beyond Total (in Millions) Debt maturities (1) $ 55.9 $ 97.2 $ $ 2.7 $ 489.5 $ 645.3 Contractual interest (2) 34.1 29.2 25.0 25.0 263.5 376.8 Lease obligations (3) 23.2 21.7 18.6 18.6 62.4 144.5 Certain long-term liabilities (4) 2.1 2.1 2.1 2.1 25.1 33.5 Forward energy and foreign exchange contracts (5) Purchase obligations (6) 44.6 15.9 16.0 12.2 2.2 90.9 Total (7) $ 159.9 $ 166.1 61.7 $ 60.6 $ 842.7 1,291.0 (1) Excluding discounts. (2) Contractual interest is the interest we are contracted to pay on our long-term debt obligations. We had $39.5 million of long-term debt subject to variable interest rates at December 31, 2009. The rate assumed for the variable interest component of the contractual interest obligation was the rate in effect at December 31, 2009. Variable rates are market determined and will fluctuate over time. (3) Before sub-lease rental income. (4) Payments associated with our Ewing research and development facility. (5) At December 31, 2009, the net value of these contracts results in an asset position. (6) Purchase obligations consist of agreements to purchase goods and services that are enforceable and legally binding on us and specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, price provisions and timing of the transaction. We have entered into a number of purchase obligations for the sourcing of materials and energy where take-or-pay arrangements apply. Since the majority of the minimum obligations under these contracts are take-or-pay commitments over the life of the contract as opposed to a year by year take-or-pay, the obligations in the table related to these types of contacts are presented in the earliest period in which the minimum obligation could be payable under these types of contracts. (7) As of December 31, 2009, the liability for uncertain tax positions was $14.4 million and this liability is excluded from the table above. Due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash flows associated with these liabilities, we are unable to make a reasonable reliable estimate of the amount and periods in which these liabilities might be paid. 45 Table of Contents Contingencies On January 28, 2005, we and our wholly owned subsidiary Foret received a Statement of Objections from the European Commission concerning alleged violations of competition law in the hydrogen peroxide business in Europe during the period 1994 to 2001. All of the significant European hydrogen peroxide producers also received the Statement of Objections. We and Foret responded to the Statement of Objections in April 2005 and a hearing on the matter was held at the end of June 2005. On May 3, 2006, we received a notice from the European Commission indicating that the Commission had imposed a fine on us and Foret in the aggregate amount of 25.0 million as a result of alleged violations during the period 1997-1999. In connection with this fine, we recorded an expense of $30.0 million (reflecting then-prevailing exchange rates) in our consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2006. This expense was included as a component of Restructuring and other charges (income) . Since we are not required to make the payment during the appeal process, the liability has been classified as long-term in the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2009 and 2008. Both we and Foret have appealed the decision of the Commission. During the appeal process, interest accrues on the fine at a rate, which as of December 31, 2009, was 4.0 percent per annum. We have provided a bank letter of credit in favor of the European Commission to guarantee our payment of the fine and accrued interest. At December 31, 2009, the amount of the letter of credit was 29.3 million (U.S. $42.0 million). In February 2005 putative direct and indirect purchaser class action complaints were filed against six U.S. hydrogen peroxide producers (and certain of their foreign affiliates) in various federal courts alleging violations of antitrust laws. Federal law provides that persons who have been injured by violations of federal antitrust law may recover three times their actual damage plus attorney fees. Related cases were also filed in various state courts. All of the federal court cases were consolidated in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania (Philadelphia). The District Court certified the direct purchaser class in January 2007. On December 30, 2008, the Court of Appeals vacated the class certification order and remanded the case for further proceedings in the District Court. Shortly thereafter, FMC reached an agreement to settle with the direct purchaser class for $10 million, with a pro rata credit for opt outs. The $10 million figure was included as a component of Restructuring and other charges (income) in our consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2008. On July 14, 2009, the settlement received final approval by the Court. No appeal has been taken and the appeal period has expired. The Court has also approved a settlement with Arkema and finally approved settlements with four of the six original defendant-groups, who collectively paid approximately $90 million. Seventeen companies (predominantly paper producers) have opted out of certain of the settlements with other defendants. Certain of the defendants in the class action have settled those opt out claims for undisclosed amounts. Ten companies (again predominantly paper producers) have opted out of the settlements with FMC and Arkema. FMC has settled with two of the ten for an amount within the opt out credit described above. The remaining eight opt outs have filed suit against FMC and, in some cases, Foret. These cases have been assigned to the same judge as the class action, and the stay of these actions entered by the District Court during the class certification appeal remains in place. FMC has moved to dismiss the opt out claims to the extent they are based on foreign purchases. That motion is fully briefed and awaiting decision by the Court. Another individual opt out case was dismissed following the bankrupt opt out decision to participate in the class settlement. Most of the state court cases have been dismissed, although some remain in California. In the indirect purchaser class action, the Court has lifted the stay to permit discovery related to class certification. Plaintiffs motion for class certification is due in May 2010. FMC intends to defend these cases. Solvay has settled with the indirect purchaser class for $2.1 million. The settlement has not yet been preliminarily approved by the Court. One indirect purchaser filed a claim in federal court in Kansas which has been transferred to the Eastern District of Pennsylvania and assigned to the same judge overseeing other hydrogen peroxide litigation. FMC has moved to dismiss this complaint on statute of limitations grounds. The motion is pending. In addition, putative class actions against the six major hydrogen peroxide producers have been filed in provincial courts in Ontario, Quebec and British Columbia under the laws of Canada. Four of the defendants have settled these claims for a total of approximately $20.5 million. On September 28, 2009, the Ontario Superior Court of Justice certified a class of direct and indirect purchasers of hydrogen peroxide. FMC has moved for leave to appeal the class certification decision and intends to defend these cases. 46 Table of Contents On January 19, 2009, the European Commission decided to initiate proceedings against FMC, its Netherlands subsidiary, and Foret, following an investigation of the European producers of animal feed phosphates. FMC is cooperating with the European Commission in the investigation and has recorded a charge of $21 million reflecting our best estimation of the expense that is likely to be incurred in connection with the resolution of this matter. This charge has been reflected as a component of Restructuring and other charges (income) in our consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2009. This amount is included in Accrued and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2009. We have certain other contingent liabilities arising from litigation, claims, performance guarantees and other commitments incident to the ordinary course of business. Based on information currently available and established reserves, the ultimate resolution of our known contingencies, including the matters described in Note 18 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or liquidity. However, there can be no assurance that the outcome of these contingencies will be favorable, and adverse results in certain of these contingencies could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity . Climate Change We have been following legislative and regulatory developments regarding climate change because the regulation of greenhouse gases, depending on their nature and scope, could subject some of our manufacturing operations to additional costs or limits on operations. On December 29, 2009, EPA Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases Rule became effective. This rule requires FMC to collect information regarding greenhouse gas emissions from our large sources and report them beginning in 2011. Our Alkali Chemicals Division mines and processes trona ore into soda ash and related products at our facilities near Green River, Wyoming. This activity constitutes most of FMC greenhouse gas emissions globally. The direct emissions from these operations are expected to be approximately 2.2 million metric tons in 2010. In addition, two plants in our BioPolymer business are also expected to report emissions above the EPA reporting threshold, but each plant emissions are expected to be substantially less than at our Green River facilities. A significant source of greenhouse gas emissions at Green River are process emissions. That is, a significant portion of the greenhouse gases released during the mining and processing of soda ash occurs naturally in the trona ore feedstock. Unlike energy efficiency, the amount of greenhouse gases present in the trona ore cannot be reduced. All of the companies producing natural soda ash have such process emissions. Yet, the lower energy intensity of natural soda ash provides a favorable carbon intensity compared with synthetic soda ash produced throughout the rest of the world. Energy use is a major cost component of our Alkali Chemicals business, leading to significant focus on reducing all forms of energy. The Alkali division has continued to make investments to lower energy intensity (e.g. co-generation, solution mining). As one of the division key performance indicators, we measure and review monthly the amount of BTUs/ton of soda ash produced. In 2010, the soda ash business has engaged a third party consultant to assist in identifying new methods to reduce energy usage. The Alkali Chemicals Division currently sells products (soda ash, sodium bicarbonate, ground trona) used in environmental scrubbing applications. Federal regulations require utilities and industrial plants to reduce emissions, particularly at coal fired power plants where FMC products are sold. Stiffer regulations are expected to be implemented in the near future (Clean Air Interstate Rule, Maximum Achievable Control Technology, National Ambient Air Quality Standards) that will increase the need for these products. The uncertainty of final climate change legislation will likely lead to existing coal fired utility plants remaining in existence for a longer period of time, sustaining demand for these products. In addition, soda ash is an essential raw material in the production of glass of all kinds. Climate change, energy intensity and alternative forms of energy will drive increased production of new forms of glass (lower 47 Table of Contents emissivity glass, solar panel glass etc.) and will increase the need for this essential raw material from FMC. The soda ash industry has an interest in assuring that climate change legislation or regulation recognizes the benefits of soda ash (particularly natural soda ash) and the challenges facing this industry in controlling its greenhouse gas emissions. On June 26, 2009, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009, which would regulate the emission of greenhouse gases. This legislation includes provisions specific to soda ash, recognizing that as an energy and trade intensive industry it should not be penalized relative to less efficient international competition. The United States Senate is working on its own climate change legislation, but this legislation has not been passed and contains significant differences from the corresponding House legislation. For any new climate change legislation to become law, both chambers of Congress would be required to approve the same legislation, and the President would have to sign the bill. It is not possible at this time to predict whether or when the Senate might act on climate change legislation, or what provisions of the House or Senate legislation would be modified in order to be reconciled with each other to arrive at one unified bill. In the absence of federal climate change legislation, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has moved forward with a finding of endangerment and a proposed tailoring rule to apply the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) provisions of the Clean Air Act to greenhouse gas emissions. This rule is expected to be challenged in court, and there may be bills introduced in Congress to withdraw EPA authority to regulate greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act while Congress considers enactment of federal legislation. Even if the tailoring rule is upheld, EPA has not clarified how the rule will be implemented. Because of the many variables, it is premature to make any estimate of the costs of complying with un-enacted federal climate change legislation or as yet un-promulgated federal regulations. At this point our U.S. facilities are not subject to any state or regional greenhouse gas regulation, and our foreign operations outside of Europe and Canada are not subject to national or local greenhouse gas regulation. Although some of our European and Canadian operations may be subject to greenhouse gas regulation, the cost to these facilities has not been and is not expected to be significant, and effect of European Union and Canadian greenhouse gas regulation has not been and is not expected to be material to FMC. We have considered the potential physical risks to FMC facilities and operations and the indirect consequences of regulation or business trends as a result of potential future climate change. Because of the many variables, not only with respect to the science, but also with respect to the nature and effect of future global climate change regulation itself, it is impossible to predict in any meaningful way what type of property damage or disruptions to our operations or indirect consequences might result from future climate change. Recently Adopted and Issued Accounting Pronouncements and Regulatory Items See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K. Critical Accounting Policies Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. We have described our accounting policies in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K. We have reviewed these accounting policies, identifying those that we believe to be critical to the preparation and understanding of our consolidated financial statements. We have reviewed with the Audit Committee those accounting policies that we have deemed critical. These policies are central to our presentation of results of operations and financial condition and require management to make estimates and judgments on certain matters. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience, current conditions and other reasonable factors. 48 Table of Contents Environmental obligations. We provide for environmental-related obligations when they are probable and amounts can be reasonably estimated. Where the available information is sufficient to estimate the amount of liability, that estimate has been used. Where the information is only sufficient to establish a range of probable liability and no point within the range is more likely than any other, the lower end of the range has been used. Estimated obligations to remediate sites that involve oversight by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), or similar government agencies, are generally accrued no later than when a Record of Decision (ROD), or equivalent, is issued, or upon completion of a Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study (RI/FS) that is submitted by us to the appropriate government agency or agencies. Estimates are reviewed quarterly by our environmental remediation management, as well as by financial and legal management and, if necessary, adjusted as additional information becomes available. The estimates can change substantially as additional information becomes available regarding the nature or extent of site contamination, required remediation methods, and other actions by or against governmental agencies or private parties. Our environmental liabilities for continuing and discontinued operations are principally for costs associated with the remediation and/or study of sites at which we are alleged to have disposed of hazardous substances. Such costs principally include, among other items, RI/FS, site remediation, costs of operation and maintenance of the remediation plan, fees to outside law firms and consultants for work related to the environmental effort, and future monitoring costs. Estimated site liabilities are determined based upon existing remediation laws and technologies, specific site consultants engineering studies or by extrapolating experience with environmental issues at comparable sites. Included in the environmental reserve balance, other assets and reasonably possible loss contingencies for 2009 are potentially recoverable amounts from third party insurance policies, and some of these amounts have been recognized as offsetting recoveries in 2009. Provisions for environmental costs are reflected in income, net of probable and estimable recoveries from named Potentially Responsible Parties (PRPs) or other third parties. Such provisions incorporate inflation and are not discounted to their present values. In calculating and evaluating the adequacy of our environmental reserves, we have taken into account the joint and several liability imposed by Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) and the analogous state laws on all PRPs and have considered the identity and financial condition of each of the other PRPs at each site to the extent possible. We have also considered the identity and financial condition of other third parties from whom recovery is anticipated, as well as the status of our claims against such parties. Although we are unable to forecast the ultimate contributions of PRPs and other third parties with absolute certainty, the degree of uncertainty with respect to each party is taken into account when determining the environmental reserve by adjusting the reserve to reflect the facts and circumstances on a site-by-site basis. Our liability includes our best estimate of the costs expected to be paid before the consideration of any potential recoveries from third parties. We believe that any recorded recoveries related to PRPs are realizable in all material respects. Recoveries are recorded as either an offset in Environmental liabilities, continuing and discontinued or as Other Assets in our consolidated balance sheets. Impairments and valuation of long-lived assets Our long-lived assets include property, plant and equipment and long-term investments, goodwill and intangible assets. We test for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the net book value of these assets may not be recoverable from the estimated undiscounted expected future cash flows expected to result from their use and eventual disposition. In cases where the estimated undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than net book value, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the net book 49 Table of Contents value exceeds the estimated fair value of assets, which is based on discounted cash flows at the lowest level determinable. The estimated cash flows reflect our assumptions about selling prices, volumes, costs and market conditions over a reasonable period of time. We perform an annual impairment test of goodwill in the third quarter. The assumptions used to estimate fair value include our best estimate of future growth rates, discount rates and market conditions over a reasonable period. We performed this test in 2009 and determined that no impairment charge was required. Pensions and other postretirement benefits We provide qualified and nonqualified defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans, as well as postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans to our employees. The costs (benefits) and obligations related to these benefits reflect key assumptions related to general economic conditions, including interest (discount) rates, healthcare cost trend rates, expected rates of return on plan assets and the rates of compensation increases for employees. The costs (benefits) and obligations for these benefit programs are also affected by other assumptions, such as average retirement age, mortality, employee turnover, and plan participation. To the extent our plans actual experience, as influenced by changing economic and financial market conditions or by changes to our own plans demographics, differs from these assumptions, the costs and obligations for providing these benefits, as well as the plans funding requirements, could increase or decrease. When actual results differ from our assumptions, the difference is typically recognized over future periods. In addition, the unrealized gains and losses related to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations may also affect periodic benefit costs (benefits) in future periods. We use certain calculated values of assets under methods both to estimate the expected rate of return on assets component of pension cost and to calculate our plans funding requirements. The expected rate of return on plan assets is based on a market-related value of assets that recognizes investment gains and losses over a five-year period. We use an actuarial value of assets to determine our plans funding requirements. The actuarial value of assets must be within a certain range, high or low, of the actual market value of assets, and is adjusted accordingly. We select the discount rate used to calculate pension and other postretirement obligations based on a review of available yields on high-quality corporate bonds, including Moody Investors Service, Inc. ( Moody ) Aa-rated Corporate and Industrial bond indices. In selecting the discount rate for 2009, we placed particular emphasis on a yield-curve approach designed by our actuary to derive an appropriate discount rate for computing the present value of the future cash flows associated with our pension and other postretirement obligations taking into consideration both the timing and amount of the cash flows. The specific interest rates supporting the yield curve were derived from calculated returns (yields) from a portfolio of high-quality (Aa-graded or higher) bond investments constructed by our actuary. In developing the assumption for the long-term rate of return on assets for our U.S. Plan, we take into consideration the technical analysis performed by our outside actuaries, including historical market returns, information on the assumption for long-term real returns by asset class, inflation assumptions, and expectations for standard deviation related to these best estimates. We also consider the historical performance of our own plan trust, which has earned a compound annual rate of return of approximately 9.71 percent over the last 20 years (which is in excess of comparable market indices for the same period) as well as other factors which are discussed in Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K. For the sensitivity of our pension costs to incremental changes in assumptions see our discussion below. 50 Table of Contents Sensitivity analysis related to key pension and postretirement benefit assumptions. A one-half percent increase in the assumed discount rate would have decreased pension and other postretirement benefit obligations by $54.7 million at December 31, 2009 and $45.4 million at December 31, 2008, and decreased pension and other postretirement benefit costs by $3.1 million, $0.5 million and $3.7 million for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. A one-half percent decrease in the assumed discount rate would have increased pension and other postretirement benefit obligations by $59.9 million at December 31, 2009 and $49.7 million at December 31, 2008, and increased pension and other postretirement benefit net periodic benefit cost by $4.5million, $0.5 million and $6.1 million for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. A one-half percent increase in the assumed expected long-term rate of return on plan assets would have decreased pension costs by $4.2 million, $4.2 million and $4.0 million for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. A one-half percent decrease in the assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets would have increased pension costs by $4.2 million, $4.2 million and $4.0 million for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Further details on our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and net periodic benefit costs (benefits) are found in Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K. Income taxes We have recorded a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized. In assessing the need for this allowance, we have considered a number of factors including future taxable income, the jurisdictions in which such income is earned and our ongoing tax planning strategies. In the event that we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made. Similarly, should we conclude that we would be able to realize certain deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made. Additionally, we file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions. The income tax returns for FMC entities taxable in the U.S. and significant foreign jurisdictions are open for examination and adjustment. We assess our income tax positions and record a liability for all years open to examination based upon our evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. For those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. We adjust these liabilities, if necessary, upon the completion of tax audits or changes in tax law. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors. Dividends On January 21, 2010, we paid dividends aggregating $9.1 million to our shareholders of record as of December 31, 2009. This amount is included in Accrued and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2009. For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, we paid $36.3 million, $34.4 million and $29.7 million in dividends, respectively. 51 Table of Contents
