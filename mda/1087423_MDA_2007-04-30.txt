ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OVERVIEW We are a global leader in providing open source software solutions to the enterprise, including our core enterprise operating system platform, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, our enterprise middleware platform, JBoss Enterprise Middleware, and other Red Hat enterprise technologies. Open source software is an alternative to proprietary software and represents a different model for the development and licensing of commercial software code than that typically used for proprietary software. Because open source software code is freely shared, there are customarily no licensing fees for the distribution of the open source software. Therefore, we do not recognize revenue from the licensing of the code itself. We provide value to our customers through the aggregation, integration, testing, certification, delivery, maintenance and support of our Red Hat enterprise technologies, and by providing a level of scalability, stability and accountability for the enterprise technologies we package and distribute. Moreover, because communities of developers not employed by us assist with the creation of our open source offerings, opportunities for further innovation of our offerings are supplemented by these communities. We sell our enterprise technologies through subscriptions, and we recognize revenue over the period of the subscription agreements with our customers. In addition, we generally provide certain managed services for each of our enterprise technologies, through RHN and JBoss ON, as a component of our subscriptions. We market our offerings primarily to enterprise customers including large enterprises, government organizations, small and medium size businesses and educational institutions. We have focused on introducing and gaining acceptance for Red Hat enterprise technologies that comprise our open source architecture. Since introducing our initial enterprise open source operating system platform, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, it has gained widespread ISV and IHV support. We have continued to build our open source architecture by expanding our enterprise offerings and introducing new systems management services, middleware, clustering capability, file management systems, directory and certificate technologies and enhanced security functionality. We intend to bring the value of open source technology to other key areas of the enterprise infrastructure as the development community efforts support and customer needs dictate. We derive our revenues and generate cash from customers primarily from two sources: (i) subscription revenue and (ii) training and services revenue, as described under Critical Accounting Policies below. The arrangements with our customers that create enterprise subscription revenues are explained in further detail under Critical Accounting Policies below and in NOTE 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. These arrangements typically involve subscriptions to Red Hat enterprise technologies. Our revenues are affected by, among other factors, corporate, government and consumer spending levels. In evaluating the performance of our business, we consider a number of factors, including total revenues, deferred revenues, operating income, operating margin and cash flows from operations. On June 2, 2006 we acquired JBoss, Inc., an open source company whose main products are middleware offerings developed and designed for service-oriented architectures, permitting web-enabled applications to run on open source and other platforms. Revenue. For the year ended February 28, 2007, total revenue increased 43.9% or $122.3 million to $400.6 million from $278.3 million for the year ended February 28, 2006. This increase resulted primarily from an increasing level of adoption of Red Hat Enterprise Linux as a primary computing platform by the larger enterprise customers, as well as growing penetration of the small and mid-sized business market and increased adoption of other Red Hat enterprise technologies. The success of our business model is predicated on the acceptance and widespread deployment of our open source technologies, our ability to generate subscription revenues on a per installed system basis for Red Hat enterprise technology and our ability to increase annual average subscription revenues per customer by providing additional value to our customers in the form of additional technology infrastructure and by providing customers with additional services. Revenue resulting from 36 Table of Contents our recent acquisition of JBoss contributed approximately $23.1 million to the $122.3 million overall increase in revenue for the year ended February 28, 2007. Deferred Revenue. Our deferred revenue, current and long-term, balance at February 28, 2007 was $338.6 million. Because of our subscription model and revenue recognition policies, deferred revenues improve predictability of future revenues. Deferred revenues at February 28, 2007 increased 51.5% as compared to the balance at February 28, 2006 of $223.5 million. Subscriptions. Our enterprise technologies are sold under subscription agreements. These agreements typically have a one or three year subscription period. The subscription entitles the end user to maintenance, which generally consists of a specified level of support, as well as security updates, bug fixes, functionality enhancements and upgrades to the technology, when and if available, during the term of the subscription through our integrated management technologies, RHN and JBoss ON. Our customers have the ability to purchase higher levels of subscriptions that increase the level of support the customer is entitled to receive. Subscription revenue increased each quarter of fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005 and is being driven primarily by the increased market acceptance and use of open source software by the enterprise and our expansion of sales channels and geographic footprint during these periods. Incremental subscription revenues resulting from our June 2, 2006 acquisition of JBoss Inc. totaled approximately $16.8 million for the year ended February 28, 2007. Sales by geography. We operate our business in three geographic regions: The Americas (U.S., Latin America and Canada); EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa); and Asia Pacific (principally Singapore, Japan, India, Australia, South Korea and China). In fiscal 2007, approximately $144.6 million or 36.1% of our revenue was generated outside the United States compared to approximately $98.7 million or 35.5% for fiscal 2006. Our international operations are expected to continue increasing as our international sales force and channels become more mature and as we enter new locations or expand our presence in existing locations. As of February 28, 2007, we have offices in more than 50 locations throughout the world. Income from operations and gross profit margin. Operating income of $52.3 million was 13.1% of total revenue for the year ended February 28, 2007 and reflects $32.4 million of share-based compensation expense of which $30.0 million relates to share-based awards which, prior to the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R, Share-Based Payment ( SFAS 123R ) in fiscal 2007, we would have reported only on a pro-forma basis in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. Subscriptions made up 85.2%, 82.8% and 76.9% of total revenues for the years ended February 28, 2007, February 28, 2006 and February 28, 2005, respectively. The gross profit margin on subscriptions was 92.0%, 90.9% and 91.1% for the years ended February 28, 2007, February 28, 2006 and February 28, 2005, respectively. These two trends, the increased percentage of sales represented by subscriptions and improvements in the gross profit margin of subscriptions, resulted in the improvement of our gross profit margin to 83.8%, 82.6% and 80.4% for the same periods, respectively. Cash, cash equivalents, investments in debt securities and cash flow from operations. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments in debt securities balances at February 28, 2007 totaled $1.2 billion. During fiscal 2007, we generated $201.6 million in cash flow from operations primarily related to the increase in sales of subscriptions during the period. Our significant cash balance gives us a measure of flexibility to take advantage of opportunities such as acquisitions, increasing investment in international areas and purchasing our own common stock and debt securities. In fiscal 2007, we focused on, and expect in fiscal 2008 to continue to focus on, among other things, (i) gaining widespread acceptance and deployment of Red Hat Enterprise Linux as a mission-critical operating system platform by the enterprise and of the JBoss Enterprise Middleware, (ii) generating increasing subscription revenue on a per installed system basis by renewing subscriptions and providing additional value to our customers and by growing the number of enterprise technologies that comprise our open source architecture and (iii) generating increased revenues by providing additional systems management, developer and other services as well as from additional market penetration through a broader and deeper set of channel partner relationships, including OEMs, and our own international expansion, among other means. 37 Table of Contents CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Our critical accounting policies include the following: Revenue recognition; Impairment of long-lived assets; Share-based compensation; and Deferred taxes. Revenue recognition We recognize revenue in accordance with Statement of Position No. 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition ( SOP 97-2 ), as amended by Statement of Position No. 98-4, Deferral of the Effective Date of a Provision of SOP 97-2, and Statement of Position No. 98-9, Modification of SOP 97-2, and Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101, as amended by Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104. We establish persuasive evidence of an arrangement for each type of revenue transaction based on either a signed contract with the end customer, a click-through contract on our website whereby the customer agrees to our standard subscription terms, signed distribution contracts with OEMs and other resellers, or, in the case of individual training seats, through receipt of payment which indicates acceptance of our training agreement terms. Subscription revenue Subscription revenue is comprised of direct and indirect sales of Red Hat enterprise technologies. Accounts receivable and deferred revenue are recorded at the time a customer enters into a binding subscription agreement for the purchase of a subscription, subscription services are made available to the customer and the customer is billed. The deferred revenue amount is amortized to revenue over the life of the subscription. Red Hat enterprise technologies are generally offered with either one or three-year base subscription periods; the majority of our subscriptions have one-year terms. Under these subscription agreements, renewal rates are generally specified for one or three year renewal terms. The base subscription generally entitles the end user to the technology itself and post contract customer support ( PCS ), generally consisting of a specified level of customer support and security errata, bug fixes, functionality enhancements to the technology and upgrades to new versions of the technologies, each on a when-and-if available basis, during the term of the subscription. We sell our open source technologies through two principal channels: (1) direct, which includes sales by our sales force as well as web store sales, and (2) indirect, which includes distributors, resellers and OEMs. We recognize revenue from the sale of Red Hat enterprise technologies ratably over the period of the subscription beginning on the commencement date of the subscription agreement. Subscription arrangements with large enterprise customers often have contracts with multiple elements (e.g., software technology, maintenance, training, consulting and other services). We allocate revenue to each element of the arrangement based on vendor-specific objective evidence of its fair value when we can demonstrate sufficient evidence of the fair value of at least those elements that are undelivered. The fair value of each element in multiple element arrangements is created by either (i) providing the customer with the ability during the term of the arrangement to renew that element at the same rate paid for the element included in the initial term of the agreement or (ii) selling the services on a stand-alone basis. Training and services revenue Training and services are comprised of revenue for consulting, engineering and customer training and education services. Consulting services consist of hourly arrangements, and revenue is recognized as these services are performed. Engineering services represent revenues earned under fixed fee arrangements with our OEM partners and other customers to provide for significant modification and customization of our Red Hat 38 Table of Contents enterprise technologies. We recognize revenues for these fixed fee engineering services using the percentage of completion basis of accounting, provided we have the ability to make reliable estimates of progress towards completion, the fee for such services is fixed or determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is probable. Under the percentage of completion method, earnings under the contract are recognized based on the progress toward completion as estimated using the ratio of labor hours incurred to total expected project hours. Changes in estimates are recognized in the period in which they are known. Revenue for customer training and education services is recognized on the dates the services are complete. Impairment of long-lived assets We evaluate the recoverability of our property and equipment and other assets in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets ( SFAS 144 ). SFAS 144 requires that one accounting model be used for long-lived assets to be disposed of by sale, whether previously held and used or newly acquired, and broadens the presentation of discontinued operations to include more disposal transactions. An impairment loss is recognized when the net book value of such assets exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets or the business to which the assets relate. We perform this assessment on an annual basis, typically during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred. Impairment losses are measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the assets. No significant impairment losses were recognized during fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005. See NOTE 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Share-based compensation Prior to March 1, 2006, we accounted for share-based compensation pursuant to the provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees ( APB 25 ), and accordingly no compensation expense was recorded for stock options or other share-based awards to employees and non-employee directors that were granted with an exercise price equal to or above the market value per share of our common stock on the grant date. For awards granted with an exercise price less than the market value of our stock on the grant date, the award intrinsic value was recorded as deferred compensation and reported as a separate component of stockholders equity. The deferred compensation was amortized to compensation expense over the vesting period of the award. Effective March 1, 2006, we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123R, using the modified-prospective transition method. Under the modified-prospective method, compensation costs recognized for fiscal 2007 include (a) compensation cost for all share-based awards granted prior to, but not yet vested as of, March 1, 2006 based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock-based Compensation ( SFAS 123 ) and (b) compensation costs for all share-based awards granted on or subsequent to March 1, 2006, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 123R and described in NOTE 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In accordance with the provisions of the modified prospective transition method, results for prior fiscal years have not been restated. See NOTE 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further analysis. Deferred taxes We account for income taxes using the liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets or liabilities for the temporary differences between financial reporting and tax bases of our assets and liabilities and for tax carryforwards at enacted statutory tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. During the year ended February 28, 2007, we recorded a net tax expense of $29.7 million, which was net of a tax benefit of approximately $5.0 million from the reduction of a valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets. The reduction of the valuation allowance resulted primarily from our determination 39 Table of Contents that it is more likely than not that the U.S. net operating loss ( NOL ) carryforwards and certain other deferred tax assets are to be realized. However, the benefit of the deferred tax asset attributable to U.S. NOL from stock-based compensation expense deductions, generated prior to adoption of SFAS 123R, are being recognized as and only to the extent that taxes payable are reduced. As these NOL from stock compensation deductions are realized, the benefit of the deferred tax asset is recorded to additional paid in capital. We continue to assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets, which primarily consist of NOL from stock-based compensation expense deductions in the United States. In assessing the realizability of these deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. As of February 28, 2007, the net deferred tax asset balance was $150.5 million of which $131.0 million is offset by a valuation allowance. We continue to record a valuation allowance for certain foreign tax losses, certain stock-based compensation expenses related to excess tax deductions recognized prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R, and an acquired NOL carryforward that is subject to a limitation under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. Our effective tax rate could be affected by, among other things, changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates and certain stock-based compensation expenses arising from SFAS 123R. 40 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Years ended February 28, 2007 and February 28, 2006 The following table is a summary of our results of operations for the years ended February 28, 2007 and February 28, 2006 (in thousands): Year Ended $ Change % Change February 28, 2007 February 28, 2006 Revenue: Subscriptions $ 341,206 $ 230,444 $ 110,762 48.1 % Training and services 59,418 47,886 11,532 24.1 Total subscription and training and services revenue 400,624 278,330 122,294 43.9 Cost of subscription and training and services revenue: Cost of subscriptions 27,457 21,003 6,454 30.7 As a % of subscription revenue 8.0 % 9.1 % Cost of training and services 37,279 27,504 9,775 35.5 As a % of training and services revenue 62.7 % 57.4 % Total cost of subscription and training and services revenue 64,736 48,507 16,229 33.5 As a % of total revenue 16.2 % 17.4 % Total gross profit 335,888 229,823 106,065 46.2 As a % of total revenue 83.8 % 82.6 % Operating expense: Sales and marketing 145,562 84,723 60,839 71.8 Research and development 71,038 40,883 30,155 73.8 General and administrative 66,999 46,135 20,864 45.2 Total operating expense 283,599 171,741 111,858 65.1 As a % of total revenue 70.8 % 61.7 % Income from operations 52,289 58,082 (5,793 ) (10.0 ) Other income, net 43,290 30,053 13,237 44.0 Interest expense (6,016 ) (6,119 ) 103 (1.7 ) Income before provision for income taxes 89,563 82,016 7,547 9.2 Provision for income taxes 29,656 2,331 27,325 1,172.2 Net income $ 59,907 $ 79,685 $ (19,778 ) (24.8 )% As a % of total revenue 15.0 % 28.6 % Revenue Subscription revenue Subscription revenue, which is primarily comprised of direct and indirect sales of Red Hat enterprise technologies, increased by 48.1% or $110.8 million to $341.2 million for the year ended February 28, 2007 from $230.4 million for the same period ended February 28, 2006. The increase in subscription revenue is primarily being driven by subscriptions to our principal enterprise technology, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, which has gained broader market acceptance in mission critical areas of computing and our international expansion. The increase is, in part, a result of the continued migration of larger enterprises in industries such as financial services to our open source platform from a proprietary Unix platform. JBoss offerings, included in the above results from the 41 Table of Contents date of acquisition, contributed $16.8 million in subscription revenue for the year ended February 28, 2007. We expect subscription revenue to continue an upward trend with the increased market acceptance for our offerings and with our continued international expansion. Training and services revenue Training revenue includes fees paid by our customers for delivery of educational materials and instruction. Services revenue includes fees for services received from customers for deployment of Red Hat enterprise technologies, and for delivery of added functionality to Red Hat Enterprise Linux or other technologies for our major customers and OEM partners. Training and services revenue increased by 24.1% or $11.5 million to $59.4 million for the year ended February 28, 2007 from $47.9 million for the same period ended February 28, 2006. The adoption of Linux and other open source technologies as a primary computing platform increases the need for training and consulting services. Accordingly, training revenue increased by 12.9% or $4.1 million as a result of continued demand for Red Hat Certified Engineers, Technicians and Architects. Additionally, we enabled more resellers to provide our training services which increased the availability of training classes. Services revenue increased by 46.0% or $7.4 million. This trend is expected to continue as Red Hat Enterprise Linux and other open source technology subscription sales continue to grow. JBoss offerings, included in the above results from the date of acquisition, added $6.3 million to training and services revenue for the year ended February 28, 2007. Cost of revenue Cost of subscription revenue The cost of subscription revenue primarily consists of expenses we incur to support, distribute, manufacture and package Red Hat enterprise technologies. These costs include labor related cost to provide technical support and maintenance, as well as cost for fulfillment, physical media, literature, packaging and shipping. Cost of subscription revenue increased by 30.7% or $6.5 million to $27.5 million for the year ended February 28, 2007 from $21.0 million for the same period ended February 28, 2006. Costs to deliver JBoss offerings contributed $2.5 million to the overall increase. The remaining increase is primarily the result of continued additions to our technical support staff to meet the demands of our growing subscriber base. As the number of open source technology subscriptions continues to increase, we expect associated support cost will continue to increase, although we anticipate this will occur at a rate slower than that of subscription revenue growth. Cost of training and services revenue Cost of training and services revenue is mainly comprised of personnel and third party consulting costs for the design, development and delivery of custom engineering, training courses and professional services provided to certain customers. Cost of training and services revenue increased by 35.5% or $9.8 million to $37.3 million for the year ended February 28, 2007 from $27.5 million for the same period ended February 28, 2006. Costs to deliver JBoss offerings contributed $2.8 million to the overall increase. Also contributing to the increase is $1.4 million of compensation cost related to share-based awards which, prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R in fiscal 2007, we reported on a pro-forma basis in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. The remaining difference is related to the increased use of outside contractors and the increased rental of off-premise training facilities to meet the growing demand for our training courses in an increased number of locations. As well we are using a greater number of outside contractors to meet the growing demand for our professional services. We anticipate continued increased demand for training for Red Hat Certified Engineers, Technicians and Architects. As a result we anticipate expanding further the number of available classes to meet the demand in the coming year. 42 Table of Contents Gross profit Gross profit increased by 46.2% or $106.1 million to $335.9 million for the year ended February 28, 2007 from $229.8 million for the same period ended February 28, 2006. Gross profit margin was 83.8% and 82.6% of total revenues for the years ended February 28, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The increase in gross profit and gross profit margin was primarily due to the continued increase in revenue and profitability of our Red Hat Enterprise Linux subscription offerings. While we are selling an increased volume of subscriptions, the costs to deliver these subscriptions, as a percentage of subscription revenue, has decreased to 8.0% for the year ended February 28, 2007 from 9.1% for the same period ended February 28, 2006. This is in part due to scale and efficiencies resulting from advancements in our packaging and shipping processes which allow us to deliver more of our subscriptions via lower cost electronic delivery when compared to box delivery. Operating expenses Sales and marketing Sales and marketing expense consists primarily of salaries and other related costs for sales and marketing personnel, sales commissions, travel, public relations and marketing materials and trade shows. Sales and marketing expense increased by 71.8% or $60.8 million to $145.6 million for the year ended February 28, 2007 from $84.7 million for the same period ended February 28, 2006. This increase was primarily due to a $33.4 million increase in sales compensation and related $2.9 million in travel costs primarily due to recent acquisitions of businesses and an organic expansion of our dedicated sales force from the prior year. The increased sales compensation cost includes an additional $7.0 million of compensation cost related to share-based awards which, prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R in fiscal 2007, we reported on a pro-forma basis in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. Marketing costs also increased by $13.6 million of which $5.4 million relates to additional advertising expenses and promotional sponsorships primarily focused on our major partners and $6.5 million related to increased marketing compensation costs, including $2.0 million for share-based awards which, prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R in fiscal 2007, were previously reported on a pro-forma basis in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. The remaining increase in sales and marketing costs relate to technology infrastructure enhancements and incremental amortization expense related to recently acquired identifiable intangibles, including licensing agreements, trademarks and customer reseller relationships. These increased investments to build our Red Hat brand across a growing number of locations throughout the world resulted in an increase of sales and marketing expense, as a percentage of revenues, from 30.4% for the year ended February 28, 2006 to 36.3% for the year ended February 28, 2007. Research and development Research and development expense consists primarily of personnel and related costs for development of software technologies and systems management offerings. Research and development expense increased by 73.8% or $30.2 million to $71.0 million for the year ended February 28, 2007 from $40.9 million for the same period ended February 28, 2006. The increase in research and development costs resulted from both the additional expansion of our engineering group through direct hire and the acquisition of businesses. Related compensation expenses increased by $24.8 million, including $7.2 million of compensation cost related to share-based awards which, prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R in fiscal 2007, we reported on a pro-forma basis in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. The expansion of our existing engineering group primarily relates to additional engineering resources to support the expansion of our product offerings and the localization of new and existing products into multiple languages. The remaining increase in research and development costs relate to technology infrastructure enhancements. Research and development expense was 17.7% and 14.7% of total revenues for the years ended February 28, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Investing in research and development has been a priority for Red Hat and we anticipate continued spending as we expand our offerings in clustering and virtualization technology. Incremental research and development costs related to JBoss offerings and included in the above variances totaled $6.2 million. 43 Table of Contents General and administrative General and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel and related costs for general corporate functions, including finance, accounting, legal, human resources, facilities and information systems expense. General and administrative expense increased by 45.2% or $20.9 million to $67.0 million for the year ended February 28, 2007 from $46.1 million for the same period ended February 28, 2006. Approximately $10.0 million is compensation cost related to share-based awards which, prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R in fiscal 2007, we reported on a pro-forma basis in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. In addition, increased headcount across all functions to help the business scale increased non-share based compensation and travel by $7.4 million and $1.0 million, respectively. The remaining increase in general and administrative costs relates to technology infrastructure enhancements. General and administrative expense was approximately 16.7% of total revenues for each of the years ended February 28, 2007 and 2006. Other income, net Other income, net consists of interest income earned on cash deposits in money market accounts and investments in short and long-term fixed income instruments, gain on the extinguishment of certain long-term debt, net gains realized on the sale of investments and foreign currency revaluation gains and losses. Other income, net increased by 44.0% or $13.2 million to $43.3 million for the year ended February 28, 2007 from $30.1 million for the same period ended February 28, 2006. The increase is primarily related to a $15.0 million increase in interest income which is partially offset by a reduction of $3.1 million net gain recognized on the extinguishment of long-term debt during the year ended February 28, 2006. The increase in interest income is primarily attributable to higher rates of return and higher cash and investment balances. Interest expense During the year ended February 28, 2007, interest expense decreased 1.7% or $0.1 million to $6.0 million from $6.1 million for the same period ended February 28, 2006. The decrease resulted from the repurchase of convertible debentures during the first half of fiscal 2006. Long-term convertible debentures outstanding at February 28, 2007 and 2006 totaled $570 million. Income taxes During the year ended February 28, 2007, we recorded approximately $29.7 million of income tax expense, which resulted in an effective tax rate of 33.1%. Our effective tax rate differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the reversal of the valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets. The provision for income tax expense for the year ended February 28, 2007, consists of approximately $28.2 million of U.S. income tax expense and approximately $1.5 million of foreign income tax expense. 44 Table of Contents Years ended February 28, 2006 and February 28, 2005 The following table is a summary of our results of operations for the years ended February 28, 2006 and February 28, 2005 (in thousands): Year Ended $ Change % Change February 28, 2006 February 28, 2005 Revenue: Subscriptions $ 230,444 $ 151,125 $ 79,319 52.5 % Training and services 47,886 45,341 2,545 5.6 Total subscription and training and services revenue 278,330 196,466 81,864 41.7 Cost of subscription and training and services revenue: Cost of subscriptions 21,003 13,488 7,515 55.7 As a % of subscription revenue 9.1 % 8.9 % Cost of training and services 27,504 24,999 2,505 10.0 As a % of training and services revenue 57.4 % 55.1 % Total cost of subscription and training and services revenue 48,507 38,487 10,020 26.0 As a % of total revenue 17.4 % 19.6 % Total gross profit 229,823 157,979 71,844 45.5 As a % of total revenue 82.6 % 80.4 % Operating expense: Sales and marketing 84,723 62,939 21,784 34.6 Research and development 40,883 32,468 8,415 25.9 General and administrative 46,135 35,626 10,509 29.5 Total operating expense 171,741 131,033 40,708 31.1 As a % of total revenue 61.7 % 66.7 % Income from operations 58,082 26,946 31,136 115.5 Other income, net 30,053 24,431 5,622 23.0 Interest expense (6,119 ) (6,436 ) 317 (4.9 ) Income before provision (benefit) for income taxes 82,016 44,941 37,075 82.5 Provision (benefit) for income taxes 2,331 (485 ) 2,816 580.6 Net income $ 79,685 $ 45,426 $ 34,259 75.4 % As a % of total revenue 28.6 % 23.1 % Revenue Subscription revenue Subscription revenue increased by 52.5% or $79.3 million to $230.4 million for the year ended February 28, 2006 from $151.1 million for the same period ended February 28, 2005. The increase in subscription revenue was driven by subscriptions to our principal enterprise technology, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, which gained broader market acceptance in mission critical areas of computing and our international expansion, especially in Asia. The increase was a result of the continued migration of larger enterprises in industries such as financial services to our Red Hat Enterprise Linux platform from a proprietary Unix platform. Training and services revenue Training and services revenue increased by 5.6% or $2.5 million to $47.9 million for the year ended February 28, 2006 from $45.3 million for the same period ended February 28, 2005. The adoption of Linux as a 45 Table of Contents primary computing platform increased the need for training and consulting services. Accordingly, training revenues increased by $1.8 million or 5.9% as a result of continued demand for Red Hat Certified Engineers, Technicians and Architects. Additionally, we enabled more resellers to provide our training services which increased the availability of training classes. Professional services revenue increased by $0.8 million or 5.2%, with the majority of the increase related to the deployment of Red Hat Enterprise Linux. Cost of revenue Cost of subscription revenue Cost of subscription revenue increased by 55.7% or $7.5 million to $21.0 million for the year ended February 28, 2006 from $13.5 million for the same period ended February 28, 2005. The increase was the result of continued additions to our technical support staff to meet the demands of our growing subscriber base. Additionally, amortization of intellectual property directly related to the delivery of subscriptions increased by $2.0 million. Cost of training and services revenue Cost of training and services revenue increased by 10.0% or $2.5 million to $27.5 million for the year ended February 28, 2006 from $25.0 million for the same period ended February 28, 2005. The majority of the increase was directly related to training and the increased capacity both in educators and classroom space. Gross profit Gross profit increased by 45.5% or $71.8 million to $229.8 million for the year ended February 28, 2006 from $158.0 million for the same period ended February 28, 2005. Gross profit margin was 82.6% and 80.4% of total revenues for the years ended February 28, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase in gross profit and gross profit margin was primarily due to the continued increase in revenue and profitability of our Red Hat Enterprise Linux subscription offerings and a growing percentage of subscriptions delivered electronically. Operating expenses Sales and marketing Sales and marketing expense increased by 34.6% or $21.8 million to $84.7 million for the year ended February 28, 2006 from $62.9 million for the same period ended February 28, 2005. This increase was primarily due to a $16.8 million increase in the cost of compensation and travel due to an expansion of our dedicated sales force by 76% from the prior year. Marketing cost also increased by $2.6 million mainly related to additional advertising expenses and promotional sponsorships focused on our major partners. Sales and marketing expense was 30.4% and 32.0% of total revenues for the years ended February 28, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Research and development Research and development expense increased by 25.9% or $8.4 million to $40.9 million for the year ended February 28, 2006 from $32.5 million for the same period ended February 28, 2005. The increase in research and development expense resulted from the additional expansion of our engineering group and was mainly compensation and related expenses and consulting fees, which increased $7.2 million and $0.6 million, respectively. This expansion related to the acquisition of certain assets of Netscape in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 and additional engineering resources to support the localization of our product offerings in multiple languages. Research and development expense was 14.7% and 16.5% and of total revenues for the years ended February 28, 2006 and 2005, respectively. General and administrative General and administrative expense increased by 29.5% or $10.5 million to $46.1 million for the year ended February 28, 2006 from $35.6 million for the same period ended February 28, 2005. The majority of the increase, 46 Table of Contents approximately $7.1 million, was a result of additional headcount across all functions to help the business scale. That increase was partially offset by a $0.7 million decrease in professional services fees in the information systems functions as a number of contractors converted to employees and a $0.5 million decrease in accounting fees relating to Sarbanes-Oxley Section 404 compliance. Facilities cost and depreciation increased by approximately $3.4 million during the year ended February 28, 2006 related to additional office and computer equipment associated with increased staffing. Additionally, we had a loss on disposal of assets of approximately $1.3 million related to disposal of computer equipment and leasehold improvements. Other administrative costs such as bank fees, property taxes, franchise taxes, travel and office supplies cost make up the remainder of the increase. General and administrative expense was 16.6% and 18.1% and of total revenues for the years ended February 28, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Other income, net Other income, net increased by 23.0% or $5.6 million to $30.1 million for the year ended February 28, 2006 from $24.4 million for the same period ended February 28, 2005. The increase was primarily related to a $5.6 million increase in interest income and a $3.1 million net gain recognized on the extinguishment of long-term debt during the year ended February 28, 2006. The increase in interest income was primarily attributable to higher rates of return and higher cash and investment balances. This increase was partially offset by a decrease of $2.2 million in realized gains on the sale of investments and losses of $1.4 million related to the write down of certain other long-term investments. Interest expense Interest expense decreased 4.9% or $0.3 million to $6.1 million for the year ended February 28, 2006 from $6.4 million for the same period ended February 28, 2005. The decrease resulted from the repurchase of convertible debentures. During the year ended February 28, 2006, we repurchased $30.0 million of the $600.0 million of outstanding long-term debentures. Income taxes During the year ended February 28, 2006, we recorded $2.3 million of income tax expense, which resulted in an effective rate of 2.8%. Our effective tax rate differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to U.S. NOL carryforwards. The provision for income tax expense for the year ended February 28, 2006 consists of foreign income tax expense. We recorded $4.3 million of foreign income tax expense and recognized a $2.0 million deferred tax benefit, due to foreign NOLs. During the year ended February 28, 2005, we recorded a net tax benefit of approximately $0.5 million. We recorded $3.1 million of income tax expense and recognized a $3.6 million deferred tax benefit, primarily related to the reversal of the valuation allowance pertaining to certain foreign deferred tax assets as it was determined to be more likely than not that the deferred tax assets in these foreign jurisdictions would be realized. ACQUISITIONS Acquisition of JBoss, Inc. On June 2, 2006, we completed our previously announced acquisition of JBoss, Inc. for approximately $328.8 million in base consideration. We are also obligated to pay an additional approximately $46.0 million pursuant to the acquisition agreement upon the achievement of certain performance milestones related to sales of JBoss products and services during the calendar year 2007. For further discussion related to this acquisition see NOTE 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Acquisition of Netscape Security Solutions On December 7, 2004, we completed the purchase of the Netscape Security Solutions unit from Netscape Communications Corporation and America Online, Inc. for a purchase price of $21.1 million in cash. The assets 47 Table of Contents acquired include a directory server and certificate management system. In April 2005, an additional $2.5 million was paid under an earn-out provision, resulting in an increase in goodwill by the same amount. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES We have historically derived a significant portion of our liquidity and operating capital from the sale of equity securities, including private sales of preferred stock and the sale of common stock in our initial and secondary public offerings, the issuance of convertible debentures and borrowings under working capital lines of credit. At February 28, 2007, we had total cash and investments of $1.2 billion, which was comprised of $527.2 million in cash and cash equivalents, $350.8 million of short-term, fixed-income investments and $278.0 million of long-term, fixed-income investments. This compares to total cash and investments of $1.1 billion at February 28, 2006. We currently have sufficient liquidity with $527.2 million in cash and cash equivalents on hand that we presently do not intend to liquidate our short and long-term investments prior to their scheduled maturity dates. However, in the event that we did liquidate these investments prior to their scheduled maturities and there were no changes in market interest rates, we could be required to recognize a realized loss on those investments when we liquidate. At February 28, 2006, we have an unrealized loss of $2.1 million on our investments in debt securities compared to $9.8 million at February 28, 2006. Year ended February 28, 2007 At February 28, 2007, cash and cash equivalents totaled $527.2 million, an increase of $259.7 million as compared to February 28, 2006. The increase in cash and cash equivalents for the year ended February 28, 2007 resulted from maturities of investment securities of $781.5 million, cash from operations which contributed $201.6 million, excess tax benefits from share-based payment arrangements of $16.0 million, other net proceeds of $23.0 million from employee-related stock transactions and proceeds from structured stock repurchase transactions of $1.5 million. Partially offsetting these cash increases were purchases of investment securities of $592.7 million, payments made for acquisitions of businesses which totaled $149.9 million for the year ended February 28, 2007 and purchases of property and equipment of $22.6 million for the same period. Effects of foreign currency exchange rates resulted in an increase to cash of approximately $1.4 million for the year ended February 28, 2007. Change in presentation of cash flows resulting from the adoption of SFAS 123R SFAS 123R requires that the portion of income tax benefits resulting from tax deductions in excess of a share-based award original grant date fair value, the excess tax benefits , be presented as a source of cash flow from financing activities. Prior to our adoption of SFAS 123R in fiscal 2007, had we realized such excess tax benefits from the exercise of share-based awards, we would have presented these excess tax benefits as a source of cash flow from operating activities. For fiscal 2007, we recognized $24.5 million of income tax benefits from share-based awards, of which $16.0 million resulted from tax deductions in excess of the original grant date fair value of the awards. These excess tax benefits from share-based arrangements have been reclassified from cash provided by operating activities to cash provided by financing activities on our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the year ended February 28, 2007. For further discussion, see NOTE 2 to Consolidated Financial Statements. Cash flows from operations Cash provided by operations of $201.6 million during the year ended February 28, 2007 includes net income of $59.9 million, adjustments to exclude the impact of non-cash revenues and expenses, which totaled $72.3 million net source of cash, and changes in working capital, which totaled $85.3 million net source of cash, primarily resulting from an increase in deferred revenue of $90.4 million. The increase in deferred revenue is due 48 Table of Contents to growth in billings as we generally bill our customers in advance of subscription periods. Partially offsetting these sources of operating cash flow was a reclassification of excess tax benefits of $16.0 million related to share-based compensation, as described above. Cash flows from investing Cash provided by investing activities of $16.7 million for the year ended February 28, 2007 includes maturities of investment securities of $781.5 million. Partially offsetting theses maturities were purchases of investment securities which totaled $592.7 million, payments, net of cash acquired, related to business acquisitions of $149.9 million, which includes our recent acquisition of JBoss, businesses in Brazil and Argentina and the acquisition of the remaining minority interest related to our joint venture in India. Also partially offsetting these maturities were investments in property and equipment, primarily information technology infrastructure, which totaled $22.6 million for the year ended February 28, 2007. Cash flows from financing Cash provided by financing activities of $40.0 million for the year ended February 28, 2007 is primarily comprised of $24.3 million in proceeds from employees exercise of common stock options, $16.0 million from excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation and proceeds from structured stock repurchase transactions of $1.5 million. Partially offsetting proceeds from these sources were repurchases of shares related to employee and non-employee directors withholding taxes of $1.7 million. Year ended February 28, 2006 At February 28, 2006, cash and cash equivalents totaled $267.5 million, an increase of $127.4 million as compared to February 28, 2005. The increase in cash and cash equivalents resulted primarily from $186.6 million in cash provided by operations and $44.1 million from the exercise of common stock options. Partially offsetting these sources of cash were uses of cash, including repurchase of convertible debt of $26.3 million, purchases of long-term investments of $22.2 million, net purchases of investment securities of approximately $20.4 million, purchases of property and equipment of approximately $16.8 million and purchases of stock of $16.7 million. Cash flows from operations Cash provided by operations of $186.6 million in the year ended February 28, 2006 includes net income of $79.7 million, adjustments to exclude the impact of non-cash revenues and expenses, which totaled a $21.4 million net source of cash, and changes in working capital, which totaled $85.5 million net source of cash, primarily resulting from an increase in deferred revenue of $91.3 million and an increase in accrued expenses of $10.5 million. These working capital sources of cash were partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable and earnings in excess of billings of $10.8 million, an increase of $3.1 million in prepaid and other current assets and a decrease in accounts payable of $2.6 million. Cash flows from investing Cash used in investing activities of $62.3 million for the year ended February 28, 2006 is primarily comprised of purchases of long-term investments of $22.2 million, including $20.0 million for our investment in Open Invention Network LLC, net purchases of fixed income investment securities of approximately $20.4 million and purchases of property and equipment of approximately $16.8 million. Cash flows from financing Cash provided by financing activities of $5.7 million for the year ended February 28, 2006 is primarily comprised of $44.0 million in proceeds from employees exercise of common stock options, $3.4 million in 49 Table of Contents proceeds and withholding from issuance of common stock due to employees purchases under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan, and $1.0 million from proceeds of structured stock repurchases, partially offset by repurchase of convertible debt of $26.3 million and repurchase of common stock of $16.7 million. Convertible debentures In January 2004, we issued $600.0 million in convertible senior debentures, of which $570 million remain outstanding. The debentures mature on January 15, 2024 and bear interest at a rate of 0.5% per annum, payable semiannually on January 15 and July 15 of each year. The debentures are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of our other existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated debt. The debentures are convertible into shares of our common stock under certain circumstances prior to maturity at a conversion rate of 39.0753 shares per $1,000 principal amount of debentures (which represents a conversion price of approximately $25.59 per share) subject to adjustment under certain conditions. We may redeem the debentures, in whole or in part, in cash at any time on or after January 15, 2009. Holders of the debentures may require us to redeem the debentures, in whole or in part, in cash on January 15 of 2009, 2014 and 2019. As of February 28, 2007, no debentures were redeemed. Accrued interest to the redemption date will be paid by us in any such redemption. Interest payments of $2.9 million were made during fiscal 2007 and 2006. Accrued interest at February 28, 2007 and February 28, 2006 was $0.4 million. See NOTE 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Capital requirements We have experienced a substantial increase in our operating expenses since our inception in connection with the growth of our operations, the development of our enterprise technologies, the expansion of our services operations and our acquisition activity. Our capital requirements during the year ending February 28, 2008 will depend on numerous factors, including the amount of resources we devote to: Funding the continued development of our enterprise technology products; accelerating the development of our systems management services; improving and extending our services and the technologies used to deliver these services to our customers; pursuing strategic acquisitions and alliances; and making possible investments in businesses, products and technologies. We have utilized, and will continue to utilize, cash and investments to fund, among other potential uses, purchases of our common stock, purchases of our convertible debentures, purchases of fixed assets and mergers and acquisitions. Given our historically strong operating cash flow and the $1.2 billion of cash and investments held at February 28, 2007 we do not presently anticipate the need to raise cash to fund our operations, either through the sale of additional equity or through the issuance of debt for the foreseeable future. However, we may take advantage of favorable capital market situations that may arise from time to time to raise additional capital. We believe that cash flow from operations will continue to improve; however, there can be no assurances that we will improve our cash flow from operations from the current rate or that such cash flows will be adequate to fund other investments or acquisitions that we may choose to make. We may choose to accelerate the expansion of our business from our current plans, which may require us to raise additional funds through the sale of equity or debt securities or through other financing means. There can be no assurances that any such financing would occur in amounts or on terms favorable to us, if at all. 50 Table of Contents Off-balance sheet arrangements We have no off-balance sheet financing arrangements and do not utilize any structured debt , special purpose or similar unconsolidated entities for liquidity or financing purposes. Contractual obligations The following table summarizes our principal contractual obligations at February 28, 2007 (in thousands): Total Less than 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More than 5 Years Operating lease obligations $ 51,030 $ 8,833 $ 14,833 $ 8,885 $ 18,479 Purchase obligations 2,558 1,308 750 500 Convertible debentures, including related interest 618,450 2,850 5,700 5,700 604,200 Total $ 672,038 $ 12,991 $ 21,283 $ 15,085 $ 622,679 RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See discussion in NOTE 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
