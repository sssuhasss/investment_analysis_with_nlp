Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations OVERVIEW The following discussion and analysis is intended to help you understand us, our operations and our financial performance. It should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes, which are included elsewhere in this report. We are one of the largest branded apparel companies in the world, with a history going back over 135 years. Our brand portfolio consists of nationally and internationally recognized trademarks, including TOMMY HILFIGER , CALVIN KLEIN , Van Heusen , IZOD , ARROW , Speedo (licensed in perpetuity for North America and the Caribbean from Speedo International Limited), Warner , Olga , True&Co. and Geoffrey Beene. Our brand portfolio also consists of various other owned, licensed and private label brands. Our business strategy is to position our brands to sell globally at various price points and in multiple channels of distribution. This enables us to offer products to a broad range of consumers, while minimizing competition among our brands and reducing our reliance on any one demographic group, product category, price point, distribution channel or region. We also license the use of our trademarks to third parties and joint ventures for product categories and in regions where we believe our licensees expertise can better serve our brands. Our revenue was $9.657 billion in 2018, of which over 50% was generated outside of the United States. Our global designer lifestyle brands, TOMMY HILFIGER and CALVIN KLEIN , together generated over 80% of our revenue. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Operations Overview We generate net sales from (i) the wholesale distribution to retailers, franchisees, licensees and distributors of dress shirts, neckwear, sportswear, jeanswear, performance apparel, intimate apparel, underwear, swim products, handbags, accessories, footwear and other related products under owned and licensed trademarks, including through digital commerce sites operated by our wholesale partners and pure play digital commerce retailers, and (ii) the sale of certain of these products through (a) approximately 1,700 Company-operated free-standing retail store locations worldwide under our TOMMY HILFIGER , CALVIN KLEIN and certain of our heritage brands trademarks, (b) approximately 1,500 Company-operated shop-in-shop/concession locations worldwide under our TOMMY HILFIGER and CALVIN KLEIN trademarks, and (c) digital commerce sites in over 30 countries under each of our TOMMY HILFIGER and CALVIN KLEIN trademarks and in the United States through our SpeedoUSA .com, TrueAndCo .com, VanHeusen .com, IZOD .com and styleBureau .com digital commerce sites. Additionally, we generate royalty, advertising and other revenue from fees for licensing the use of our trademarks. We manage our operations through our operating divisions, which are presented as six reportable segments: (i) Tommy Hilfiger North America; (ii) Tommy Hilfiger International; (iii) Calvin Klein North America; (iv) Calvin Klein International; (v) Heritage Brands Wholesale; and (vi) Heritage Brands Retail. We have entered into the following transactions, which impact our results of operations and comparability among the years, including our 2019 expectations as compared to 2018, as discussed in the section entitled Result of Operations below: We will be closing our TOMMY HILFIGER flagship and anchor stores in the United States in the first quarter of 2019. We expect to incur pre-tax costs of approximately $60 million during 2019, primarily consisting of severance, noncash asset impairments and lease and other contract termination costs. We announced in the first quarter of 2019 that we had entered into definitive agreements for two pending acquisitions. The first is for purposes of acquiring the approximately 78% interest in Gazal that we do not already own. We, along with Gazal, jointly own and manage PVH Australia, which licenses and operates businesses under the TOMMY HILFIGER , CALVIN KLEIN and Van Heusen brands, along with other licensed and owned brands. PVH Australia will come under our full ownership as a result of the acquisition. The aggregate net purchase price for the shares being acquired is approximately A$124 million (approximately $90 million based on the current exchange rate in effect), after taking into account the divestiture to a third party of an office building and warehouse owned by Gazal. The second is for purposes of acquiring the Tommy Hilfiger retail business in Hong Kong and certain other countries in Central and Southeast Asia from our current licensee in those markets. The purchase price is estimated to be approximately $75 million. The closings of these two pending acquisitions are subject to customary conditions, 32 including in respect of the Australia acquisition, shareholder and court approvals, and are expected to occur in the second quarter of 2019. We expect to record a net pre-tax gain of approximately $70 million during 2019 in connection with the Australia acquisition and TH CSAP acquisition, consisting of a noncash gain to write up our equity investments in Gazal and PVH Australia to fair value, partially offset by pre-tax costs related to both acquisitions, primarily consisting of noncash valuation adjustments and amortization of short-lived assets. We announced on January 10, 2019 a restructuring in connection with strategic changes for our Calvin Klein business (the Calvin Klein restructuring ). The strategic changes include (i) the closure of the CALVIN KLEIN 205 W39 NYC brand (formerly Calvin Klein Collection ), (ii) the closure of the flagship store on Madison Avenue in New York, New York, (iii) the restructuring of the Calvin Klein creative and design teams globally, and (iv) the consolidation of operations for the men Calvin Klein Sportswear and Calvin Klein Jeans businesses. We recorded pre-tax costs of $41 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, consisting of $27 million of severance, $7 million of noncash asset impairments, $4 million of contract termination and other costs and $2 million of inventory markdowns. We expect to incur additional pre-tax costs of approximately $130 million during 2019 in connection with the Calvin Klein restructuring, primarily consisting of severance, noncash asset impairments, lease and other contract termination costs, and inventory markdowns. Please see Note 17 , Exit Activity Costs , in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for further discussion. We acquired on April 20, 2018 the Geoffrey Beene tradename from Geoffrey Beene for $17 million, of which $16 million was paid in cash. Prior to the acquisition, we had licensed the rights to design, market and distribute Geoffrey Beene dress shirts and neckwear from Geoffrey Beene. We issued on December 21, 2017 600 million euro-denominated principal amount of 3 1/8% senior notes due December 15, 2027. We redeemed on January 5, 2018 our $700 million principal amount of 4 1/2% senior notes due December 15, 2022 (using the proceeds of the senior notes due December 15, 2027) and recorded pre-tax debt extinguishment charges of $24 million. Please see the section entitled Liquidity and Capital Resources below for further discussion. We amended on December 20, 2017 Mr. Tommy Hilfiger employment agreement, pursuant to which we made a cash buyout of a portion of the future payment obligation (the Mr. Hilfiger amendment ). We recorded pre-tax charges of $83 million in 2017 in connection with the amendment. We restructured our supply chain relationship with Li & Fung in a transaction that closed on September 30, 2017. Our non-exclusive buying agency agreement with Li & Fung was terminated in connection with this transaction. We recorded pre-tax charges of $54 million in 2017 in connection with the termination. We acquired on September 1, 2017 the Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein wholesale and concessions businesses in Belgium and Luxembourg from a former agent (the Belgian acquisition ). As a result of this acquisition, we now operate directly our Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein businesses in this region. The total consideration for the acquisition was $12 million. We acquired on March 30, 2017 True & Co., a direct-to-consumer intimate apparel digital commerce retailer. This acquisition enabled us to participate further in the fast-growing online channel and provided a platform to increase innovation, data-driven decisions and speed in the way we serve our consumers across our channels of distribution. The total consideration for the acquisition was $28 million, net of $400,000 of cash acquired. We completed the relocation of our Tommy Hilfiger office in New York in 2017 and recorded related pre-tax charges of $19 million, including noncash depreciation expense. We purchased a group annuity in 2017 for certain participants of our retirement plans under which certain of our benefit obligations were transferred to an insurer. We recorded a pre-tax loss of $9 million in connection with the noncash settlement of such benefit obligations. We completed a consolidation within our warehouse and distribution network in North America in 2017 and recorded related net pre-tax charges of $8 million, which included a $3 million gain on the sale of a warehouse and distribution center. 33 We entered into an agreement on January 24, 2017 to terminate the license for the Tommy Hilfiger men tailored clothing business in North America held by Marcraft Clothes, Inc. effective December 31, 2017 (the TH men tailored license termination ). Peerless Clothing International, Inc. became the licensee for the business effective January 1, 2018. These transactions were undertaken in order to consolidate with Peerless Clothing International, Inc. our men tailored businesses for all of our brands in North America. We recorded a pre-tax charge of $11 million in 2016 in connection with the TH men tailored license termination. We formed on November 30, 2016 a joint venture in Mexico, PVH Mexico, in which we own a 49% economic interest. The joint venture was formed by merging our wholly owned subsidiary that principally operated and managed our Calvin Klein business in Mexico with a wholly owned subsidiary of Grupo Axo that distributes certain TOMMY HILFIGER brand products in Mexico. In connection with the formation of PVH Mexico, we deconsolidated our wholly owned subsidiary. We recorded a pre-tax noncash loss of $82 million in 2016 (including $ 57 million related to foreign currency translation adjustment losses previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss) in connection with the Mexico deconsolidation. We, along with Arvind, formed PVH Ethiopia on June 29, 2016, in which we own a 75% interest. We have consolidated the joint venture in our consolidated financial statements. PVH Ethiopia was formed to operate a manufacturing facility that produces finished products for us for distribution primarily in the United States. The manufacturing facility began operations in 2017. We issued on June 20, 2016 350 million euro-denominated principal amount of 3 5/8% senior notes due July 15, 2024. Please see the section entitled Liquidity and Capital Resources below for further discussion. We amended on May 19, 2016 our senior secured credit facilities and recorded pre-tax debt modification and extinguishment charges of $16 million. Please see the section entitled Liquidity and Capital Resources below for further discussion. We acquired on April 13, 2016 the 55% of the ownership interests in TH China, our former joint venture for TOMMY HILFIGER in China, that we did not already own. As a result of the TH China acquisition, we now operate directly our Tommy Hilfiger business in this market. The total consideration for the acquisition was $161 million (including the elimination of a $3 million pre-acquisition receivable owed to us by TH China), net of cash acquired of $105 million. We recorded a net pre-tax gain of $70 million in 2016, including a noncash gain of $153 million to write-up our equity investment to fair value prior to the acquisition closing and costs of $83 million, which primarily consisted of noncash valuation adjustments and amortization of short-lived assets. We recorded pre-tax charges of $24 million and $27 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively, primarily consisting of noncash amortization of short-lived assets. We exited a TOMMY HILFIGER flagship store in Europe in 2016 and recorded a pre-tax gain of $18 million in connection with a payment made to us. Our Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein businesses each have substantial international components that expose us to significant foreign exchange risk. Our Heritage Brands business also has international components but those components are not significant to the business. Our results of operations in local foreign currencies are translated into United States dollars using an average exchange rate over the representative period. Accordingly, our results of operations are unfavorably impacted during times of a strengthening United States dollar against the foreign currencies in which we generate significant revenue and earnings and favorably impacted during times of a weakening United States dollar against those currencies. Over 50% of our $9.657 billion of revenue in 2018 was subject to foreign currency translation. There is also a transactional impact on our financial results because inventory typically is purchased in United States dollars by our foreign subsidiaries. As with translation, our results of operations will be unfavorably impacted during times of a strengthening United States dollar as the increased local currency value of inventory results in a higher cost of goods in local currency when the goods are sold and favorably impacted during times of a weakening United States dollar as the decreased local currency value of inventory results in a lower cost of goods in local currency when the goods are sold. We use foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge against a portion of the exposure related to this transactional impact. The contracts cover at least 70% of the projected inventory purchases in United States dollars by our foreign subsidiaries. These contracts are generally entered into 12 months in advance of the related inventory purchases. Therefore, the impact of fluctuations of the United States dollar on the cost of inventory purchases covered by these contracts may be realized in our results of operations in the year following their inception, as the underlying inventory hedged by the contracts is sold. 34 Additionally, there is a transactional impact related to changes in SG&A expenses as a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Based on current foreign currency exchange rates, we expect a decrease in revenue of approximately $150 million, or 1%, and a slight decrease in net income in 2019 as compared to 2018 due to the impact of foreign currency exchange. Further, we have exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to our 950 million aggregate principal amount of euro-denominated senior notes, as the weakening of the United States dollar against the euro would require us to use a greater amount of our cash flows from operations to pay interest and make long-term debt repayments. We designated the carrying amount of these euro-denominated senior notes that we had issued in the United States as net investment hedges of our investments in certain of our foreign subsidiaries that use the euro as their functional currency. As a result, the remeasurement of these foreign currency borrowings at the end of each period is recorded in equity. Retail comparable store sales discussed below refer to sales from retail stores that have been open for at least 12 months, as well as sales from Company-operated digital commerce sites for those businesses and regions that have operated the related digital commerce site for at least 12 months. Sales from retail stores and Company-operated digital commerce sites that are closed or shut down during the year are excluded from the calculation of retail comparable store sales. Sales for retail stores that are relocated, materially altered in size or closed for a certain number of consecutive days and sales from Company-operated digital commerce sites that are materially altered are also excluded from the calculation of retail comparable store sales until such stores or sites have been in their new location or in their newly renovated state, as applicable, for at least 12 months. Retail comparable store sales are based on local currencies and comparable weeks. As a result of the 53rd week in 2017, the 2018 retail comparable store sales are more appropriately compared with the 52 week period ended February 4, 2018 (which excludes for this purpose the first week of 2017). All 2018 retail comparable store sales are presented on this shifted basis. 2017 retail comparable store sales exclude the extra week in 2017. The following table summarizes our income statements in 2018, 2017 and 2016: 2018 2017 2016 (Dollars in millions) Net sales $ 9,154 $ 8,439 $ 7,791 Royalty revenue 376 366 321 Advertising and other revenue 127 109 91 Total revenue 9,657 8,915 8,203 Gross profit 5,308 4,894 4,370 % of total revenue 55.0 % 54.9 % 53.3 % SG&A 4,433 4,245 3,678 % of total revenue 45.9 % 47.6 % 44.8 % Non-service related pension and postretirement cost (income) 5 3 (41 ) Debt modification and extinguishment costs 24 16 Other noncash gain, net 71 Equity in net income of unconsolidated affiliates 21 10 0 Income before interest and taxes 892 632 789 Interest expense 121 128 121 Interest income 5 6 6 Income before taxes 776 510 674 Income tax expense (benefit) 31 (26 ) 125 Net income 745 536 549 Less: Net loss attributable to redeemable non-controlling interest (2 ) (2 ) 0 Net income attributable to PVH Corp. $ 746 $ 538 $ 549 35 Total Revenue Total revenue was $9.657 billion in 2018, $8.915 billion in 2017 and $8.203 billion in 2016. Revenue in 2017 included the benefit of a 53rd week. The increase in revenue of $742 million, or 8%, in 2018 as compared to 2017 was due principally to the effect of the following items: The addition of an aggregate $451 million of revenue, or a 12% increase over the prior year, attributable to our Tommy Hilfiger International and Tommy Hilfiger North America segments, which included the addition of $49 million, or 1%, related to the impact of foreign currency translation. Tommy Hilfiger International segment revenue increased 15% (including a 2% positive foreign currency impact), driven by continued strong performance across all regions and channels. Tommy Hilfiger International comparable store sales increased 13%. Revenue in our Tommy Hilfiger North America segment increased 6%, principally attributable to strength in the wholesale business and a 5% comparable store sales increase. The addition of an aggregate $270 million of revenue, or an 8% increase over the prior year, attributable to our Calvin Klein International and Calvin Klein North America segments, which included the addition of $12 million related to the impact of foreign currency translation. Calvin Klein International segment revenue increased 10%, driven by growth in Europe and Asia. Calvin Klein International comparable store sales increased 5%. Revenue in our Calvin Klein North America segment increased 5% primarily as a result of growth in the wholesale business and a 1% comparable store sales increase. The addition of an aggregate $21 million of revenue, or a 1% increase over the prior year, attributable to our Heritage Brands Retail and Heritage Brands Wholesale segments. Comparable store sales increased 1%. The increase in revenue of $712 million, or 9%, in 2017 as compared to 2016 was due principally to the effect of the following items, inclusive of a 53rd week in 2017: The addition of an aggregate $382 million of revenue, or an 11% increase over the prior year, attributable to our Tommy Hilfiger International and Tommy Hilfiger North America segments, which included an addition of approximately $73 million, or 2%, related to the impact of foreign currency translation. Tommy Hilfiger International segment revenue increased 19% (including a 4% positive foreign currency impact), driven principally by outstanding performance in Europe and Asia, as well as the inclusion of a full first quarter of revenue from the China business as a result of the TH China acquisition in April 2016. Tommy Hilfiger International comparable store sales increased 8%. Revenue in our Tommy Hilfiger North America segment was flat, as a reduction of approximately $75 million resulting from the discontinuation of our directly operated womenswear wholesale business in the United States and Canada during the fourth quarter of 2016 in connection with the licensing of this business to G-III offset growth in the retail business. Tommy Hilfiger North America comparable store sales increased 3%. The addition of an aggregate $326 million of revenue, or a 10% increase over the prior year, attributable to our Calvin Klein International and Calvin Klein North America segments, which included an addition of approximately $49 million, or 2%, related to the impact of foreign currency translation. Calvin Klein International segment revenue increased 21% (including a 3% positive foreign currency impact), driven by strength in Europe and China. Calvin Klein International comparable store sales increased 6%. Revenue in our Calvin Klein North America segment increased 1%, principally due to growth in the wholesale business and an increase in royalty revenue, partially offset by a reduction of approximately $60 million resulting from the Mexico deconsolidation and a 1% decline in comparable store sales. The addition of an aggregate $3 million of revenue attributable to our Heritage Brands Retail and Heritage Brands Wholesale segments. Comparable store sales increased 2%. We currently expect that revenue will increase 4% in 2019 compared to 2018, inclusive of a negative impact of approximately 1% related to foreign currency translation. Revenue for the Tommy Hilfiger business is expected to increase approximately 6% compared to 2018, inclusive of a negative impact of approximately 2% related to foreign currency translation. Revenue for the Calvin Klein business is expected to increase approximately 2% compared to 2018, inclusive of a negative impact of approximately 1% related to foreign currency translation. Revenue for our Heritage Brands business is expected to increase approximately 3% compared to 2018. Our 2019 guidance assumes that both the Australia acquisition and the TH CSAP acquisition will close in the second quarter of 2019. These pending acquisitions are expected to add approximately $150 million of revenue in 2019. 36 Gross Profit Gross profit is calculated as total revenue less cost of goods sold and gross margin is calculated as gross profit divided by total revenue. Included as cost of goods sold are costs associated with the production and procurement of product, such as inbound freight costs, purchasing and receiving costs and inspection costs. Also included as cost of goods sold are the amounts recognized on foreign currency forward exchange contracts as the underlying inventory hedged by such forward exchange contracts is sold. Warehousing and distribution expenses are included in SG&A expenses. All of our royalty, advertising and other revenue is included in gross profit because there is no cost of goods sold associated with such revenue. As a result, our gross profit may not be comparable to that of other entities. The following table shows our revenue mix between net sales and royalty, advertising and other revenue, as well as our gross margin for 2018 , 2017 and 2016 : 2018 2017 2016 Components of revenue: Net sales 94.8 % 94.7 % 95.0 % Royalty, advertising and other revenue 5.2 5.3 5.0 Total 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Gross margin 55.0 % 54.9 % 53.3 % Gross profit in 2018 was $5.308 billion, or 55.0% of total revenue, as compared to $4.894 billion, or 54.9% of total revenue, in 2017. The 10 basis point increase in gross margin was principally driven by (i) a favorable mix of business due to faster growth in our Tommy Hilfiger International and Calvin Klein International segments than in our North America segments, as our International segments generally carry higher gross margins, and (ii) gross margin improvement in our Tommy Hilfiger business. Partially offsetting these increases were gross margin declines in our Calvin Klein and Heritage Brands businesses principally due to more promotional selling. Gross profit in 2017 was $4.894 billion, or 54.9% of total revenue, as compared to $4.370 billion, or 53.3% of total revenue, in 2016. The 160 basis point increase in gross margin was principally driven by (i) a favorable mix of business due to faster growth in our Tommy Hilfiger International and Calvin Klein International segments than in our North America segments, as our International segments generally carry higher gross margins, (ii) gross margin improvements in our North America segments due to less promotional selling, and (iii) gross margin improvements related to the Mexico deconsolidation and the G-III license, as the directly operated businesses in Mexico and the directly operated Tommy Hilfiger wholesale womenswear business in the United States and Canada were replaced by royalty revenues from PVH Mexico and G-III, which carry no cost of goods sold. These increases were partially offset by the unfavorable impact of the stronger United States dollar on our international businesses that purchase inventory in United States dollars, particularly our European businesses, as the increased local currency value of inventory resulted in higher cost of goods in local currency when the goods were sold. We currently expect that gross margin in 2019 will increase as compared to 2018 due to (i) the impact of expected faster growth in our Tommy Hilfiger International and Calvin Klein International segments than in our North America segments, as our International segments generally carry higher gross margins, and (ii) an expected increase in gross margin in our Calvin Klein business due to less promotional selling resulting from the restructuring initiatives being implemented related to our creative and design functions. These increases will be partially offset by short-lived noncash valuation adjustments expected to be recorded principally in connection with the Australia acquisition. SG&A Expenses Our SG&A expenses were as follows: 2018 2017 2016 (Dollars in millions) SG&A expenses $ 4,433 $ 4,245 $ 3,678 % of total revenue 45.9 % 47.6 % 44.8 % SG&A expenses in 2018 were $4.433 billion, or 45.9% of total revenue, as compared to $4.245 billion, or 47.6% of total revenue in 2017. The 170 basis point decrease in SG&A expenses as a percentage of total revenue was principally 37 attributable to the absence in 2018 of costs that were recorded in 2017 in connection with (i) the Mr. Hilfiger amendment, (ii) the Li & Fung termination, (iii) the relocation of our Tommy Hilfiger office in New York, including noncash depreciation expense, and (iv) the consolidation within our warehouse and distribution network in North America. Also contributing to the decrease was a leveraging of expenses in the Tommy Hilfiger business. These decreases were partially offset by (i) a change in the mix of business due to faster growth in our Tommy Hilfiger International and Calvin Klein International segments than in our North America segments, as our International segments generally carry higher SG&A expenses as percentages of total revenue, (ii) the costs incurred in connection with the Calvin Klein restructuring and (iii) an increase in corporate expenses due, in part, to investments in digital and information technology initiatives. SG&A expenses in 2017 were $4.245 billion, or 47.6% of total revenue, as compared to $3.678 billion, or 44.8% of total revenue in 2016. The 280 basis point increase in SG&A expenses as a percentage of total revenue was principally attributable to (i) a change in the mix of business due to faster growth in our Tommy Hilfiger International and Calvin Klein International segments than in our North America segments, as our International segments generally carry higher SG&A expenses as percentages of total revenue, (ii) the costs incurred in connection with the Mr. Hilfiger amendment, (iii) the costs incurred in connection with the Li & Fung termination, (iv) an increase in marketing expenditures, particularly in the Calvin Klein business, (v) an increase in corporate expenses due, in part, to investments in digital and sourcing initiatives, including start-up costs associated with PVH Ethiopia, (vi) the costs incurred in connection with the relocation of our Tommy Hilfiger office in New York, including noncash depreciation expense, (vii) the absence of the gain recorded in 2016 in connection with a payment made to us to exit a TOMMY HILFIGER flagship store in Europe and (viii) the costs incurred in connection with the consolidation within our warehouse and distribution network in North America. These increases were partially offset by (i) a reduction of costs incurred in connection with the TH China acquisition, primarily consisting of noncash valuation adjustments and amortization of short-lived assets, (ii) the absence of the costs incurred in connection with the TH men tailored license termination and (iii) the absence of costs incurred in connection with the Warnaco integration and related restructuring. We currently expect that SG&A expenses as a percentage of total revenue in 2019 will increase as compared to 2018 due to (i) an increase in costs expected to be incurred in connection with the Calvin Klein restructuring, (ii) costs expected to be incurred in connection with the closure of our TOMMY HILFIGER flagship and anchor stores in the United States, (iii) costs expected to be incurred in connection with the Australia acquisition and the TH CSAP acquisition, primarily consisting of noncash valuation adjustments and amortization of short-lived assets, and (iv) a change in the mix of business due to faster growth in our Tommy Hilfiger International and Calvin Klein International segments than in our North America segments, as our International segments generally carry higher SG&A expenses as percentages of total revenue. These increases will be partially offset by the absence in 2019 of costs that were recorded in 2018 in connection with the TH China acquisition, consisting of noncash amortization of short-lived assets. Non-Service Related Pension and Postretirement Cost (Income) Non-service related pension and postretirement cost in 2018 was $5 million as compared to $3 million in 2017. Non-service related pension and postretirement cost in 2018 included a $15 million actuarial loss on our retirement plans. Non-service related pension and postretirement cost in 2017 included a $9 million loss recorded in connection with the noncash settlement of certain of our benefit obligations related to our retirement plans as a result of a group annuity purchased for certain participants under which such obligations were transferred to an insurer, as well as a $3 million actuarial loss on our retirement plans. Please see Note 12 , Retirement and Benefit Plans , in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for further discussion. Non-service related pension and postretirement cost in 2017 was $3 million as compared to non-service related pension and postretirement income of $41 million in 2016. Non-service related pension and postretirement cost in 2017 included a $9 million loss recorded in connection with the noncash settlement of certain of our benefit obligations related to our retirement plans as a result of a group annuity purchased for certain participants under which such obligations were transferred to an insurer, as well as a $3 million actuarial loss on our retirement plans. Non-service related pension and postretirement income in 2016 included a $39 million actuarial gain on our retirement plans. Please see Note 12 , Retirement and Benefit Plans , in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for further discussion. We currently expect that non-service related pension and postretirement income for 2019 will be approximately $7 million compared to non-service related pension and postretirement cost of $5 million in 2018. Non-service related pension and postretirement (income) cost recorded throughout the year is calculated using actuarial valuations that incorporate assumptions and estimates about financial market, economic and demographic conditions. Differences between estimated and actual results give rise to gains and losses that are recorded immediately in earnings, generally in the fourth quarter of the year, which can create volatility in our results of operations. Our 2018 non-service related pension and postretirement cost included a $15 38 million actuarial loss on our retirement plans recorded in the fourth quarter. Based on current market, economic and demographic conditions, we are not aware of any changes to the actuarial valuations for 2019 and as such, our expectation for 2019 assumes there is no actuarial gain or loss. Our actual 2019 non-service related pension and postretirement (income) cost may be significantly different than our projections. Debt Modification and Extinguishment Costs We incurred costs totaling $24 million in 2017 in connection with the early redemption of our $700 million 4 1/2% senior notes due December 15, 2022. Please see the section entitled Liquidity and Capital Resources below for further discussion. We incurred costs totaling $16 million in 2016 in connection with the amendment of our senior secured credit facilities. Please see the section entitled Liquidity and Capital Resources below for further discussion. Other Noncash Gain, Net We recorded a pre-tax noncash gain of $153 million in 2016 to write up our equity investment in TH China to fair value in connection with the TH China acquisition. Please see Note 3 , Acquisitions , in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for further discussion. We recorded a pre-tax noncash loss of $82 million in 2016 (including $ 57 million related to foreign currency translation adjustment losses previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss) in connection with the Mexico deconsolidation. Please see Note 5 , Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates , in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for further discussion. We expect to record in 2019 a significant noncash gain to write up our equity investments in Gazal and PVH Australia to fair market value in connection with the Australia acquisition. The closing is expected to occur in the second quarter of 2019. Equity in Net Income of Unconsolidated Affiliates The equity in net income of unconsolidated affiliates was $21 million in 2018 as compared to $10 million during 2017 and $100,000 during 2016. These amounts relate to our share of income (loss) from our PVH Australia joint venture, PVH Mexico joint venture (since the formation of PVH Mexico on November 30, 2016), our former joint venture for the TOMMY HILFIGER brand in China (prior to the TH China acquisition on April 13, 2016), and our joint ventures for TOMMY HILFIGER in India and Brazil, and for CALVIN KLEIN in India. Also included is our share of (loss) income from our investments in Karl Lagerfeld Holding B.V. ( Karl Lagerfeld ) and, beginning in the third quarter of 2016, in Gazal. Our investments in the continuing joint ventures, Karl Lagerfeld and Gazal are being accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Please see the section entitled Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates within Liquidity and Capital Resources below for further discussion. The equity in net income of unconsolidated affiliates in 2016 included a one-time expense of $6 million recorded on our equity investment in TH China prior to the acquisition closing. We currently expect that our equity in net income of unconsolidated affiliates for 2019 will decrease as compared to 2018 as the income we recognize on our investments in Gazal and PVH Australia in 2019 will only be for a partial year. Following the closing of the Australia acquisition, which is expected to occur in the second quarter of 2019, we will consolidate the results of Gazal and PVH Australia into our financial statements. Interest Expense, Net Net interest expense decreased to $116 million in 2018 from $122 million in 2017 primarily due to (i) the net impact of the early redemption of our $700 million 4 1/2% senior notes in January 2018 and issuance of 600 million euro-denominated 3 1/8% senior notes in December 2017 and (ii) the cumulative impact of long-term debt repayments made during 2018 and 2017, partially offset by an increase in short-term borrowings and interest rates as compared to 2017. Please see the section entitled Financing Arrangements within Liquidity and Capital Resources below for further discussion. Net interest expense increased to $122 million in 2017 from $115 million in 2016 primarily due to the net impact of the issuance of 350 million euro-denominated 3 5/8% senior notes in June 2016 and increases in short-term borrowings and interest rates as compared to 2016, partially offset by the cumulative impact of long-term debt repayments made during 2017 39 and 2016. Please see the section entitled Financing Arrangements within Liquidity and Capital Resources below for further discussion. Net interest expense in 2019 is currently expected to be approximately $128 million compared to $116 million in 2018 primarily due to higher interest rates, as well as an increase in short-term borrowings, including as a result of the Australia acquisition, the TH CSAP acquisition and costs expected to be incurred in connection with the Calvin Klein restructuring. Income Taxes Income tax expense (benefit) was as follows: 2018 2017 2016 (Dollars in millions) Income tax expense (benefit) $ 31 $ (26 ) $ 125 Income tax expense (benefit) as a % of pre-tax income 4.0 % (5.1 )% 18.6 % The U.S. Tax Legislation was enacted on December 22, 2017. The U.S. Tax Legislation is comprehensive and significantly revised the United States tax code. The revisions that significantly impact us are (i) the reduction of the corporate income tax rate from 35.0% to 21.0%, (ii) the imposition of a one-time transition tax on earnings of foreign subsidiaries deemed to be repatriated, (iii) the implementation of a modified territorial tax system, (iv) the introduction of a tax on foreign income in excess of a deemed return on tangible assets of foreign corporations (known as GILTI ) and a beneficial tax rate to be applied against foreign derived intangible income (known as FDII ) and (v) the introduction of a base erosion anti-abuse tax measure (known as BEAT ) that taxes certain payments between United States corporations and their subsidiaries. We recorded a provisional net tax benefit of $53 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 in connection with the U.S. Tax Legislation, consisting of a $265 million benefit primarily from the remeasurement of our net United States deferred tax liabilities, partially offset by a $38 million valuation allowance on our foreign tax credits and a $174 million transition tax on earnings of foreign subsidiaries deemed to be repatriated. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we completed our final analysis of the impacts of the U.S. Tax Legislation and recorded a net tax benefit of $25 million to adjust the provisional amount recorded in 2017, during the measurement period allowed by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The $25 million net tax benefit included the release of a $26 million valuation allowance on our foreign tax credits, partially offset by a $2 million expense related to the remeasurement of our net United States deferred tax liabilities. We file income tax returns in more than 40 international jurisdictions each year. Most of the international jurisdictions in which we file tax returns had lower statutory tax rates than the United States statutory tax rate in 2016 and in 2017 prior to the effective date of the U.S. Tax Legislation. A substantial amount of our earnings comes from our international operations, particularly in the Netherlands and Hong Kong, where income tax rates, coupled with special rates levied on income from certain of our jurisdictional activities, continue to be lower than the United States statutory income tax rate after giving effect to the U.S. Tax Legislation, and reduced our consolidated effective income tax rate during 2018, 2017 and 2016. We expect to benefit from these special rates until 2022. The reduction in the United States statutory income tax rate from 35.0% to 21.0% did not have a significant impact on our overall effective tax rate due to our mix of earnings. Our effective income tax rate for 2018 was lower than the 21.0% United States statutory income tax rate primarily due to (i) a $41 million benefit from the remeasurement of certain of our net deferred tax liabilities in connection with the enactment of legislation in the Netherlands known as the 2019 Dutch Tax Plan, which became effective on January 1, 2019 and includes a gradual reduction of the corporate income tax rate by 2021, and resulted in a benefit to our effective income tax rate of 5.3%, (ii) the favorable impact on certain liabilities for uncertain tax positions resulting from the expiration of applicable statutes of limitation, which resulted in a benefit to our effective income tax rate of 3.7%, (iii) a net tax benefit of $25 million recorded in 2018 to adjust the provisional amount recorded in 2017 in connection with the U.S. Tax Legislation, which resulted in a benefit to our effective income tax rate of 3.2%, and (iv) the benefit of overall lower tax rates in certain international jurisdictions where we file tax returns. The effective income tax rate for 2018 was 4.0% compared with (5.1)% in 2017. The 2018 effective income tax rate was higher than the effective income tax rate for 2017 primarily due to (i) a lower net benefit recorded in connection with the U.S. Tax Legislation, which resulted in a 3.2% benefit to our 2018 effective income tax rate compared with a 10.4% benefit to our 2017 effective income tax rate, (ii) an unfavorable change in our uncertain tax positions activity of 3.8%, and (iii) the absence of a 3.0% benefit to our 2017 effective income tax rate resulting from an excess tax benefit from the exercise of stock 40 options by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. These unfavorable impacts to our effective income tax rate for 2018 were partially offset by a 5.3% benefit to our 2018 effective income tax rate from the remeasurement of certain of our net deferred tax liabilities in connection with the 2019 Dutch Tax Plan. As a result of the U.S. Tax Legislation, which reduced the United States statutory income tax rate from 35.0% to 21.0% effective January 1, 2018, our United States statutory income tax rate for 2017 was a blended rate of 33.7%. Our effective income tax rate for 2017 was lower than the United States statutory income tax rate primarily due to (i) the provisional net benefit of $53 million recorded in connection with the U.S. Tax Legislation, which resulted in a benefit to our 2017 effective income tax rate of 10.4%, (ii) the benefit of overall lower tax rates in certain international jurisdictions where we file tax returns, and (iii) the overall benefit of certain discrete items, including the favorable impact on certain liabilities for uncertain tax positions and an excess tax benefit from the exercise of stock options by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, which resulted in benefits to our 2017 effective income tax rate of 7.5% and 3.0%, respectively. The effective income tax rate for 2017 was (5.1)% compared with 18.6% in 2016. The 2017 effective income tax rate was significantly lower than the effective income tax rate for 2016 primarily due to (i) the impact of the U.S. Tax Legislation in 2017, which resulted in a benefit to our 2017 effective income tax rate of 10.4%, (ii) a favorable change in our uncertain tax positions activity of 3.8%, (iii) an excess tax benefit from the exercise of stock options by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, which resulted in a benefit to our 2017 effective income tax rate of 3.0%, and (iv) faster growth in our international pre-tax earnings as compared to our domestic pre-tax earnings. These favorable impacts to our effective income tax rate for 2017 were partially offset by the absence of a 5.7% benefit to our 2016 effective income tax rate related to the pre-tax gain recorded to write-up our equity investment in TH China to fair value. The effective income tax rate for 2016 was lower than the 35.0% United States statutory income tax rate due to the benefit of overall lower tax rates in certain international jurisdictions where we file tax returns. Also contributing to the lower effective income tax rate for 2016 was the benefit of discrete items, including the lower tax rate applicable to the pre-tax gain recorded to write-up our equity investment in TH China to fair value that resulted in a 5.7% benefit to our effective income tax rate. We currently expect that our effective income tax rate in 2019 will be in a range of 15% to 16%. Our expectation that our effective income tax rate in 2019 will be lower than the United States statutory income tax rate is principally due to the overall benefit of certain discrete items, including the favorable impact on certain liabilities for uncertain tax positions. Our expectation that the effective income tax rate in 2019 will increase compared to 2018 is primarily due to (i) the absence of a 5.3% benefit to our 2018 effective income tax rate related to the remeasurement of certain of our net deferred tax liabilities in connection with the 2019 Dutch Tax Plan and (ii) the absence of a 3.2% benefit to our 2018 effective income tax rate related to the U.S. Tax Legislation. Our tax rate is affected by many factors, including the mix of international and domestic pre-tax earnings, discrete events arising from specific transactions, and new regulations, as well as audits by tax authorities and the receipt of new information, which can cause us to change our estimate for uncertain tax positions. Please see Note 9 , Income Taxes , in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for further discussion. Redeemable Non-Controlling Interest We have a joint venture in Ethiopia with Arvind named PVH Ethiopia, in which we own a 75% interest. We consolidate the results of PVH Ethiopia in our consolidated financial statements. PVH Ethiopia was formed to operate a manufacturing facility that produces finished products for us for distribution primarily in the United States. The manufacturing facility began operations in 2017. The net loss attributable to the redeemable non-controlling interest was immaterial in 2018, 2017 and 2016. We currently expect that the net loss attributable to the redeemable non-controlling interest for 2019 will be immaterial. Please see Note 6 , Redeemable Non-Controlling Interest , in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for further discussion. 41 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash Flow Summary Cash and cash equivalents at February 3, 2019 was $452 million, a decrease of $42 million from the amount at February 4, 2018 of $494 million. The change in cash and cash equivalents included the impact of (i) $302 million of common stock repurchases under the stock repurchase program, (ii) $150 million of long-term debt repayments, (iii) a $16 million payment made in connection with the acquisition of the Geoffrey Beene tradename, and (iv) a $10 million contribution to our defined benefit pension plans. Cash flow in 2019 will be impacted by various factors in addition to those noted below in this Liquidity and Capital Resources section, including (i) expected long-term debt repayments of approximately $150 million, (ii) expected common stock repurchases under the stock repurchase program of approximately $200 million, (iii) the expected net consideration to be paid for the Australia acquisition of A$124 million (approximately $90 million based on the current exchange rate in effect), and (iv) the expected consideration to be paid for the TH CSAP acquisition, which is estimated to be approximately $75 million. As of February 3, 2019, approximately $415 million of cash and cash equivalents was held by international subsidiaries. Prior to the enactment of the U.S. Tax Legislation, our undistributed foreign earnings were considered permanently reinvested and, as such, United States federal and state income taxes were not previously recorded on these earnings. As a result of the U.S. Tax Legislation, substantially all of our earnings in foreign subsidiaries generated prior to the enactment of the U.S. Tax Legislation were deemed to have been repatriated and, as a result, we recorded a one-time transition tax of $174 million in 2017. Our intent is to reinvest indefinitely substantially all of our earnings in foreign subsidiaries outside of the United States. However, if management decides at a later date to repatriate these earnings to the United States, we may be required to accrue and pay additional taxes, including any applicable foreign withholding tax and United States state income taxes. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of tax that might be payable if these earnings were repatriated due to the complexities associated with the hypothetical calculation. Operations Cash provided by operating activities was $852 million in 2018 compared to $644 million in 2017. The increase in cash provided by operating activities as compared to the prior year was primarily driven by an increase in net income as adjusted for noncash charges, partially offset by changes in working capital, including (i) an increase in trade receivables due, in part, to an increase in wholesale sales and (ii) an increase in inventories, primarily due to an expected increase in sales for the first quarter of 2019 as compared to the prior year period, as well as an acceleration of receipts in advance of potential tariffs on goods imported from China. In connection with our acquisition of Calvin Klein, we were obligated to pay Mr. Calvin Klein contingent purchase price payments based on 1.15% of total worldwide net sales (as defined in the acquisition agreement, as amended) of products bearing any of the CALVIN KLEIN brands with respect to sales made through February 12, 2018. A significant portion of the sales on which the payments to Mr. Klein have been made were wholesale sales by us and our licensees and other partners to retailers. Contingent purchase price payments totaled $16 million, $56 million and $53 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. All payments due to Mr. Klein under the agreement have been made. All contingent purchase price payments are subject to audit, as per the terms of the acquisition agreement. As a result of accounting guidance adopted in the first quarter of 2018, contingent purchase price payments to Mr. Klein are now classified as operating activities in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, instead of the previous classification as investing activities. Please see Note 1 , Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for further discussion of the accounting guidance. Capital Expenditures Our capital expenditures in 2018 were $379 million compared to $358 million in 2017. The capital expenditures in 2018 primarily related to (i) upgrading and enhancing our operating, supply chain and logistics systems and our digital commerce platforms, (ii) the renovation and expansion of our administrative offices in Amsterdam, and (iii) investments in new stores and store expansions. We currently expect that capital expenditures for 2019 will increase to approximately $425 million and will include expenditures primarily related to (i) investments in new stores and store expansions, (ii) continued investments to upgrade and enhance our operating, supply chain and logistics systems and our digital commerce platforms, and (iii) the expansion of our warehouse and distribution network in North America. 42 Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates We own a 50% economic interest in PVH Australia. We received dividends of $6 million, $3 million and $1 million from PVH Australia during 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We acquired approximately 10% of the outstanding capital stock of Gazal, which is listed on the Australian Securities Exchange, in 2016 for $9 million. We acquired additional capital stock for $8 million in 2017. Our current ownership interest in Gazal is approximately 22%. We received dividends of $1 million from Gazal in each of 2018 and 2017. We entered into on February 20, 2019 a definitive agreement to acquire the approximately 78% interest in Gazal that we do not already own. PVH Australia will come under our full ownership as a result of the Australia acquisition. The aggregate net purchase price for the shares being acquired is approximately A$124 million (approximately $90 million based on the current exchange rate in effect), after taking into account the divestiture to a third party of an office building and warehouse owned by Gazal. The closing is subject to customary conditions, including shareholder, court and regulatory approvals, and is expected to occur in the second quarter of 2019. We acquired a 51% economic interest in a joint venture, Calvin Klein Arvind Fashion Private Limited ( CK India ) in 2013. We sold 1% of our interest for $400,000 in 2017, decreasing our economic interest in CK India to 50%. Prior to the sale, we were not deemed to hold a controlling interest in CK India as the shareholders agreement provided the partners with equal rights. CK India licenses from one of our subsidiaries the rights to the CALVIN KLEIN trademarks in India for certain product categories. We made payments of $2 million to CK India in each of 2017 and 2016 to contribute our share of the joint venture funding. We own a 50% economic interest in a joint venture, Tommy Hilfiger Arvind Fashion Private Limited ( TH India ). TH India licenses from one of our subsidiaries the rights to the TOMMY HILFIGER trademarks in India for certain product categories. Arvind, our joint venture partner in PVH Ethiopia and CK India, is also our joint venture partner in TH India. We made payments of $3 million to TH India during 2017 to contribute our share of the joint venture funding. We acquired a 40% economic interest in a joint venture, Tommy Hilfiger do Brasil S.A. ( TH Brazil ) in 2012. We acquired an approximately 1% additional interest for $300,000 in 2017, increasing our economic interest in TH Brazil to approximately 41%. TH Brazil licenses from one of our subsidiaries the rights to the TOMMY HILFIGER trademarks in Brazil for certain product categories. We made payments of $3 million and $2 million to TH Brazil during 2017 and 2016, respectively, to contribute our share of the joint venture funding. We issued a note receivable to TH Brazil in 2016 for $12 million, of which $6 million was repaid in 2016 and the remaining balance, including accrued interest, was repaid in 2017. We and Grupo Axo formed PVH Mexico in 2016. We own a 49% economic interest in the joint venture. PVH Mexico licenses from certain of our wholly owned subsidiaries the rights to distribute and sell certain TOMMY HILFIGER , CALVIN KLEIN , Warner , Olga and Speedo brand products in Mexico. PVH Mexico was formed by merging our wholly owned subsidiary that principally operated and managed the Calvin Klein business in Mexico (the Mexico business ) with a wholly owned subsidiary of Grupo Axo that distributes certain TOMMY HILFIGER brand products in Mexico. In connection with the formation of PVH Mexico, we deconsolidated the Mexico business and began accounting for our 49% interest under the equity method of accounting in 2016. We made payments of $ 7 million to PVH Mexico during 2016 to contribute our share of the joint venture funding. Please see Note 5 , Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates , in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for further discussion. Loan to a Supplier Wuxi Jinmao Foreign Trade Co., Ltd. ( Wuxi ), one of our finished goods inventory suppliers, has a wholly owned subsidiary with which we entered into a loan agreement in 2016. Under the agreement, Wuxi subsidiary borrowed a principal amount of $14 million for the development and operation of a fabric mill. Principal payments are due in semi-annual installments beginning March 31, 2018 through September 30, 2026. The outstanding principal balance of the loan bears interest at a rate of (i) 4.50% per annum until the sixth anniversary of the closing date of the loan and (ii) London interbank offered rate ( LIBOR ) plus 4.00% thereafter. We received principal payments of $200,000 during 2018. The outstanding balance, including accrued interest, was $14 million as of both February 3, 2019 and February 4, 2018 . 43 Acquisition of the Geoffrey Beene Tradename We acquired the Geoffrey Beene tradename on April 20, 2018 for $17 million, of which $16 million was paid in cash. Please see Note 3 , Acquisitions , in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for further discussion. Acquisition of the Wholesale and Concessions Businesses in Belgium and Luxembourg We completed the Belgian acquisition on September 1, 2017. We paid $12 million as cash consideration for this transaction. Please see Note 3 , Acquisitions , in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for further discussion. Acquisition of True & Co. We acquired True & Co. on March 30, 2017. We paid $28 million, net of $400,000 of cash acquired, as cash consideration for this transaction. Please see Note 3 , Acquisitions , in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for further discussion.

We paid $158 million, net of cash acquired of $105 million, as cash consideration for this transaction. Please see Note 3 , Acquisitions , in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for further discussion. TH CSAP Acquisition We entered into on March 25, 2019 a definitive agreement to acquire the Tommy Hilfiger retail business in Hong Kong and certain other countries in Central and Southeast Asia from our current licensee in those markets. The purchase price is estimated to be approximately $75 million. The closing is subject to customary conditions and regulatory approval and is expected to occur in the second quarter of 2019. Sale of Assets We sold a building in Chattanooga, Tennessee in 2017 for $3 million in connection with the consolidation within our warehouse and distribution network in North America. One of our European subsidiaries sold a building in Amsterdam, the Netherlands in 2016 for 15 million (approximately $17 million based on the exchange rate in effect on the date of the sale). Dividends Our common stock currently pays annual dividends totaling $0.15 per share. Dividends on common stock totaled $12 million in each of 2018, 2017 and 2016. We currently project that cash dividends on our common stock in 2019 will be approximately $11 million based on our current dividend rate, the number of shares of our common stock outstanding as of February 3, 2019 , our estimate of stock to be issued during 2019 under our stock incentive plans and our estimate of stock repurchases during 2019. Acquisition of Treasury Shares Our Board of Directors authorized a $500 million three-year stock repurchase program effective June 3, 2015. On March 21, 2017, the Board of Directors authorized a $750 million increase to the program and extended it to June 3, 2020. On March 26, 2019, the Board of Directors authorized a further $750 million increase to the program and extended it to June 3, 2023. Repurchases under the program may be made from time to time over the period through open market purchases, accelerated share repurchase programs, privately negotiated transactions or other methods, as we deem appropriate. Purchases are made based on a variety of factors, such as price, corporate requirements and overall market conditions, applicable legal requirements and limitations, restrictions under our debt arrangements, trading restrictions under our insider trading policy and 44 other relevant factors. The program may be modified by the Board of Directors, including to increase or decrease the repurchase limitation or extend, suspend, or terminate the program, at any time, without prior notice. During 2018, 2017 and 2016, we purchased approximately 2.2 million, 2.2 million and 3.2 million shares, respectively, of our common stock under the program in open market transactions for $300 million, $250 million and $315 million, respectively. Purchases of $2 million that were accrued for in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of February 4, 2018 were paid in 2018. The repurchased shares were held as treasury stock and $258 million of the authorization remained available for future share repurchases as of February 3, 2019 . Treasury stock activity also includes shares that were withheld principally in conjunction with the settlement of vested restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance share units to satisfy tax withholding requirements. Tommy Hilfiger India Contingent Purchase Price Payments We reacquired in 2011 the rights in India to the TOMMY HILFIGER trademarks that had been subject to a perpetual license previously granted to a third party. We were required to make annual contingent purchase price payments to the seller based on a percentage of sales of TOMMY HILFIGER products in India in excess of an agreed upon threshold during each of six consecutive 12-month periods immediately following the acquisition, with the final payment made in 2017. We made contingent purchase price payments of approximately $1 million in each of 2017 and 2016. As a result of accounting guidance adopted in 2018, these contingent purchase price payments are now classified as financing activities in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, instead of the previous classification as investing activities. Please see to Note 1 , Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for further discussion of the accounting guidance. Financing Arrangements Our capital structure was as follows: (In millions) February 3, 2019 February 4, 2018 Short-term borrowings $ 13 $ 20 Current portion of long-term debt Capital lease obligations 17 16 Long-term debt 2,819 3,061 Stockholders equity 5,828 5,536 In addition, we had $452 million and $494 million of cash and cash equivalents as of February 3, 2019 and February 4, 2018 , respectively. Short-Term Borrowings We have the ability to draw revolving borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities, as discussed in the section entitled 2016 Senior Secured Credit Facilities below. We had $8 million outstanding under these facilities as of February 3, 2019 . The weighted average interest rate on funds borrowed as of February 3, 2019 was 4.45%. The maximum amount of revolving borrowings outstanding under these facilities during 2018 was $274 million. There were no borrowings outstanding under these facilities as of February 4, 2018 . Additionally, we have the availability to borrow under short-term lines of credit, overdraft facilities and short-term revolving credit facilities denominated in various foreign currencies. These facilities provided for borrowings of up to $102 million based on exchange rates in effect on February 3, 2019 and are utilized primarily to fund working capital needs. We had $5 million and $20 million outstanding under these facilities as of February 3, 2019 and February 4, 2018 , respectively. The weighted average interest rate on funds borrowed as of February 3, 2019 and February 4, 2018 was 0.21% and 1.19%, respectively. The maximum amount of borrowings outstanding under these facilities during 2018 was $39 million. Capital Lease Obligations Our cash payments for capital lease obligations totaled $5 million, $5 million and $7 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. 45 2016 Senior Secured Credit Facilities We have senior secured credit facilities due May 19, 2021 (the 2016 facilities ) that consist of a $2.347 billion United States dollar-denominated Term Loan A facility and senior secured revolving credit facilities consisting of (i) a $475 million United States dollar-denominated revolving credit facility, (ii) a $25 million United States dollar-denominated revolving credit facility available in United States dollars and Canadian dollars and (iii) a 186 million euro-denominated revolving credit facility available in euro, British pound sterling, Japanese yen and Swiss francs. Borrowings under the 2016 facilities bear interest at variable rates calculated in the manner as described below. The senior secured revolving credit facilities also include amounts available for letters of credit. A portion of each of the United States dollar-denominated revolving credit facilities is also available for the making of swingline loans. The issuance of such letters of credit and the making of any swingline loan reduces the amount available under the applicable revolving credit facility. We had prior senior secured credit facilities outstanding through May 19, 2016 (the 2014 facilities ), which were amended by the 2016 facilities in 2016. Among other things, this amendment provided for (i) us to borrow an additional $582 million principal amount of loans under the Term Loan A facility, (ii) the repayment of all outstanding loans under the previously outstanding Term Loan B facility with the proceeds of the additional loans under the Term Loan A facility, and (iii) the termination of the Term Loan B facility. We paid debt issuance costs of $11 million (of which $5 million was expensed as debt modification costs and $6 million is being amortized over the term of the related debt agreement) and recorded debt extinguishment costs of $11 million to write-off previously capitalized debt issuance costs. We had loans outstanding of $1.644 billion, net of original issue discounts and debt issuance costs, under the Term Loan A facility, $8 million of borrowings outstanding under the senior secured revolving credit facilities and $20 million of outstanding letters of credit under the senior secured revolving credit facilities as of February 3, 2019 . We made payments of $150 million, $250 million and $350 million during 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, on our term loans under the 2016 facilities and 2014 facilities. As a result of the voluntary repayments we have made to date, as of February 3, 2019 , we are not required to make a long-term debt repayment until June 2020. The United States dollar-denominated borrowings under the 2016 facilities bear interest at a rate equal to an applicable margin plus, as determined at our option, either (a) a base rate determined by reference to the greater of (i) the prime rate, (ii) the United States federal funds rate plus 1/2 of 1.00% and (iii) a one-month adjusted Eurocurrency rate plus 1.00% or (b) an adjusted Eurocurrency rate, calculated in a manner set forth in the 2016 facilities. The Canadian dollar-denominated borrowings under the 2016 facilities bear interest at a rate equal to an applicable margin plus, as determined at our option, either (a) a Canadian prime rate determined by reference to the greater of (i) the rate of interest per annum that Royal Bank of Canada establishes as the reference rate of interest in order to determine interest rates for loans in Canadian dollars to its Canadian borrowers and (ii) the sum of (x) the average of the rates per annum for Canadian dollar bankers acceptances having a term of one month and (y) 0.75%, or (b) an adjusted Eurocurrency rate, calculated in a manner set forth in the 2016 facilities. The borrowings under the 2016 facilities in currencies other than United States dollars or Canadian dollars bear interest at a rate equal to an applicable margin plus an adjusted Eurocurrency rate, calculated in a manner set forth in the 2016 facilities. The current applicable margin with respect to the Term Loan A facility and each revolving credit facility is 1.50% for adjusted Eurocurrency rate loans and 0.50% for base rate loans, respectively. After the date of delivery of the compliance certificate and financial statements with respect to each of our fiscal quarters, the applicable margin for borrowings under the Term Loan A facility and the revolving credit facilities is subject to adjustment based upon our net leverage ratio. 46 We entered into interest rate swap agreements designed with the intended effect of converting notional amounts of our variable rate debt obligation to fixed rate debt. Under the terms of the agreements, for the outstanding notional amount, our exposure to fluctuations in the one-month LIBOR is eliminated and we pay a fixed rate plus the current applicable margin. The following interest rate swap agreements were entered into or in effect during 2018, 2017 and 2016: (In millions) Designation Date Commencement Date Initial Notional Amount Notional Amount Outstanding as of February 3, 2019 Fixed Rate Expiration Date January 2019 February 2020 $ 50 $ 2.4187% February 2021 November 2018 February 2019 139 2.8645% February 2021 October 2018 February 2019 116 2.9975% February 2021 June 2018 August 2018 50 50 2.6825% February 2021 June 2017 February 2018 306 182 1.566% February 2020 July 2014 February 2016 683 1.924% February 2018 The notional amounts of the outstanding interest rate swap that commenced in February 2018 and the interest rate swaps that will commence in February 2019 will be adjusted according to pre-set schedules during the terms of the swap agreements such that, based on our projections for future debt repayments, our outstanding debt under the 2016 facilities is expected to always equal or exceed the combined notional amount of the then-outstanding interest rate swaps. 4 1/2% Senior Notes Due 2022 We had outstanding $700 million principal amount of 4 1/2% senior notes due December 15, 2022. We redeemed these notes on January 5, 2018 in connection with the issuance of 600 million euro-denominated principal amount of 3 1/8% senior notes due December 15, 2027, as discussed below. We paid a premium of $16 million to the holders of these notes in connection with the redemption and recorded debt extinguishment costs of $8 million to write-off previously capitalized debt issuance costs associated with these notes during 2017. 7 3/4% Debentures Due 2023 We have outstanding $100 million of debentures due November 15, 2023 that accrue interest at the rate of 7 3/4%. The debentures are not redeemable at our option prior to maturity. 3 5/8% Euro Senior Notes Due 2024 We issued on June 20, 2016 350 million euro-denominated principal amount of 3 5/8% senior notes due July 15, 2024. Interest on the notes is payable in euros. We paid 6 million (approximately $7 million based on exchange rates in effect on the payment date) of fees during 2016 in connection with the issuance of these notes, which are amortized over the term of the notes. We may redeem some or all of these notes at any time prior to April 15, 2024 by paying a make whole premium plus any accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, we may redeem some or all of these notes on or after April 15, 2024 at their principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest. 3 1/8% Euro Senior Notes Due 2027 We issued on December 21, 2017 600 million euro-denominated principal amount of 3 1/8% senior notes due December 15, 2027. Interest on the notes is payable in euros. We paid 9 million (approximately $ 10 million based on exchange rates in effect on the payment date) of fees during 2017 in connection with the issuance of these notes, which are amortized over the term of the notes. We may redeem some or all of these notes at any time prior to September 15, 2027 by paying a make whole premium plus any accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, we may redeem some or all of these notes on or after September 15, 2027 at their principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest. Our financing arrangements contain financial and non-financial covenants and customary events of default. As of February 3, 2019 , we were in compliance with all applicable covenants under our financing arrangements. 47 As of February 3, 2019 , our issuer credit was rated BBB- by Standard & Poor with a stable outlook and our corporate credit was rated Ba1 by Moody with a positive outlook. In assessing our credit strength, we believe that both Standard & Poor and Moody considered, among other things, our capital structure and financial policies, our consolidated balance sheet, our historical acquisition activity and other financial information, as well as industry and other qualitative factors. Please see Note 8 , Debt , in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for further discussion of our debt. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes, as of February 3, 2019 , our contractual cash obligations by future period: Payments Due by Period Description Total Obligations 2019 2020-2021 2022-2023 Thereafter (In millions) Long-term debt (1) $ 2,839 $ $ 1,649 $ 100 $ 1,090 Interest payments on long-term debt 469 111 178 87 93 Short-term borrowings 13 13 Operating and capital leases (2) 2,171 408 694 447 621 Inventory purchase commitments (3) 1,074 1,074 Minimum contractual royalty payments (4) 32 18 12 2 Non-qualified supplemental defined benefit plan (5) 9 1 2 1 5 Sponsorship and model payments (6) 57 28 25 3 1 Total contractual cash obligations $ 6,664 $ 1,653 $ 2,560 $ 640 $ 1,810 ______________________ (1) At February 3, 2019 , we had outstanding $1.649 billion under a senior secured Term Loan A facility, which requires mandatory payments through May 19, 2021 (according to the mandatory repayment schedules), $100 million of 7 3/4% debentures due November 15, 2023, $401 million of 3 5/8% senior unsecured euro notes due July 15, 2024 and $688 million of 3 1/8% senior unsecured euro notes due December 15, 2027. (2) Includes retail store, warehouse, distribution centers, showroom, office and equipment operating leases, as well as capital leases. Retail store operating leases generally provide for payment of direct operating costs in addition to rent. The obligation amounts listed include future minimum lease payments and exclude such direct operating costs. Please see Note 16 , Leases , in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for further information. (3) Represents contractual commitments that are enforceable and legally binding for goods on order and not received or paid for as of February 3, 2019 . Inventory purchase commitments also include fabric commitments with our suppliers, which secure a portion of our material needs for future seasons. Substantially all of these goods are expected to be received and the related payments are expected to be made within six months of our year end. This amount does not include foreign currency forward exchange contracts that we have entered into to manage our exposure to exchange rate changes with respect to certain of these purchases. Please see Note 10 , Derivative Financial Instruments , in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for further information. (4) Our minimum contractual royalty payments arise under numerous license agreements we have with third parties, each of which has different terms. Agreements typically require us to make minimum payments to the licensors of the licensed trademarks based on expected or required minimum levels of sales of licensed products, as well as additional royalty payments based on a percentage of sales when our sales exceed such minimum sales. Certain of our license agreements require that we pay a specified percentage of net sales to the licensor for advertising and promotion of the licensed products, in some cases requiring a minimum amount to be paid. Any advertising payments, with the exception of minimum payments to licensors, are excluded from the minimum contractual royalty payments shown in the table. There is no guarantee that we will exceed the minimum payments under any of these license agreements. However, given our projected sales levels for products covered under these agreements, we currently anticipate that 48 future payments required under our license agreements on an aggregate basis will exceed the contractual minimums shown in the table. (5) We have an unfunded, non-qualified supplemental defined benefit plan covering certain retired executives under which the participants will receive a predetermined amount during the 10 years following the attainment of age 65, provided that prior to the termination of employment with us, the participant has been in such plan for at least 10 years and has attained age 55. (6) Represents payment obligations for sponsorships. We have agreements relating to our sponsorship of the Barclays Center, the Brooklyn Nets, Mercedes-AMG Petronas Motorsport in Formula One TM racing and certain other professional sports teams and athletes and other similar sponsorships, as well as agreements with celebrities, models and stylists. Not included in the above table are contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plans, or payments to employees and retirees in connection with our unfunded supplemental executive retirement, supplemental pension and postretirement health plans. Contractual cash obligations for these plans cannot be determined due to the number of assumptions required to estimate our future benefit obligations, including return on assets, discount rate and future compensation increases. The liabilities associated with these plans, together with the liability for the non-qualified supplemental defined benefit plans included in the above table, are presented in Note 12 , Retirement and Benefit Plans , in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report. Currently, we do not expect to make any material contributions to our pension plans in 2018. Our actual contributions may differ from our planned contributions due to many factors, including changes in tax and other benefit laws, or significant differences between expected and actual pension asset performance or interest rates. Not included in the above table are $184 million of net potential cash obligations associated with uncertain tax positions due to the uncertainty regarding the future cash outflows associated with such obligations. Please see Note 9 , Income Taxes , in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for further information related to uncertain tax positions. Not included in the above table are $32 million of asset retirement obligations related to leased office and retail store locations due to the uncertainty of timing of future cash outflows associated with such obligations. Please see Note 22 , Other Comments , in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for further information related to asset retirement obligations. Not included in the above table are contractual royalty obligations related to our perpetual license agreement with Speedo International Limited. Under the terms of the agreement, our contractual minimum payments each year are $1 million, which is subject to annual increases based on the Consumer Price Index. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have a material current effect, or that are reasonably likely to have a material future effect, on our financial position, changes in financial position, revenue, expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. 49 MARKET RISK Financial instruments held by us as of February 3, 2019 include cash and cash equivalents, short-term borrowings, long-term debt, foreign currency forward exchange contracts and interest rate swap agreements. Note 11 , Fair Value Measurements , in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report outlines the fair value of our financial instruments as of February 3, 2019 . Cash and cash equivalents held by us are affected by short-term interest rates, which are currently low. The potential for a significant decrease in short-term interest rates is low due to the currently low rates of return we are receiving on our cash and cash equivalents and, therefore, a further decrease would not have a material impact on our interest income. However, there is potential for a more significant increase in short-term interest rates, which could have a more material impact on our interest income. Given our balance of cash and cash equivalents at February 3, 2019 , the effect of a 10 basis point change in short-term interest rates on our interest income would be approximately $450,000 annually. Borrowings under our 2016 facilities bear interest at a rate equal to an applicable margin plus a variable rate. As such, our 2016 facilities expose us to market risk for changes in interest rates. We have entered into interest rate swap agreements for the intended purpose of reducing our exposure to interest rate volatility. As of February 3, 2019 , after taking into account the effect of our interest rate swap agreements that were in effect as of such date, approximately 50% of our long-term debt was at a fixed interest rate, with the remainder at variable interest rates. Given our debt position at February 3, 2019 , the effect of a 10 basis point change in interest rates on our variable interest expense would be approximately $1 million annually. Please see the section entitled Liquidity and Capital Resources above for further discussion of our credit facilities and interest rate swap agreements. Our Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein businesses each have substantial international components that expose us to significant foreign exchange risk. Our Heritage Brands business also has international components but those components are not significant to the business. Over 50% of our $9.657 billion of revenue in 2018 was generated outside of the United States. Changes in exchange rates between the United States dollar and other currencies can impact our financial results in two ways: a translational impact and a transactional impact. The translational impact refers to the impact that changes in exchange rates can have on our results of operations and financial position. The functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries are generally the applicable local currencies. Our consolidated financial statements are presented in United States dollars. The results of operations in local foreign currencies are translated into United States dollars using an average exchange rate over the representative period and the assets and liabilities in local foreign currencies are translated into United States dollars using the closing exchange rate at the balance sheet date. Foreign exchange differences that arise from the translation of our foreign subsidiaries assets and liabilities into United States dollars are recorded as foreign currency translation adjustments in other comprehensive (loss) income. Accordingly, our results of operations and other comprehensive (loss) income will be unfavorably impacted during times of a strengthening United States dollar, particularly against the euro, the Brazilian real, the Japanese yen, the Korean won, the British pound sterling, the Canadian dollar and the Chinese yuan renminbi, and favorably impacted during times of a weakening United States dollar against those currencies. In 2018, we recognized unfavorable foreign currency translation adjustments of $361 million within other comprehensive loss, principally driven by a strengthening of the United States dollar against the euro of 8% since February 4, 2018 . Our foreign currency translation adjustments recorded in other comprehensive (loss) income are significantly impacted by the substantial amount of goodwill and other intangible assets denominated in the euro, which represented 34% of our $7.2 billion total goodwill and other intangible assets as of February 3, 2019 . This translational impact was partially mitigated by the change in the fair value of our net investment hedges discussed below. A transactional impact on financial results is common for apparel companies operating outside the United States that purchase goods in United States dollars, as is the case with most of our foreign operations. As with translation, our results of operations will be unfavorably impacted during times of a strengthening United States dollar as the increased local currency value of inventory results in a higher cost of goods in local currency when the goods are sold and favorably impacted during times of a weakening United States dollar as the decreased local currency value of inventory results in a lower cost of goods in local currency when the goods are sold. We also have exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to certain intercompany transactions and SG&A expenses. We currently use and plan to continue to use foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative instruments to mitigate the cash flow or market value risks associated with these inventory and intercompany transactions, but we are unable to entirely eliminate these risks. The foreign currency forward exchange contracts cover at least 70% of the projected inventory purchases in United States dollars by our foreign subsidiaries. 50 Given our foreign currency forward exchange contracts outstanding at February 3, 2019 , the effect of a 10% change in foreign currency exchange rates against the United States dollar would result in a change in the fair value of these contracts of approximately $105 million. Any change in the fair value of these contracts would be substantially offset by a change in the fair value of the underlying hedged items. Based on current foreign currency exchange rates, we expect a decrease in revenue of approximately $150 million, or 1%, and a slight decrease in net income in 2019 as compared to 2018 due to the impact of foreign currency exchange. In order to mitigate a portion of our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to the value of our investments in foreign subsidiaries denominated in the euro, we designated the carrying amount of our 950 million aggregate principal amount of euro-denominated senior notes that we had issued in the United States as net investment hedges of our investments in certain of our foreign subsidiaries that use the euro as their functional currency. The effect of a 10% change in the euro against the United States dollar would result in a change in the fair value of the net investment hedges of approximately $110 million. Any change in the fair value of the net investment hedges would be more than offset by a change in the value of our investments in certain of our European subsidiaries. Additionally, during times of a weakening United States dollar against the euro, we would be required to use a greater amount of our cash flows from operations to pay interest and make long-term debt repayments on our euro-denominated senior notes. Included in the calculations of expense and liabilities for our pension plans are various assumptions, including return on assets, discount rates, mortality rates and future compensation increases. Actual results could differ from these assumptions, which would require adjustments to our balance sheet and could result in volatility in our future pension expense. Holding all other assumptions constant, a 1% change in the assumed rate of return on assets would result in a change to 2019 net benefit cost related to the pension plans of approximately $6 million. Likewise, a 0.25% change in the assumed discount rate would result in a change to 2019 net benefit cost of approximately $31 million. SEASONALITY Our business generally follows a seasonal pattern. Our wholesale businesses tend to generate higher levels of sales in the first and third quarters, while our retail businesses tend to generate higher levels of sales in the fourth quarter. Royalty, advertising and other revenue tends to be earned somewhat evenly throughout the year, although the third quarter has the highest level of royalty revenue due to higher sales by licensees in advance of the holiday selling season. We expect this seasonal pattern will generally continue. Working capital requirements vary throughout the year to support these seasonal patterns and business trends. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Please see Note 1 , Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for a discussion of recently issued and adopted accounting standards. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Our consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of significant accounting policies, which require management to make significant estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are outlined in Note 1 , Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report. We believe that the following are the more critical judgmental areas in the application of our accounting policies that currently affect our financial position and results of operations: Sales allowances and returns We have arrangements with many of our department and specialty store customers to support their sales of our products. We establish accruals which, based on a review of the individual customer arrangements and the expected performance of our products in their stores, we believe will be required to satisfy our sales allowance obligations. We also establish accruals, which are based on historical experience, an evaluation of current sales trends and market conditions, and authorized amounts, that we believe are necessary to provide for sales allowances and inventory returns. Our historical accrual estimates have not differed materially from actual results. It is possible that the accrual estimates could vary from actual results, which would require adjustment to the allowance and returns accruals. Inventories Inventories are comprised principally of finished goods and are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, except for certain retail inventories in North America that are stated at the lower of cost or market using the 51 retail inventory method. Cost for substantially all wholesale inventories in North America and certain wholesale inventories in Asia is determined using the first-in, first-out method. Cost for all other inventories is determined using the weighted average cost method. We review current business trends, inventory aging and discontinued merchandise categories to determine adjustments which we estimate will be needed to liquidate existing clearance inventories and record inventories at either the lower of cost or net realizable value or the lower of cost or market using the retail inventory method, as applicable. We believe that all inventory writedowns required at February 3, 2019 have been recorded. Our historical estimates of inventory reserves have not differed materially from actual results. If market conditions were to change, it is possible that the required level of inventory reserves would need to be adjusted. Asset impairments We determined during each of 2018, 2017 and 2016 that long-lived assets in certain of our retail stores and shop-in-shops were not recoverable, which resulted in us recording impairment charges. In order to calculate the impairment charges, we estimated the undiscounted future cash flows and the related fair value of each asset. The undiscounted future cash flows for each asset were estimated using current sales trends and other factors. If different assumptions had been used for future sales trends, the recorded impairment charges could have been significantly higher or lower. Note 11 , Fair Value Measurements , in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report includes further discussion of the circumstances surrounding the impairments and the assumptions related to the impairment charges. Allowance for doubtful accounts Trade receivables, as presented in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, are net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. An allowance for doubtful accounts is determined through an analysis of the aging of accounts receivable and assessments of collectibility based on historic trends, the financial condition of our customers and an evaluation of economic conditions. Because we cannot predict future changes in economic conditions and in the financial stability of our customers, actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates and could impact our allowance for doubtful accounts. Income taxes Deferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases and are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered. Deferred tax assets are evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe a portion will not be realized. We consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets, including our recent earnings experience and expectations of future taxable income by taxing jurisdiction, the carryforward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes and other relevant factors. The actual realization of deferred tax assets may differ significantly from the amounts we have recorded. During the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Accounting for income taxes requires a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the tax position will be fully sustained upon review by taxing authorities, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. For tax positions that are 50 percent or less likely of being sustained upon audit, we do not recognize any portion of that benefit in the financial statements. We consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes. Our actual results have differed materially in the past and could differ materially in the future from our current estimates. The U.S. Tax Legislation was enacted on December 22, 2017. The U.S. Tax Legislation is comprehensive and significantly revised the United States tax code. Please see Note 9 , Income Taxes , in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for further discussion of the impacts of the U.S. Tax Legislation. Goodwill and other intangible assets Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually, at the beginning of the third quarter of each fiscal year, and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that it is more likely than not that the carrying amount may be impaired. Impairment testing for goodwill is done at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit is defined as an operating segment or one level below the operating segment, called a component. However, two or more components of an operating segment will be aggregated and deemed a single reporting unit if the components have similar economic characteristics. We assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a more detailed quantitative impairment test for goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets. We may elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to the quantitative test for any reporting units or indefinite-lived intangible assets. Qualitative factors that we consider as part of our assessment include a change in our market capitalization and its implied impact on reporting unit fair value, a change in our weighted average cost of capital, industry and market conditions, macroeconomic conditions, trends in product 52 costs and financial performance of our businesses. If we perform the quantitative test for any reporting units or indefinite-lived intangible assets, we generally use a discounted cash flow method to estimate fair value. The discounted cash flow method is based on the present value of projected cash flows. Assumptions used in these cash flow projections are generally consistent with our internal forecasts. The estimated cash flows are discounted using a rate that represents our weighted average cost of capital. The weighted average cost of capital is based on a number of variables, including the equity-risk premium and risk-free interest rate. Management believes the assumptions used for the impairment tests are consistent with those that would be utilized by a market participant performing similar analysis and valuations. Adverse changes in future market conditions or weaker operating results compared to our expectations may impact our projected cash flows and estimates of weighted average cost of capital, which could result in a potential impairment charge if we are unable to recover the carrying value of our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets. For goodwill, if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized to the extent the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill. For indefinite-lived intangible assets, an impairment loss is recognized to the extent the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value. For the 2018 annual goodwill impairment test, we elected to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceeded directly to the quantitative impairment test using a discounted cash flow method to estimate the fair value of our reporting units. The annual goodwill impairment test during 2018 yielded estimated fair values in excess of the carrying amounts for our reporting units, all of which had fair values in excess of the carrying amounts by more than 50%, and therefore the second step of the quantitative goodwill impairment test was not required. No impairment of goodwill resulted from our annual impairment test in 2018. For the 2017 annual goodwill impairment test, we elected to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it was more likely than not that the fair value of any reporting unit was less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it was necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. In evaluating whether it was more likely than not that the fair value of any reporting unit was less than its carrying amount, we assessed relevant events and circumstances including the change in our market capitalization and its implied impact on reporting unit fair value, a change in our weighted average cost of capital, industry and market conditions, macroeconomic conditions, trends in product costs and financial performance of our businesses. After assessing these events and circumstances, we determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of any reporting unit was less than its carrying amount and concluded that the quantitative goodwill impairment test was not required. No impairment of goodwill resulted from our annual impairment test in 2017. For the 2018 annual impairment test of all indefinite-lived intangible assets, except for the Geoffrey Beene tradename, we elected to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceeded directly to the quantitative impairment test using a discounted cash flow method to estimate fair value. For the Geoffrey Beene tradename, since only a few months had passed since the acquisition on April 20, 2018 and there had not been any significant changes in the business, we determined qualitatively that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of this tradename was less than the carrying amount and concluded that the quantitative impairment test was not required. No impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets resulted from our annual impairment tests in 2018. For the 2017 annual impairment test of certain indefinite-lived intangible assets, we elected to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it was more likely than not that the fair value of any asset was less than its carrying amount. In performing this evaluation, we assessed relevant events and circumstances including industry and market conditions, a change in our weighted average cost of capital, macroeconomic conditions, trends in product costs and financial performance of our businesses. After assessing these events and circumstances, we determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of these certain indefinite-lived intangible assets were less than their carrying amounts and concluded that the quantitative impairment test was not required. For certain other indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment tests, we elected to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceeded directly to the quantitative impairment test using a discounted cash flow method to estimate fair value. No impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets resulted from our annual impairment tests in 2017. If different assumptions for our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment tests had been applied, significantly different outcomes could have resulted. There can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions used in our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment testing performed in 2018 will prove to be accurate predictions of the future. For example, if general macroeconomic conditions deteriorate or otherwise vary from current assumptions (including those resulting in changes in the weighted average cost of capital), industry or market conditions deteriorate, business conditions or strategies for a specific reporting unit change from current assumptions, including cost increases or loss of major customers, our businesses do not perform as projected, or there is an extended period of a significant decline in our stock price, this could be an indicator that the excess fair value of our reporting units could be lessened and the chance of an impairment of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets could be raised. 53 Pension and Benefit Plans Pension and benefit plan expenses are recorded throughout the year based on calculations using actuarial valuations that incorporate estimates and assumptions that depend in part on financial market, economic and demographic conditions, including expected long-term rate of return on assets, discount rate and mortality rates. These assumptions require significant judgment. Actuarial gains and losses, which occur when actual experience differs from our actuarial assumptions, are recognized in the year in which they occur and could have a material impact on our operating results. These gains and losses are measured at least annually at the end of our fiscal year and, as such, are generally recorded during the fourth quarter of each year. The expected long-term rate of return on assets is based on historical returns and the level of risk premium associated with the asset classes in which the portfolio is invested as well as expectations for the long-term future returns of each asset class. The expected long-term rate of return for each asset class is then weighted based on the target asset allocation to develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption for the portfolio. The expected return on plan assets is recognized quarterly and determined by applying the long-term expected rate of return on assets to the actual fair value of plan assets adjusted for expected benefit payments, contributions and plan expenses. At the end of the year, the fair value of the assets is remeasured and any difference between the actual return on assets and the expected return is recorded in earnings as part of the actuarial gain or loss. The discount rate is determined based on current market interest rates. It is selected by constructing a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds that matches the cash flows from interest payments and principal maturities of the portfolio to the timing of benefit payments to participants. The yield on such a portfolio is the basis for the selected discount rate. Service and interest cost is measured using the discount rate as of the beginning of the year, while the projected benefit obligation is measured using the discount rate as of the end of the year. The impact of the change in the discount rate on our projected benefit obligation is recorded in earnings as part of the actuarial gain or loss. We revised during each of 2018 and 2017 the mortality assumptions used to determine our benefit obligations based on recently published actuarial mortality tables. These changes in life expectancy resulted in changes to the period for which we expect benefits to be paid. In 2018, the decrease in life expectancy decreased our benefit obligations and future expense, and, in 2017, the increase in life expectancy increased our benefit obligations and future expense. We also periodically review and revise, as necessary, other plan assumptions such as rates of compensation increases, retirement, and termination based on historical experience and anticipated future management actions. We have not historically had significant adjustments to these assumptions. Actual results could differ from our assumptions, which would require adjustments to our balance sheet and could result in volatility in our future net benefit cost. Holding all other assumptions constant, a 1% change in the assumed rate of return on assets would result in a change to 2019 net benefit cost related to the pension plans of approximately $6 million. Likewise, a 0.25% change in the assumed discount rate would result in a change to 2019 net benefit cost of approximately $31 million. Note 12 , Retirement and Benefit Plans , in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report sets forth certain significant rate assumptions and information regarding our target asset allocation, which are used in performing calculations related to our pension plans. Stock-based compensation Accounting for stock-based compensation requires measurement of compensation cost for all stock-based awards at fair value on the date of grant and recognition of compensation cost over the service period for awards expected to vest. We use the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model to determine the fair value of our stock options. This model uses assumptions that include the risk-free interest rate, expected volatility, expected dividend yield and expected life of the options. The fair value of restricted stock units is determined based on the quoted price of our common stock on the date of grant. The fair value of our stock options and restricted stock units is recognized as expense over the service period, net of actual forfeitures. The fair value of contingently issuable performance shares that are subject to market conditions is established using a Monte Carlo simulation model. Certain contingently issuable performance shares that are subject to market conditions are also subject to a holding period of one year after the vesting date. For such awards, the grant date fair value is discounted for the restriction of liquidity, which is calculated using the Chaffe model. We record expense for the awards that are subject to market conditions ratably over the vesting period, net of actual forfeitures, regardless of whether the market condition is satisfied. 54
