Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Company's consolidated financial statements and related notes. All references to years relate to fiscal years which ended on January 31 of the following calendar year. KEY STRATEGIES The Company's key strategies are: To enhance customer awareness of the TIFFANY & CO. trademark (the Brand ), its heritage, its products and its association with quality and luxury. The Brand is the single most important asset of the Company. Management will continue to invest in marketing and public relations programs designed to build awareness of the Brand, its heritage and its products with both new and existing customers, as well as to enhance the Brand association among consumers with quality and luxury. Management will continue to monitor these efforts and the strength of the Brand through market research. To maintain an active product development program. The Company continues to invest in product development in order to introduce new design collections and extensions of existing collections that will appeal to the Company existing customer base as well as to new customers. The Company will also invest in the watch category, which it deems appropriate for the Brand and which presents incremental growth opportunities. To enhance the customer experience with superior customer service and through engaging store environments. To ensure a superior shopping experience, the Company employs highly qualified sales and customer service professionals, focuses on enhancing ongoing sales and product training programs, and is investing in enhancing its information systems for customer relationship management. The Company also focuses on continually enhancing the design of its stores, as well as the creative visual presentation of its merchandise, to provide an engaging luxury experience in both its new and existing stores. To selectively expand global distribution without compromising the value of the Brand. Management intends to continue to expand its global distribution by adding stores in both new and existing markets and through its e-commerce websites. Management recognizes that over-saturation of any market could diminish the distinctive appeal of the Brand, but believes that there are a significant number of potential worldwide locations remaining that meet financial and Brand requirements. To increase store productivity. Through the above efforts, the Company is committed to growing sales per square foot by increasing both consumer traffic and the percentage of store visitors who make a purchase. In addition, the Company is increasing, through store renovations, the percentage of selling space in some of its stores, which is contributing to higher store productivity. TIFFANY & CO. K- 26 Table of Contents To maintain substantial control over product supply through direct diamond sourcing and internal jewelry manufacturing. The Company's diamond processing operations purchase, sort, cut and/or polish rough diamonds for use in merchandise. The Company will continue to seek additional sources of diamonds which, combined with continued focus on its internal manufacturing operations, are intended to secure adequate product supplies and favorable costs. To achieve improved operating margins. Management's long-term objective is to improve operating margin through the above efforts, along with the realization of efficiencies in product sourcing, manufacturing and distribution, the control of selling, general and administrative expenses and the enhancement of productivity through sales leverage on fixed costs, such that sales growth can generate a higher relative rate of earnings growth. 2013 SUMMARY Worldwide net sales increased 6% to $4,031,130,000 . On a constant-exchange-rate basis (see "Non-GAAP Measures" below), worldwide net sales in 2013 increased 10% due to sales growth in all regions, and comparable store sales increased 6% . The Company added a net of 14 TIFFANY & CO. stores (opening six in the Americas, seven in Asia-Pacific and three in Europe while closing one in Asia-Pacific and one in Japan). Operating margin decreased 10.9 percentage points. However, excluding certain expenses (see "Non-GAAP Measures" below), operating margin increased 1.3 percentage points primarily due to an increase in gross margin as well as sales leverage on operating expenses. Net earnings decreased 56% to $181,369,000 , or $1.41 per diluted share. However, excluding certain expenses (see "Non-GAAP Measures" below), net earnings increased 15% to $480,557,000, or $3.73 per diluted share. In May 2013, the Board of Directors approved a 6% increase in the quarterly dividend rate to $0.34 per share of the Company's Common Stock, or an annual dividend rate of $1.36 per share. Free cash flow (see "Non-GAAP Measures" below) was an outflow of $66,800,000 in 2013 entirely due to the arbitration award payment, compared with an inflow of $108,760,000 in 2012 . RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Non-GAAP Measures The Company reports information in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP"). The Company's management does not, nor does it suggest that investors should, consider non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company presents such non-GAAP financial measures in reporting its financial results to provide investors with an additional tool to evaluate the Company's operating results. TIFFANY & CO. K- 27 Table of Contents Net Sales . The Company's reported net sales reflect either a translation-related benefit from strengthening foreign currencies or a detriment from a strengthening U.S. dollar. Internally, management monitors and measures its sales performance on a non-GAAP basis that eliminates the positive or negative effects that result from translating sales made outside the U.S. into U.S. dollars ("constant-exchange-rate basis"). Management believes this constant-exchange-rate basis provides a more representative assessment of sales performance and provides better comparability between reporting periods. The following table reconciles the sales percentage increases (decreases) from the GAAP to the non-GAAP basis versus the previous year: 2013 2012 GAAP Reported Translation Effect Constant- Exchange- Rate Basis GAAP Reported Translation Effect Constant- Exchange- Rate Basis Net Sales: Worldwide 6 % (4 )% 10 % 4 % (1 )% 5 % Americas 5 5 2 2 Asia-Pacific 17 (1 ) 18 8 8 Japan (9 ) (20 ) 11 4 (2 ) 6 Europe 9 2 7 3 (4 ) 7 Other 53 53 41 41 Comparable Store Sales: Worldwide 3 % (3 )% 6 % % (1 )% 1 % Americas 3 3 (2 ) (2 ) Asia-Pacific 10 (1 ) 11 3 1 2 Japan (10 ) (20 ) 10 4 (3 ) 7 Europe 6 2 4 (2 ) (4 ) 2 Other* 14 14 * Represents sales in five TIFFANY & CO. stores in the United Arab Emirates ("U.A.E."), which were converted from independently-operated to Company-operated in July 2012, and became comparable in the third quarter of 2013. TIFFANY & CO. K- 28 Table of Contents Statement of Earnings. Internally, management monitors and measures its earnings performance excluding certain items listed below. Management believes excluding such items presents the Company's results on a more comparable basis to the corresponding period in the prior year, thereby providing investors with an additional perspective to analyze the results of operations of the Company. The following tables reconcile certain GAAP amounts to non-GAAP amounts: (in thousands, except per share amounts) GAAP Arbitration award a increase/ (decrease) Specific cost-reduction initiatives b (decrease)/increase Non-GAAP Year Ended January 31, 2014 Selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses $ 1,555,903 $ $ (9,379 ) $ 1,546,524 Earnings from operations 304,329 480,211 9,379 793,919 As a % of sales 7.5 % 19.7 % Other income, net 13,191 (7,489 ) 5,702 Provision for income taxes 73,497 179,319 3,594 256,410 Effective tax rate 28.8 % 34.8 % Net earnings 181,369 293,403 5,785 480,557 As a % of sales 4.5 % 11.9 % Diluted earnings per share 1.41 2.28 0.04 3.73 a Amounts associated with the award issued in arbitration between the Swatch Group Ltd. and the Company.

TIFFANY & CO. K- 29 Table of Contents Free Cash Flow. Internally, management monitors its cash flow on a non-GAAP basis. The ability to generate free cash flow demonstrates how much cash the Company has available for discretionary and non-discretionary items after deduction of capital expenditures. The Company's operations require regular capital expenditures for the opening, renovation and expansion of stores and distribution and manufacturing facilities as well as ongoing investments in information technology. Management believes this provides a more representative assessment of operating cash flows. The following table reconciles GAAP net cash provided by operating activities to non-GAAP free cash flow: Years Ended January 31, ( in thousands) 2014 2013 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 154,652 $ 328,290 Less: Capital expenditures (221,452 ) (219,530 ) Free cash (outflow) inflow $ (66,800 ) $ 108,760 Comparable Store Sales Comparable store sales include only sales transacted in Company-operated stores open for more than 12 months. In markets other than Japan, sales for relocated stores are included in comparable store sales if the relocation occurs within the same geographical market. In Japan, sales for a new store are not included if the store was relocated from one department store to another or from a department store to a free-standing location. In all markets, the results of a store in which the square footage has been expanded or reduced remain in the comparable store base. Net Sales Net sales by segment were as follows: (in thousands) 2013 2012 2011 2013 vs. 2012 % Change 2012 vs. 2011 % Change Americas $ 1,926,864 $ 1,839,969 $ 1,805,783 5 % 2 % Asia-Pacific 944,676 810,420 748,214 17 8 Japan 578,571 639,185 616,505 (9 ) 4 Europe 469,784 432,167 421,141 9 3 Other 111,235 72,508 51,294 53 41 $ 4,031,130 $ 3,794,249 $ 3,642,937 6 % 4 % Americas .

In 2013 , total sales in the Americas increased $86,895,000 , or 5% , due to an increase in the average price per jewelry unit sold partly offset by fewer jewelry units sold. Comparable store sales increased $43,393,000, or 3%, led by growth in New York Flagship store sales as well as modest growth in branch store sales. Non-comparable store sales grew $46,563,000. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, sales in the Americas increased 5% , and comparable store sales increased 3% . In 2012, total sales in the Americas increased $34,186,000, or 2%, due to an increase in the average price per jewelry unit sold partly offset by fewer jewelry units sold. Comparable store sales decreased $32,800,000, or 2%, consisting of similar percentage decreases in New York Flagship store sales and in TIFFANY & CO. K- 30 Table of Contents comparable branch store sales. Non-comparable store sales grew $56,362,000 and sales of TIFFANY & CO. merchandise to independent distributors increased $3,158,000. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, sales in the Americas increased 2%, and comparable store sales decreased 2%.

Asia-Pacific currently includes sales in 72 Company-operated TIFFANY & CO. stores, as well as sales of TIFFANY & CO. products in certain markets through Internet and wholesale operations. Asia-Pacific represented 23% , 21% and 21% of worldwide net sales in 2013 , 2012 and 2011 . Sales in Greater China represented more than half of Asia-Pacific's net sales in those same periods. In 2013 , total sales in Asia-Pacific increased $134,256,000 , or 17% , due to an increase in the number of jewelry units sold and in the average price per jewelry unit sold. Comparable store sales increased $74,818,000, or 10%, non-comparable store sales grew $44,519,000 and sales of TIFFANY & CO. merchandise to independent distributors increased $15,232,000. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, Asia-Pacific sales increased 18% and comparable store sales increased 11% due to geographically broad-based sales growth across the region. In 2012, total sales in Asia-Pacific increased $62,206,000, or 8%, primarily due to an increase in the number of jewelry units sold. Comparable store sales increased $18,374,000, or 3%, non-comparable store sales grew $32,571,000 and sales of TIFFANY & CO. merchandise to independent distributors increased $9,447,000.

Japan currently includes sales in 54 Company-operated TIFFANY & CO. stores, as well as sales of TIFFANY & CO. products through business-to-business, Internet and wholesale operations. Japan represented 14% , 17% and 17% of worldwide net sales in 2013 , 2012 and 2011 . The decline in 2013 was entirely due to a negative translation effect from the Japanese yen weakening against the U.S. dollar. In 2013 , total sales in Japan decreased $60,614,000 , or 9% , and comparable store sales decreased $57,525,000, or 10%, due to currency translation.

In 2013 , total sales in Europe increased $37,617,000 , or 9% , due to an increase in the number of jewelry units sold and in the average price per jewelry unit sold. Comparable store sales increased $21,653,000, or 6%, non-comparable store sales increased $10,927,000 and Internet sales increased $5,047,000. On a constant-exchange-rate basis, sales in Europe increased 7% and comparable store sales increased 4% reflecting growth in most countries. In 2012, total sales in Europe increased $11,026,000, or 3%, due to an increase in the average price per jewelry unit sold partly offset by a decrease in the number of jewelry units sold.

On a constant-exchange-rate basis, sales in Europe increased 7% and comparable store sales increased 2% reflecting growth in most of continental Europe and a modest sales decline in the U.K. Other. Other consists of all non-reportable segments. Other includes the Emerging Markets region, which consists of retail sales in five TIFFANY & CO. stores in the U.A.E. which were converted from independently-operated to Company-operated stores in July 2012, and wholesale sales of TIFFANY & CO. merchandise to independent distributors for resale in certain emerging markets (primarily in the Middle East, and through January 2014 in Russia).

In 2013 , Other sales increased $38,727,000 , or 53% , primarily due to retail sales growth in the U.A.E. as well as higher wholesale sales of rough diamonds. Comparable store sales of five TIFFANY & CO. stores in the U.A.E. increased 14%. In 2012, Other sales increased $21,214,000, or 41%, primarily due to the incremental retail sales from the conversion of the five stores in the U.A.E. Product Category Information. In 2013 , worldwide net sales increased $236,881,000 , or 6% , primarily driven by increases of $176,712,000 , or 23% , in the statement, fine & solitaire jewelry category (reflecting growth throughout the category, along with growing demand for colored diamonds and other gemstones); $39,596,000 , or 3% , in the engagement jewelry & wedding bands category (reflecting growth in solitaire diamonds rings); and $36,965,000 , or 2% , in the fashion jewelry category (primarily due to sales growth of gold jewelry). In 2012, worldwide net sales increased $151,312,000 , or 4% , primarily driven by increases of $ 44,015,000 , or 6% , in the statement, fine & solitaire jewelry category (reflecting particularly strong sales of yellow and fancy colored diamond jewelry); $37,457,000 , or 3% , in the engagement jewelry & wedding bands category; and $66,470,000 , or 4% , in the fashion jewelry category (primarily due to the introduction of the RUBEDO metal in 2012 and sales growth in jewelry designed by Elsa Peretti and Paloma Picasso). Store Data . In 2013 , the Company added a net of 14 stores: six in the Americas (three in the U.S., one each in Canada, Mexico and Brazil), seven in Asia-Pacific (four in China, two in Taiwan and one in Hong Kong) and three in Europe (two in Italy and one in Germany) while closing one store each in Asia-Pacific and in Japan. In 2012, the Company added a net of 28 stores: 13 in the Americas (six in Canada which included the conversion of four department-store locations from independently-operated wholesale distribution to Company-operated stores, four in the U.S., two in Mexico and one in Brazil), eight in Asia-Pacific (six in China, one in Singapore and one in Australia), two in Europe (France and the Czech Republic) and five stores in the U.A.E. Sales per gross square foot generated by all company-operated stores were approximately $3,100 in 2013 and $3,000 in both 2012 and 2011. TIFFANY & CO. K- 32 Table of Contents Gross Margin 2013 2012 2011 Gross profit as a percentage of net sales 58.1 % 57.0 % 59.0 % Gross margin (gross profit as a percentage of net sales) increased by 1.1 percentage points in 2013 primarily benefiting from reduced product cost pressures and price increases taken in the first half of the year. A continued shift in sales mix toward higher-priced, lower-margin products offset a portion of these benefits. Gross margin decreased by 2.0 percentage points in 2012 largely due to high precious metal and diamond costs, as well as a shift in sales mix toward higher-priced, lower-margin products, and reduced sales leverage on fixed costs. Sales mix was affected by, among other items, a decline in sales of silver jewelry which earns a higher margin than the Company's overall gross margin. Management periodically reviews and adjusts its retail prices when appropriate to address product cost increases, specific market conditions and changes in foreign currencies/U.S. dollar relationships. Its long-term strategy is to continue that approach. Among the market conditions that management considers are consumer demand for the product category involved, which may be influenced by consumer confidence, and competitive pricing conditions. Management uses derivative instruments to mitigate certain foreign exchange and precious metal price exposures (see "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note I - Hedging Instruments"). Management increased retail prices in the first half of 2013 across all geographic regions and product categories as previous increases were insufficient to offset commodity cost pressures experienced in recent years. Price increases in 2012 were not significant. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 2013 2012 2011 SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales 38.6 % 38.6 % 39.6 % SG&A expenses increased $89,836,000 , or 6% , in 2013 and $23,339,000, or 2%, in 2012. SG&A expenses in those years are not comparable due to the inclusion of certain expenses associated with specific cost-reduction initiatives in 2013 and expenses associated with the relocation of the New York headquarters staff in 2011. See "Non-GAAP Measures" for further details. Excluding the 2013 items noted in "Non-GAAP Measures", SG&A expenses in 2013 increased $80,457,000, or 5%, primarily due to increased fixed and variable labor costs, such as sales commissions and incentive compensation, of $34,628,000 and increased store occupancy and depreciation expenses of $32,577,000 related to new and existing stores. In 2013, changes in foreign currency exchange rates had the effect of decreasing SG&A expenses by 3%. Excluding the 2011 items noted in "Non-GAAP Measures", SG&A expenses increased $65,845,000, or 5%, in 2012 primarily due to increased store occupancy and depreciation expenses of $36,090,000 related to new and existing stores, increased marketing expenses of $8,474,000 and increased labor and benefit costs of $5,081,000. In 2012, the modest increase in labor and benefit costs reflected reduced incentive compensation. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales, excluding the items noted in "Non-GAAP Measures", would have been 38.4% in both 2013 and 2011. The Company's SG&A expenses are largely fixed in nature. Variable costs (which include items such as variable store rent, sales commissions and fees paid to credit card companies) represent approximately one-fifth of total SG&A expenses. TIFFANY & CO. K- 33 Table of Contents Arbitration Award Expense In the quarter ended January 31, 2014, the Company recorded a charge of $480,211,000, related to the adverse arbitration ruling between The Swatch Group Ltd. and the Company, which includes the damages, interest and other costs associated with the ruling. See "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note K - Commitments and Contingencies" for additional information.

Earnings from operations decreased 56% in 2013 but would have increased 14% when excluding other operating expenses. On a segment basis, the ratio of earnings (losses) from operations to each segment's net sales in 2013 compared with 2012 was as follows: Americas the ratio increased 0.6 percentage point resulting from an improvement in gross margin as well as sales leveraging of operating expenses; Asia-Pacific the ratio increased 2.5 percentage points primarily due an improvement in gross margin as well as sales leveraging of operating expenses; Japan the ratio increased 5.3 percentage points primarily due to an improvement in gross margin (which includes a benefit from the Company's ongoing program to utilize forward contracts for a portion of forecasted merchandise purchases) as well as sales leveraging of operating expenses; Europe the ratio increased 0.5 percentage point due to an improvement in gross margin partly offset by increased store-related operating expenses; and Other the ratio improved 8.0 percentage points due to increased earnings as well as sales leveraging of operating expenses in the Emerging Markets region offset by charges associated with the valuation of wholesale diamonds not suitable for the Company's needs. TIFFANY & CO. K- 34 Table of Contents Earnings from operations decreased 2% in 2012. On a segment basis, the ratio of earnings (losses) from operations to each segment's net sales in 2012 compared with 2011 was as follows: Americas the ratio decreased 2.7 percentage points primarily resulting from a decline in gross margin as well as increased operating expenses due to the opening of new stores; Asia-Pacific the ratio decreased 4.2 percentage points primarily due to a decline in gross margin as well as increased operating expenses due to the opening of new stores and increased marketing; Japan the ratio increased 2.0 percentage points primarily due to the sales leveraging of operating expenses as well as an increase in gross margin; Europe the ratio decreased 4.1 percentage points primarily due to a decline in gross margin; and Other the operating loss is primarily attributable to spending for the development of the Emerging Markets region. Unallocated corporate expenses include costs related to administrative support functions which the Company does not allocate to its segments. Such unallocated costs include those for centralized information technology, finance, legal and human resources departments. Unallocated corporate expenses increased as a percentage of net sales in 2013 primarily due to increases in management incentive and stock-based compensation. Unallocated corporate expenses decreased as a percentage of sales in 2012. Other operating expenses in 2013 represent $480,211,000 of expenses associated with the adverse arbitration ruling between the Swatch Group Ltd. and the Company and $9,379,000 of expenses associated with specific cost-reduction initiatives. Other operating expenses of $42,719,000 in 2011 related to Tiffany's relocation of its New York headquarters staff to a single location. See "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note K - Commitments and Contingencies." Interest Expense and Financing Costs Interest expense and financing costs increased $3,585,000 , or 6% , in 2013 and $10,495,000, or 22%, in 2012, primarily due to increased interest expense related to increased borrowings. Other Income, Net Other income, net includes interest income, gains/losses on investment activities and foreign currency transactions. Other income, net increased $7,763,000 , or 143%, in 2013 , but the increase was only $274,000 when excluding foreign currency transaction gains related to the Arbitration award expense. See "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note K - Commitments and Contingencies" and "Non-GAAP Measures" for further information. Other income, net increased $329,000 in 2012. Provision for Income Taxes The effective income tax rate was 28.8% in 2013 compared with 35.3% in 2012 and 34.0% in 2011. Excluding the effects of certain expenses noted in "Non-GAAP Measures", the effective income tax rate would have been 34.8% in 2013. The tax rate for 2011 included a valuation allowance reversal against certain deferred tax assets where management had determined it was more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be realized in the future. TIFFANY & CO. K- 35 Table of Contents 2014 Outlook Management expects net earnings to be in a range of $4.05 $4.15 per diluted share. This is based on the following assumptions, which are approximate and may or may not prove valid, and which should be read in conjunction with "Item 1A. Risk Factors" on page K-13: Worldwide net sales increasing by a high-single-digit percentage in U.S. dollars and on a constant-exchange-rate basis, with all regions expected to achieve growth in their total sales and comparable store sales. Adding 13 Company-operated stores and closing four existing stores: opening four in the Americas, five in Asia-Pacific, two in Japan, and one each in Europe and Russia, while closing one each in the Americas, Asia-Pacific, Japan and the U.A.E. Earnings from operations as a percentage of net sales ("operating margin") increasing due to a higher gross margin and SG&A expense growth less than sales growth. Interest and other expenses, net of $65,000,000 to $70,000,000 with the increase over 2013 reflecting the interest cost on higher average levels of net-debt. An effective income tax rate of 35%. A 6% increase in net inventories. Capital expenditures increasing to $270,000,000, with the increase over 2013 largely reflecting incremental investments in certain information technology systems. Free cash flow of at least $400,000,000. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The Company's liquidity needs have been, and are expected to remain, primarily a function of its ongoing, seasonal and expansion-related working capital requirements and capital expenditure needs. Over the long term, the Company manages its cash and capital structure to maintain a strong financial position that provides flexibility to pursue strategic initiatives. Management regularly assesses its working capital needs, capital expenditure requirements, debt service, dividend payouts, share repurchases and future investments. Management believes that cash on hand, internally-generated cash flows, the funds available under its revolving credit facilities and the ability to access the debt and capital markets are sufficient to support the Company's liquidity and capital requirements for the foreseeable future. As of January 31, 2014 , the Company cash and cash equivalents totaled $345,778,000 , of which approximately one-half was held in locations outside the U.S. where the Company has the intention to indefinitely reinvest any undistributed earnings to support its continued expansion and investments outside of the U.S. Such cash balances are not available to fund U.S. cash requirements unless the Company were to decide to repatriate such funds. The Company has sufficient sources of cash in the U.S. to fund its U.S. operations without the need to repatriate any of those funds held outside the U.S. TIFFANY & CO. K- 36 Table of Contents The following table summarizes cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities: (in thousands) 2013 2012 2011 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 154,652 $ 328,290 $ 210,606 Investing activities (246,781 ) (331,146 ) (242,583 ) Financing activities (65,426 ) 71,446 (213,817 ) Effect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents (1,505 ) 2,294 (1,843 ) Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents $ (159,060 ) $ 70,884 $ (247,637 ) Operating Activities The Company had a net cash inflow from operating activities of $154,652,000 in 2013 , $328,290,000 in 2012 and $210,606,000 in 2011 . The change from 2012 to 2013 was impacted by the payment of the Arbitration Award (see "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note K - Commitments and Contingencies"), a decelerated rate of inventory growth and the timing of income tax payments. The increase from 2011 to 2012 primarily resulted from a decelerated rate of inventory growth offset by various other outflows. Working Capital. Working capital (current assets less current liabilities) and the corresponding current ratio (current assets divided by current liabilities) were $2,531,648,000 and 4.6 at January 31, 2014 , compared with $2,564,997,000 and 5.4 at January 31, 2013 . Accounts receivable, less allowances at January 31, 2014 were 9% higher than January 31, 2013 due to sales growth. When excluding the effect of foreign currency translation, primarily from the weaker Japanese yen, accounts receivable, less allowances would have been 14% higher than January 31, 2013. On a 12-month rolling basis, accounts receivable turnover was 22 times in 2013 and 21 times in 2012 . Inventories, net at January 31, 2014 were 4% higher than January 31, 2013 . Finished goods inventories rose 3% and combined raw material and work-in-process inventories increased 5% to support new store openings, expanded product assortments, rough diamond sourcing and internal manufacturing requirements. Net inventories rose 6% from January 31, 2013 when excluding the effect of foreign currency translation, primarily from the weaker Japanese yen. Prepaid expenses and other current assets at January 31, 2014 were 55% higher than January 31, 2013. The increase was largely due to income tax receivables primarily resulting from the impact and timing of the Arbitration Award on the Company's estimated income tax payments. Additionally, Other assets, net at January 31, 2014 were 10% higher than January 31, 2013 as certain income tax receivables are anticipated to be received after fiscal 2014. Investing Activities The Company had a net cash outflow from investing activities of $246,781,000 in 2013 , $331,146,000 in 2012 and $242,583,000 in 2011 . The increased outflow in 2012 was primarily due to payments of $82,664,000 to acquire intangible assets as well as a $25,000,000 payment related to an acquisition. Marketable Securities and Short-Term Investments. The Company invests a portion of its cash in marketable securities and short-term investments. The Company had net purchases of investments in marketable securities and short-term investments of $23,460,000 during 2013 and net proceeds received from the sale of marketable securities and short-term investments of $4,063,000 during 2012 and $55,139,000 during 2011. TIFFANY & CO. K- 37 Table of Contents Capital Expenditures. Capital expenditures are typically related to the opening, renovation and/or relocation of stores (which represented slightly more than half of capital expenditures in 2013 , 2012 and 2011 excluding the relocation in 2011 of Tiffany's New York headquarters staff), distribution and manufacturing facilities and ongoing investments in information technology. Capital expenditures were $221,452,000 in 2013 , $219,530,000 in 2012 and $239,443,000 in 2011 , representing 5%, 6% and 7% of net sales in those respective years. Notes Receivable Funded. The Company may, from time to time, extend loans to diamond mining and exploration companies in order to obtain rights to purchase the mine's output. The Company loaned $3,050,000 and $8,015,000 in 2013 and 2012 to various companies. In 2011, the Company loaned $56,605,000 to various companies of which $50,000,000 was provided to Koidu Limited (previously Koidu Holdings S.A.). See "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note K - Commitments and Contingencies." Proceeds from Notes Receivable Funded. In 2013, the Company received $1,181,000 of repayments associated with loans extended to diamond mining and exploration companies discussed in Notes Receivable Funded above. Payments to acquire intangible assets. In 2012, the Company made a $47,059,000 payment to retain an exclusive license for Peretti-designed jewelry and products. The Company also made a $35,605,000 payment to secure a prime retail location in Europe. See "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note B - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies." Payment for acquisition. In 2012, the Company made a $25,000,000 payment related to the acquisition of net assets associated with the five existing independently-operated TIFFANY & CO. stores located in the U.A.E. See "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note C - Acquisition." Financing Activities The Company had a net cash outflow from financing activities of $65,426,000 in 2013 compared with an inflow of $71,446,000 in 2012 and an outflow of $213,817,000 in 2011 . Year-over-year changes in cash flows from financing activities are largely driven by borrowings. Additionally, the Company did not repurchase any of its Common Stock in 2013. Recent Borrowings. The Company had net proceeds from short-term and long-term borrowings as follows: (in thousands) 2013 2012 2011 Short-term borrowings: Proceeds from credit facility borrowings, net $ 49,883 $ 47,278 $ 13,548 Proceeds from other credit facility borrowings 89,806 40,298 61,020 Repayment of other credit facility borrowings (69,737 ) (361 ) (4,517 ) Net proceeds from short-term borrowings 69,952 87,215 70,051 Long-term borrowings: Proceeds from issuance 250,000 Repayments (60,000 ) (58,915 ) Net proceeds from long-term borrowings 190,000 (58,915 ) Net proceeds from total borrowings $ 69,952 $ 277,215 $ 11,136 In July 2013, the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary, Tiffany & Co. (Shanghai) Commercial Company Limited ("Tiffany-Shanghai"), entered into a three-year multi-bank revolving credit agreement (the "Tiffany- TIFFANY & CO. K- 38 Table of Contents Shanghai Credit Agreement"). The Tiffany-Shanghai Credit Agreement has an aggregate borrowing limit of RMB 930,000,000 ( $153,457,000 at January 31, 2014 ). The Tiffany-Shanghai Credit Agreement is available for Tiffany-Shanghai's general working capital requirements, which included repayment of a portion of the indebtedness under Tiffany-Shanghai's existing bank loan facilities. The Tiffany-Shanghai Credit Agreement contains affirmative and negative covenants usual and customary for facilities of this size and purpose. The six lenders that are party to the Tiffany-Shanghai Credit Agreement will make loans, upon Tiffany-Shanghai's request, for periods of up to 12 months at the applicable interest rates as announced by the People's Bank of China. The Tiffany-Shanghai Credit Agreement matures in July 2016. In connection with this agreement, the Company entered into a guaranty agreement by and between the Company and the facility agent under the Tiffany-Shanghai Credit Agreement (the "Guaranty"). In December 2011, the Company entered into a three-year $200,000,000 and a five-year $200,000,000 multi-bank, multi-currency, committed unsecured revolving credit facility (the "Credit Facilities"). In July 2012, the commitments were each increased to $275,000,000, resulting in a total borrowing capacity of $550,000,000. The Credit Facilities are available for working capital and other corporate purposes. Under the Credit Facilities, borrowings may be made from 10 participating banks at interest rates based upon either (i) local currency borrowing rates or (ii) the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.5%, whichever is higher, plus a margin based on the Company's leverage ratio. Under all of the Company's credit facilities, there were $252,365,000 of borrowings, $3,952,000 letters of credit issued but not outstanding and $565,540,000 available for borrowing at January 31, 2014 . The weighted-average interest rate for the amount outstanding at January 31, 2014 was 3.37% compared with 3.05% at January 31, 2013. In 2012, the Company issued $250,000,000 of long-term debt at an interest rate of 4.40%. Proceeds were used to repay $60,000,000 of 10-year term, 6.56% Series D Senior Notes that came due in July 2012 and for general corporate purposes. The ratio of total debt (short-term borrowings, current portion of long-term debt and long-term debt) to stockholders' equity was 37% at both January 31, 2014 and 2013 . In January 2014, the Company entered into amendments to each of the Credit Facilities, each of the Unsecured Senior Notes agreements and the Guaranty which were required as a result of the issuance of the Arbitration Award. See "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note K - Commitments and Contingencies." These amendments: (i) provided that only half of the Arbitration Award amount would be included in the ratio used to determine the interest rate for borrowings and for the facility fee, in each case under the Credit Facilities; (ii) extended the time in which a judgment or decree may be paid, stayed on appeal, discharged, bonded or dismissed before an event of default would arise; (iii) amended certain financial definitions to exclude the impact of the Arbitration Award from the calculation of certain financial covenants; and (iv) waived certain defaults and events of default that had arisen in connection with the issuance of the Arbitration Award. At January 31, 2014 , the Company was in compliance with all debt covenants. Share Repurchases. In January 2011, the Company's Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program ("2011 Program") and terminated a previously-existing program. The 2011 Program authorized the Company to repurchase up to $400,000,000 of its Common Stock through open market or private transactions. The timing of repurchases and the actual number of shares to be repurchased depended on a variety of discretionary factors such as stock price, cash-flow forecasts and other market conditions. The Company suspended share repurchases during the second quarter of 2012 in order to allow for a more effective allocation of resources consistent with the Company's growth strategies. In January 2013, the Board of Directors extended the expiration date of the 2011 Program to January 31, 2014. The 2011 Program expired on January 31, 2014. TIFFANY & CO. K- 39 Table of Contents The Company's share repurchase activity was as follows: (in thousands, except per share amounts) 2013 2012 2011 Cost of repurchases $ $ 54,107 $ 174,118 Shares repurchased and retired 813 2,629 Average cost per share $ $ 66.54 $ 66.23 Dividends. The cash dividend on the Company's Common Stock was increased once in each of 2013, 2012 and 2011. The Company's Board of Directors declared quarterly dividends which totaled $1.34, $1.25 and $1.12 per common share in 2013 , 2012 and 2011 with cash dividends paid of $170,312,000 , $158,594,000 and $142,840,000 in those respective years. The dividend payout ratio (dividends as a percentage of net earnings) was 94%, 38% and 33% in 2013 , 2012 and 2011 . Dividends as a percentage of adjusted net earnings (see "Non-GAAP Measures") were 35% in 2013 and 31% in 2011. At least annually, the Company's Board of Directors reviews its policies with respect to dividends and share repurchases with a view to actual and projected earnings, cash flows and capital requirements. Proceeds from Non-controlling Interest. In 2012, the Company received proceeds of $12,750,000 associated with its venture with Damas Jewellery LLC that acquired the five existing independently-operated TIFFANY & CO. stores located in the U.A.E. as noted in Payment for acquisition above. See "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note C - Acquisition" for additional details on the venture. Contractual Cash Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following is a summary of the Company's contractual cash obligations at January 31, 2014 : (in thousands) Total 2014 2015-2016 2017-2018 Thereafter Unrecorded contractual obligations: Operating leases $ 1,407,072 $ 215,345 $ 343,189 $ 254,754 $ 593,784 Inventory purchase obligations a 421,183 421,183 Interest on debt b 456,697 51,704 92,829 53,396 258,768 Other contractual obligations c 81,929 61,793 9,828 3,008 7,300 Recorded contractual obligations: Short-term borrowings 252,365 252,365 Long-term debt 751,154 201,154 175,000 375,000 $ 3,370,400 $ 1,002,390 $ 647,000 $ 486,158 $ 1,234,852 a) The Company will, from time to time, secure supplies of diamonds by agreeing to purchase a defined portion of a mine's output. Inventory purchase obligations associated with these agreements have been estimated for 2014 and included in this table. Purchases beyond 2014 that are contingent upon mine production have been excluded as they cannot be reasonably estimated. b) Excludes interest payments on amounts outstanding under available lines of credit, as the outstanding amounts fluctuate based on the Company's working capital needs. c) Consists primarily of fixed royalty commitments, construction-in-progress and packaging supplies. TIFFANY & CO. K- 40 Table of Contents The summary above does not include the following items: Cash contributions to the Company's pension plan and cash payments for other postretirement obligations. The Company plans to contribute approximately $30,000,000 to the pension plan in 2014 . However, this expectation is subject to change if actual asset performance is different than the assumed long-term rate of return on pension plan assets. In addition, the Company estimates cash payments for postretirement health-care and life insurance benefit obligations to be $1,966,000 in 2014 . Unrecognized tax benefits at January 31, 2014 of $27,626,000 and accrued interest and penalties of $9,752,000. The final outcome of tax uncertainties is dependent upon various matters including tax examinations, interpretation of the applicable tax laws or expiration of statutes of limitations. The Company believes that its tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that it has adequately provided for these matters. However, the examinations may result in proposed assessments where the ultimate resolution may result in the Company owing additional taxes. Management anticipates that it is reasonably possible that the total gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits will decrease by approximately $20,000,000 in the next 12 months, a portion of which may affect the effective tax rate; however, management does not currently anticipate a significant effect on net earnings. Future developments may result in a change in this assessment. The following is a summary of the Company's outstanding borrowings and available capacity under its credit facilities at January 31, 2014 : (in thousands) Total Capacity Borrowings Outstanding Letters of Credit Issued Available Capacity Three-year revolving credit facility a $ 275,000 $ 41,159 $ $ 233,841 Five-year revolving credit facility b 275,000 78,053 3,952 192,995 Other credit facilities c 271,857 133,153 138,704 $ 821,857 $ 252,365 $ 3,952 $ 565,540 a Matures in December 2014. b Matures in December 2016. c Maturities range from 2014 through 2016. In addition, the Company has other available letters of credit and financial guarantees of $70,151,000 of which $26,534,000 was outstanding at January 31, 2014 . Of those available letters of credit and financial guarantees, $54,970,000 expires within one year. Seasonality As a jeweler and specialty retailer, the Company's business is seasonal in nature, with the fourth quarter typically representing approximately one-third of annual net sales and a higher percentage of annual net earnings. Management expects such seasonality to continue. Critical Accounting Estimates The Company's consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These principles require management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and related notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates and the differences could be material. Periodically, the Company reviews all significant estimates and assumptions affecting the financial statements and records any necessary adjustments. TIFFANY & CO. K- 41 Table of Contents The development and selection of critical accounting estimates and the related disclosures below have been reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Directors. The following critical accounting policies that rely on assumptions and estimates were used in the preparation of the Company's consolidated financial statements: Inventory. The Company writes down its inventory for discontinued and slow-moving products. This write-down is equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and its estimated market value, and is based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write-downs might be required. The Company has not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish its reserve for discontinued and slow-moving products during the past three years. At January 31, 2014 , a 10% change in the reserve for discontinued and slow-moving products would have resulted in a change of $6,411,000 in inventory and cost of sales. Property, plant and equipment and intangibles assets and key money . The Company reviews its property, plant and equipment and intangibles assets and key money for impairment when management determines that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable due to events or changes in circumstances. Recoverability of these assets is evaluated by comparing the carrying value of the asset with estimated future undiscounted cash flows. If the comparisons indicate that the value of the asset is not recoverable, an impairment loss is calculated as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the asset and the loss is recognized during that period. The Company did not record any material impairment charges in 2013 , 2012 or 2011 . Goodwill . The Company performs its annual impairment evaluation of goodwill during the fourth quarter of its fiscal year or when circumstances otherwise indicate an evaluation should be performed. A qualitative assessment is first performed for each reporting unit to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If it is concluded that this is the case, an evaluation, based upon discounted cash flows, is performed and requires management to estimate future cash flows, growth rates and economic and market conditions. The 2013 , 2012 and 2011 evaluations resulted in no impairment charges. Notes receivables and other financing arrangements. The Company may, from time to time, provide financing to diamond mining and exploration companies in order to obtain rights to purchase the mine's output. Management evaluates these financing arrangements for potential impairment by reviewing the parties' financial statements and projections and business, operational and other economic factors on a periodic basis. If the analyses indicate that the financing receivable is not recoverable, an impairment loss is recognized, in respect to all or a portion of the financing, during that period. The Company did not record any material impairment charges in 2013 , 2012 or 2011 . Income taxes . The Company is subject to income taxes in both the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. The calculation of the Company's tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across the Company's global operations. Significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax expense. The Company's income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for uncertain tax positions reflect management's best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid. Foreign and domestic tax authorities periodically audit the Company's income tax returns. These audits often examine and test the factual and legal basis for positions the Company has taken in its tax filings with respect to its tax liabilities, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions ("tax filing positions"). Management believes that its tax filing positions are reasonable and legally supportable. However, in specific cases, various tax authorities may take a contrary position. In evaluating the exposures associated with the Company's various tax filing TIFFANY & CO. K- 42 Table of Contents positions, management records reserves using a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold for income tax positions taken or expected to be taken. Earnings could be affected to the extent the Company prevails in matters for which reserves have been established or is required to pay amounts in excess of established reserves. In evaluating the Company's ability to recover its deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise, management considers all available evidence. The Company records valuation allowances when management determines it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized in the future. Employee benefit plans . The Company maintains several pension and retirement plans, as well as provides certain postretirement health-care and life insurance benefits for retired employees. The Company makes certain assumptions that affect the underlying estimates related to pension and other postretirement costs. Significant changes in interest rates, the market value of securities and projected health-care costs would require the Company to revise key assumptions and could result in a higher or lower charge to earnings. The Company used discount rates of 4.50% to determine its 2013 pension expense for all U.S. plans and 4.50% to determine its 2013 postretirement expense. Holding all other assumptions constant, a 0.5% increase in the discount rate would have decreased 2013 pension and postretirement expenses by $5,678,000 and $527,000. A decrease of 0.5% in the discount rate would have increased the 2013 pension and postretirement expenses by $6,307,000 and $770,000. The discount rate is subject to change each year, consistent with changes in the yield on applicable high-quality, long-term corporate bonds. Management selects a discount rate at which pension and postretirement benefits could be effectively settled based on (i) an analysis of expected benefit payments attributable to current employment service and (ii) appropriate yields related to such cash flows. The Company used an expected long-term rate of return of 7.50% to determine its 2013 pension expense. Holding all other assumptions constant, a 0.5% change in the long-term rate of return would have changed the 2013 pension expense by $1,483,000. The expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets is selected by taking into account the average rate of return expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for the benefits included in the projected benefit obligation. More specifically, consideration is given to the expected rates of return (including reinvestment asset return rates) based upon the plan's current asset mix, investment strategy and the historical performance of plan assets. For postretirement benefit measurement purposes, 7.00% (for pre-age 65 retirees) and 6.25% (for post-age 65 retirees) annual rates of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care were assumed for 2014 . The rates were assumed to decrease gradually to 4.75% by 2020 and remain at that level thereafter. A one-percentage-point change in the assumed health-care cost trend rate would not have a significant effect on the aggregate service and interest cost components of the 2013 postretirement expense. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS See "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note B - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies." OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS The Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements. TIFFANY & CO. K- 43 Table of Contents
