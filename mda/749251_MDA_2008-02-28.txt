OVERVIEW Gartner, Inc. is a leading research and advisory firm that helps executives use technology to build, guide and grow their enterprises. We offer independent and objective research and analysis on the information technology, computer hardware, software, communications and related technology industries. We provide comprehensive coverage of the IT industry to approximately 10,000 client organizations, including approximately 400 Fortune 500 companies, across 75 countries. Our client base consists primarily of CIOs and other senior IT and business executives from a wide variety of enterprises, government agencies and the investment community. We employ a diversified business model that utilizes and leverages the breadth and depth of our research intellectual capital while enabling us to maintain and grow our market-leading position and brand franchise. The foundation for our business model is our ability to create and distribute our unique, proprietary research content as broadly as possible via: published reports and briefings, consulting and advisory services, and hosting symposia, conferences and exhibitions. In early 2005, we undertook an initiative to better utilize the intellectual capital associated with our core research product. Our diversified business model provides multiple entry points and synergies that facilitate increased client spending on our research, consulting and events. A critical part of our long-term strategy is to increase business volume with our most valuable clients, identifying relationships with the greatest sales potential and expanding those relationships by offering strategically relevant research and analysis. We also seek to extend the Gartner brand name to develop new client relationships, and augment our sales capacity and expand into new markets around the world. In addition, we seek to increase our revenue and operating cash flow through more effective pricing of our products and services. These initiatives have created additional revenue streams through more effective packaging, campaigning and cross-selling of our products and services. We intend to maintain a balance between (1) pursuing opportunities and applying resources with a strict focus on growing our three core businesses and (2) generating profitability through a streamlined cost structure. We have three business segments: Research, Consulting and Events. Research provides insight for CIOs, IT professionals, technology companies and the investment community through reports and briefings, access to our analysts, as well as peer networking services and membership programs designed specifically for CIOs and other senior executives. Consulting consists primarily of consulting, measurement engagements and strategic advisory services (paid one-day analyst engagements) ( SAS ), which provide assessments of cost, performance, efficiency and quality focused on the IT industry. Events consists of various symposia, conferences and exhibitions focused on the IT industry. We believe the following business measurements are important performance indicators for our business segments: BUSINESS SEGMENT BUSINESS MEASUREMENTS Research Contract value represents the value attributable to all of our subscription-related research products that recognize revenue on a ratable basis. Contract value is calculated as the annualized value of all subscription research contracts in effect at a specific point in time, without regard to the duration of the contract. Client retention rate represents a measure of client satisfaction and renewed business relationships at a specific point in time. Client retention is calculated on a percentage basis by dividing our current clients, who were also clients a year ago, by all clients from a year ago. Wallet retention rate represents a measure of the amount of contract value we have retained with clients over 13 Table of Contents BUSINESS SEGMENT BUSINESS MEASUREMENTS a twelve-month period. Wallet retention is calculated on a percentage basis by dividing the contract value of clients, who were clients one year earlier, by the total contract value from a year earlier. When wallet retention exceeds client retention, it is an indication of retention of higher-spending clients, or increased spending by retained clients, or both. Number of executive program members represents the number of paid participants in executive programs. Consulting Consulting backlog represents future revenue to be derived from in-process consulting, measurement and strategic advisory services engagements. Utilization rates represent a measure of productivity of our consultants. Utilization rates are calculated for billable headcount on a percentage basis by dividing total hours billed by total hours available to bill. Billing Rate represents earned billable revenue divided by total billable hours. Average annualized revenue per billable headcount represents a measure of the revenue generating ability of an average billable consultant and is calculated periodically by multiplying the average billing rate per hour times the utilization percentage times the billable hours available for one year. Events Number of events represents the total number of hosted events completed during the period. Number of attendees represents the number of people who attend events. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL POSITION During 2007 we continued to execute on the strategy we launched in 2005 to accelerate the growth of our Research business while at the same time maintaining the growth and profitability of our Consulting and Events businesses. The cornerstones of this strategy are to produce extraordinary research content, deliver innovative and highly differentiated product offerings, enhance our sales capability, provide world class client service and improve operational effectiveness. The success of this strategy is evident in our 2007 financial results, which includes total revenue growth of 12%, earnings per share growth of 36% and cash flow from operations growth of 40%. We had net income of $73.6 million in 2007, or $0.68 per diluted share, compared to $0.50 per diluted share for the prior year. The $0.68 per diluted share for 2007 includes a net charge of $(0.04) recorded in the second quarter of 2007 for certain non-operating and other items. We generated $148.3 million of operating cash flow in 2007, and we ended the year with $109.9 million in cash. In our Research business we executed on our strategy of accelerating growth by introducing new and innovative product offerings and expanding our sales force. Revenue was up 18% in 2007, with growth occurring across our entire product portfolio and geographic regions. Our sales force of 806 associates is up approximately 22% over the prior year end. Research contract value was $752.5 million at December 31, 2007, up 18% from the prior year end, and was up 14% excluding the impact of foreign currency. Contract value increased at least 18% in each of the four quarters of 2007 on a year-over-year basis, reflecting the successful execution of our strategy to accelerate the growth of our Research business. Both our Research client retention rate and wallet retention rate remained strong at 82% and 101%, respectively. In our Consulting business we continue to focus on achieving maximum profitability by targeting the most profitable accounts and geographies. Revenue from our Consulting business was up 6% in 2007, to $325.0 million, despite lower headcount. Consulting backlog at December 31, 2007 was $121.4 million, up 11% from the $109.6 at December 31, 2006. The consultant utilization rate increased 5 points in 2007, to 69% from 64% in the prior year, reflecting improved engagement management and reduced headcount. The hourly billing rate remained above $350 per hour while the average annualized revenue per billable headcount was up approximately 5% from the prior year. Billable headcount was 472 at December 31, 2007, down about 10% year-over-year, primarily due to the exit from our Asian consulting operations. Our Events business strategy is to continue to focus on managing the Events portfolio by retaining successful events that are content driven and introducing promising new events that will yield greater profitability, while eliminating less profitable and less attended events. Events revenue for 2007 was up 7%, with 78 events held in the year as compared to 74 in the prior year, with attendance up about 8%. In furtherance of our Events strategy, on February 20, 2008 we announced that we had contracted to sell our Vision Events portfolio of events (See Note 15 Subsequent Events in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements). For a more detailed discussion of our segment results, see Segment Results below. We also continued our focus on enhancing shareholder value through the continued evolution of our capital structure. During 2007 we repurchased 8.4 million shares of our common stock, bringing the total number of shares repurchased since January 1, 2005 to 24.1 million shares. In January 2007 we closed on a new credit facility which increased our total debt capacity to $480.0 million. FLUCTUATIONS IN QUARTERLY OPERATING RESULTS Our quarterly and annual revenue, operating income, and cash flow fluctuate as a result of many factors, including: the timing of our SymposiumITxpo series that normally occurs during the fourth calendar quarter, and other events; the amount of new business generated; the mix of domestic and international business; changes in market demand for our products and services; changes in foreign currency rates; 14 Table of Contents the timing of the development, introduction and marketing of new products and services; competition in the industry; and other factors. The potential fluctuations in our operating income could cause period-to-period comparisons of operating results not to be meaningful and could provide an unreliable indication of future operating results. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements requires the application of appropriate accounting policies. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Management considers the policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our financial statements because their application requires complex and subjective judgments and estimates. Specific risks for these critical accounting policies are described below. Revenue recognition We recognize revenue in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements ( SAB 101 ), and SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104, Revenue Recognition ( SAB 104 ). Revenue by significant source is accounted for as follows: Research revenues are derived from subscription contracts for research products. Revenues from research products are deferred and recognized ratably over the applicable contract term; Consulting revenues are generated from fixed fee and time and material engagements. Revenue from fixed fee contracts is recognized on a percentage of completion basis. Revenues from time and materials engagements is recognized as work is delivered and/or services are provided; Events revenues are deferred and recognized upon the completion of the related symposium, conference or exhibition; Other revenues consist primarily of fees from research reprints which are recognized when the reprint is shipped. The majority of research contracts are billable upon signing, absent special terms granted on a limited basis from time to time. All research contracts are non-cancelable and non-refundable, except for government contracts that have a 30-day cancellation clause, but have not produced material cancellations to date. It is our policy to record the entire amount of the contract that is billable as a fee receivable at the time the contract is signed with a corresponding amount as deferred revenue, since the contract represents a legally enforceable claim. For those government contracts that permit termination, we bill the client the full amount billable under the contract but only record a receivable equal to the earned portion of the contract. In addition, we only record deferred revenue on these government contracts when cash is received. Deferred revenues attributable to government contracts were $57.6 million and $47.9 million at December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006, respectively. In addition, at December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006, we had not recognized uncollected receivables or deferred revenues relating to government contracts that permit termination, of $10.8 million and $9.6 million, respectively. Uncollectible fees receivable The allowance for losses is composed of a bad debt and a sales and allowance reserve. Provisions are charged against earnings. The measurement of likely and probable losses and the allowance for uncollectible fees receivable is based on historical loss experience, aging of outstanding receivables, an assessment of current economic conditions and the financial health of specific clients. This evaluation is inherently judgmental and requires material estimates. These valuation reserves are periodically re-evaluated and adjusted as more information about the ultimate collectibility of fees receivable becomes available. Circumstances that could cause our valuation reserves to increase include changes in our clients liquidity and credit quality, other factors negatively impacting our clients ability to pay their obligations as they come due, and the effectiveness of our collection efforts. The following table provides our total fees receivable, along with the related allowance for losses (in thousands): December 31, 2007 2006 Total fees receivable $ 363,376 $ 337,083 Allowance for losses (8,450 ) (8,700 ) Fees receivable, net $ 354,926 $ 328,383 Impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets The evaluation of goodwill is performed in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets ( SFAS No. 142 ). Among other requirements, this standard eliminated goodwill amortization upon adoption and requires ongoing annual assessments of goodwill impairment. The evaluation of other intangible assets is performed on a periodic basis. These assessments require management to estimate the fair values of our reporting units based on estimates of future business operations and market and economic conditions in developing long-term forecasts. If we determine that the fair value of any reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we must recognize an impairment charge for the associated goodwill of that reporting unit against earnings in our financial statements. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment at least annually, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors we consider important that could trigger a review for impairment include the following: Significant under-performance relative to historical or projected future operating results; Significant changes in the manner of our use of acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business; Significant negative industry or economic trends; Significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period; and Our market capitalization relative to net book value. 15 Table of Contents Due to the numerous variables associated with our judgments and assumptions relating to the valuation of the reporting units and the effects of changes in circumstances affecting these valuations, both the precision and reliability of the resulting estimates are subject to uncertainty, and as additional information becomes known, we may change our estimates. Accounting for income taxes As we prepare our consolidated financial statements, we estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions where we operate. This process involves estimating our current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our consolidated balance sheets. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets when future realization is in question. We consider the availability of loss carryforwards, existing deferred tax liabilities, future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance. In the event we determine that we are able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount, an adjustment is made to the deferred tax asset to increase income in the period such determination is made. Likewise, if we determine that we will not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset is charged against income in the period such determination is made. Accounting for stock-based compensation On January 1, 2006, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards 123(R), Share-Based Payment ( SFAS No. 123(R) ), as interpreted by SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107 ( SAB No. 107 ). Effective with the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), the Company is recognizing stock-based compensation expense, which is based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant, over the related service period, net of estimated forfeitures (See Note 9 Stock-Based Compensation in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stock compensation awards requires the input of certain highly complex and subjective assumptions, including the expected life of the stock compensation awards and the Company common stock price volatility. In addition, determining the appropriate amount of associated periodic expense requires management to estimate the rate of employee forfeitures and the likelihood of achievement of certain performance targets. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock compensation awards and the associated periodic expense represent management best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of judgment. As a result, if factors change and the Company deems it necessary in the future to modify the assumptions it made or to use different assumptions, or if the quantity and nature of the Company stock-based compensation awards changes, then the amount of expense may need to be adjusted and future stock compensation expense could be materially different from what has been recorded in the current period. Contingencies and other loss reserves and accruals We record accruals for severance costs, lease costs associated with excess facilities, contract terminations and asset impairments as a result of actions we undertake to streamline our organization, reposition certain businesses and reduce ongoing costs. Estimates of costs to be incurred to complete these actions, such as future lease payments, sublease income, the fair value of assets, and severance and related benefits, are based on assumptions at the time the actions are initiated. To the extent actual costs differ from those estimates, reserve levels may need to be adjusted. In addition, these actions may be revised due to changes in business conditions that we did not foresee at the time such plans were approved. Additionally, we record accruals for estimated incentive compensation costs during each year. Amounts accrued at the end of each reporting period are based on our estimates and may require adjustment as the ultimate amount paid for these incentives are sometimes not known until after year end. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 2007 VERSUS 2006 REVENUES increased $128.9 million, or 12%, to $1,189.2 million in 2007 from $1,060.3 million during 2006. Excluding the favorable effects of foreign currency translation, total revenues for 2007 would have increased 9% over 2006. Research revenues increased 18% in 2007 to $673.3 million, compared to $571.2 million in 2006, and comprised approximately 57% and 54% of total revenues in 2007 and 2006, respectively. Consulting revenues in 2007 of $325.0 million were up 6% compared to $305.2 million in 2006, and comprised approximately 27% and 29% of total revenues in 2007 and 2006, respectively. Events revenues were $180.8 million in 2007, an increase of 7% from $169.4 million in 2006, and comprised approximately 15% and 16% of total revenues in 2007 and 2006, respectively. Other revenues, consisting principally of research reprint revenues, declined to $10.0 million in 2007 from $14.4 million in 2006. Please refer to the section of this MD&A entitled Segment Results for a further discussion of revenues by segment. Revenues increased in all regions. Revenues from sales to United States and Canadian clients increased 8%, to $681.9 million in 2007 from $631.3 million in 2006. Revenues from sales to clients in Europe, the Middle East and Africa ( EMEA ) increased to $403.9 million in 2007 from $337.7 million in 2006, a 20% increase. Revenues from sales to clients in the Other International region increased 13%, to $103.3 million in 2007 from $91.3 million in 2006. 16 Table of Contents COST OF SERVICES AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT increased $39.9 million, or 8%, when comparing 2007 with 2006, to $545.3 million from $505.3 million, respectively. Excluding the unfavorable effects of foreign currency translation, Cost of services and product development would have increased 4%. The $39.9 million increase was primarily due to the impact of foreign currency, which added about $17.0 million of additional expense, $18.2 million of merit salary, bonus, and fringe increases, $6.4 million of higher event fulfillment costs driven by higher events revenue, and additional stock-based compensation costs under SFAS No. 123(R) of about $2.5 million. These increases were offset to some extent by lower non-sales headcount and other charges. For the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, Cost of services and product development as a percentage of revenue was 46% and 48%, respectively. SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE (SG&A) expense increased $59.2 million, or 14% to $475.3 million from $416.1 million when comparing 2007 to 2006. Excluding the unfavorable effects of foreign currency translation, SG&A expense would have increased by 12% year-over-year. The $59.2 million increase in SG&A year-over-year resulted primarily from increased investment in our sales organization, with expenses up approximately $30.0 million, foreign currency translation, which added about $20.1 million of expense, and additional stock-based compensation under SFAS No. 123(R) of $5.4 million. We now have 806 sales associates, a 22% increase over the prior year-end. While SG&A expense increased 14% year-over-year, when sales-related expenses are excluded General and Administrative (G&A) expense was actually down about one percentage point year-over-year as a percentage of revenue. DEPRECIATION expense for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $24.3 million compared to $23.4 million in 2006, driven by higher capital expenditures. We had $24.2 million and $21.1 million of capital expenditures in 2007 and 2006, respectively, and for 2008 the Company projects capital expenditures of approximately $25.0 million to $27.0 million. AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLES was $2.1 million in 2007 compared to $10.7 million in 2006. The decrease was due to certain intangibles acquired in the META acquisition becoming fully amortized in 2006. META INTEGRATION CHARGES was zero in 2007 and $1.5 million in 2006. These expenses were primarily for severance, and for consulting, accounting, and tax services. OTHER CHARGES was $9.1 million and zero in 2007 and 2006, respectively. The $9.1 million charge in 2007 includes an $8.7 million charge for the Expert Choice litigation settlement and $2.7 million of restructuring costs related to the Company exit from consulting operations in Asia. Offsetting these charges was a credit of $2.3 million related to an excess facility which the Company returned to service. INTEREST EXPENSE, NET was $22.2 million and $16.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The increase in our interest expense was due to a higher weighted-average amount of debt outstanding in 2007. The increased interest expense from additional debt outstanding was partially offset by a slight decline in rates and higher interest income. OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET was $3.2 million and $(0.8) million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. 2007 includes a gain from the settlement of a claim for $1.8 million, while the majority of the Other income (expense), net balances in both years consists of net foreign currency exchange gains and losses. PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES was $40.6 million for 2007 as compared to $27.7 million in 2006. The effective tax rate for 2007 was 35.6% as compared to 32.2% for 2006. The higher effective tax rate in 2007 as compared to 2006 is attributable to several items. The most significant of these items includes the following: (a) the Company generated a smaller percentage of its income in low tax jurisdictions in 2007 as compared to 2006, and (b) differences relating to the release of valuation allowances and changes in reserves. 2006 VERSUS 2005 REVENUES increased 7% or $71.3 million, to $1,060.3 million during 2006 from $989.0 million during 2005. Research revenues increased 9% in 2006 to $571.2 million, compared to $523.0 million in 2005, and comprised approximately 54% and 53% of total revenues in 2006 and 2005, respectively. Consulting revenues in 2006 of $305.2 million were up 1% compared to the $301.1 in 2005, and comprised approximately 29% and 30% of total revenues in 2006 and 2005, respectively. Events revenues were $169.4 million in 2006, an increase of 12% from the $151.3 million in 2005, and comprised approximately 16% and 15% of total revenues in 2006 and 2005, respectively. Other revenues, consisting principally of research reprint revenues, increased 6%, to $14.4 million in 2006 from $13.6 million in 2005. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, total revenues for 2006 would have increased slightly less than 7%. See the Segment Results section below for a further discussion of segment revenues. Gartner acquired META on April 1, 2005, and as a result Gartner 17 Table of Contents first quarter of 2005 operating results did not contain META. Because META had been completely integrated into Gartner, we could not approximate the impact on our 2006 results from the acquisition. REVENUES increased in all regions. Revenues from sales to United States and Canadian clients increased 3% to $631.3 million in 2006 from $611.0 million in 2005. Revenues from sales to clients in Europe, the Middle East and Africa ( EMEA ) increased 14% to $337.7 million in 2006 from $296.7 million in 2005. Revenues from sales to clients in Other international regions increased 12%, to $91.3 million in 2006 from $81.3 million in 2005. COST OF SERVICES AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT expense increased $18.7 million, or 4%, to $505.3 million in 2006 from $486.6 million in 2005. Excluding the effects of foreign currency translation, Cost of services and product development expense would have increased 3% for the year ended December 31, 2006. The 4% year-over-year increase in Cost of services and product development expense was primarily due to charges of $8.0 million for stock-based compensation under SFAS No. 123(R), approximately $6.0 million of incremental delivery costs associated with continued growth in our Events business, the inclusion of a full year of salary and benefit expense for former META employees in 2006 compared to nine months in 2005, and higher compensation costs related to merit salary increases. The Company adopted SFAS No. 123(R) on January 1, 2006 under the modified prospective transition method, so the prior year excludes such charges. In addition to these expense increases, Cost of services and product development expense for 2005 benefited from the reversal of $2.1 million of prior year bonus accruals. For 2006 and 2005, Cost of services and product development expense as a percentage of sales was 48% and 49%, respectively. SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE ( SG&A ) expenses increased 5%, or $18.8 million, to $416.1 million in 2006 from $397.3 million in 2005. Excluding the effects of foreign currency translation, SG&A expense would have increased by 4% year-over-year. The 5% increase in SG&A expense on a year-to-date basis resulted primarily from increased investment in our sales organization. We now have 663 sales associates, a 21% increase over the prior year, which added approximately $18.0 million of costs. Also contributing to the increase were charges of $8.7 million for stock-based compensation under SFAS No. 123(R), and increased recruiting and relocation expenses. Offsetting these increases were reductions in a number of G&A expense categories, to include consulting, travel, facilities, and fulfillment. In addition, SG&A expense in 2005 benefited from the reversal of $0.8 million of prior year bonus accruals. DEPRECIATION expense for 2006 decreased 8%, to $23.4 million, compared to $25.5 million for 2005. The reduction is due to a decline in capital spending in both the current and prior periods, reflecting our focus on disciplined capital spending on projects that support our strategic initiatives. AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLES was $10.7 million for 2006 and $10.2 million in 2005. Of the $25.6 million of intangibles we recorded related to META, both the intellectual property and database intangibles are now fully amortized, with $5.0 million in customer relationship intangibles remaining to be amortized. META INTEGRATION CHARGES were $1.5 million and $15.0 million for 2006 and 2005, respectively. These expenses were primarily for severance, and for consulting, accounting, and tax services, related to our integration of META. The Company will not record any additional META integration charges in 2007 or later. OTHER CHARGES were zero in 2006 and $29.1 million in 2005. The 2005 charges consisted of $10.6 million of employee severance costs, $8.2 million of charges mostly related to excess office space, $6.0 million related to an option buyback, and $4.3 million primarily for restructuring in our international operations. LOSS ON INVESTMENTS, NET was zero and $5.8 million for 2006 and 2005, respectively. The 2005 loss was primarily due to the writedown of an investment in a venture capital fund to its net realizable value. The investment was sold in late 2005 at book value. INTEREST EXPENSE, NET was $16.6 million and $11.1 million for 2006 and 2005, respectively, a $5.5 million increase. The increase was primarily related to an increase in rates and an increase in the amount of debt outstanding, and to a lesser extent higher amortization and writeoff of debt issue costs. The weighted-average interest rate on our debt was 6.3% in 2006 compared to 4.9% in the prior year. In addition, the weighted-average debt outstanding was about $5.0 million higher in 2006 compared to 2005. OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET for both 2006 and 2005 consists primarily of net foreign currency exchange gains and losses. PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES was $27.7 million for 2006 compared to $7.9 million for 2005. The effective tax rate was 32.2% and 144.8% for 2006 and 2005, respectively. The lower effective tax rate in 2006 as compared to 2005 is attributable to several items. The most significant of those items include the following: (a) the Company generated a larger percentage of its income in low tax jurisdictions in 2006 as compared to 2005, and (b) 2006 included a significant decrease in valuation allowances for state and local net operating losses while 2005 included a significant increase in valuation allowances for foreign tax credits. The impact of these items is partially offset by: (a) benefits taken to reduce overall tax expense in 2005 relating to repatriated earnings, no such items occurred in 2006, (b) larger benefits taken in 2005 as compared to 2006 for foreign tax credits generated, and (c) an overall increase in reserve needs in 2006 as compared to an overall 18 Table of Contents decrease in 2005. Note that the impact of the various positive and negative adjustments is amplified by lower pretax book income in 2005 as compared to 2006. In March 2005, we repatriated approximately $52.0 million in cash from our non-US subsidiaries. Also in 2005, we took into account technical corrections issued by the Treasury Department related to repatriating earnings under the American Jobs Creation Act (AJCA). As a result of favorable provisions in the technical corrections, we realized a tax benefit of $3.6 million in 2005 that reduced the cumulative charge on the repatriated earnings to $1.4 million. In addition, as a consequence of the application of the technical corrections, we re-evaluated our ability to use foreign tax credits in the future and took a charge of $2.5 million to re-establish valuation allowance for foreign tax credits that will more likely than not expire unused. Upon filing our 2005 income tax return in 2006, the Company determined that it would be more beneficial not to avail itself of the provision of the AJCA with respect to the taxation of the repatriation. Therefore, the repatriation was taxed as an ordinary dividend under existing tax law. Excluding the impact of SFAS No. 123(R), amortization of certain intangibles acquired as part of the META acquisition and various META integration charges, the effective tax rate was 32.4% for 2006. Excluding the impact of the amortization of certain intangibles acquired as part of the META acquisition, various META integration charges and certain one-time charges for facility closures and capital asset impairments, the effective tax rate was 36.6% for 2005, respectively. The lower effective tax rate in 2006 as compared to 2005 is attributable to several items. The most significant of those items include the following: (a) the Company generated more income in low tax jurisdictions in 2006 as compared to 2005, and (b) 2006 included a significant decrease in valuation allowances for state and local net operating losses while 2005 included a significant increase in valuation allowances for foreign tax credits. The impact of these items is partially offset by (a) benefits taken to reduce overall tax expense in 2005 relating to repatriated earnings, no such items occurred in 2006, (b) larger benefits taken in 2005 as compared to 2006 for foreign tax credits generated, and (c) an overall increase in reserve needs in 2006 as compared to an overall decrease in 2005. The impact of the various positive and negative adjustments was amplified by lower pretax book income in 2005 as compared to 2006. 2007 SEGMENT RESULTS We evaluate reportable segment performance and allocate resources based on gross contribution margin. Gross contribution is defined as operating income excluding certain Cost of services and product development charges, and Selling, general and administrative expenses, depreciation, META integration charges, amortization of intangibles and Other charges. Gross contribution margin is defined as gross contribution as a percentage of revenues. Research Revenue in our Research business increased $102.1 million or 18% in 2007, to $673.3 million compared to $571.2 million for 2006. We had year-over-year growth across our entire product portfolio and in all of our geographic regions. Excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency, revenue was up about 15% over the prior year. Research gross contribution increased to $429.1 million in 2007, from $345.5 million in 2006, a 24% increase, while the contribution margin increased 4 points, to 64% from 60%. The contribution margin improved primarily due to better operating leverage from our stronger revenue performance. Contract value was $752.5 million at December 31, 2007, up 18% from $640.3 million at December 31, 2006. The year-over-year increase was driven by increases in both core research and Executive Programs, and reflects the great success of our new role-based product offerings. We had contract value growth across all of our major geographic regions and client industry segments. Adjusted for the favorable impact of foreign currency translation, contract value was up about 14% year-over-year. At December 31, 2007, our research client retention rate remained strong at 82%, up from 81% at December 31, 2006. Wallet retention was 101% at December 31, 2007, up from 96% at December 31, 2006, reflecting higher spending at retained clients. Our Executive Program membership was 3,753 at December 31, 2007, which is up about 3% over the prior year-end. Consulting Consulting revenues were $325.0 million in 2007, compared to $305.2 million in 2006, an increase of 6%, or $19.8 million, despite a decline in billable headcount. Excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency translation, revenues were up 3% year-over-year. The increased revenue was driven by substantial improvement in our contract optimization business as well as higher utilization and billing rates in our core consulting business. Our contract optimization business was weak in the fourth quarter of 2006 due to changes in sales incentives, which we have since rectified. Billable headcount was 472 at December 31, 2007 compared to 518 at December 31, 2006, a 9% decrease. The reduced billable headcount primarily reflects our decision to exit our consulting business in Asia. Consulting gross contribution of $128.2 million in 2007 increased 6% from $120.7 million in 2006, while contribution margin decreased 1 point, to 39% in 2007 from 40% in the prior year. The decrease in gross contribution margin year-over-year was driven by lower SAS revenue performance and additional investment in senior level consultants. The consultant utilization rate was 69% and 64% for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The billing rate remained above $350 per hour for both 2007 and 2006. Our average annualized revenue per billable headcount was up about 5%, to approximately 19 Table of Contents $430,000 in 2007 from $410,000 in 2006. Consulting backlog, which represents future revenues to be recognized from in-process consulting, measurement and SAS, increased 11%, to $121.4 million at December 31, 2007 from $109.6 million at December 31, 2006. Events Events revenues for 2007 increased 7%, or $11.4 million, to $180.8 million compared to $169.4 million in 2006. Adjusted for the favorable impact of foreign exchange, revenues were up about 3%. We held 78 events held in 2007 and 74 in 2006. The increased revenue was primarily due to the addition of 10 new events in 2007 and an increase in both attendee volume and ticket prices. Attendance at events was 44,216 in 2007, an 8% increase over 2006. For 2008, we are currently projecting that we will hold 82 events. Gross contribution was $88.2 million in 2007 compared to $83.7 million in 2006, a 5% increase, while gross contribution margin was 49% for both periods. On February 20, 2008 we announced that we had contracted to sell our Vision Events portfolio of events (See Note 15 Subsequent Events in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements). 2006 SEGMENT RESULTS We evaluate reportable segment performance and allocate resources based on gross contribution margin. Gross contribution is defined as operating income excluding certain Cost of services and product development charges and SG&A expense, depreciation, META integration charges, amortization of intangibles and Other charges. Gross contribution margin is defined as gross contribution as a percentage of revenues. Research We had strong revenue performance in our Research business in 2006, with revenue up 9%, to $571.2 million, from $523.0 in 2005. Foreign currency had an immaterial impact on revenue for the year. The revenue growth for the year was across all of our regions and client sectors, as well as across the entire client portfolio. Both client and wallet retention rates remained strong. At December 31, 2006, our research client retention rate was 81%, the same rate as of December 31, 2005. Wallet retention was up 3 points from the prior year, to 96% at December 31, 2006, from 93% at December 31, 2005. Our Executive Program membership was 3,646 at December 31, 2006, compared to 3,522 at the prior year end. Research gross contribution of $345.5 million for 2006 increased 11% from the $310.0 million in 2005, while gross contribution margin increased 1 point in 2006 to 60%, from 59% in the prior year. The improvement in the contribution margin was mainly due to operating leverage resulting from the strong revenue performance. SFAS No. 123(R) decreased gross contribution margin in the Research segment by about 1 point in 2006. Contract value at December 31, 2006 was the highest in the company history, at $640.3 million, up 8% over the prior year value of $592.6 million. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, contract value increased by approximately 11%. Contract value has now increased for 12 consecutive quarters. The increase was driven by growth in both core research and Executive Programs. Consulting Consulting revenues increased 1%, to $305.2 million in 2006 as compared to $301.1 million in 2005. With a strong emphasis on growing the Research segment, coupled with a decline in revenues in the contract optimization portion of the Consulting business change due to a change in sales incentives, growth slowed in the second half of 2006. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, revenues were up slightly less than 1%. The year-over-year revenue increase reflects increases in annualized revenue per billable headcount, billing rate, and consultant utilization. Billable headcount was 518 at December 31, 2006, compared to 525 for the prior year, a decline of 1%. Consultant utilization rates were 64% and 62% for 2006 and 2005, respectively. The billing rate remained at over $300 per hour in 2006, while the average annualized revenue per billable headcount was about $410,000. Consulting gross contribution of $120.7 million for 2006 decreased 4% from the $125.7 million in 2005, while the contribution margin for 2006 decreased to 40%, from 42% in the prior year. The margin decline was primarily due to costs related to SFAS No. 123(R), costs related to exiting less profitable geographies, and investments made in senior level hires related to our growth strategy. The impact of SFAS No. 123(R), which we adopted on January 1, 2006, decreased gross contribution margin in the Consulting segment for 2006 by approximately half a point. Consulting backlog, which represents future revenues to be recognized from in-process consulting, measurement and SAS, was $109.6 million at December 31, 2006, compared to $107.7 million at September 30, 2006 and $119.9 million at December 31, 2005. Events Events revenues in 2006 were up 12%, or $18.1 million, to $169.4 million from $151.3 million in the prior year. We held 74 events in 2006 with over 41,000 attendees compared to 70 events in 2005 with over 35,000 attendees. The increase in revenue was due to new 20 Table of Contents events as well as strong performance from our on-going events. We had 11 new events in 2006 which had higher revenues than the events that were eliminated, while revenue from existing events was up 7%, reflecting underlying strength in our on-going Summit events. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, Events revenues were up approximately 11% in 2006. Events gross contribution was $83.7 million, or 49% of revenues, for 2006, compared to $76.1 million, or 50% of revenues, for 2005. The decrease in gross contribution margin was primarily due to the mix of new events and existing events. SFAS No. 123(R) had an immaterial impact on the Events gross contribution margin for 2006. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 2007 Cash provided by operating activities totaled $148.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to cash provided of $106.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $42.1 million, or 40%. The increase in cash flow from operating activities was primarily due to an increase in cash from our core operations of approximately $39.0 million, lower cash payments for taxes of about $21.0 million, and to a lesser extent, lower cash payments for severance and other items of $5.0 million. Offsetting these improvements was a payment of $9.5 million related to a legal settlement and higher cash payments for interest on our outstanding debt of about $8.0 million, and a higher reduction from excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation of $5.6 million. Cash used in investing activities was $24.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $21.8 million in 2006. The increase was due to a year-over-year increase in capital expenditures, which increased to $24.2 million in 2007 from $21.1 million in 2006. Cash used in financing activities increased slightly, to $93.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $91.5 million in 2006. On a net basis, we borrowed an additional $24.0 million in 2007 compared to $123.0 million of additional borrowings in 2006, a decrease of $99.0 million year-over-year. We decreased our use of cash to repurchase shares by $103.9 million, as we repurchased $166.8 million of our common stock in 2007 compared to $270.7 million in 2006. We received proceeds from stock issued under stock plans of $34.5 million in 2007, compared to $46.7 million in 2006, a decrease of $12.2 million. Excess tax benefits from stock compensation increased approximately $5.6 million, to $14.8 million in 2007 compared to $9.2 million in 2006. At December 31, 2007, cash and cash equivalents totaled $109.9 million. The effect of exchange rates increased cash and cash equivalents by about $11.6 million during 2007. 2006 Cash provided by operating activities totaled $106.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to $27.1 million in 2005. The increase in cash flow from operating activities of $79.2 million was primarily due to an increase in cash from core operations of approximately $50.0 million. The improved cash flow also reflects lower cash payments for severance and other charges of about $21.0 million, as well as a decrease of $28.0 million of payments related to the integration of META. These improvements were somewhat offset by higher cash payments for bonus, and to a lesser extent, interest and other items. Cash used in investing activities was $21.8 million for 2006, compared to $181.0 million in 2005. The decrease in cash used was primarily due to the net expenditure of $161.3 million for the acquisition of META in 2005. Capital expenditures of $21.1 million was down about $1.2 million from the prior year period, reflecting the Company continued focus on disciplined capital spending. Cash used by financing activities totaled $91.5 million in 2006, compared to $70.0 million of cash provided in the year ended December 31, 2005. The decline in cash provided was due to the repurchase of $270.7 million of our common shares in 2006, which includes $200.0 million repurchased directly from Silver Lake in December 2006, for which we borrowed an additional $190.0 million and utilized $10.0 million of existing cash. During 2005 we had $9.6 million of common share repurchases. We borrowed additional amounts in both 2006 and 2005, and our outstanding debt increased by about $123.0 million in 2006 compared to an increase of approximately $56.0 million in the prior year. We realized about $15.7 million more in cash from stock issued under stock plans during 2006, with $46.7 million of proceeds in 2006 compared to $31.0 million during the prior year period. The increase was a result of our higher stock price during 2006 as compared to 2005, which resulted in more stock option exercises by employees in 2006. We also had $9.2 million in excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation awards under SFAS No. 123(R). OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS The Company has a borrowing arrangement that provides for a five-year, $180.0 million term loan and a $300.0 million revolving credit facility. The revolving credit facility may be increased up to an additional $100.0 million at our lenders discretion (the expansion feature ), for a total revolving credit facility of $400.0 million. However, the $100.0 million expansion feature may or may not be available to us depending upon prevailing credit market conditions. 21 Table of Contents The term loan will be repaid in 18 consecutive quarterly installments which commenced on September 30, 2007, plus a final payment due on January 31, 2012, and may be prepaid at any time without penalty or premium at our option. The revolving credit facility may be used for loans, and up to $15.0 million may be used for letters of credit. The revolving loans may be borrowed, repaid and reborrowed until January 31, 2012, at which time all amounts borrowed must be repaid. At December 31, 2007, the Company had $174.0 million outstanding under the term loan and $220.0 million outstanding under the revolver. As of December 31, 2007, the Company had approximately $77.0 million of available borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility, not including the expansion feature. We believe that our existing cash balances, together with cash from our operating activities and the borrowing capacity we have under our five-year revolving credit facility, will be sufficient for our expected short-term and foreseeable long-term needs. The following table represents our contractual cash commitments (in thousands) due after December 31, 2007: Less Than 1 - 3 4 - 5 More Than Total 1 Year Years Years 5 Years Operating leases (1) $ 187,950 $ 35,450 $ 56,900 $ 28,950 $ 66,650 Debt (2), (3) 394,000 16,500 81,000 296,500 Deferred compensation arrangement (4) 21,900 1,900 4,150 4,200 11,650 FASB Interpretation No. 48 liability (5) 403 403 Treasury stock repurchases (6) 2,300 2,300 Other 6,536 5,701 835 Totals $ 613,089 $ 62,254 $ 142,885 $ 329,650 $ 78,300 (1) The Company leases various facilities, furniture, and computer equipment expiring between 2008 and 2025.

The statement applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. The Company does not believe the adoption of SFAS No. 157 will have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115 ( SFAS No. 159 ). SFAS No. 159 permits entities to choose to measure certain financial instruments and certain other items at fair value at specified election dates. If the fair value option is elected, a business entity shall report unrealized gains and losses on elected items in earnings at each subsequent reporting date. Upon initial adoption of this Statement an entity is permitted to elect the fair value option for available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities previously accounted for under SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities . The effect of reclassifying those securities into the trading category should be included in a cumulative-effect adjustment of retained earnings and not in current-period earnings and should be separately disclosed. SFAS No. 159 is effective as of the beginning of the first fiscal year that begins after November 15, 2007. The Company does not believe the adoption of SFAS No. 159 will have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations ( SFAS No. 141R ), which replaces FASB Statement No. 141. SFAS No. 141R establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, any non controlling interest in the acquiree, and the goodwill acquired in a business combination. The Statement also establishes disclosure requirements which will enable users to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination. SFAS No. 141R is effective as of the beginning of an entity fiscal year that begins after December 15, 2008, which will be the Company fiscal year beginning January 1, 2009. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact, if any, the adoption of SFAS No. 141R will have on the Company financial position or results of operations. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statement amendments of ARB No. 51 ( SFAS No. 160 ). SFAS No. 160 requires the accounting and reporting of minority interests as noncontrolling interests and classified as a component of equity. The statement also establishes reporting requirements that provide sufficient disclosures that clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent and the interests of the noncontrolling owners. SFAS No. 160 applies to all entities that prepare consolidated financial statements, except not-for-profit organizations, but will affect only those entities that have an outstanding noncontrolling interest in one or more subsidiaries or that deconsolidate a subsidiary. The statement is effective as of the beginning of an entity first fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2008, which will be the Company fiscal year beginning January 1, 2009. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact, if any, the adoption of SFAS No. 160 will have on the Company financial position or results of operations. The SEC Staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin ( SAB ) 110 which permits companies, under certain circumstances, to continue to use the simplified method when calculating the expected term of plain vanilla share options. Originally, the use of simplified method was due to expire on December 31, 2007. A company may use the simplified method if it concludes that it is not reasonable to base its estimate of expected term on its experience with exercising historical share options. Although there is no expiration date for SAB 110, the SEC Staff believes that more detailed external information about exercise behavior will, over time, become readily available. The effective date for SAB 110 is January 1, 2008. The Company expects that it will continue to use the simplified method for awards of stock-based compensation after January 1, 2008.
