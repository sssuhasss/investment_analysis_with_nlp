ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) NiSource Inc. Other Operations (continued) Environmental Matters Currently, various environmental matters impact the Other Operations segment. As of December 31, 2006, a reserve has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions. Refer to Note 18-F, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding environmental matters for the Other Operations segment. Net Revenues For the year ended 2006, net operating revenues were $36.2 million, a decrease of $5.9 million from 2005. The decrease was mainly due to decreased revenues from the operation of the Whiting Clean Energy facility partially offset by increased commercial and industrial gas marketing revenues of $2.1 million. For the year ended 2005, net operating revenues were $42.1 million, an increase of $22.5 million from 2004. The increase was primarily due to increased net revenues from Whiting Clean Energy and $7.4 million of increased revenues from commercial and industrial marketing customers. Operating Loss The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $40.2 million in 2006, an increased loss of $27.9 million from the 2005 period, due to increased losses associated with Whiting Clean Energy, including contract termination costs with BP of $17.0 million incurred in the fourth quarter of 2006, and increased scheduled maintenance costs of $7.2 million for Whiting Clean Energy, partially offset by a reduction in uncollectible accounts of $4.0 million and $2.1 million of increased revenues from commercial and industrial gas marketing. The Other Operations segment reported an operating loss of $12.3 million in 2005 compared to an operating loss of $30.5 million in the 2004 period. This improvement is the result of decreased losses associated with Whiting Clean Energy and $7.4 million of increased revenues from commercial and industrial gas marketing. 55 Table of Contents
