ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD&A") is intended to help the reader understand our results of operations and financial condition for the three years ended December 31, 2014 . The MD&A should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed elsewhere in this Form 10-K, particularly in Item 1A. "Risk Factors" and in the "Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" preceding Part I of this Form 10-K. Throughout this MD&A, we refer to measures used by management to evaluate performance, including a number of financial measures that are not defined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). These include organic revenue, organic revenue growth, free cash flow and adjusted working capital. Organic revenue and organic growth refer to revenue and revenue growth excluding the impacts of foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestitures. Free cash flow is operating cash flow less capital spending, while adjusted working capital refers to accounts receivable, plus inventory, less accounts payable. We believe these measures provide investors with important information that is useful in understanding our business results and trends. Reconciliations within this MD&A provide more details on the use and derivation of these measures. The MD&A is organized as follows: Overview and Outlook Consolidated Results of Operations Segment Results of Operations Financial Condition Cash Flow Summary and Liquidity and Capital Resources Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates and Recent Accounting Standards Special Notes Regarding Non-GAAP Disclosures OVERVIEW AND OUTLOOK Dover is a diversified global manufacturer delivering innovative equipment and components, specialty systems and support services through four major operating segments: Energy, Engineered Systems, Fluids, and Refrigeration & Food Equipment. On February 28, 2014, the Company completed the separation of Knowles from Dover through the pro rata distribution of 100% of the common stock of Knowles to Dover's stockholders of record as of the close of business on February 19, 2014. The distribution was structured to be tax-free to Dover and its shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In the first quarter of 2014, Dover announced the realignment of its businesses into a new segment structure, consisting of four segments and organized around its key end markets to better focus on growth strategies. The new structure is designed also to provide increased opportunities to leverage Dover's scale and capitalize on productivity initiatives. In connection with management's evaluation of Dover's businesses for their strategic fit within Dover's operations, the Company announced in the fourth quarter of 2014 its intention to divest Datamax O'Neil and Sargent Aerospace, two businesses within the Engineered Systems segment. Accordingly, these businesses were reclassified to discontinued operations. The Company has reached a definitive agreement to sell Datamax O'Neil. Also excluded from continuing operations are the results of operations of DEK International and Everett Charles Technologies (including the Multitest business, collectively "ECT"), until their respective dates of sale of third quarter 2014 and fourth quarter 2013, respectively. The Company completed the sale of DEK International in the third quarter of 2014 for total proceeds of $170.6 million, which resulted in an after-tax loss on sale of $6.9 million. In addition, the Company recognized a gain on sale of $3.2 million in 2014 in connection with a working capital adjustment of $4.5 million for ECT. The results presented herein represent continuing operations, excluding the results of these businesses, as well as the results of Knowles prior to the spin-off. 23 Table of Contents Full year 2014 consolidated revenue from continuing operations was $7.8 billion, an increase of $597.6 million, as compared to prior year reflecting an increase in organic revenue of 4.4%, a 4.4% increase in acquisition-related revenue and a negligible impact due to foreign currency translation. Increases across all four segments were led by strong results in our Engineered Systems, Fluids and Energy segments. Our Engineered Systems segment achieved solid growth across both platforms, resulting in overall revenue growth of 9.5% as compared to the prior year. Within the Printing & Identification platform of Engineered Systems, our recent acquisition MS Printing performed well as did our core printing and coding businesses. In addition, the Industrials platform achieved broad-based growth led by our auto-related and waste handling businesses. Our Fluids segment performed well with revenue growth of 15.7% as compared to the prior year, as continuing robust market conditions for Fluid Transfer products and solid Pumps markets resulted in strong organic growth, supplemented by acquisition-related growth. In our Energy segment, revenue growth of nearly 9.0% largely driven by recent acquisitions, solid U.S. Drilling & Production customer activity, as well as generally healthy Bearings & Compression markets. Our Refrigeration & Food Equipment segment generated revenue growth of 1.8%, with solid performance in our Refrigeration end market, partially offset by the impact of product mix within our Food Equipment end market. Gross profit increased $195.7 million, or 7.0%, to $3.0 billion, reflecting the benefit of increased sales volumes mainly due to broad-based order and shipment activity. This growth was partially offset by higher restructuring charges in the current year, as well as higher labor costs. For further discussion related to our consolidated and segment results, see "Consolidated Results of Operations" and "Segment Results of Operations," respectively, within Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Bookings increased 7.8% over the prior year to $7.8 billion, representing year-over-year growth across our Energy, Engineered Systems and Fluids segments of 8.8%, 11.4% and 13.7%, respectively. This growth was partially offset by a 1.0% decrease for our Refrigeration & Food Equipment segment. Overall, the book-to-bill of 1.00 slightly decreased as compared to the prior year. Backlog of $1.2 billion remained relatively flat as compared to prior year. From a geographic perspective for the year, our North American, European and Asian markets were all solid, whereas Latin America was weak. We anticipate our North American growth will moderate, specifically for our Energy segment, due to the recent decline in global oil markets; however, we expect North America to remain a solid market for our other three segments. We acquired a total of seven businesses in 2014 for total net consideration of $802.3 million. These businesses were acquired to complement and expand upon existing operations within our Energy, Fluids and Refrigeration & Food Equipment segments and the Printing & Identification platform of the Engineered Systems segment. Included in these acquisitions was the October 1, 2014 acquisition of Accelerated Companies LLC ("Accelerated"), a supplier of artificial lift and fluid handling solutions to oil and gas production markets. The business is now part of Dover Artificial Lift, a business unit within Dover's Energy segment. The total purchase price for this acquisition, net of cash acquired and including final working capital adjustments, was approximately $435.7 million, which was funded with commercial paper. In addition to the aforementioned acquisitions, we completed previously announced actions to adjust our costs and further streamline our businesses. These actions resulted in full year 2014 restructuring charges of $44.8 million, of which $37.4 million was incurred in the fourth quarter of 2014. We expect to incur restructuring charges of approximately $17.0 million to $20.0 million in the first quarter of 2015, with approximately $12.0 million to $15.0 million of these charges within our Energy segment. The 2015 cost savings expected to be realized as a result of the restructuring programs initiated in late 2014 and early 2015 is expected to be within the range of $70.0 million to $75.0 million. In light of the economic uncertainty, particularly for the Energy end markets, it is possible that additional programs may be implemented throughout the remainder of 2015 . During the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company purchased a total of approximately 7.5 million shares of its common stock in the open market at a total cost of $601.1 million, or approximately $80.50 per share. Included in this total are 3.6 million shares repurchased to complete the November 2012 $1.0 billion stock repurchase program. The remaining 3.9 million of share repurchases in 2014 were made pursuant to the share repurchase program approved in May 2012. As of December 31, 2014, the approximate number of shares still available for repurchase under the May 2012 share repurchase authorization was 0.1 million. This authorization was canceled and replaced in January 2015 with a new standing share repurchase authorization approved by the Board of Directors, whereby the Company may repurchase up to 15 million shares of its common stock over the following three years. In addition, we continued our history of increasing our annual dividend payments to shareholders by paying $258.5 million in dividends in 2014. 24 Table of Contents Looking forward to 2015, we expect the following: Within our Energy segment, lower revenue in our U.S.-based Drilling & Production businesses, however, we continue to expect our international oil and gas activity and our Bearings & Compression businesses to grow; Within our Engineered Systems segment, continued growth driven by strong dynamics in our Industrials platform and global growth in Printing & Identification; The continuation of solid global markets in our Fluids segment driven by increased regulatory activity, a positive retail fueling environment and new product introductions; Within our Refrigeration & Food Equipment segment, growth supported by our focus on customer service and best-in-class products; and Continued share repurchases under the new standing authorization approved in January 2015. Our 2015 guidance anticipates the combined impact of lower oil prices, discontinued operations, share repurchase activity and the impact of foreign currency translation. We expect total revenue growth of 1% to (2%), primarily reflecting our outlook for Energy. Within our total revenue forecast, organic growth is anticipated to be approximately 1% to (2%), completed acquisitions will provide approximately 2% growth, and the impact of foreign currency translation is expected to have a negative impact of 2%. In total, we expect full year adjusted EPS to be in the range of $4.70 to $4.95. If global or domestic economic conditions accelerate or deteriorate, our operating results for 2015 could be materially different than currently projected. 25 Table of Contents CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS As discussed in Note 4 Disposed and Discontinued Operations to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K, in the fourth quarter of 2014, we reclassified certain businesses in the Engineered Systems segment to discontinued operations based on our decision to divest these businesses. The results of operations of these businesses have been removed from the results of continuing operations and are presented within results of discontinued operations for all periods presented.

All four segments grew solidly year-over-year. Acquisition growth of 4.4% was largely driven by our Energy segment and included recent acquisitions such as Accelerated and WellMark. Our 2013 consolidated revenue increased 8.0% to $7.2 billion compared with 2012 , reflecting organic growth of 2.1%, growth from acquisitions of 5.9% and a negligible impact from currency translation. All four of our segments generated 2013 organic revenue growth, with the majority attributed to volume increases driven by strength in Energy, Refrigeration and Food Equipment, and many of the other industrial markets served by our Engineered Systems segment. Gross Profit Our gross profit increased $ 195.7 million , or 7.0% , in 2014 compared with 2013 , reflecting the benefit of increased sales volumes. Gross profit margin declined 40 basis points due to the impact of higher restructuring costs of $14.4 million , higher acquisition-related depreciation and amortization of $15.4 million, and higher one-time labor costs as we completed the transition to new production sites. 26 Table of Contents Our gross profit increased $198.6 million or 7.7% in 2013 compared with 2012 , reflecting the benefit of increased sales volumes, favorable net material costs, and benefits from productivity initiatives. The benefit from these factors were partly offset with higher depreciation and amortization expense of $15.7 million. Gross profit margin was consistent year over year, with the operating leverage achieved by the higher volumes being offset by the impact of normal pricing concessions, business mix and higher labor costs. Selling and Administrative Expenses Selling and administrative expenses increased $ 141.8 million , or 8.8% , in 2014 compared with 2013 primarily due to general increases across the segments in support of higher volumes. The current year expense included higher restructuring costs of $21.3 million to align our businesses with anticipated market conditions and $15.0 million additional depreciation and amortization expense relating primarily to the recent acquisitions of Finder Pompe, Wellmark, and Accelerated. As a percentage of revenue, selling and administrative expenses increased 10 basis points in 2014 to 22.7% . Results for 2014 include a $3.6 million one-time settlement charge for lump-sum payments made to participants in our U.S. defined benefit pension plan. Selling and administrative expenses for the 2013 period also include certain one-time gains of $6.8 million associated with the sale of land in Switzerland and pension curtailment gain of $4.4 million recognized in connection with the freeze of future service benefits for the U.S. benefit plans. Adjusting for these one-time items, selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue improved 20 basis points in 2014 relative to 2013 a result of leverage from higher revenue levels, which more than offset higher acquisition-related depreciation and amortization and increased restructuring charges. Higher selling and administrative expenses in 2013 relative to 2012 reflect general increases across the segments in support of higher volumes. As a percentage of revenue, selling and administrative expenses decreased to 22.6% in 2013 compared with 23.0% in 2012 . This 40 basis point improvement is the a result of leverage from the higher revenue levels which offset higher acquisition-related depreciation and amortization charges of $11.6 million. Approximately 20 basis points of this improvement is attributable to the $11.2 million of one-time items recognized in 2013 as discussed above. Non-Operating Items Interest expense, net, increased $6.5 million , or 5.4% , to $127.2 million in 2014 primarily due to higher interest expense related to the euro-denominated debt issued in the fourth quarter of 2013. In 2013 , our interest expense, net, decreased 0.5% to $120.7 million due primarily to lower interest rates on commercial paper borrowings for the period. Other expense (income), net in 2014 , 2013 , and 2012 includes $2.1 million, $5.6 million, and $9.2 million, respectively, of net foreign exchange losses resulting from the re-measurement and settlement of foreign currency denominated balances. These foreign exchange losses were more than offset by other nonrecurring items including insurance settlements for property damage of $5.1 million and $7.4 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively. Other income for 2014 also included $1.7 million for earnings on minority investments during the year. Other expense, net in 2012 also included royalty income and other miscellaneous non-operating gains and losses, none of which are individually significant. Income Taxes We operate globally, and 27.8%, 31.7%, and 31.2% of our pre-tax earnings in 2014 , 2013 , and 2012 , respectively, were generated in foreign jurisdictions. Foreign earnings are generally subject to local country tax rates that are well below the 35.0% U.S. statutory rate. We also benefit from tax holidays and incentives in a number of the foreign jurisdictions. As a result, our effective non-U.S. tax rate is typically significantly lower than the U.S. statutory rate. The 2014 effective tax rate on continuing operations was 28.9% compared to the 2013 rate of 23.8%. The 2014 rate was impacted by $11.3 million of favorable net discrete items, principally related to settlements of uncertain tax matters. The 2013 effective tax rate was impacted by other favorable net discrete items totaling $75.5 million, principally related to the conclusion of certain U.S. federal, state and international tax audits, a favorable court opinion, certain cross-border tax consequences and the effect of the American Tax Relief Act of 2012 signed into law on January 2, 2013. After adjusting for discrete items, the effective tax rates were 29.9% for 2014 and 31.0% for 2013 . We believe it is reasonably possible during the next twelve months that uncertain tax positions may be settled, which could result in a decrease in the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits. This decrease may result in an income tax benefit. Due to the 27 Table of Contents potential for resolution of federal, state, and foreign examinations, and the expiration of various statutes of limitation, our gross unrecognized tax benefits balance may change within the next twelve months by a range of zero to $27.0 million. Some portion of such change may be reported as discontinued operations. We believe adequate provision has been made for all income tax uncertainties. The 2012 effective tax rate on continuing operations was 30.2%. The effective tax rate in 2012 was favorably impacted by net discrete and other items totaling $17.8 million, arising principally from settlements with the U.S. federal and state taxing authorities. After adjusting for discrete and other items, the effective tax rate for 2012 was 32.1%. Earnings from Continuing Operations Earnings from continuing operations decreased 2.4% to $778.1 million , or $4.61 diluted earnings per share ("EPS") in 2014 , compared with earnings from continuing operations of $797.5 million , or $4.60 EPS, in 2013 . Excluding the impact of discrete tax benefits of $11.3 million , or $0.07 EPS, in 2014 and $75.5 million , or $0.43 EPS, in 2013 , earnings from continuing operations increased 6.2% . The increase in these adjusted earnings for 2014 is primarily due to higher revenues and benefits from productivity and cost containment initiatives, offset by higher restructuring and acquisition-related expenses. Excluding the impact of discrete tax items, EPS increased 9.1% in 2014, reflecting the impact of higher earnings and lower weighted average shares outstanding relative to 2013 due to over seven million shares repurchased during the year. Earnings from continuing operations increased 22.7% to $797.5 million , or $4.60 EPS in 2013 , compared with earnings from continuing operations of $650.1 million , or $3.53 EPS, in 2012 . Excluding the impact of discrete tax benefits of $75.5 million , in 2013 and $17.8 million, or $0.10 EPS, in 2012, earnings from continuing operations increased 14.2%. The increase in 2013 adjusted earnings is primarily the result of higher revenues, offset in part by higher labor costs across all segments, as well as higher acquisition-related expenses, including depreciation and amortization. Excluding the impact of discrete tax items, EPS increased 21.2% in 2013, which reflects the increase in earnings, as well as the impact of six million share buybacks during the period. Discontinued Operations The results of discontinued operations reflect the results of Datamax O'Neil and Sargent Aerospace, which were reclassified to discontinued operations in the fourth quarter of 2014. These results also include Knowles prior to the distribution on February 28, 2014 and the results of DEK and ECT prior to their respective sale dates of July 2, 2014 and November 30, 2013. The results of discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2014 totaled a net loss of $2.9 million . This amount includes a loss on the sale of DEK of $6.9 million and a gain of $3.2 million in connection with a working capital adjustment for ECT, which was sold in the prior year. Also reflected within the net loss from discontinued operations is $32.3 million of after-tax earnings for those businesses classified as discontinued operations, $27.1 million of spin-off costs and a pension settlement charge of $4.4 million , net of tax, attributable to lump sum payments made to Knowles participants in Dover's qualified defined benefit pension plan. Earnings from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2013 totaled net earnings of $205.6 million , which primarily reflects after-tax earnings of the five businesses classified as discontinued operations as well as discrete tax benefits of $54.8 million, $30.1 million of spin-off costs, and $18.3 million of interest on tax obligations in foreign jurisdictions. Also reflected in discontinued operations is a net loss on the sale of ECT, including impairments, of $21.5 million and $14.0 million of impairment relating to DEK. Earnings from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2012 totaled net earnings of $161.0 million , which primarily reflects after-tax earnings of the five businesses classified as discontinued operations as well as various expense and accrual adjustments relating to other discontinued operations. This activity was offset by a goodwill impairment charge recognized in connection with the anticipated sale of ECT of $51.9 million , net of tax. Refer to Note 4 Disposed and Discontinued Operations in the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information on disposed and discontinued operations. 28 Table of Contents Restructuring Activities 2014 Restructuring Activities The Company incurred $44.8 million of restructuring charges during 2014 including the programs described below. The Energy segment incurred restructuring charges of $7.5 million, related principally to a facility consolidation in its businesses serving the compression markets and a reduction in workforce. The Engineered Systems segment recorded $6.6 million of restructuring charges relating to facility consolidations within both the Printing & Identification and Industrials platforms, as well as actions taken to optimize costs related to engineering, sales, and administrative functions within the Printing & Identification platform. The Fluids segment recorded $3.8 million of restructuring charges principally related to reduction in workforce for those businesses serving the Pumps markets. The Refrigeration & Food Equipment segment recorded restructuring charges of $24.9 million, primarily related to headcount reductions and exit plans at targeted facilities, including approximately $17.5 million related to the closure of a European-based facility within Refrigeration. Corporate recorded restructuring charges of approximately $2.0 million, primarily severance expense, resulting from the Company's decision to realign its businesses into a new segment structure in the first quarter of 2014 following the spin-off of Knowles. Of the restructuring charges above, $37.4 million was incurred in Q4 2014 principally due to streamlining business across the organization. We expect to incur restructuring charges of approximately $17.0 million to $20.0 million in the first quarter of 2015, with the majority of these charges in the Energy segment. We anticipate that much of the benefit of the 2014 and 2015 programs will be realized over the remainder of 2015 and into 2016. We also expect to fund the remainder of the 2014 programs currently underway, as well those commenced in 2015 , over the next 12 to 18 months. In light of the economic uncertainty in certain of our end markets and our continued focus on improving our operating efficiency, it is possible that additional programs may be implemented throughout the remainder of 2015 . 2013 Restructuring Activities During 2013, we initiated restructuring actions relating to ongoing cost reduction efforts, including targeted facility consolidations and headcount reductions at certain businesses. As a result, in 2013, we incurred restructuring charges totaling $9.1 million related to these programs, as follows: The Engineered Systems segment incurred restructuring charges of $3.6 million, mainly relating to facility consolidations and other headcount reduction programs undertaken to optimize its cost structure. The Fluids segment incurred restructuring charges of $0.9 million, principally relating to rationalization of global headcount to better align its footprint with present market conditions. The Refrigeration & Food Equipment segment incurred restructuring charges of $5.5 million, primarily relating to a facility consolidation and related headcount reductions within its operations to better reflect the current market dynamics. Restructuring initiatives in 2012 were limited to a few targeted facility consolidations. We incurred restructuring charges of $13.9 million relating to such activities. See Note 9 Restructuring Activities in the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional details regarding our recent restructuring activities. 29 Table of Contents SEGMENT RESULTS OF OPERATIONS This summary that follows provides a discussion of the results of operations of each of our four reportable operating segments (Energy, Engineered Systems, Fluids, and Refrigeration & Food Equipment). Each of these segments is comprised of various product and service offerings that serve multiple end markets. See Note 17 Segment Information in the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for a reconciliation of segment revenue, earnings, and operating margin to our consolidated revenue, earnings from continuing operations, and operating margin. Segment EBITDA and segment EBITDA margin, which are presented in the segment discussion that follows, are non-GAAP measures and do not purport to be alternatives to operating income as a measure of operating performance. We believe that these measures are useful to investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating ongoing operating profitability as they exclude the depreciation and amortization expense related primarily to capital expenditures and acquisitions that occurred in prior years, as well as in evaluating operating performance in relation to our competitors. For further information, see the Non-GAAP Disclosures at the end of this Item 7. Energy Our Energy segment, serving the Drilling & Production, Automation, and Bearings & Compression end markets, is a provider of customer driven solutions and services for safe and efficient production and processing of oil, natural gas liquids, and gas worldwide, and has a strong presence in the bearings and compression components markets.

Drilling & Production revenue (representing 72.4% of 2014 segment revenue) increased $81.3 million, or 5.9%. Growth was driven by strong U.S. drilling and artificial lift activity and the impact of acquisitions, particularly Accelerated 30 Table of Contents Companies LLC, purchased in October 2014. This growth was partially offset by expected lower project-related shipments in Australia and lower demand for winches in the military and infrastructure markets. Bearings & Compression revenue (representing 17.2% of 2014 segment revenue) increased $5.8 million, or 1.7%. This growth resulted from increased demand in our Compression end market, partially offset by softness in our Bearings end market due to slower OEM build rates. Automation revenue (representing 10.4% of 2014 segment revenue) increased $76.2 million, or 56.9%, primarily resulting from growth relating to the 2014 acquisitions of Wellmark Holdings, Inc. and Timberline Manufacturing as well as the full year impact of the 2013 acquisition of SPIRIT. Growth in 2014 was also driven by strong drilling activity and increased sensor replacement in the downhole pressure transducers business. Energy earnings in 2014 increased $2.2 million compared to 2013, or 0.5%, primarily due to higher Drilling and Automation revenue partially offset by higher acquisition-related depreciation and amortization of approximately $22.0 million, as well as higher restructuring costs of $8.4 million. The operating margin decrease of 190 basis points was also partially impacted by unfavorable material pricing in the artificial lift businesses. Bookings for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased 8.8% compared to 2013, primarily due to broad-based growth across our product lines. Backlog at December 31, 2014 increase 12.8% compared to the prior year, mainly due to large projects booked in our Bearings end market. 2013 Versus 2012 Revenue generated by our Energy segment increased $65.6 million, or 3.7%, compared with 2012. The increase was driven primarily by acquisition growth of 3.4% and organic growth of 0.3%. There was a negligible impact from foreign currency translation. Drilling & Production revenue (representing 74.4% of 2013 segment revenue) increased by $62.6 million, or 4.8%, driven by a large artificial lift project in Australia and market share gains and international growth in Drilling end markets, partially offset by softer demand for winch products in the energy and recovery markets. Bearings & Compression revenue (representing 18.4% of 2013 segment revenue) increased by $4.5 million, or 1.3%, reflecting a small increase in Bearing end market shipments, partially offset by slightly lower Compression product sales. Automation revenue (representing 7.2% of 2013 segment revenue) decreased by $1.6 million, or 1.2%, driven by prior year customer upgrade programs in our downhole pressure transducers business that did not repeat. Energy's earnings decreased $7.2 million, or 1.5%, primarily resulting from lower yields and higher costs of new drilling products, lower sales of winch products and investments in compression product expansion. Operating margin decreased 130 basis points compared to the prior year due to the lower yields and higher costs of new drilling products, unfavorable product mix in artificial lift products and investments in compression product expansion. 31 Table of Contents Engineered Systems Our Engineered Systems segment is comprised of two platforms, Industrials and Printing & Identification, and is focused on the design, manufacture and service of critical equipment and components serving the vehicle service, environmental solutions, industrial, and printing and identification markets. As discussed previously, Datamax O'Neil, a business previously within the the Printing & Identification platform, and Sargent Aerospace, previously within the Industrials platform, were reclassified to discontinued operations in the fourth quarter of 2014. The discussion that follows addresses continuing operations of the segment.

Revenue derived from the Industrials platform (representing 58.6% of 2014 segment revenue) increased $97.0 million, or 7.5% , as compared to the prior year comprising organic growth of 7.1% resulting from broad-based growth led by our auto-related and waste equipment businesses. Acquisition-related revenue increased 0.2%, while foreign currency translation had a favorable impact of 0.1%. 32 Table of Contents Revenue of our Printing & Identification platform (representing 41.4% of 2014 segment revenue) increased $111.0 million, or 12.6% including organic growth of 4.8% and 9.7% acquisition-based growth, partially offset by a 1.9% unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation. Broad-based global growth in both our fast moving consumer goods and industrial markets, especially in the U.S., drove organic revenue growth. Acquisition growth was primarily driven by MS Printing Solutions, acquired in February 2014, contributing revenue growth of approximately 8.0% as compared to 2013. Engineered Systems segment earnings in 2014 increased $39.5 million, or 11.4% compared with 2013 , as a result of increased volume and productivity improvements and recent acquisitions. Operating margin increased 20 basis points compared to 2013 , as productivity savings were partially offset by higher acquisition-related costs, including $6.5 million of depreciation and amortization, as well as higher restructuring costs of $3.0 million. Bookings for our Industrials platform reflected broad-based growth, resulting in an increase of 10.3%. Our Printing & Identification platform's bookings increased 12.9%, due to the impact of recent acquisitions and continued strong activity in our core fast moving consumer goods markets, especially in the U.S. Segment book-to-bill was 1.02. 2013 Versus 2012 Engineered Systems 2013 revenue increased $34.3 million, or 1.6% , due to organic revenue growth of 1.6%. Revenue derived from the Industrials platform (representing 59.7% of 2013 segment revenue) increased $7.3 million, or 0.6% , driven by higher demand for waste equipment for large regional haulers and increased demand in vehicle service markets, partially offset by lower demand for equipment serving the mining, utilities, military, and industrial automation machinery sectors. Revenue of our Printing & Identification platform (representing 40.3% of 2013 segment revenue) increased $27.0 million, or 3.2% , favorably impacted by market improvements in Europe and developing markets. Engineered Systems segment earnings in 2013 increased $27.8 million, or 8.7% , compared with 2012 , due to the impact of productivity improvements and favorable pricing. In addition, non-recurring gains in 2013 included settlements on insurance related to property damage totaling $3.1 million that partially offset other miscellaneous non-recurring charges, none of which were individually significant. Operating margin increased 110 basis points compared to 2012 , primarily attributable to leveraging higher volumes and ongoing productivity improvements, including restructuring savings from actions taken earlier in 2013 and 2012 in the Printing & Identification platform. 33 Table of Contents Fluids Our Fluids segment, serving the Fluid Transfer and Pumps end markets, is focused on the safe handling of critical fluids across the oil and gas, retail fueling, chemical, hygienic and industrial markets.

Fluid Transfer revenue (representing 54.5% of 2014 segment revenue) increased $113.4 million, or 17.0%, compared to the prior year. Growth was driven by strong fuel transportation and global retail fueling environment markets, as well as from recent acquisitions. Pumps revenue (representing 45.5% of 2014 segment revenue) increased $80.3 million, or 14.1%, as compared with the prior year. Growth was driven by solid global demand, growth from recent acquisitions and new product introductions. Fluids segment earnings increased $27.1 million, or 12.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the comparable prior year period, as volume leverage, productivity initiatives and strategic pricing more than offset incremental costs associated with recent acquisitions, including approximately $10.7 million of depreciation and amortization. Operating margin decreased 60 basis points, primarily due to the aforementioned impact of recent acquisitions, as well as higher restructuring charges to better streamline businesses, particularly within the businesses serving the Pumps end market. Bookings for 2014 decreased 13.7% as compared to 2013 , and backlog levels decreased 10.5% at December 31, 2014 compared to the prior year end, primarily reflecting the timing of project-related orders within Pumps. Book to bill was solid at 1.0. 34 Table of Contents 2013 Versus 2012 Fluids segment revenue increased $149.3 million, or 13.7% , compared to 2012 , attributable to organic revenue growth of 6.8% and acquisition-related growth of 6.9%. Fluid Transfer revenue (representing 53.8% of 2013 segment revenue) increased $68.8 million, or 11.5%, year-over-year, reflecting acquisition-related growth from acquisitions made in the forth quarter of 2013, as well as broad-based order and shipment activity. Pumps revenue (representing 46.2% of 2013 segment revenue increased $80.5 million, or 16.4%, compared with the prior year, primarily driven by the acquisitions of Ebsray Pumps and Finder Pompe in the second and fourth quarters of 2013, respectively. Fluids segment earnings increased $42.0 million, or 23.0% , in 2013 compared to 2012 , with an increase in operating margin of 140 basis points, as the increased sales volume and productivity initiatives more than offset higher acquisition-related costs, including depreciation and amortization. 35 Table of Contents Refrigeration & Food Equipment Our Refrigeration & Food Equipment segment is a provider of innovative and energy efficient equipment and systems serving the commercial refrigeration and food service industries.

The overall increase in revenue includes organic growth of 1.7%, and acquisition growth of 0.2%. Foreign currency translation had an unfavorable impact of 0.1%. Revenue growth in our Refrigeration end market (representing 77.2% of 2014 segment revenue) increased $33.3 million, or 2.3% , resulting from solid activity with major food retailers. Revenue derived from Food Equipment (representing 22.8% of 2014 segment revenue) was flat year over year, where growth in commercial kitchen and can-forming equipments was offset by soft food processing equipment activity. Refrigeration & Food Equipment segment earnings in 2014 decreased $28.6 million, or 10.7% , compared with 2013 , with a decrease in operating margin of 180 basis points. The earnings and margin decreases were driven by non-recurring restructuring of $24.9 million ($19.4 million higher as compared to 2013) primarily for the closure of a European-based facility, unfavorable product mix, as well as a $6.8 million land sale gain in the prior year that did not repeat. Bookings for the year ended December 31, 2014 decreased slightly as compared to 2013, reflecting anticipated lower orders for Refrigeration and the timing of orders for Food Equipment. Backlog at December 31, 2014 decreased 18.6% due to the aforementioned timing of orders for Food Equipment. Book to bill was 0.97. 36 Table of Contents 2013 Versus 2012 Revenue generated by our Refrigeration & Food Equipment segment increased $280.2 million, or 17.4% , compared with 2012 . The overall increase in revenue resulted primarily acquisition-related growth of 16.0%, as well as organic revenue growth of 1.4%. Our revenue in the Refrigeration market (representing 76.8% of 2013 segment revenue) increased $227.8 million, or 18.6% , primarily reflecting the favorable impact of recent acquisitions, most notably Anthony International acquired in November 2012. These increases in revenue more than offset the impact of delayed shipments to a key retail customer on a specific project. Our Food Equipment revenue (representing 23.2% of 2013 segment revenue) increased $52.4 million , or 13.6% , over the prior year reflecting increased demand for beverage can-making equipment and the favorable impact of recent acquisitions. Refrigeration & Food Equipment's 2013 earnings increased 19.7% compared with 2012 , with an increase in operating margin of 30 basis points. The earnings and margin increases were mainly due to the impact of recent acquisitions and productivity savings, partially offset by acquisition-related depreciation and amortization expense. 37 Table of Contents FINANCIAL CONDITION We assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating, investing, and financing activities. Significant factors affecting liquidity are: cash flows generated from operating activities, capital expenditures, acquisitions, dispositions, dividends, repurchase of outstanding shares, adequacy of available commercial paper and bank lines of credit, and the ability to attract long-term capital with satisfactory terms. We generate substantial cash from the operations of our businesses and remain in a strong financial position, with sufficient liquidity available for reinvestment in existing businesses and strategic acquisitions. Cash Flow Summary The following table is derived from our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows: Years Ended December 31, Cash Flows from Continuing Operations (in thousands) 2014 2013 2012 Net Cash Flows Provided By (Used In): Operating activities $ 950,164 $ 979,612 $ 968,369 Investing activities (782,557 ) (361,677 ) (1,225,330 ) Financing activities (255,489 ) (678,542 ) (342,942 ) Operating Activities Cash provided by operating activities in 2014 decreased $29.4 million relative to 2013 . This decline was driven by higher investments in working capital of $43.4 million in 2014 relative to the prior year due, primarily due to the impact of timing of inventory purchases and vendor payments. In addition, higher tax payments of approximately $54.0 million contributed to the decline in operating cash flow in 2014. These reductions were partially offset by higher continuing earnings before the impact of depreciation, amortization, and restructuring expenses and lower pension contributions of $16.0 million . Cash provided by operating activities in 2013 increased $11.2 million as compared to the prior year. This increase was driven by higher earnings from continuing operations; however, increased investments in working capital of $77.4 million , mostly due to the timing of customer payments, reduced operating cash flow. Higher long-term and annual incentive compensation payouts in 2013 drove reductions in compensation accruals of approximately $64.3 million . Additionally, higher tax payments of $51.9 million further reduced operating cash flow in 2013. Pension and Post-Retirement Activity: The funded status of our qualified defined benefit pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets, the level of market interest rates, and the level of funding. We contribute cash to our plans at our discretion, subject to applicable regulations and minimum contribution requirements. Cash contributions to the U.S. qualified benefit plans totaled $9.0 million and $18.0 million in 2013 and 2012 , respectively. Due to the overfunded status of this plan, the Company made no contributions in 2014 and expects to make minimal contributions in the near term. Our significant international pension obligations are located in regions where it is not economically advantageous to pre-fund the plans due to local regulations. Total cash contributions to ongoing international defined benefit pension plans in 2014 , 2013 , and 2012 totaled $9.5 million, $9.8 million, and $7.2 million, respectively. In 2015, we expect to contribute approximately $6.5 million to our non-U.S. plans. See Note 15 Employee Benefit Plans in the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion regarding our post-retirement plans. Adjusted Working Capital: In 2014 , Adjusted Working Capital (a non-GAAP measure calculated as accounts receivable, plus inventory, less accounts payable) increased from 2013 by $165.9 million, or 13.1%, to $1.4 billion, which reflected an increase in receivables of $110.1 million, an increase in net inventory of $148.4 million, and an increase in accounts payable of $92.6 million, generally due to the impact of timing of inventory purchases and vendor payments in 2014 . Excluding acquisitions and the effects of foreign exchange translation of $51.3 million, Adjusted Working Capital would have increased by $81.4 million, or 6.4%. 38 Table of Contents Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities are derived from cash outflows for capital expenditures and acquisitions, partially offset by proceeds from sales of businesses, property, plant and equipment, and short-term investments. The majority of the activity in investing activities was comprised of the following: Acquisitions: In 2014 , we deployed $802.3 million to acquire seven businesses, including $435.7 million for Accelerated and $158.6 million for WellMark Holdings, Inc., two U.S. acquisitions within the Energy segment. In comparison, we acquired ten business in 2013 for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $322.8 million including $142.2 million for Finder Pompe, a European acquisition in the Fluids segment. Total acquisition spend of nearly $1.1 billion in 2012 was comprised of seven businesses, including $265.8 million for Maag Pump Systems, $119.4 million for PCS, and $603.2 million for Anthony International. See Note 3 Acquisitions in the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information with respect to recent acquisitions. Capital spending: Capital expenditures, primarily to support capacity expansion, innovation, and cost savings, were $166.0 million in 2014 , $141.7 million in 2013 , and $146.5 million in 2012 . Our capital expenditures were approximately $24.3 million higher in the 2014 period as compared to 2013 , primarily due to expansion activities in the Bearings & Compression end market. We expect 2015 capital expenditures to approximate 2.3% of revenue. Proceeds from sale of businesses: In 2014 , we generated cash proceeds of $191.3 million , primarily from the sale of DEK International and $16.3 million from the collection of deferred sale proceeds on the 2013 sale of Everett Charles Technologies, which accounted for the majority of the $76.5 million of cash received in 2013. Other investing activities : The majority of other investing activities for 2014 was a minority investment in a business serving the Refrigeration end market. We anticipate that capital expenditures and any acquisitions we make in 2015 will be funded from available cash and internally generated funds and, if necessary, through the issuance of commercial paper, the use of established lines of credit, or accessing the public debt or equity markets. Financing Activities Our cash flow from financing activities generally relates to the use of cash for purchases of our common stock and payment of dividends, offset by net borrowing activity and proceeds from exercise of stock options. The majority of financing activity was attributed to the following: Long-term debt and notes payable: During the 2014 period, we increased net borrowings from commercial paper issuances by $251.5 million principally to fund acquisitions during the period, including Accelerated Companies in the fourth quarter. In December 2013, the Company issued 300.0 million of 2.125% euro-denominated notes due in 2020. The proceeds of $403.8 million from the sale of the notes, net of discounts and issuance costs, were primarily used to repay commercial paper, which primarily accounted for the $381.0 million cash outflow during the year, as well as fund business acquisitions. In the 2012 period, we had negligible reductions in long-term debt, but increased borrowings of $607.5 million from commercial paper issuances for the purpose of funding acquisitions. Treasury purchases: In November 2012, Dover's Board of Directors approved a $1.0 billion stock repurchase program to drive additional shareholder value. During 2014, the Company completed this program through the repurchase of 3.6 million shares at a total cost of $292.6 million . We used $457.3 million in 2013 to repurchase 6.0 million shares and $250.1 million in 2012 to repurchase 4.0 million shares under this facility. We repurchased an additional 3.9 million shares in 2014 for a total cost of $308.5 million and 8.3 million shares for $493.0 million in 2012 under previous repurchase programs authorized by the board of directors. In January 2015, Dover's board of directors approved a new standing share repurchase authorization, whereby the Company may repurchase up to 15 million shares of its common stock over the following three years. These share repurchases are opportunistic buybacks made as part of management's capital allocation strategy. These repurchases are also made to offset the dilutive impact of shares issued under our equity compensation plans. 39 Table of Contents Dividend payments: Total dividend payments to common shareholders were $258.5 million in 2014 , $247.8 million in 2013 and $241.0 million in 2012 . Our dividends paid per common share increased 7% to $1.55 per share in 2014 compared to $1.45 per share in 2013 . This represents the 59th consecutive year that our dividend has increased. Proceeds from the exercise of share-based awards: We had a net cash outflow of $0.8 million in 2014 from the exercise of share-based awards, as compared to a net cash inflow of $7.6 million in 2013 and $43.1 million in 2012. These proceeds have declined in recent periods as the number of stock options are diminishing and a larger number of cashless exercises of equity awards have occurred. Cash Flows from Discontinued Operations In 2014 , the businesses reported as discontinued operations generated net cash flow of $6.0 million . These cash flows reflect the operating results of Datamax O'Neil and Sargent Aerospace as well as Knowles prior to its spin-off in the first quarter and DEK prior to its sale in the third quarter. Cash flow generated for this period primarily reflects cash generated from operations of approximately $53.8 million, offset by costs incurred for the spin-off of Knowles of $27.1 million and capital expenditures of $20.6 million. 2013 and 2012 cash flows of $65.8 million and $171.1 million , respectively, include full year results for those business classified as discontinued operations, which include Knowles, DEK, ECT, Datamax O'Neil, and Sargent Aerospace. Higher investments in working capital of $115.4 million in 2013 relative to 2012, as well as costs of $30.1 million incurred in 2013 in connection with the spin-off of Knowles contributed to the decline in operating cash flows from discontinued operations in 2013, offset by higher earnings and lower capital expenditures for the period. Liquidity and Capital Resources Free Cash Flow In addition to measuring our cash flow generation and usage based upon the operating, investing, and financing classifications included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, we also measure free cash flow (a non-GAAP measure). We believe that free cash flow is an important measure of operating performance because it provides management and investors a measurement of cash generated from operations that is available to repay debt, pay dividends, fund acquisitions, and repurchase our common stock. For further information, see the Non-GAAP Disclosures at the end of this Item 7. The following table reconciles our free cash flow to cash flow provided by operating activities: Years Ended December 31, Free Cash Flow (dollars in thousands) 2014 2013 2012 Cash flow provided by operating activities $ 950,164 $ 979,612 $ 968,369 Less: Capital expenditures (166,033 ) (141,694 ) (146,502 ) Free cash flow $ 784,131 $ 837,918 $ 821,867 Free cash flow as a percentage of revenue 10.1 % 11.7 % 12.4 % For 2014 , we generated free cash flow of $784.1 million , representing 10.1% of revenue and 100.8% of earnings from continuing operations. Free cash flow in 2013 was $837.9 million or 11.7% of revenue, compared to $821.9 million , or 12.4% of revenue in 2012 . The full year decrease in 2014 free cash flow reflects a higher investment in working capital and higher capital expenditures, partially offset by higher earnings from continuing operations before depreciation and amortization. We expect to generate free cash flow in 2015 of approximately 11.0% of revenue. The 2013 increase in free cash flow compared to 2012 reflects higher earnings from continuing operations and lower capital expenditures, partially offset by higher investments in working capital and higher tax payments in 2013 . 40 Table of Contents Net Debt to Net Capitalization We utilize the net debt to net capitalization calculation (a non-GAAP measure) to assess our overall financial leverage and capacity and believe the calculation is useful to investors for the same reason. The following table provides a reconciliation of net debt to net capitalization to the most directly comparable GAAP measures: Net Debt to Net Capitalization Ratio (dollars in thousands) December 31, 2014 December 31, 2013 December 31, 2012 Current maturities of long-term debt $ 299,956 $ 2,778 $ 3,266 Commercial paper 478,000 226,500 607,500 Long-term debt 2,253,041 2,599,201 2,189,350 Total debt 3,030,997 2,828,479 2,800,116 Less: Cash and cash equivalents (681,581 ) (803,882 ) (800,076 ) Net debt 2,349,416 2,024,597 2,000,040 Add: Stockholders' equity 3,700,725 5,377,396 4,919,230 Net capitalization $ 6,050,141 $ 7,401,993 $ 6,919,270 Net debt to net capitalization 38.8 % 27.4 % 28.9 % Our net debt to net capitalization ratio increased to 38.8% at December 31, 2014 compared to 27.4% at December 31, 2013 . The increase in this ratio was driven primarily by the reduction in our net capitalization of $1.3 billion for the period primarily due to the $1.4 billion distribution of Knowles, $601.1 million in share repurchases, and $258.5 million of dividends, offset by $775.2 million of current earnings. As described above, we also received a cash payment of $360.0 million from Knowles, net of cash distributed, upon separation on February 28, 2014, which was used to fund share repurchases and reduce commercial paper balances. Net debt increased $324.8 million during the period primarily due to increases in commercial paper balances and a reduction in cash levels to fund acquisitions, dividend payments, and other general operating purposes. Our net debt to net capitalization ratio decreased slightly at December 31, 2013 compared to the prior year-end due to the significant increase in equity levels driven by current net earnings, offset in part by $28.4 million of additional net borrowings. We replaced commercial paper borrowings in 2013 with the issuance of 300.0 million of 2.125% euro-denominated notes due 2020, from which we received proceeds of approximately $403.8 million. We use commercial paper borrowings for general corporate purposes, including the funding of acquisitions and the repurchase of our common stock. We currently maintain an unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks which permits borrowings up to $1.0 billion and expires on November 10, 2016. This facility is used primarily as liquidity back-up for our commercial paper program. We have not drawn down any loans under this facility nor do we anticipate doing so. If we were to draw down a loan, at our election, the loan would bear interest at a Eurodollar or Sterling rate based on LIBOR, plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.565% to 1.225% (subject to adjustment based on the rating accorded our senior unsecured debt by S&P and Moody s) or at a base rate pursuant to a formula defined in the facility. Under this facility, we are required to maintain an interest coverage ratio of EBITDA to consolidated net interest expense of not less than 3.0 to 1. We were in compliance with this covenant and our other long-term debt covenants at December 31, 2014 and had a coverage ratio of 12.7 to 1.0. We are not aware of any potential impairment to our liquidity and expect to remain in compliance with all of our debt covenants. We also have a current shelf registration statement filed with the SEC that allows for the issuance of additional debt securities that may be utilized in one or more offerings on terms to be determined at the time of the offering. Net proceeds of any offering would be used for general corporate purposes, including repayment of existing indebtedness, capital expenditures, and acquisitions. At December 31, 2014 , our cash and cash equivalents totaled $681.6 million , of which approximately $509.8 million was held outside the United States. Cash and equivalents are invested in highly liquid investment-grade money market instruments and bank deposits with maturities of three months or less. We regularly invest cash in excess of near-term requirements in money market instruments or short-term investments, which consist of investment grade time deposits with original maturity dates at the time of purchase of no greater than three months. 41 Table of Contents In 2014, we made a one-time cash dividend of approximately $235.0 million as a result of certain restructuring arising from the spin-off of Knowles. The U.S. tax consequences of this intercompany dividend, which were not significant, have been included in our total income tax expense. Since the remaining cash our foreign subsidiaries hold is generally used to finance foreign operations and investments, including acquisitions, it is our intent to indefinitely reinvest those funds outside the U.S. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of tax payable if some or all of such funds were to be repatriated and the amount of foreign tax credits available to reduce or eliminate the resulting U.S. income tax liability. Management believes it has sufficient liquidity to satisfy its cash needs, including its cash needs in the United States. Our ability to obtain debt financing at comparable risk-based interest rates is partly a function of our existing cash-flow-to-debt and debt-to-capitalization levels as well as our current credit standing. Our credit ratings, which are independently developed by the respective rating agencies, were as follows as of December 31, 2014 : Short Term Rating Long Term Rating Outlook Moody's P-1 A2 Stable Standard & Poor's A-1 A Stable Fitch F1 A Stable Short-term ratings of "P-1," "A-1" and "F1" are defined as a strong or superior ability to repay short-term debt obligations. A long-term rating of "A" or "A2" is defined as a strong capacity to meet financial commitments, but susceptible to adverse business or economic conditions. We believe that existing sources of liquidity are adequate to meet anticipated funding needs at comparable risk-based interest rates for the foreseeable future. Acquisition spending and/or share repurchases could potentially increase our debt. Operating cash flow and access to capital markets are expected to satisfy our various cash flow requirements, including acquisitions and capital expenditures. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations As of December 31, 2014 , we had approximately $135.5 million outstanding in letters of credit with financial institutions, which expire at various dates in 2015 through 2020 . These letters of credit are primarily maintained as security for insurance, warranty and other performance obligations. In general, we would only be liable for the amount of these guarantees in the event of default in the performance of our obligations, the probability of which we believe is remote. We have also provided typical indemnities in connection with sales of certain businesses and assets, including representations and warranties and related indemnities for environmental, health and safety, tax, and employment matters. We do not have any material liabilities recorded for these indemnifications and are not aware of any claims or other information that would give rise to material payments under such indemnities. 42 Table of Contents A summary of our consolidated contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2014 and the years when these obligations are expected to be due is as follows: Payments Due by Period (in thousands) Total Less than 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More than 5 Years Other (5) Long-term debt (1) $ 2,552,997 $ 299,956 $ 231 $ 348,958 $ 1,903,852 $ Interest payments (2) 1,658,098 125,534 221,818 193,206 1,117,540 Rental commitments 272,935 63,979 93,840 57,580 57,536 Purchase obligations 74,914 73,599 1,121 194 Capital leases 7,202 3,801 2,746 308 347 Supplemental & post-retirement benefits (3) 135,510 24,928 17,272 22,094 71,216 Uncertain tax positions (4) 95,980 1,105 94,875 Total obligations $ 4,797,636 $ 592,902 $ 337,028 $ 622,340 $ 3,150,491 $ 94,875 _________ (1 ) See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Amounts represent principal payments for all long-term debt, including current maturities. (2 ) Amounts represent estimate of future interest payments on long-term debt using the interest rates in effect at December 31, 2014. (3 ) Amounts represent estimated benefit payments under our unfunded supplemental and post-retirement benefit plans and our unfunded non-U.S. qualified defined benefit plans. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We also expect to contribute approximately $6.5 million to our non-U.S. qualified defined benefit plans in 2015, which amount is not reflected in the above table. (4 ) Due to the uncertainty of the potential settlement of future uncertain tax positions, we are unable to estimate the timing of the related payments, if any, that will be made subsequent to 2014. These amounts do not include the potential indirect benefits resulting from deductions or credits for payments made to other jurisdictions. Financial Instruments and Risk Management The diverse nature of our businesses activities necessitates the management of various financial and market risks, including those related to changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and commodity prices. We periodically use derivative financial instruments to manage some of these risks. We do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. We are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to our financial instrument contracts; however, nonperformance by these counterparties is considered unlikely as our policy is to contract with highly-rated, diversified counterparties. Interest Rate Exposure We may, from time to time, enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to interest rate changes. As of December 31, 2014 , we did not have any open interest rate swap contracts. We issue commercial paper, which exposes us to changes in variable interest rates; however, maturities are typically three months or less so a change in rates over this period would have an immaterial impact on our pre-tax earnings. We consider our current risk related to market fluctuations in interest rates to be minimal since our debt is largely long-term and fixed-rate in nature. Generally, the fair market value of fixed-interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. A 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would decrease the 2014 year-end fair value of our long-term debt by approximately $242.1 million. However, since we have no plans to repurchase our outstanding fixed-rate instruments before their maturities, the impact of market interest rate fluctuations on our long-term debt does not affect our results of operations or financial position. 43 Table of Contents Foreign Currency Exposure We conduct business in various non-U.S. countries, primarily in Canada, Mexico, substantially all of the European countries, Brazil, Argentina, Malaysia, China, India, and other Asian countries. Therefore, we have foreign currency risk relating to receipts from customers, payments to suppliers, and intercompany transactions denominated in foreign currencies. We will occasionally use derivative financial instruments to offset such risks, when it is believed that the exposure will not be limited by our normal operating and financing activities. We have formal policies to mitigate risk in this area by using fair value and/or cash flow hedging programs. Changes in the value of the currencies of the countries in which we operate affect our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows when translated into U.S. dollars, our reporting currency. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar could result in unfavorable translation effects as the results of foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars. We have generally accepted the exposure to exchange rate movements relative to our investment in non-U.S. operations. We may, from time to time, for a specific exposure, enter into fair value hedges, and at December 31, 2014 , we had one outstanding floating-to-floating cross currency swap agreement for a total notional amount of $50.0 million in exchange for CHF 65.1 million , which matures on October 15, 2015. This transaction hedges a portion of our net investment in non-U.S. operations. The agreement qualifies as a net investment hedge and changes in the fair value are reported within the cumulative translation adjustment section of other comprehensive earnings, with any hedge ineffectiveness being recognized in current earnings. The fair values at December 31, 2014 and 2013 reflected cumulative losses of $15.6 million and $23.7 million , respectively, due to the strengthening of the Swiss franc relative to the U.S. dollar over the term of this arrangement. Due to the movement in currency rates subsequent to December 31, 2014, the loss on this net investment hedge has increased to approximately $21.0 million. Additionally, the Company has designated the 300.0 million of euro-denominated notes issued December 4, 2013 as a hedge of a portion of the its net investment in euro-denominated operations. Due to the high degree of effectiveness between the hedging instruments and the exposure being hedged, fluctuations in the value of the euro-denominated debt due to exchange rate changes are offset by changes in the net investment. Accordingly, changes in the value of the euro-denominated debt are recognized in the cumulative translation adjustment section of other comprehensive income to offset changes in the value of the net investment in euro-denominated operations. Due to the devaluation of the euro relative to the U.S. dollar in the latter half of 2014, the U.S. dollar equivalent of this debt decreased, resulting in the recognition of a gain in other comprehensive income of $47.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 . In contrast, the Company recognized a loss of $6.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 due to the appreciation of the euro relative to the U.S. dollar at that time. Commodity Price Exposure Certain of our businesses are exposed to volatility in the prices of certain commodities, such as aluminum, steel, copper, and various precious metals, among others. Our primary exposure to commodity pricing volatility relates to the use of these materials in purchased component parts or the purchase of raw materials. When possible, we maintain long-term fixed price contracts on raw materials and component parts; however, we are prone to exposure as these contracts expire. We may, from time to time, for a specific exposure, enter into cash flow hedges to mitigate our risk to commodity pricing; however, such contracts outstanding at December 31, 2014 were not significant. Critical Accounting Policies Our consolidated financial statements and related public financial information are based on the application of generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ("GAAP"). GAAP requires the use of estimates, assumptions, judgments, and subjective interpretations of accounting principles that have an impact on the assets, liabilities, revenue, and expense amounts we report. These estimates can also affect supplemental information contained in our public disclosures, including information regarding contingencies, risk, and our financial condition. The significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are discussed in Note 1 Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies . The accounting assumptions and estimates discussed in the section below are those that we consider most critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they inherently involve significant judgments and estimates. We believe our use of estimates and underlying accounting assumptions conforms to GAAP and is consistently applied. We review valuations based on estimates for reasonableness on a consistent basis. Revenue is recognized when all of the following circumstances are satisfied: a) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, b) price is fixed or determinable, c) collectability is reasonably assured, and d) delivery has occurred or services 44 Table of Contents have been rendered. The majority of our revenue is generated through the manufacture and sale of a broad range of specialized products and components, with revenue recognized upon transfer of title and risk of loss, which is generally upon shipment. Service revenue represents less than 5% of our total revenue and is recognized as the services are performed. In limited cases, our revenue arrangements with customers require delivery, installation, testing, certification, or other acceptance provisions to be satisfied before revenue is recognized. We do not have significant multiple deliverable arrangements. Inventories for the majority of our subsidiaries, including all international subsidiaries, are stated at the lower of cost, determined on the first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis, or market. Other domestic inventories are stated at cost, determined on the last-in, first-out (LIFO) basis, which is less than market value. Under certain market conditions, estimates and judgments regarding the valuation of inventories are employed by us to properly value inventories. Certain businesses tend to experience somewhat higher levels of inventory value fluctuations, particularly given the relatively high rate of product obsolescence over relatively short periods of time. We have significant tangible and intangible assets on our balance sheet that include goodwill and other intangibles related to acquisitions. The valuation and classification of these assets and the assignment of useful depreciation and amortization lives involve significant judgments and the use of estimates. The testing of these intangibles under established accounting guidelines for impairment also requires significant use of judgment and assumptions, particularly as it relates to the identification of reporting units and the determination of fair market value. Our assets and reporting units are tested and reviewed for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter or, when indicators of impairment exist, such as a significant sustained change in the business climate, or when a significant portion of a reporting unit is to be reclassified to discontinued operations, during the interim periods. We estimate fair value using discounted cash flow analyses (i.e. an income approach) which incorporate management assumptions relating to future growth and profitability. Changes in business or market conditions could impact the future cash flows used in such analyses. We believe that our use of estimates and assumptions are reasonable and comply with generally accepted accounting principles. We performed the annual impairment testing of our 16 identified reporting units in the fourth quarter of 2014 , and the fair value of all reporting units exceeded the carrying value by at least 60% and, in most cases, significantly more. If the fair value of each of these reporting units was decreased by 10%, the resulting fair value would still have exceeded the carrying value and no impairment would have been recognized. Additionally, we have considered the economic environments in which our businesses operate, particularly our Energy segment, as the recent decline in oil and gas prices have impacted our 2015 projected results. Throughout 2015, we will continue to reassess the Energy markets and related impact on projected results in order to determine whether a triggering event occurs, at which point goodwill testing will be performed. The valuation of our pension and other post-retirement plans requires the use of assumptions and estimates that are used to develop actuarial valuations of expenses and assets/liabilities. Inherent in these valuations are key assumptions, including discount rates, investment returns, projected salary increases and benefits, and mortality rates. Annually, we review the actuarial assumptions used in our pension reporting and compare them with external benchmarks to ensure that they accurately account for our future pension obligations. Changes in assumptions and future investment returns could potentially have a material impact on our pension expense and related funding requirements. Our expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is reviewed annually based on actual returns, economic trends and portfolio allocation. Our discount rate assumption is determined by developing a yield curve based on high quality corporate bonds with maturities matching the plans expected benefit payment streams. The plans expected cash flows are then discounted by the resulting year-by-year spot rates. As disclosed in Note 15 Employee Benefit Plans to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the 2014 weighted-average discount rates used to measure our qualified defined benefit, supplemental, and other post-retirement obligations ranged from 2.31% to 4.05%, a decrease from the 2013 rates, which ranged from 3.53% to 4.90%. The lower 2014 discount rates are reflective of the decrease in global market interest rates over these periods. A 25 basis point decrease in the discount rates used for these plans would have increased the post retirement benefit obligations by approximately $40.5 million from the amount recorded in the financial statements at December 31, 2014 . Our pension expense is also sensitive to changes in the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. A decrease of 25 basis points in the expected long-term rate of return on assets would have increased our defined benefit pension expense by approximately $1.8 million. We have significant amounts of deferred tax assets that are reviewed for recoverability and valued accordingly. These assets are evaluated by using estimates of future taxable income streams and the impact of tax planning strategies. Reserves are also estimated, using more likely than not criteria, for ongoing audits regarding federal, state, and 45 Table of Contents international issues that are currently unresolved. We routinely monitor the potential impact of these situations and believe that we have established the proper reserves. Reserves related to tax accruals and valuations related to deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes in tax codes and rulings, changes in statutory tax rates, and our future taxable income levels. The provision for uncertain tax positions provides a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and disclosure requirements regarding uncertainties in income tax positions. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We record interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of our provision for income taxes. We have significant accruals and reserves related to the self-insured portion of our risk management program. These accruals require the use of estimates and judgment with regard to risk exposure and ultimate liability. We estimate losses under these programs using actuarial assumptions, our experience, and relevant industry data. We review these factors quarterly and consider the current level of accruals and reserves adequate relative to current market conditions and experience. We have established liabilities for environmental and legal contingencies at both the business and corporate levels. A significant amount of judgment and the use of estimates are required to quantify our ultimate exposure in these matters. The valuation of liabilities for these contingencies is reviewed on a quarterly basis to ensure that we have accrued the proper level of expense. The liability balances are adjusted to account for changes in circumstances for ongoing issues and the establishment of additional liabilities for emerging issues. While we believe that the amount accrued to-date is adequate, future changes in circumstances could impact these determinations. Occasionally, we will establish liabilities for restructuring activities at an operation, in accordance with appropriate accounting principles. These liabilities, for both severance and exit costs, require the use of estimates. Though we believe that these estimates accurately reflect the anticipated costs, actual results may be different than the estimated amounts. We will from time to time discontinue certain operations for various reasons. Estimates are used to adjust, if necessary, the assets and liabilities of discontinued operations, including goodwill, to their estimated fair market value. These estimates include assumptions relating to the proceeds anticipated as a result of the sale. Fair value is established using internal valuation calculations along with market analysis of similar-type entities. The adjustments to fair market value of these operations provide the basis for the gain or loss when sold. Changes in business conditions or the inability to sell an operation could potentially require future adjustments to these estimates. We recognized total goodwill impairment charges of $63.8 million in 2013 and $63.8 million 2012 for certain reporting units included in discontinued operations based on the reduction in fair value implied in the anticipated selling price. No impairment charges were recorded in 2014. We will continue to evaluate impairment each reporting period for the remaining business held for sale at December 31, 2014 . We are required to recognize in our consolidated statements of earnings the expense associated with all share-based payment awards made to employees and directors, including stock options, stock appreciation rights (SARs), restricted stock, and performance share awards. We use the Black-Scholes valuation model to estimate the fair value of SARs and stock options granted to employees. The model requires that we estimate the expected life of the SAR or option, expected forfeitures and the volatility of our stock using historical data. We use the Monte Carlo simulation model to estimate fair value of performance share awards which also require us to estimate the volatility of our stock and the volatility of returns on the stock of our peer group as well as the correlation of the returns between the companies in the peer group. For additional information related to the assumptions used, see Note 13 Equity and Cash Incentive Program to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Recent Accounting Standards In June 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2014-12 which requires that a performance target for share-based payments that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition. Under this new standard, compensation cost should be recognized in the period in which it becomes probable that the performance target will be achieved and should represent the compensation cost attributable to the periods for which the requisite service has already been rendered. This update is effective for annual periods 46 Table of Contents beginning after December 15, 2015. The Company has evaluated this guidance and determined that the adoption will not significantly impact the consolidated financial statements. In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09 that introduces a new five-step revenue recognition model in which an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. This ASU also requires disclosures sufficient to enable users to understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers, including qualitative and quantitative disclosures about contracts with customers, significant judgments and changes in judgments, and assets recognized from the costs to obtain or fulfill a contract. This standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period. The Company is currently evaluating the new guidance to determine the impact it will have on its consolidated financial statements. In April 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-08, which includes amendments that change the requirements for reporting discontinued operations and require additional disclosures about discontinued operations. Under the new guidance, only disposals representing a strategic shift in operations - that is, a major effect on the organization's operations and financial results - should be presented as discontinued operations. Additionally, the ASU requires expanded disclosures about discontinued operations that will provide financial statement users with more information about the assets, liabilities, income, and expenses of discontinued operations. This update is effective for Dover in the first quarter of 2015. The Company has evaluated this guidance and determined that the adoption will not significantly impact the consolidated financial statements. In July 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-11, which provides that an unrecognized tax benefit, or a portion thereof, should be presented in the financial statements as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward, except to the extent that a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward is not available at the reporting date to settle any additional income taxes that would result from disallowance of a tax position, or the tax law does not require the entity to use, and the entity does not intend to use, the deferred tax asset for such purpose, then the unrecognized tax benefit should be presented as a liability. This standard was effective for Dover for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2013. The Company adopted this guidance effective January 1, 2014. The adoption of this ASU did not significantly impact the consolidated financial statements. In March 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-05, which permits an entity to release cumulative translation adjustments into net income when a reporting entity (parent) ceases to have a controlling financial interest in a subsidiary or group of assets that is a business within a foreign entity. Accordingly, the cumulative translation adjustment should be released into net income only if the sale or transfer results in the complete or substantially complete liquidation of the foreign entity in which the subsidiary or group of assets had resided, or, if a controlling financial interest is no longer held. The revised standard was effective for Dover for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2013. The Company adopted this guidance effective January 1, 2014. The adoption of this ASU did not significantly impact the consolidated financial statements. In February 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-02 which requires additional disclosures regarding the reporting of reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income. ASU 2013-02 requires an entity to present, either on the face of the statement where net income is presented or in the notes, significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by the respective line items of net income but only if the amount reclassified is required under U.S. GAAP to be reclassified to net income in its entirety in the same reporting period. This guidance was effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2012. The Company adopted this guidance effective January 1, 2013. The Company's adoption of this standard did not have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements. In July 2012, the FASB issued ASU 2012-02, which allows an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test of an indefinite-lived intangible asset. Per the terms of this ASU, an entity would not be required to calculate the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset unless the entity determines, based on qualitative assessment, that it is not more likely than not, the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. The revised standard was effective for Dover for its annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2012. Its adoption did not have a material impact on the Company consolidated financial statements. Non-GAAP Disclosures In an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding our results as determined by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), we also disclose non-GAAP information which we believe provides useful information to investors. Segment 47 Table of Contents EBITDA, segment EBITDA margin, free cash flow, net debt, total debt, net capitalization, the net debt to net capitalization ratio, adjusted working capital, earnings adjusted for non-recurring items, effective tax rate adjusted for discrete and other items, revenue excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and organic revenue growth are not financial measures under GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for cash flows from operating activities, debt or equity, earnings, revenue, or working capital as determined in accordance with GAAP, and they may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. We believe that segment EBITDA and segment EBITDA margin are useful to investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating ongoing operating profitability as they exclude the depreciation and amortization expense related primarily to capital expenditures and acquisitions that occurred in prior years, as well as in evaluating operating performance in relation to our competitors. Segment EBITDA is calculated by adding back depreciation and amortization expense to segment earnings. Segment margin is calculated as segment EBITDA divided by segment revenue. We believe the net debt to net capitalization ratio and free cash flow are important measures of operating performance and liquidity. Net debt to net capitalization is helpful in evaluating our capital structure and the amount of leverage we employ. Free cash flow provides both management and investors a measurement of cash generated from operations that is available to fund acquisitions, pay dividends, repay debt, and repurchase our common stock. Reconciliations of free cash flow, total debt, and net debt can be found above in this Item 7, Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation. We believe that reporting our effective tax rate adjusted for discrete and other items is useful to management and investors as it facilitates comparisons of our ongoing tax rate to prior and future periods and our peers. We believe that reporting adjusted working capital (also sometimes called "working capital"), which is calculated as accounts receivable, plus inventory, less accounts payable, provides a meaningful measure of our operational results by showing the changes caused solely by revenue. We believe that reporting adjusted working capital and revenues at constant currency, which excludes the positive or negative impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, provides a meaningful measure of our operational changes, given the global nature of our businesses. We believe that reporting organic revenue and organic revenue growth, which exclude the impact of foreign currency exchange rates and the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, provides a useful comparison of our revenue performance and trends between periods.
