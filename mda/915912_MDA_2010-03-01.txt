ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A ) is intended to help provide an understanding of our business and results of operations. This MD&A should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report. This report, including the following MD&A, contains forward-looking statements regarding future events or trends that should be read in conjunction with the factors described under Forward-Looking Statements included in this report. In addition, our actual results or developments could differ materially from those projected in such forward-looking statements as a result of the factors discussed under Forward-Looking Statements as well as the risk factors described in Item 1a, Risk Factors, of this report. Executive Overview Business Description We are primarily engaged in developing, acquiring, owning and operating apartment communities in high barrier to entry markets of the United States. We believe that apartment communities are an attractive long-term investment opportunity compared to other real estate investments, because a broad potential resident base should help reduce demand volatility over a real estate cycle. However, throughout the real estate cycle, apartment market fundamentals, and therefore operating cash flows, are affected by overall economic conditions. We seek to create long-term shareholder value by accessing capital on cost effective terms; deploying that capital to develop, redevelop and acquire apartment communities in high barrier to entry markets; operating apartment communities; and selling communities when they no longer meet our long-term investment strategy or when pricing is attractive. Barriers to entry in our markets generally include a difficult and lengthy entitlement process with local jurisdictions and dense urban or suburban areas where zoned and entitled land is in limited supply. We regularly evaluate the allocation of our investments by the amount of invested capital and by product type within our individual markets, which are located in New England, the New York/New Jersey metro area, the Mid-Atlantic, the Midwest, the Pacific Northwest, and the Northern and Southern California regions of the United States. Our time-tested strategy is to be leaders in customer insight, market research and capital allocation, delivering a range of multifamily offerings tailored to serve the needs of the most attractive customer segments in the best-performing US submarkets. Our communities are predominately upscale, which generally command among the highest rents in their markets. However, we also pursue the ownership and operation of apartment communities that target a variety of customer segments and price points, consistent with our goal of offering a broad range of products and services. Financial Highlights and Outlook For the year ended December 31, 2009, net income available to common stockholders was $155,647,000 compared to $401,033,000 for 2008, a decrease of 61.2%. The decrease is primarily due to the reduced number of communities sold and amount of gains related to these sales in 2009 as compared to the prior year, coupled with the loss recognized on the tender offer completed in October 2009, offset somewhat by a decrease in charges for land impairments and abandoned pursuit costs. Detail of the impacts for the land impairments, abandoned pursuits as well as the charge for the tender offer and certain other non-routine items is provided in the following table. 38 Non-Routine Items Decrease (Increase) in Net Income and FFO (dollars in thousands) Full Year Full Year 2008 2009 Land impairments $ 57,899 $ 21,152 Abandoned pursuits (1) 6,611 1,139 Severance and related costs 3,400 4,500 Federal excise tax 3,200 515 (Gain) loss on unsecured notes repurchase (1,839 ) 25,910 Gain on sale of land (4,830 ) Joint venture income adjustment (2) (1,294 ) Legal settlement proceeds, net (1,175 ) Preferred stock deferred offering expenses 3,566 Fund II organizational costs 1,209 Total non-routine items $ 74,046 $ 45,917 Weighted Average Dilutive Shares Outstanding 77,578,852 80,599,657 (1) For purposes of non-routine classification, abandoned pursuits includes costs we expensed for individual pursuits in excess of $1,000 in a given quarter. (2) Includes our promoted interest of $3,894 in joint venture, and our pro rata portion of an impairment charge on a community in an unconsolidated joint venture of $2,600. Apartment fundamentals continued to be challenged during 2009. Job losses exceeded our expectations during the year, resulting in more than expected downward pressure on rental revenue. Our Established Community portfolio experienced a decline in year-over-year rental revenue of 3.7%, comprised of a decrease in rental rates of 3.1% and in economic occupancy of 0.6%. This decrease in revenues and an increase in operating expenses resulted in a decline in our Established Community portfolio NOI of 7.1% in 2009 from the prior year. We expect Earnings per share diluted ( EPS ) will decrease to $1.73 for 2010 from $1.93 in 2009, driven primarily by a decline in revenue and NOI from our Established Communities in 2010 as compared to the prior year. The recession, coupled with the short term nature of apartment leases, continues to adversely impact current operating fundamentals. The expected decline in our 2010 NOI is attributable largely to the effect of job losses experienced during the past two years. Employment is a leading demand driver, and we expect continued weak employment conditions to contribute to revenue declines in 2010. The impact of job losses on our results for 2010 may be somewhat offset by (i) the expected continued weakness in the for-sale housing market during 2010, (ii) growth in those age groups that have historically demonstrated a higher propensity to rent and (iii) constrained levels of new supply. Our current financial outlook for 2010 provides for a decline in rental revenue of between 3.0% and 4.5% in our Established Community portfolio resulting in a projected NOI decline for our Established Communities of 5.0% to 7.0%. We were again active in the capital markets in 2009, raising in excess of $1,700,000,000 through the issuance of secured and unsecured debt, assets sales, sales of common equity in the public markets, and capital commitments for Fund II. We have used the proceeds received to fund our development and redevelopment activities, to acquire an indirect interest in assets through Fund II, to repay higher cost secured and unsecured debt, and to repay floating rate debt, while retaining substantial cash balances for general corporate purposes. Our focus on raising capital includes consideration for managing the maturity risk associated with our secured and unsecured debt obligations. Our 2009 activity includes the issuance of over $800,000,000 of secured financing and $500,000,000 of unsecured notes in September 2009 in two $250,000,000 tranches, one maturing in 2017 and the second maturing in 2020. A portion of the proceeds was used to repurchase $310,100,000 principal amount of some or all of the amounts outstanding on unsecured notes maturing over the next three years, effectively extending the duration of debt maturities while reducing interest costs. We believe that our relatively modest level of secured and unsecured debt will continue to provide financial flexibility to access capital on attractive terms. 39 The funds raised from dispositions consist of the proceeds from the sale of five communities for a gross sales price of $179,675,000. We anticipate our level of disposition activity will be consistent in 2010, within the range of gross sales of $180,000,000 to $200,000,000, occurring primarily during the first half of the year During 2009 we completed the development of nine communities for an aggregate total capitalized cost of $810,700,000. We started the development of two communities, which are expected to be completed for an estimated total capitalized cost of $64,900,000. We expect an increase in investor demand for quality multifamily assets, due in part to the increased liquidity in the capital markets and constrained supply resulting from the decline in development activity in all markets. While we reduced our level of development during 2009 in response to the general deterioration in real estate and capital market conditions, we believe that our development activity will continue to create long-term value. During 2010, we expect to use our core competency in development to deliver new assets into the market for a recovery in apartment fundamentals that we expect in 2011 and 2012. We anticipate new development starts in 2010 with a total projected capitalized cost of $380,000,000. Consistent with this view, we also expect to increase redevelopment activity for our wholly owned communities in 2010, during which we expect to start redevelopment of seven wholly owned communities. During 2010, we expect to disburse approximately $500,000,000 related to the seven communities under development at December 31, 2009, the new development starts, and anticipated acquisitions of land for future development. We expect approximately $50,000,000 of the projected 2010 disbursements will be funded from cash in escrow related to previously sourced tax-exempt debt. We believe that our current level of indebtedness, our current ability to service interest and other fixed charges and our current limited use of financial encumbrances (such as secured financing) will provide adequate access to the capital necessary to fund our development and redevelopment activities during 2010. We expect to meet our liquidity needs from the issuance of corporate securities (which could include unsecured debt and/or common and preferred equity) and secured debt, as well as from disposition proceeds, joint ventures or from retained cash. We believe that the current market provides for an opportunity to perform certain scheduled maintenance and repositioning activities at attractive costs due to a continued decline in costs for construction materials and labor. We increase our direct and indirect interests in communities through development and acquisitions. While we grow principally through our demonstrated core competency of developing wholly owned assets from capital sources, we also acquire interests in additional assets, primarily through our investment in Fund II. Fund I is a discretionary investment fund with nine institutional investors, including us. One of our wholly owned subsidiaries is the general partner of Fund I and has invested approximately $50,000,000 in Fund I, representing a 15.2% combined general partner and limited partner equity interest. Fund I was our principal vehicle for acquiring apartment communities through the close of its investment period in March 2008. Subsidiaries of Fund I have 21 loans secured by individual assets with amounts outstanding in the aggregate of $436,410,000 with varying maturity dates (or dates after which the loans can be prepaid without penalty), ranging from October 2011 to September 2016. These mortgage loans are secured by the underlying real estate. Fund II is a second discretionary investment fund with six institutional investors, including us. One of our wholly owned subsidiaries is the general partner of Fund II. Fund II was formed in August 2008 and, in the second quarter of 2009, we added equity commitments for Fund II, resulting in total equity commitments from five institutional investors and us of $400,000,000, of which our commitment is $125,000,000. Total equity commitments to Fund II in the second quarter of 2009 increased by $67,000,000 as a result of the following: a new institutional investor made an equity commitment of $75,000,000; an existing institutional investor increased its commitment by $17,000,000, based on terms of its existing commitment; and we decreased our commitment by $25,000,000 to $125,000,000, based on terms of our existing commitment, decreasing our equity interest to approximately 31%. 40 Fund II can employ leverage of up to 65%, allowing for a total investment capacity of approximately $1,100,000,000, and has a term that expires in August 2018, plus two one-year extension options. Fund II now serves as the exclusive vehicle through which we will acquire investment interests in apartment communities until August 2011 or, if earlier, until 90% of the committed capital of Fund II is invested, subject to limited exceptions. Fund II will not include or involve our development activities. We will receive, in addition to any returns on invested equity, asset management fees, property management fees and redevelopment fees. We will also receive a promoted interest if certain return thresholds are met. In 2009, Fund II acquired two communities, Avalon Bellevue Park, a 220 apartment-home community located in Bellevue, Washington and The Hermitage, a 491 apartment-home community located in Fairfax, Virginia. Fund II has invested $104,330,000 as of December 31, 2009. Fund II has one loan secured by an asset in the amount of $21,515,000 with a maturity of June 2019. This loan is payable by Fund II. As of December 31, 2009, Fund II also has $30,200,000 outstanding under a credit facility that matures in December 2010. In February 2010, Fund II acquired its third community, a 203 apartment-home community located in Gaithersburg, Maryland. Communities Overview Our real estate investments consist primarily of current operating apartment communities, Development Communities, and Development Rights. Our current operating communities are further distinguished as Established Communities, Other Stabilized Communities, Lease-Up Communities and Redevelopment Communities. Established Communities are generally operating communities that are consolidated for financial reporting purposes and were owned and had stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of the beginning of the prior year, which allows the performance of these communities and the markets in which they are located to be compared and monitored between years. Other Stabilized Communities are generally all other consolidated operating communities that have stabilized occupancy and operating expenses during the current year, but had not achieved stabilization as of the beginning of the prior year. Lease-Up Communities consist of communities where construction is complete but stabilization has not been achieved. Redevelopment Communities consist of communities where substantial redevelopment is in progress or is planned to begin during the current year. A more detailed description of our reportable segments and other related operating information can be found in Note 9, Segment Reporting, of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Although each of these categories is important to our business, we generally evaluate overall operating, industry and market trends based on the operating results of Established Communities, for which a detailed discussion can be found in Results of Operations as part of our discussion of overall operating results. We evaluate our current and future cash needs and future operating potential based on acquisition, disposition, development, redevelopment and financing activities within Other Stabilized, Redevelopment and Development Communities. Discussions related to these segments of our business can be found in Liquidity and Capital Resources. NOI of our current operating communities is one of the financial measures that we use to evaluate community performance. NOI is affected by the demand and supply dynamics within our markets, our rental rates and occupancy levels and our ability to control operating costs. Our overall financial performance is also impacted by the general availability and cost of capital and the performance of newly developed and acquired apartment communities. As of December 31, 2009, we owned or held a direct or indirect ownership interest in 172 apartment communities containing 50,364 apartment homes in ten states and the District of Columbia, of which seven communities were under construction and seven communities were under reconstruction. Of these communities, 24 were owned by entities that were not consolidated for financial reporting purposes, including 19 owned by subsidiaries of Fund I and two owned by subsidiaries of Fund II. In addition, we owned a direct or indirect ownership interest in Development Rights to develop an additional 28 wholly owned communities that, if developed in the manner expected, will contain an estimated 7,180 apartment homes. Results of Operations 41 Our year-over-year operating performance is primarily affected by both overall and individual geographic market conditions and apartment fundamentals and reflected in changes in NOI of our Established Communities; NOI derived from acquisitions and development completions; the loss of NOI related to disposed communities; and capital market and financing activity.

The overall decline in net income was mitigated by a reduction in charges for land impairments and abandoned pursuit costs between years. Net income attributable to common stockholders increased $51,573,000 or 14.8% in 2008 over the prior year period due primarily to gains from the sale of communities and year-over-year increases in community operating performance, partially offset by charges associated with land impairments and abandoned pursuits as well as increased costs for interest and depreciation. NOI is considered by management to be an important and appropriate supplemental performance measure to net income because it helps both investors and management to understand the core operations of a community or communities prior to the allocation of any corporate-level or financing-related costs. NOI reflects the operating performance of a community and allows for an easy comparison of the operating performance of individual assets or groups of assets. In addition, because prospective buyers of real estate have different financing and overhead structures, with varying marginal impacts to overhead by acquiring real estate, NOI is considered by many in the real estate industry to be a useful measure for determining the value of a real estate asset or group of assets. We define NOI as total property revenue less direct property operating expenses, including property taxes. NOI does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, NOI should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance. NOI should also not be considered an alternative to net cash flow from operating activities, as determined by GAAP, as a measure of liquidity, nor is NOI necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs. Reconciliations of NOI for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 to net income for each year, are as follows (dollars in thousands): 42 For the year ended 12-31-09 12-31-08 12-31-07 Net income $ 154,274 $ 410,746 $ 359,745 Indirect operating expenses, net of corporate income 30,315 33,010 31,285 Investments and investment management expense 3,844 4,787 4,763 Expensed development and other pursuit costs 5,842 12,511 6,974 Interest expense, net 150,323 114,910 92,175 (Gain) loss on extinguishment of debt, net 25,910 (1,839 ) General and administrative expense 28,748 42,781 28,494 Equity in income of unconsolidated entities (1,441 ) (4,566 ) (59,169 ) Depreciation expense 209,746 183,748 157,895 Impairment loss land holdings 21,152 57,899 Gain on sale of real estate assets (68,717 ) (284,901 ) (107,032 ) Income from discontinued operations (13,974 ) (27,353 ) (33,894 ) Net operating income $ 546,022 $ 541,733 $ 481,236 The NOI increases for both 2009 and 2008, as compared to the prior year period, consist of changes in the following categories (dollars in thousands): Full Year Full Year 2009 2008 Established Communities $ (29,707 ) $ 19,160 Other Stabilized Communities 14,228 44,722 Development and Redevelopment Communities 19,768 (3,385 ) Total $ 4,289 $ 60,497 The NOI decrease in Established Communities in 2009 is due to the rental revenue declines as a result of the job losses experienced in 2008 and 2009, coupled with increases in community operating expenses. During 2009, we focused on minimizing rental rate declines, while maintaining occupancy of at least 94% in all regions. We anticipate that rental rates and occupancy levels will decline in 2010 such that overall rental revenue will decline between 3.0% and 4.5%. The projected revenue decline is due to our expectation of continued job losses at least through the second quarter of 2010. Expense growth also impacts growth in NOI and we continue to monitor and manage operating expenses to constrain expense growth. We expect operating expenses to be flat in 2010 from prior year levels. As a result, we expect NOI for our Established Communities to decline between 5.0% and 7.0%. These projections are based on our outlook for employment conditions and apartment market fundamentals in 2010, both nationally and in the markets where we operate, as well as the individual demand/supply characteristics of each submarket in which we operate. There can be no assurance that our outlook for economic conditions and/or their impact on our operating results will be accurate, and actual results could differ materially. Please see Risk Factors, Forward-Looking Statements and other discussions in this report on Form 10-K for a discussion of factors which could affect our results of operations. Rental and other income increased in 2009 as compared to the prior year due to additional rental income generated from newly developed communities, offset somewhat by decreased rental rates and occupancy for our Established Communities. Rental and other income increased in 2008 as compared to the prior year due to increased rental rates and occupancy for our Established Communities, coupled with additional rental income generated from newly developed communities. Overall Portfolio The weighted average number of occupied apartment homes increased to 38,233 apartment homes for 2009 as compared to 37,886 homes for 2008 and 38,436 homes for 2007. The increase in 2009 over 2008 is due to homes available from newly developed communities, offset partially by communities sold during 2009, as well as declining occupancy levels due to the economic slow down. 43 The weighted average monthly revenue per occupied apartment home decreased to $1,910 for 2009 as compared to $1,921 in 2008 and $1,767 in 2007. Established Communities Rental revenue decreased $22,370,000, or 3.7%, for 2009 and increased $18,221,000, or 3.1%, for 2008. The decrease in 2009 from 2008 is due primarily to lower rental rates. For 2009, the weighted average monthly revenue per occupied apartment home decreased 3.1% to $1,869 compared to $1,929 in 2008. There was a slight change in year-over-year average economic occupancy for 2009 down 0.6% to 95.6% compared to 96.2% in 2008. The increase in rental revenue in 2008 over the prior year is due entirely to increased average rental rates. Economic occupancy takes into account the fact that apartment homes of different sizes and locations within a community have different economic impacts on a community gross revenue. Economic occupancy is defined as gross potential revenue less vacancy loss, as a percentage of gross potential revenue. Gross potential revenue is determined by valuing occupied homes at leased rates and vacant homes at market rents. We experienced decreases in Established Communities rental revenue in all six of our regions for 2009 as compared to the prior year period as discussed in more detail below. The Metro New York/New Jersey region, which accounted for approximately 26% of Established Community rental revenue for 2009, experienced a decrease in rental revenue of 4.3% for 2009 as compared to 2008. Average rental rates decreased 4.1% to $2,288, and economic occupancy decreased 0.2% to 95.9% for 2009 as compared to 2008. During 2009, the trend of weakening rental market conditions in both New York City and surrounding suburban markets resulting from the recession is reflected in the declining rental rates in the second half of 2009. The challenges facing the financial services industry drive the region current expectation for job growth, which is expected to lag the U.S. average and our other markets. The Mid-Atlantic/Midwest region, which represented approximately 21% of Established Community rental revenue during 2009, experienced a decrease in rental revenue of 0.6% as compared to 2008. Average rental rates decreased by 0.7% to $1,729, while economic occupancy increased by 0.1% from 96.4% to 96.5% for 2009 as compared to 2008. This region continues to benefit from the impact of government and government services employment, which has served to stabilize the economy relative to other regions. The New England region accounted for approximately 21% of the Established Community rental revenue for 2009 and experienced a rental revenue decrease of 4.0% over the prior year. Average rental rates decreased 2.9% to $1,984 and economic occupancy decreased 1.1% to 95.2% for 2009, as compared to 2008. Given the significance of the financial services industry in the Boston metro area, as well as the impact of New York trends on Fairfield-New Haven, we expect the job recovery to be slow. Northern California accounted for approximately 17% of the Established Community rental revenue for 2009 and experienced a rental revenue decrease of 4.7% over the prior year. Average rental rates decreased 4.1% to $1,923 and economic occupancy decreased by 0.6% to 96.2% for 2009 as compared to 2008. The region employment base, with its above-average exposure to high-technology industries, can result in greater volatility in rental revenue changes relative to other regions. Southern California accounted for approximately 11% of the Established Community rental revenue for 2009 and experienced a rental revenue decrease of 5.0% over the prior year. Average rental rates decreased 3.8% to $1,509, and economic occupancy decreased by 1.2% to 94.1% for 2009 as compared to 2008. The Pacific Northwest region accounted for approximately 5% of the Established Community rental revenue for 2009 and experienced a rental revenue decrease of 5.0% over the prior year. Average rental rates decreased 3.7% to $1,282 and economic occupancy decreased by 1.3% to 94.2% for 2009 as compared to 2008. The Pacific Northwest also has a large presence of technology based employment, a contributing factor to the greater degree of volatility in rental rates. We believe a recovery in apartment fundamentals in the Pacific Northwest is likely to lag other AvalonBay regions given an increased level of housing supply in many submarkets. 44 In accordance with GAAP, cash concessions are amortized as an offset to rental revenue over the approximate lease term, which is generally one year. As a supplemental measure, we also present rental revenue with concessions stated on a cash basis to help investors evaluate the impact of both current and historical concessions on GAAP based rental revenue and to more readily enable comparisons to revenue as reported by other companies. Rental revenue with concessions stated on a cash basis also allows investors to understand historical trends in cash concessions, as well as current rental market conditions. The following table reconciles total rental revenue in conformity with GAAP to total rental revenue adjusted to state concessions on a cash basis for our Established Communities for the years 2009 and 2008 (dollars in thousands). Information for the year ended December 31, 2007 is not presented, as Established Community classification is not comparable prior to January 1, 2008. See Note 9, Segment Reporting, of our Consolidated Financial Statements. For the year ended 12-31-09 12-31-08 Rental revenue (GAAP basis) $ 587,752 $ 610,122 Concessions amortized 8,000 6,771 Concessions granted (6,361 ) (8,004 ) Rental revenue adjusted to state concessions on a cash basis $ 589,391 $ 608,889 Year-over-year % change GAAP revenue (3.7 %) n/a Year-over-year % change cash concession based revenue (3.2 %) n/a Management, development and other fees increased $760,000, or 11.6%, in 2009 and increased $426,000, or 6.9% in 2008. The increase in 2009 was due primarily to increased asset and property management fees from Fund II. The increase in 2008 was due primarily to increased redevelopment fees and property management fees as additional communities were acquired by subsidiaries of Fund I. Direct property operating expenses, excluding property taxes increased $22,817,000, or 11.9% in 2009 and increased $19,722,000, or 11.5% for 2008 as compared to the prior year periods, primarily due to the addition of recently developed apartment homes coupled with increased administrative expense due primarily to increases in bad debt expense due to the recession. For Established Communities, direct property operating expenses, excluding property taxes, increased $6,411,000, or 4.8% to $139,955,000 for 2009 and $328,000, or 0.2% to $133,544,000 for 2008, due primarily to increased administrative and community maintenance related costs, offset partially by a decrease in insurance and utility related expenses. The increases in administrative expense are primarily due to increased bad debt. Property taxes increased $9,872,000, or 13.4% and $6,697,000, or 10.0% in 2009 and 2008, respectively, due to the addition of newly developed and redeveloped apartment homes and overall higher assessments. Property tax increases are also impacted by the size and timing of successful tax appeals. For Established Communities, property taxes increased by $1,242,000, or 2.1% and $3,515,000, or 6.2% for 2009 and 2008, respectively over the prior year, due to both higher assessments throughout all regions and reductions in property taxes realized in 2008 that did not occur in 2009. The impact of the current economic environment has not been reflected in current assessments, as there is typically a time lag between a change in the economy affecting property valuations and updated real estate tax assessments. We expect property taxes in 2010 to increase over 2009 due primarily to higher tax rates, without the benefit of lower assessed values. For communities in California, property tax changes are determined by the change in the California Consumer Price Index, with increases limited by law (Proposition 13). We evaluate property tax increases internally, and also engage third-party consultants to assist in our evaluations. We appeal property tax increases when appropriate. 45 Corporate-level property management and other indirect operating expenses decreased by $2,315,000, or 5.8% in 2009 and increased $1,247,000, or 3.2% in 2008 over the prior year periods. The decrease in 2009 over 2008 is due primarily to decreases in compensation costs, coupled with a reduction in costs associated with the initial start up of our Customer Care Center, discussed below. The increase in 2008 over the prior year is due primarily to increased compensation and employee separation costs, as well as costs relating to the initial start up of the Customer Care Center and other corporate initiatives focused on increasing efficiency and enhancing controls at our operating communities. The Customer Care Center in Virginia Beach, Virginia opened in 2007 and expanded in 2008 to centralize certain community-related accounting, administrative and customer service functions. Investments and investment management reflects the costs incurred for investment acquisitions and investment management. Investments and investment management costs decreased in 2009 by $943,000 or 19.7% from the prior year due primarily to lower compensation and travel-related costs. Expensed development and other pursuit costs primarily reflect the costs incurred for abandoned pursuit costs, which include costs incurred for development pursuits not yet considered probable for development, as well as the abandonment of Development Rights and disposition pursuits. Expensed development and other pursuit costs increased in 2008 as compared to 2007 and 2009 due to increases in abandoned development pursuits in response to the economic decline and deteriorating market conditions in 2008. These costs can be volatile, particularly in periods of economic downturn or when there is limited access to capital, and the costs may vary significantly from period to period. Interest expense, net increased $35,413,000, or 30.8% and $22,735,000, or 24.7% in 2009 and 2008, respectively over the prior years. This category includes interest expense offset by interest capitalized, and interest income. The increase in 2009 is due primarily to a decrease in the amount of interest capitalized in 2009 as compared to the prior year, coupled with increased interest expense in 2009 compared to 2008 from additional secured and unsecured debt issued to fund development activity. The decrease in interest capitalized is due to the reduction in development activity in 2009 as compared to 2008. The increase in 2008 over the prior year is due primarily to a decrease in interest income in 2008 as compared to the prior year period, coupled with increased interest expense in 2008 compared to 2007. The higher level of interest income in 2007 is due to higher invested cash balances from our January 2007 equity offering. The increased interest expense in 2008 is due primarily to increased amounts of debt outstanding in 2008 compared to the prior year. (Gain) loss on the extinguishment of debt, net reflects the impact of our debt repurchase activity for payments above or below the carrying basis. The net loss in 2009 is due to the $310,100,000 in unsecured notes that we purchased prior to their scheduled maturity at a premium, offset by the gain recognized from our January 2009 tender offer. Depreciation expens e increased in 2009 and 2008 primarily due to the net increase in assets from the completion of development and redevelopment activities, offset by assets sold during the year. General and administrative expense ( G&A ) decreased $14,033,000, or 32.8% in 2009 and increased $14,287,000, or 50.1% in 2008 as compared to the prior years. The increase in 2008 as compared to 2007 and 2009 is due primarily to higher severance and related costs in 2008 associated with the decrease in our planned development activity, higher federal excise tax expense in 2008 resulting from gains on disposition activity and organization costs for the formation of Fund II incurred in 2008. Impairment loss for 2009 is due to the write down of three land parcels which we do not currently plan on developing. Impairment loss in 2008 is due primarily to the write down of eight land parcels which we did not plan on developing at the time. We did not recognize an impairment loss in 2007. Gain on sale of land for 2009 increased primarily due to the sale of two land parcels in 2009, without comparable activity in the prior year. Equity in income of unconsolidated entities for 2009 decreased from the prior year period due primarily to the recognition of our proportionate amount of an impairment loss that one of our unconsolidated investments recognized on one of its operating communities in 2009. In addition, gains from both the sale of a community by an 46 unconsolidated joint venture as well as from an investment in a joint venture formed to develop for sale homes occurred in 2008 that were not present in 2009. These amounts were partially offset by the recognition of our promoted interest in the joint venture that owns Avalon Chrystie Place in 2009. The decrease in 2008 from the prior year is due primarily to the gain on the sale of two partnership interests in 2007 and the related loss of partnership income, partially offset by our portion of the gain from the sale of a community by a joint venture partner, income from joint ventures where the underlying communities have achieved stabilized operations and gains from our investment in a joint venture formed to develop for-sale homes. Income from discontinued operations represents the net income generated by communities sold or qualifying as discontinued operations during the period from January 1, 2007 through December 31, 2009. This income decreased for 2009 and 2008 due to an increased number of communities sold in each year as compared to the prior year period. See Note 7, Real Estate Disposition Activities, of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Gain on sale of communities decreased in 2009 and increased in 2008 as compared to the prior year periods as a result of changes in the sales volume and associated gains in each respective year. The amount of gain realized upon disposition of a community depends on many factors, including the number of communities sold, the size and carrying value of those communities and the market conditions in the local area. Net (income) loss attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests for 2009 resulted in income of $1,373,000 compared to income of $741,000 in 2008 due primarily to recognition of income for our joint venture partners portion of expenses incurred by Fund II, as well as the conversion and redemption of limited partnership units in 2008 and 2009, thereby reducing outside ownership interests and the allocation of net income to outside ownership interests. FFO FFO is considered by management to be an appropriate supplemental measure of our operating and financial performance. In calculating FFO, we exclude gains or losses related to dispositions of previously depreciated property and exclude real estate depreciation, which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates. FFO can help one compare the operating performance of a real estate company between periods or as compared to different companies. We believe that in order to understand our operating results, FFO should be examined with net income as presented in our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report. For a more detailed discussion and presentation of FFO, see Selected Financial Data, included in Item 6 of this report. Liquidity and Capital Resources We believe our principal short-term liquidity needs are to fund: development and redevelopment activity in which we are currently engaged; the minimum dividend payments on our common stock required to maintain our REIT qualification under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986; debt service and principal payments either at maturity or opportunistic payments; normal recurring operating expenses; DownREIT partnership unit distributions; and capital calls for Fund II, as required. Factors affecting our liquidity and capital resources are our cash flows from operations, financing activities and investing activities (including dispositions) as well as general economic and market conditions. Operating cash flow has historically been determined by: (i) the number of apartment homes currently owned, (ii) rental rates, (iii) occupancy levels and (iv) operating expenses with respect to apartment homes. The timing and type of capital markets activity in which we engage, as well as our plans for development, redevelopment, acquisition and disposition activity, are affected by changes in the capital markets environment, such as changes in interest rates or the availability of cost-effective capital. We regularly review our liquidity needs, the adequacy of cash flows from operations and other expected liquidity sources to meet these needs. 47 During 2009 we saw access to liquidity improve as credit and equity markets recovered. During 2009, we raised in excess of $1,700,000,000 in the form of secured debt, unsecured debt and public and private equity. In 2010, we expect to meet all of our liquidity needs from a variety of internal and external sources, including cash balances on hand, borrowing capacity under our Credit Facility (as defined below), secured financings and other public or private sources of liquidity as discussed below, as well as our operating activities. To the extent that currently available internal and external resources do not satisfy our needs, we may seek additional external financing. Additional external financing could come from a variety of sources, such as public sales of debt or equity securities or unsecured or secured loans from financial institutions or other private or governmental lenders, among others. Private equity through joint ventures may also be used. Our ability to obtain additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions, the general availability of credit, the overall availability of credit to the real estate industry, our credit ratings and credit capacity, as well as the perception of lenders regarding our long or short-term financial prospects. At December 31, 2009, we have unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and cash in escrow of $316,367,000 available for both current liquidity needs as well as development activities, of which $93,440,000 relates to a Development Right for which we have not begun construction. Unrestricted cash and cash equivalents totaled $105,691,000 at December 31, 2009, an increase of $40,756,000 from $64,935,000 at December 31, 2008. The following discussion relates to changes in cash due to operating, investing and financing activities, which are presented in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows included elsewhere in this report. Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities decreased to $378,600,000 in 2009 from $386,084,000 in 2008. The decrease was driven primarily by the timing of general corporate payables and the payment of interest amounts in 2009 as compared to 2008. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities of $333,559,000 in 2009 related to investments in assets through development and redevelopment. In total, we invested $572,103,000 during 2009 in the following areas: We invested approximately $560,155,000 in the development of communities. We had capital expenditures of $11,948,000 for real estate and non-real estate assets. These amounts are partially offset by the proceeds from the disposition of real estate of $189,417,000. Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities totaled $4,285,000 in 2009. The net cash used is due primarily to the repayment of unsecured notes at maturity and repayment of amounts tendered of $868,564,000, the payment of cash dividends in the amount of $283,710,000, the repayment of amounts outstanding on the Credit Facility, defined below, of $124,000,000, and the repayment of secured notes of $65,229,000. These amounts were partially offset by the pooled secured financing executed in April 2009 for $741,140,000, the issuance of $500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of unsecured notes in September and $108,860,000 received from the issuance of common stock, primarily through the Continuous Equity Program (the CEP ) we initiated in August 2009. Variable Rate Unsecured Credit Facility We currently have a $1,000,000,000 revolving variable rate Credit Facility with a syndicate of commercial banks that expires in November 2011 (assuming our exercise of a one-year renewal option). We pay an annual facility fee of approximately $1,250,000. The Credit Facility bears interest at varying levels based on the London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ), our credit rating and on a maturity schedule selected by us. The current stated pricing is LIBOR plus 0.40% per annum (0.63% on January 31, 2010). The spread over LIBOR can vary from LIBOR plus 0.325% to LIBOR plus 1.00% based on our credit rating. In addition, a competitive bid option is available for borrowings of up to $650,000,000. This option allows banks that are part of the lender consortium to bid to provide us loans at a rate that is lower than the stated pricing provided by the Credit Facility. The competitive bid option may result in lower pricing if market conditions allow. We had no outstanding balance under this competitive bid option at January 31, 2010. At January 31, 2010, there were no amounts outstanding on the Credit Facility, 48 $45,355,000 was used to provide letters of credit, and $954,645,000 was available for borrowing under the Credit Facility. We expect to refinance the Credit Facility prior to maturity. While credit market conditions continue to improve from the difficult environment seen in 2008 and 2009, we expect facility pricing to be higher, and we may not be able to achieve the same borrowing capacity as exists under the current Credit Facility. We are subject to financial and other covenants contained in the Credit Facility and the indenture under which our unsecured notes were issued. The financial covenants include the following: limitations on the amount of total and secured debt in relation to our overall capital structure; limitation on the amount of our unsecured debt relative to the undepreciated basis of real estate assets that are not encumbered by property-specific financing; and minimum levels of debt service coverage. We were in compliance with these covenants at December 31, 2009. In addition, our secured borrowings may include yield maintenance, defeasance, or prepayment penalty provisions, which would result in us incurring an additional charge in the event of a full or partial prepayment of outstanding principal before the scheduled maturity. These provisions in our secured borrowings are generally consistent with other similar types of debt instruments issued during the same time period in which our borrowings were secured. Continuous Equity Offering Program In August 2009, we commenced the CEP, under which we may sell up to $400,000,000 of our common stock. This program is available until the $400,000,000 is sold or August 2012, whichever occurs first. We may sell the shares in amounts and at times to be determined by us. Actual sales will depend on a variety of factors to be determined by us, including market conditions, the trading price of our common stock and determinations of the appropriate sources of funding. In conjunction with the CEP, we engaged sales agents who received compensation of 1.5% of the gross sales price for shares sold. During the three months ended December 31, 2009 we sold 37,900 shares under this program at an average sales price of $74.34 per share, for net proceeds of $2,775,000. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we sold 1,504,901 shares under this program at an average sales price of approximately $69.56 per share, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $103,109,000. Future Financing and Capital Needs Debt Maturities One of our principal long-term liquidity needs is the repayment of long-term debt at the time that such debt matures. For unsecured notes, a portion of the principal of these notes may be repaid prior to maturity. Early retirement of our unsecured notes could result in gains or losses on extinguishment similar to those recognized in 2008 and 2009. If we do not have funds on hand sufficient to repay our indebtedness as it becomes due, it will be necessary for us to refinance the debt. This refinancing may be accomplished by uncollateralized private or public debt offerings, additional debt financing that is secured by mortgages on individual communities or groups of communities, draws on our Credit Facility or by equity offerings. Although we believe we will have the capacity to meet our currently anticipated liquidity needs, we cannot assure you that additional debt financing or debt or equity offerings will be available or, if available, that they will be on terms we consider satisfactory. The following financing activity occurred during 2009: we obtained secured financing for $741,140,000 pursuant to fourteen separate ten-year mortgage loans, each secured by one of our current communities at an interest rate of 5.86%; we obtained $93,440,000 in variable rate tax-exempt bond financing related to a Development Right, the proceeds of which will be held in escrow until requisitioned for construction funding; we repaid $4,143,000 in 8.08% fixed rate debt secured by a real estate asset formerly classified as a Development Right in Alexandria, Virginia in April 2009 pursuant to its scheduled maturity; 49 we redeemed $37,438,000 principal amount of our $150,000,000, 7.5% unsecured notes that mature in August 2009 for par and cancelled the notes upon purchase; we redeemed $64,423,000 principal amount of our $200,000,000, 7.5% unsecured notes that mature in December 2010 for $63,135,000 with the discount below par recorded as a gain reflected in (gain) loss on extinguishment of debt, net on the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Other Comprehensive Income of the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K and cancelled the notes upon purchase; we repaid $105,600,000 in unsecured debt, representing the first tranche of our $330,000,000 unsecured variable rate term loan pursuant to its scheduled maturity; we repaid $19,470,000 in variable rate debt secured by Avalon at Flanders Hill, located in Westborough, Massachusetts pursuant to its scheduled maturity; we repaid $102,562,000 of previously issued 7.5% unsecured notes, along with any unpaid interest, pursuant to their scheduled maturity; we repaid $112,200,000 in unsecured debt, representing the second tranche of our term loan prior to its scheduled maturity of January 2010; we issued a total of $500,000,000 of unsecured notes under our existing shelf registration statement. The offering consisted of two separate $250,000,000 tranches with effective interest rates of 5.80% and 6.19%, maturing in March 2017 and March 2020, respectively; we settled a cash tender offer, purchasing the following unsecured notes: $46,001,000 principal amount of our $200,000,000 7.5% unsecured notes due December 2010 at a weighted average price of 107.50% of par; $150,000,000 principal amount of our $300,000,000 6.625% unsecured notes due September 2011 at a weighted average price of 109.00% of par; $55,600,000 principal amount of our $250,000,000 5.5% unsecured notes due January 2012 at a weighted average price of 106.25% of par; and $48,399,000 principal amount of our $250,000,000 6.125% unsecured notes due November 2012 at a weighted average price of 108.75% of par; we repurchased $10,100,000 principal amount of our 6.625% unsecured notes due September 2011 at a weighted average price of 107.0% of par; we recorded a charge for the purchase premium as well as certain deferred issuance costs related to the $300,000,000 cash tender offer and additional $10,100,000 unsecured notes repurchase activity above of approximately $26,000,000 in (gain) loss on extinguishment of debt, net on the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Other Comprehensive Income of the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this form 10-K; we repaid the final $112,200,000 of our term loan outstanding prior to its scheduled maturity of January 2011; we repaid $33,615,000 in variable rate debt secured by Avalon at Newton Highlands, located in Newton, Massachusetts pursuant to its scheduled maturity; and through the execution of interest rate swaps, we effectively converted $300,000,000 principal of our fixed rate unsecured notes, with a weighted average maturity of approximately two years, to floating rate debt at a weighted average interest rate of three month LIBOR plus 5.42%. 50 The following table details debt maturities for the next five years, excluding our Credit Facility and amounts outstanding related to communities classified as held for sale, for debt outstanding at December 31, 2009 (dollars in thousands).

portion of this debt is effectively fixed at December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008 through an interest rate swap agreement. The portion of the debt fixed through the interest rate swap agreement decreases (and therefore the variable portion of the debt increases) monthly as payments are made to a principal reserve fund. (3) Variable rates are given as of December 31, 2009. (4) Financed by variable rate debt, but interest rate is capped through an interest rate protection agreement. (5) Represents full amount of the debt as of December 31, 2009. Actual amounts drawn on the debt as of December 31, 2009 are $46,216 for Bowery Place II, $44,678 for Avalon Acton, $88,823 for Morningside Park, $64,080 for Walnut Creek, and $0 for West Chelsea. (6) Balances outstanding represent total amounts due at maturity, and are not net of $2,448 of debt discount and basis adjustments associated with the hedged unsecured notes as of December 31, 2009 and $2,035 of debt discount as of December 31, 2008, as reflected in unsecured notes on our Consolidated Balance Sheets included elsewhere in this report. (7) In October 2009, we redeemed $46,001 principal amount of our $200,000 7.5% unsecured notes due December 2010. (8) In October 2009, we redeemed $160,100 principal amount of our $300,000 6.625% unsecured notes due September 2011. (9) In October 2009, we redeemed $55,600 principal amount of our $250,000 5.5% unsecured notes due January 2012. (10) In October 2009, we redeemed $48,399 principal amount of our $250,000 6.125% unsecured notes due November 2012. (11) In August and October 2009, we repaid $224,400 in unsecured debt, representing the second and third tranches of our term loan, prior to its scheduled maturities in January 2010 and 2011, respectively. (12) In October 2009, we executed $300,000 of interest rate swaps allowing us to effectively convert $300,000 principal of our fixed rate unsecured notes to floating rate debt. Future Financing and Capital Needs Portfolio and Other Activity As of December 31, 2009, we had seven new wholly owned communities under construction, for which a total estimated cost of $245,046,000 remained to be invested. We also had seven wholly owned communities under reconstruction, for which a total estimated cost of $49,527,000 remained to be invested. In addition, we may be required to contribute our proportionate share of capital to Fund II, if or to the extent that Fund II makes capital calls in conjunction with additional community acquisitions during 2010. Substantially all of the capital expenditures necessary to complete the communities currently under construction and reconstruction, development costs related to pursuing Development Rights, as well as for equity contributions to Fund II, will be funded from: cash currently on hand, including cash in construction escrows, invested in highly liquid overnight money market funds and repurchase agreements, and short-term investment vehicles; the remaining capacity under our $1,000,000,000 Credit Facility; retained operating cash; the net proceeds from sales of existing communities; the issuance of debt or equity securities; and/or private equity funding, including joint venture activity. Before planned reconstruction activity, including reconstruction activity related to communities acquired by the Funds, or the construction of a Development Right begins, we intend to arrange adequate financing to complete these undertakings, although we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such financing. In the event that financing cannot be obtained, we may have to abandon Development Rights, write off associated pre-development costs that were capitalized and/or forego reconstruction activity. In such instances, we will not realize the increased revenues and earnings that we expected from such Development Rights or reconstruction activity and significant losses could be incurred. From time to time we use joint ventures to hold or develop individual real estate assets. We generally employ joint ventures primarily to mitigate asset concentration or market risk and secondarily as a source of liquidity. We may also use joint ventures related to mixed-use land development opportunities where our partners bring development and operational expertise to the venture. Each joint venture or partnership agreement has been individually negotiated, and our ability to operate and/or dispose of a community in our sole discretion may be limited to varying 52 degrees depending on the terms of the joint venture or partnership agreement. We cannot assure you that we will achieve our objectives through joint ventures. In evaluating our allocation of capital within our markets, we sell assets that do not meet our long-term investment criteria or when capital and real estate markets allow us to realize a portion of the value created over the past business cycle and redeploy the proceeds from those sales to develop and redevelop communities. Because the proceeds from the sale of communities may not be immediately redeployed into revenue generating assets, the immediate effect of a sale of a community for a gain is to increase net income, but reduce future total revenues, total expenses and NOI. However, we believe that the absence of future cash flows from communities sold will have a minimal impact on our ability to fund future liquidity and capital resource needs. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements In addition to our investment interests in consolidated and unconsolidated real estate entities, we have certain off-balance sheet arrangements with the entities in which we invest. Additional discussion of these entities can be found in Note 6, Investments in Real Estate Entities, of our Consolidated Financial Statements located elsewhere in this report. CVP I, LLC has outstanding tax-exempt, variable rate bonds maturing in November 2036 in the amount of $117,000,000, which have permanent credit enhancement. We have agreed to guarantee, under limited circumstances, the repayment to the credit enhancer of any advances it may make in fulfillment of CVP I, LLC repayment obligations under the bonds . We have also guaranteed to the credit enhancer that CVP I, LLC will obtain a final certificate of occupancy for the project (Chrystie Place in New York City), which is expected in 2010. Our 80% partner in this venture has agreed that it will reimburse us its pro rata share of any amounts paid relative to these guaranteed obligations. The estimated fair value of and our obligation under these guarantees, both at inception and as of December 31, 2009, were not significant. As a result we have not recorded any obligation associated with these guarantees at December 31, 2009. Subsidiaries of Fund I have 21 loans secured by individual assets with amounts outstanding in the aggregate of $436,410,000, with varying maturity dates (or dates after which the loans can be prepaid), ranging from October 2011 to September 2016. These mortgage loans are secured by the underlying real estate. The mortgage loans are payable by the subsidiaries of Fund I with operating cash flow or disposition proceeds from the underlying real estate. We have not guaranteed the debt of Fund I, nor do we have any obligation to fund this debt should Fund I be unable to do so. In addition, as part of the formation of Fund I, we have provided to one of the limited partners a guarantee. The guarantee provides that if, upon final liquidation of Fund I, the total amount of all distributions to that partner during the life of Fund I (whether from operating cash flow or property sales) does not equal a minimum of the total capital contributions made by that partner, then we will pay the partner an amount equal to the shortfall, but in no event more than 10% of the total capital contributions made by the partner (maximum of approximately $7,500,000 as of December 31, 2009). As of December 31, 2009, the expected realizable value of the real estate assets owned by Fund I is considered adequate to cover such potential payment to that partner under the expected Fund I liquidation scenario. The estimated fair value of, and our obligation under this guarantee, both at inception and as of December 31, 2009 was not significant and therefore we have not recorded any obligation for this guarantee as of December 31, 2009. A subsidiary of Fund II has one loan secured by an asset in the amount of $21,515,000 with a maturity of June 2019. This loan is payable by the subsidiary of Fund II. As of December 31, 2009, Fund II also has $30,200,000 outstanding under a credit facility that matures in December 2010. The mortgage loan is payable by the subsidiary of Fund II with operating cash flow or disposition proceeds from the underlying real estate, and the credit facility is payable by Fund II and is secured by capital commitments. We have not guaranteed, beyond our proportionate share of capital commitments supporting the credit facility of Fund II, the debt of Fund II, nor do we have any obligation to fund this debt should Fund II be unable to do so. 53 In addition, as part of the formation of Fund II, we have provided to one of the limited partners a guarantee. The guarantee provides that if, upon final liquidation of Fund II, the total amount of all distributions to that partner during the life of Fund II (whether from operating cash flow or property sales) does not equal a minimum of the total capital contributions made by that partner, then we will pay the partner an amount equal to the shortfall, but in no event more than 10% of the total capital contributions made by the partner (maximum of approximately $1,470,000 as of December 31, 2009). As of December 31, 2009, the expected realizable value of the real estate assets owned by Fund II is considered adequate to cover such potential payment to that partner under the expected Fund II liquidation scenario. The estimated fair value of, and our obligation under this guarantee, both at inception and as of December 31, 2009 was not significant and therefore we have not recorded any obligation for this guarantee as of December 31, 2009. MVP I, LLC, the entity that owns Avalon at Mission Bay North II, has a loan secured by the underlying real estate assets of the community for $105,000,000. The loan is a fixed rate, interest-only note bearing interest at 6.02%, maturing in December 2015. We have not guaranteed the debt of MVP I, LLC, nor do we have any obligation to fund this debt should MVP I, LLC be unable to do so. Avalon Del Rey Apartments, LLC has a loan secured by the underlying real estate assets of the community for $45,943,000 maturing in April 2016. The variable rate loan had an interest rate of 3.69% at December 31, 2009. We have not guaranteed the debt of Avalon Del Rey Apartments, LLC, nor do we have any obligation to fund this debt should Avalon Del Rey Apartments, LLC be unable to do so. Aria at Hathorne Hill, LLC is a joint venture in which we have a non-managing member interest. The LLC is developing for-sale town homes in Danvers, Massachusetts. The LLC has three separate variable rate loans with aggregate borrowings of $2,432,000 and a weighted average interest rate of 4.19% at December 31, 2009. We have not guaranteed the debt of Aria at Hathorne, nor do we have any obligation to fund this debt should Aria at Hathorne be unable to do so. PHVP I, LLC, a consolidated joint venture in which we hold a 99.0% controlling interest, constructed a public garage adjacent to our Walnut Creek development. As part of the construction management services we provided to PHVP I, LLC for the construction of the public garage, we provided a construction completion guarantee to the related lender in order to fulfill their standard financing requirements related to the garage construction financing, which occurred in the third quarter of 2009. Our obligations under this guarantee therefore, have terminated and we have no further obligation under this agreement. In 2007 we entered into a non-cancelable commitment (the Commitment ) to acquire parcels of land in Brooklyn, New York for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $111,000,000. Under the terms of the Commitment, we are closing on the various parcels over a period determined by the seller ability to execute unrelated purchase transactions and achieve deferral of gains for the land sold under this Commitment. However, under no circumstances will the Commitment extend beyond 2011, at which time either we or the seller can compel execution of the remaining transactions. At December 31, 2009, we have an outstanding commitment to purchase the remaining land for approximately $51,500,000. There are no other lines of credit, side agreements, financial guarantees or any other derivative financial instruments related to or between our unconsolidated real estate entities and us. In evaluating our capital structure and overall leverage, management takes into consideration our proportionate share of this unconsolidated debt. Contractual Obligations In 2009, we entered into a lease agreement for office space in Arlington, Virginia. The office space will serve as our corporate headquarters, with relocation scheduled to occur in the first half of 2010. The lease has a ten year lease term, with extension rights, with rent of approximately $1,900,000 annually. We are marketing for lease or sale the building that serves as our current headquarters in Alexandria, Virginia. Aside from this lease, there have not been any other material changes outside of the ordinary course of business to our contractual obligations during 2009. 54 Scheduled contractual obligations required for the next five years and thereafter are as follows as of December 31, 2009 (dollars in thousands): Payments due by period Total Less than 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More than 5 Years Debt Obligations $ 3,977,320 $ 125,060 $ 754,761 $ 579,595 $ 2,517,904 Operating Lease Obligations (1) 3,412,947 20,732 50,815 53,850 3,287,550 Total $ 7,390,267 $ 145,792 $ 805,576 $ 633,445 $ 5,805,454 (1) Includes land leases expiring between October 2026 and March 2142. Amounts do not include any adjustment for purchase options available under the land leases. Inflation and Deflation Substantially all of our apartment leases are for a term of one year or less. In an inflationary environment, this may allow us to realize increased rents upon renewal of existing leases or the beginning of new leases. Short-term leases generally minimize our risk from the adverse effects of inflation, although these leases generally permit residents to leave at the end of the lease term and therefore expose us to the effect of a decline in market rents. In a deflationary rent environment, we may be exposed to declining rents more quickly under these shorter-term leases. Forward-Looking Statements This Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements as that term is defined under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You can identify forward-looking statements by our use of the words believe, expect, anticipate, intend, estimate, assume, project, plan, may, shall, will and other similar expressions in this Form 10-K, that predict or indicate future events and trends and that do not report historical matters. These statements include, among other things, statements regarding our intent, belief or expectations with respect to: our potential development, redevelopment, acquisition or disposition of communities; the timing and cost of completion of apartment communities under construction, reconstruction, development or redevelopment; the timing of lease-up, occupancy and stabilization of apartment communities; the pursuit of land on which we are considering future development; the anticipated operating performance of our communities; cost, yield, revenue, NOI and earnings estimates; our declaration or payment of distributions; our joint venture and discretionary fund activities; our policies regarding investments, indebtedness, acquisitions, dispositions, financings and other matters; our qualification as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code; the real estate markets in Northern and Southern California and markets in selected states in the Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, New England, Metro New York/New Jersey and Pacific Northwest regions of the United States and in general; the availability of debt and equity financing; interest rates; general economic conditions including the recent economic downturn; and trends affecting our financial condition or results of operations. We cannot assure the future results or outcome of the matters described in these statements; rather, these statements merely reflect our current expectations of the approximate outcomes of the matters discussed. In addition, these 55 forward-looking statements represent our estimates and assumptions only as of the date of this report. We do not undertake a duty to update these forward-looking statements, and therefore they may not represent our estimates and assumptions after the date of this report. You should not rely on forward-looking statements because they involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. These risks, uncertainties and other factors may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from the anticipated future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. In addition to the factors referred to below, you should carefully review the discussion under Item 1a., Risk Factors, in this document for a discussion of additional risks associated with our business and these forward-looking statements. Some of the factors that could cause our actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the following: we may fail to secure development opportunities due to an inability to reach agreements with third parties to obtain land at attractive prices or to obtain desired zoning and other local approvals; we may abandon or defer development opportunities for a number of reasons, including changes in local market conditions which make development less desirable, increases in costs of development, increases in the cost of capital or lack of capital availability, resulting in losses; construction costs of a community may exceed our original estimates; we may not complete construction and lease-up of communities under development or redevelopment on schedule, resulting in increased interest costs and construction costs and a decrease in our expected rental revenues; occupancy rates and market rents may be adversely affected by competition and local economic and market conditions which are beyond our control; financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all, and our cash flows from operations and access to cost effective capital may be insufficient for the development of our pipeline which could limit our pursuit of opportunities; our cash flows may be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest, and we may be unable to refinance existing indebtedness or the terms of such refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of existing indebtedness; we may be unsuccessful in our management of Fund I, Fund II or the REIT vehicles that are used with each respective Fund; and we may be unsuccessful in managing changes in our portfolio composition. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. If our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different, or different assumptions were made, it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied, resulting in different financial results or a different presentation of our financial statements. Below is a discussion of the accounting policies that we consider critical to an understanding of our financial condition and operating results that may require complex or significant judgment in their application or require estimates about matters which are inherently uncertain. A discussion of our significant accounting policies, including further discussion of the accounting policies described below, can be found in Note 1, Organization and Basis of Presentation of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Principles of Consolidation We may enter into various joint venture agreements with unrelated third parties to hold or develop real estate assets. We must determine for each of these ventures whether to consolidate the entity or account for our investment under the equity or cost basis of accounting. We determine whether to consolidate certain entities based on our rights and obligations under the joint venture agreements, applying the applicable accounting guidance. For investment interests that we do not consolidate, we 56 evaluate the guidance to determine the accounting framework to apply. The application of the rules in evaluating the accounting treatment for each joint venture is complex and requires substantial management judgment. Therefore, we believe the decision to choose an appropriate accounting framework is a critical accounting estimate. If we were to consolidate the joint ventures that we accounted for using the equity method at December 31, 2009, our assets would have increased by $1,030,260,000 and our liabilities would have increased by $778,156,000. We would be required to consolidate those joint ventures currently not consolidated for financial reporting purposes if the facts and circumstances changed, including but not limited to the following reasons, none of which are currently expected to occur: For entities not considered to be variable interest entities, the nature of the entity changed such that it would be considered a variable interest entity and if we were considered the primary beneficiary. For entities in which we do not hold a controlling voting and/or variable interest, the contractual arrangement changed resulting in our investment interest being either a controlling voting and/or variable interest. We evaluate our accounting for investments on a quarterly basis or when a significant change in the design of an entity occurs. Cost Capitalization We capitalize costs during the development of assets beginning when we determine that development of a future asset is probable until the asset, or a portion of the asset, is delivered and is ready for its intended use. For redevelopment efforts, we capitalize costs either (i) in advance of taking homes out of service when significant renovation of the common area has begun until the redevelopment is completed, or (ii) when an apartment home is taken out of service for redevelopment until the redevelopment is completed and the apartment home is available for a new resident. Rental income and operating expenses incurred during the initial lease-up or post-redevelopment lease-up period are fully recognized as they accrue. During the development and redevelopment efforts we capitalize all direct costs and indirect costs which have been incurred as a result of the development and redevelopment activities. These costs include interest and related loan fees, property taxes as well as other direct and indirect costs. Interest is capitalized for any project specific financing, as well as for general corporate financing to the extent of our aggregate investment in the projects. Indirect project costs, which include personnel and office and administrative costs that are clearly associated with our development and redevelopment efforts, are also capitalized. The estimation of the direct and indirect costs to capitalize as part of our development and redevelopment activities requires judgment and, as such, we believe cost capitalization to be a critical accounting estimate. There may be a change in our operating expenses in the event that there are changes in accounting guidance governing capitalization or changes to our levels of development or redevelopment activity. If changes in the accounting guidance limit our ability to capitalize costs or if we reduce our development and redevelopment activities without a corresponding decrease in indirect project costs, there may be an increase in our operating expenses. For example, if in 2009 our development activities decreased by 10%, and there were no corresponding decrease in our indirect project costs, our operating expenses would have increased by $2,493,200. We capitalize pre-development costs incurred in pursuit of Development Rights. These costs include legal fees, design fees and related overhead costs. Future development of these pursuits is dependent upon various factors, including zoning and regulatory approval, rental market conditions, construction costs and availability of capital. Pre-development costs incurred for pursuits for which future development is not yet considered probable are expensed as incurred. In addition, if the status of a Development Right changes, making future development no longer probable, any capitalized pre-development costs are written off with a charge to expense. Due to the subjectivity in determining whether a pursuit will result in the development of an apartment community, and therefore should be capitalized, the accounting for pursuit costs is a critical accounting estimate. If we had 57 determined that 10% of our capitalized pursuit costs were associated with Development Rights that were no longer probable of occurring, net income for the year ended December 31, 2009 would have decreased by $8,776,300. Abandoned Pursuit Costs & Asset Impairment We capitalize pre-development costs incurred in pursuit of new development opportunities for which we currently believe future development is probable. Future development of these Development Rights is dependent upon various factors, including zoning and regulatory approval, rental market conditions, construction costs and the availability of capital. Pre-development costs incurred for pursuits for which future development is not yet considered probable are expensed as incurred. In addition, if the status of a Development Right changes, making future development by us no longer probable, any capitalized pre-development costs are written off with a charge to expense. We expensed costs related to abandoned pursuits, which includes the abandonment of Development Rights and disposition pursuits, in the amounts of $5,842,000 in 2009 and $12,511,000 in 2008. These costs are included in operating expenses, excluding property taxes on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations and Other Comprehensive Income. Abandoned pursuit costs can vary greatly, and the costs incurred in any given period may be significantly different in future years. During 2009, we concluded that the continued economic downturn and the related decline in employment levels did not support the development and construction of certain new apartment communities that were previously in planning. This resulted in the recognition of an impairment charge of $20,302,000 related to the impairment of two land parcels which we currently do not intend to develop. We looked to third-party pricing estimates to determine the fair values of the land parcels considered to be impaired. Given the heterogeneous nature of multifamily real estate, the third party values incorporated significant other unobservable inputs and are therefore considered to be Level 3 prices in the fair value hierarchy. In addition, in 2009 we recognized a further impairment charge of $850,000 on a land parcel for which an earlier impairment had been recognized in the fourth quarter of 2008. The additional impairment charge reduces our carrying basis to its current estimated selling price less costs to dispose. Our focus on value creation through real estate development presents an impairment risk in the event of a future deterioration of the real estate and/or capital markets or a decision by us to reduce or cease development. We cannot predict the occurrence of future events that may cause an impairment assessment to be performed, or the likelihood of any future impairment charges, if any. You should also review Item 1a., Risk Factors of this Form 10-K. REIT Status We are a Maryland corporation that has elected to be treated, for federal income tax purposes, as a REIT. We elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Code for the year ended December 31, 1994 and have not revoked such election. A corporate REIT is a legal entity which holds real estate interests and must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that it currently distribute at least 90% of its adjusted taxable income to stockholders. As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to corporate level federal income tax on taxable income if we distribute 100% of taxable income to our stockholders over time periods allowed under the Code. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to federal and state income taxes at regular corporate rates (subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax) and may not be able to elect to qualify as a REIT for four subsequent taxable years. For example, if we failed to qualify as a REIT in 2009, our net income would have decreased by approximately $62,000,000. Our qualification as a REIT requires management to exercise significant judgment and consideration with respect to operational matters and accounting treatment. Therefore, we believe our REIT status is a critical accounting estimate.
