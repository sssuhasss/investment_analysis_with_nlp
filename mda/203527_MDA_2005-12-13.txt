Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview Solid demand for our new products for image guided radiation therapy, or IGRT, and stereotactic treatments and service contracts, together with a focus on execution and operational efficiency, enabled us to achieve excellent financial results in fiscal year 2005. Both of our business segments and the Other category contributed positively to the growth in annual net orders, revenues and operating margins. With the help of our gross margin improvements, our operating earnings for fiscal year 2005 increased by 19% from fiscal year 2004. During fiscal year 2005, we generated a record $252 million of cash flows from operations. We delivered a 33% return on equity, an increase of 5 percentage points from a 28% return on equity in fiscal year 2004. Oncology Systems. Our largest business segment is Oncology Systems, which produces, sells and services hardware and software products for treating cancer with radiation, including linear accelerators, treatment simulation and verification products, information management and treatment planning software and other sophisticated accessory products and services. Our products enable radiation oncology departments in hospitals and clinics to perform conventional radiotherapy treatments and offer the advanced treatment processes of intensity modulated radiation therapy, or IMRT, and IGRT. In our view, the fundamental market drivers for long-term growth in the radiation therapy and stereotactic radiosurgery markets continue to be the rising cancer incidence, underserved medical needs outside of the United States, technology advances that are leading to improvements in patient care, improvement in cost efficiency in delivering radiation therapy and customer demand for more advanced and effective treatments (such as IMRT, IGRT and stereotactic radiosurgery). Our focus in the Oncology Systems business segment is on advancing IGRT and IMRT technology and treatments. Adoption of our new IGRT technology was strong in fiscal year 2005, with an increasing percentage of orders for our high-energy Clinac accelerators including our on board imager, or OBI, and also our PortalVision accessory. As of the end of fiscal year 2005, more than 110 installations of our OBI for our high-energy Clinac accelerators and Trilogy medical linear accelerators were either complete or in progress. For fiscal year 2005, North American net orders rose 3% while international net orders grew by 29%. We also have seen a continued shift in our Oncology Systems business from North America to the international regions, with international net orders accounting for 47% of the total Oncology Systems net orders in fiscal year 2005, compared to 41% of the total Oncology Systems net orders in fiscal year 2004. We believe that the lower growth rate in North American Oncology Systems net orders in fiscal year 2005 over fiscal year 2004 was due to the continued slowdown in demand in North America for radiotherapy capital equipment, particularly equipment for IMRT. This slowdown came after several years of strong growth driven by rapid adoption of IMRT and as IMRT has become more of an established treatment methodology. Conversely, starting about three years ago, international regions entered a rapid adoption phase for IMRT technology and demand for radiation therapy equipment in international regions strongly increased after several years of slow growth. This appears to be consistent with a historical pattern where the international regions and North American region have different cycles of demand and technology adoption, with one growing rapidly while the other is in a relatively slow growth phase. Also, last year and earlier this year, after the introduction of our new products for IGRT, we noted some confusion about IGRT technology in the radiotherapy community and longer decision-making time periods as customers evaluated IGRT, all of which we believe contributed to the overall slowdown in the North American region. We believe now that hospitals and clinics are beginning to have a better understanding of IGRT and its potential for improving the outcomes and cost effectiveness of cancer care. Similar to what we have experienced with IMRT, we expect that IGRT will become one of the main 43 contributors to net orders and revenues growth in our Oncology Systems business segment in the coming years, with North America ahead of international regions in adoption rate. Our success in Oncology Systems largely depends upon our ability to retain leadership in technological innovation, the cost effectiveness of our products, the efficacy of our treatment technology and external economic influences. Factors affecting the adoption rate of new technologies such as IGRT could include our internal efficiency in design, documentation and testing, deployment and installation and the more-widely demonstrated efficacy of IGRT by early adopters. They may also include customer training, reimbursement and our ability to educate customers about the cost effectiveness of our new technology and clinical outcome advantages. External economic influences could include hospital financial strength in the United States, foreign currency exchange rates and governmental healthcare policies outside the United States. X-Ray Products. Our second business segment is X-ray Products, which manufactures and sells (i) X-ray tubes for use in a range of applications including computed tomography, or CT, scanning, radioscopic/fluoroscopic imaging, mammography, special procedures and industrial applications and (ii) flat panel imaging products (also commonly referred to as flat panel detectors) for digital X-ray image capture, which is an alternative to image intensifier tubes for fluoroscopy and X-ray film for radiography. We continue to view the fundamental growth driver for this component business to be the on-going success of key original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, that incorporate our X-ray tube products and flat panel detectors into their medical diagnostic and industrial imaging systems. Our flat panel detectors are being incorporated into next generation imaging equipment, including equipment for IGRT such as OBI, and for dental CT scanning and veterinary X-ray imaging. X-ray Products had an extremely good year in net orders, revenues and operating earnings growth in fiscal year 2005 compared to fiscal year 2004 due to significant growth in net orders, revenues and operating earnings of flat panel detectors. Other. The operations of the Ginzton Technology Center, or GTC, and BrachyTherapy are reported as part of the Other category of our Segment Information (see Note 15, Segment Information of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements within this Annual Report on Form 10-K). In fiscal year 2005, we continued to invest in developing technologies that enhance our current businesses or may lead to new business areas, including next generation digital X-ray imaging technology, volumetric and functional imaging, improved X-ray sources and technology for security and cargo screening applications. In addition, we are developing technologies and products that promise to improve disease management by more precise targeting of radiation, as well as by employing targeted energy and molecular agents to enhance the effectiveness and broaden the application of radiation therapy. GTC is also investigating the use of X-ray and high energy accelerator technology for security applications. Our BrachyTherapy operations manufacture, sell and service advanced brachytherapy products, which include treatment planning software, afterloaders and applicators. Our brachytherapy products are being used for partial breast irradiation and many other applications. In fiscal year 2005, we experienced significant revenue growth of brachtherapy products primarily attributable to increased sales of our high dose afterloader, or HDR product. This discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as the information contained under Factors Affecting Our Business in Item 1. We discuss our results of operations below. All figures given in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are based on actual reported results. Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of our financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, or GAAP, requires us to make estimates and 44 assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. We periodically review our accounting policies and estimates and make adjustments when facts and circumstances dictate. In addition to the accounting policies that are more fully described in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we consider the critical accounting policies described below to be affected by critical accounting estimates. Such accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments, assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements, and actual results could differ materially from these estimates. For a discussion of how these estimates and other factors may affect our business, also see Factors Affecting Our Business In Item 1. Revenue Recognition We frequently enter into sales arrangements with customers that contain multiple elements or deliverables such as hardware, software and services. Judgments as to the allocation of the proceeds received from an arrangement to the multiple elements of the arrangement, the determination of whether any undelivered elements are essential to the functionality of the delivered elements and the appropriate timing of revenue recognition are critical in respect to these arrangements to ensure compliance with GAAP. In addition, the amount of product revenues recognized is affected by our judgments as to whether objective and reliable evidence of fair value exists for hardware products and vendor-specific objective evidence of the fair value for software products in arrangements with multiple elements. Changes to the elements in an arrangement and the ability to establish objective and reliable evidence of fair value or vendor-specific objective evidence of the fair value for those elements could affect the timing of revenue recognition. Revenue recognition also depends on the timing of shipment and is subject to customer acceptance and the readiness of customers facilities. If shipments are not made on scheduled timelines or if the products are not accepted by the customer in a timely manner, our reported revenues may differ materially from expectations. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Credit evaluations are undertaken for all major sale transactions before shipment is authorized. Normal payment terms require payment of a small portion upon signing of the purchase order contract, a significant amount upon transfer of risk of loss and the remaining amount upon completion of the installation. On a quarterly basis, we evaluate aged items in the accounts receivable aging report and provide allowance in an amount we deem adequate for doubtful accounts. If our evaluation of our customers financial conditions does not reflect the future ability to collect outstanding receivables, additional provisions may be needed and our future operating results could be negatively impacted. Inventories Our inventories include high technology parts and components that may be specialized in nature or subject to rapid technological obsolescence. We have programs to minimize the required inventories on hand and we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and adjust for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on historical usage rates and our estimates of product demand and production. Actual demand may differ from our estimates, in which case we may have understated or overstated the provision required for obsolete and excess inventory, which would have an impact on our operating results. Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill is initially recorded when the purchase price paid for a business acquisition exceeds the estimated fair value of the net identified tangible and intangible assets acquired. The majority of companies we have acquired have not had significant identified tangible assets and, as a result, a significant portion of the 45 purchase price has been typically allocated to intangible assets and goodwill. Our future operating performance will be impacted by the future amortization of these acquired intangible assets and potential impairment charges related to goodwill if indicators of potential impairment exist. As a result of business acquisitions, the allocation of the purchase price to goodwill and intangible assets could have a significant impact on our future operating results. The allocation of the purchase price of the acquired companies to goodwill and intangible assets requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions, including estimates of future cash flows expected to be generated by the acquired assets and the appropriate discount rate for these cash flows. Should conditions be different from management current estimates, material write-downs of intangible assets and/or goodwill may be required, which would adversely affect our operating results. We will continue to make assessments of impairment on an annual basis in the fourth quarter of our fiscal years or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment arise. In fiscal years 2005 and 2004, we performed such evaluations and found no impairment. Warranty Obligations We warrant our products for a specific period of time, usually one year, against material defects. We provide for the estimated future costs of warranty obligations in cost of revenues when the related revenues are recognized. The accrued warranty costs represent our best estimate at the time of sale of the total costs that we will incur to repair or replace product parts that fail while still under warranty. The amount of accrued estimated warranty costs obligation for established products is primarily based on historical experience as to product failures adjusted for current information on repair costs. For new products, estimates will include historical experience of similar products, as well as reasonable allowance for start-up expenses. Actual warranty costs could differ from the estimated amounts. On a quarterly basis, we review the accrued balances of our warranty obligations and update the historical warranty cost trends. If we were required to accrue additional warranty cost in the future, it would negatively impact our operating results. Environmental Matters We are subject to a variety of environmental laws around the world regulating the handling, storage, transport and disposal of hazardous materials that do or may create increased costs for some of our operations. Environmental remediation liabilities are recorded when environmental assessments and/or remediation efforts are probable and the costs of these assessments or remediation efforts can be reasonably estimated, in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, and the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, or AICPA, Statement of Position 96-1, Environmental Remediation Liabilities. The accrued environmental costs represent our best estimate as to the total costs of remediation and the time period over which these costs will be incurred. On a quarterly basis, we review these accrued balances. If we were required to accrue additional environmental remediation costs in the future, it would negatively impact our operating results. Defined Benefit and Post-Retirement Benefit Plans We sponsor several defined benefit pension plans covering the employees who meet eligibility requirements. Several statistical and other factors that attempt to anticipate future events are used in calculating the expense and liability related to those plans for which the benefit is actuarially determined. These factors include assumptions about the discount rate, expected return on plan assets, rate of future compensation increases and healthcare cost increases, which we determined within certain guidelines. In addition, we also use subjective factors, such as withdrawal and mortality rates, to calculate the expense and liability. The actuarial assumptions we use are long-term assumptions and may differ materially from actual experience in the short-term due to changing market and economic conditions and changing 46 participant demographics. These differences may have a significant impact on the amount of pension expense we recorded. The expected rates of return on the various defined benefit pension plans assets are based on the asset allocation of each plan and the long-term projected return of those assets. The discount rate enables us to state expected future cash flows at a present value on the measurement date. The discount rates used for defined benefit plans in all countries other than Germany are based on high quality AA-rated corporate bonds with durations corresponding to the expected durations of the benefit obligations. The discount rate for the defined benefit plan in Germany was determined using fixed-income German government investments corresponding to the duration of the benefit obligations adjusted to take into account the difference between the yield curve on high quality corporate fixed-income investments and government fixed-income investment. A lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense. Taxes on Earnings We are subject to taxes on earnings in both the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. As a global taxpayer, significant judgments and estimates are required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for taxes on earnings. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves addressing uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the United States and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and interest may be due. These liabilities are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit. The provision for taxes on earnings includes the effect of changes to these liabilities that are considered appropriate. In addition, the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets assumes that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable earnings to fully utilize these deferred tax assets. Should we conclude it is more likely than not that we will be unable to recover our net deferred tax assets, our tax provision would increase in the period in which we make such a determination. Earnings derived from our international regions are generally taxed at rates lower than U.S. rates. The ability to maintain our current effective rate is contingent upon existing tax laws in both the United States and in the respective countries in which our international subsidiaries are located. In addition, a decrease in the percentage of our total earnings from our international regions, or a change in the mix of international regions among particular tax jurisdictions, could increase our effective tax rate. Also, our current effective tax rate does not assume U.S. taxes on undistributed profits of certain foreign subsidiaries. These earnings could become subject to incremental foreign withholding or U.S. federal and state taxes should they either be deemed or actually remitted to the United States. Results of Operations Fiscal Year Our fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period ending on the Friday nearest September 30. Fiscal year 2005 comprised the 52-week period ended on September 30, 2005. Fiscal year 2004 was the 53-week period ended on October 1, 2004 and fiscal year 2003 was the 52-week period ended on September 26, 2003. On June 14, 2004, our Board of Directors declared a two-for-one stock split in the form of a 100% stock dividend. The distribution of the shares was made on July 30, 2004 to stockholders of record as of June 30, 2004. Unless otherwise stated, all references to the number of shares and per share amounts of our common stock have been retroactively restated to reflect the increased number of shares resulting from the two-for-one split. 47 Discussion of Financial Data for Fiscal Years ended 2005, 2004 and 2003 Total Revenues Revenues by sales classification Fiscal Years (Dollars in millions) 2005 % Change 2004 % Change 2003 Product $ 1,162 10 % $ 1,059 17 % $ 908 Service Contracts and Other 221 25 % 177 32 % 134 Total Revenues $ 1,383 12 % $ 1,236 19 % $ 1,042 Product as a percentage of total revenues 84 % 86 % 87 % Service Contracts and Other as a percentage of total revenues 16 % 14 % 13 % Revenues by region North America $ 730 5 % $ 693 11 % $ 625 Europe 385 20 % 319 35 % 236 Asia 208 16 % 179 19 % 151 Rest of world 60 35 % 45 46 % 30 Total International (1) 653 20 % 543 30 % 417 Total $ 1,383 12 % $ 1,236 19 % $ 1,042 North America as a percentage of total revenues 53 % 56 % 60 % International as a percentage of total revenues 47 % 44 % 40 % (1) We consider international revenues to be revenues outside of North America. Total revenues increased in fiscal year 2005 over fiscal year 2004 and fiscal year 2004 over fiscal year 2003 due primarily to the increases in Oncology Systems revenues in each of those years, although X-ray Products business segment and Other category also contributed to the increases. However, total revenue growth in fiscal year 2005 from fiscal year 2004 was less than the growth (both in absolute dollars and percentage growth) in fiscal year 2004 from fiscal year 2003, principally due to the slowdown in product revenue growth in Oncology Systems. This slowdown was offset in part by strong X-ray Products revenue growth which contributed appreciably more revenue growth in fiscal year 2005 than in fiscal year 2004. Increased service contracts and other revenues also contributed to the increase in total revenues, with the amount of the service contracts and other revenues increasing in fiscal year 2005 greater than in fiscal year 2004 (though lesser on a percentage of total revenues basis due to the higher total revenues in fiscal year 2005 as compared to fiscal year 2004). Oncology Systems service contracts revenues continued to comprise the vast bulk of total service contracts and other revenues, as well as being the primary contributor to the increase in total service and other revenues, in each of fiscal years 2005 and 2004. Oncology Systems also was the primary contributor to the increases in international revenues in fiscal years 2005 and 2004. The shift in international revenues and service contracts revenues as a greater percentage of total revenues is reflective of similar shifts in the Oncology Systems business segment, with international Oncology Systems revenues and service contracts revenues becoming a greater percentage of Oncology Systems revenues over the same time period. 48 Oncology Systems Revenues Revenues by sales classification Fiscal Years (Dollars in millions) 2005 % Change 2004 % Change 2003 Product $ 933 8 % $ 867 18 % $ 732 Service Contracts 206 26 % 164 32 % 124 Total Oncology Systems $ 1,139 10 % $ 1,031 20 % $ 856 Product as a percentage of Oncology Systems revenues 82 % 84 % 86 % Service Contracts as a percentage of Oncology Systems revenues 18 % 16 % 14 % Oncology Systems revenues as a percentage of total revenues 82 % 84 % 82 % The majority of the growth in total revenues for Oncology Systems business segment in fiscal year 2005 over fiscal year 2004 came from increased product revenues. However, total Oncology Systems revenues grew appreciably less in fiscal year 2005 over fiscal year 2004 than in fiscal year 2004 over fiscal year 2003 due primarily to the continued slowdown in the product revenue growth of Oncology Systems in North America as discussed in the Overview section of this MD&A. The increase from Oncology Systems product revenues from fiscal year 2004 to fiscal year 2005 was primarily driven by higher sales volumes of our new accessory products that enable IGRT, including our OBI and PortalVision products, which was stronger in the second half of the fiscal year. In addition, higher sales volume of our core products, including the Trilogy accelerators, contributed to a significant portion of Oncology Systems product revenues growth. Service contracts revenues grew faster than product revenues for fiscal years 2005 and 2004. Service contracts revenues increased in fiscal year 2005 over fiscal year 2004 primarily due to the increase in sophistication of our products and the success of our software products which generate annual maintenance contracts and renewals. Oncology Systems product revenues increased in fiscal years 2004 from fiscal year 2003 due to the demand for and rapid adoption rate of our IMRT-related products. Additionally, the relatively weak U.S. dollar made our pricing more competitive with our foreign competitors in the international regions. The increase in service contracts revenues for fiscal year 2004 over fiscal year 2003 was due to a combination of factors, including growth in the installed base of our products and the increase in sophistication of our products (particularly software products which generate maintenance contracts). The acquisition of the radiotherapy equipment service business of Mitsubishi Electric Co. in Japan in fiscal year 2004 also contributed to the increase in service contracts revenues. Revenues by region Fiscal Years (Dollars in millions) 2005 % Change 2004 % Change 2003 North America $ 628 3 % $ 611 11 % $ 548 Europe 343 20 % 286 37 % 209 Asia 119 24 % 96 26 % 76 Rest of world 49 31 % 38 68 % 23 Total International 511 22 % 420 37 % 308 Total Oncology Systems $ 1,139 10 % $ 1,031 20 % $ 856 North America as a percentage of Oncology Systems revenues 55 % 59 % 64 % International as a percentage of Oncology Systems revenues 45 % 41 % 36 % 49 Although all of our geographic regions contributed to the increase in Oncology Systems revenues for fiscal years 2005 and 2004, our revenues from North American Oncology Systems grew modestly at 3% in fiscal year 2005, compared with 11%, 18% and 32% in fiscal years 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. We believe that the rapid adoption rate of IMRT was the primary driver for the strong revenue growth in the earlier periods. Similarly, as IMRT has become more of an established treatment technology, we experienced the inevitable lower growth rate in the market for radiotherapy capital equipment, particularly equipment for IMRT as discussed in the Overview section of this MD&A. On the other hand, international revenues continued its strong growth rates of 22%, 37% and 19% in fiscal years 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, when compared with the respective prior fiscal years after a year of negative growth rate of (1%) in fiscal year 2002 over fiscal year 2001. Strong demand internationally started about three years ago primarily driven by the underserved markets in the international regions and the increase in adoption rate of IMRT by our international customers, similar to what we had seen in North America several years ago. The growth in international revenues in fiscal year 2005 over fiscal year 2004 was also due in part to (i) increased service revenues from the radiotherapy equipment service business of Mitsubishi Electric Co. in Japan, (ii) the acquisition of Sigma Micro Informatique Conseil, or Sigma Micro, in January 2005 that added to our European revenues, and to a lesser extent (iii) the continuing weakness of the U.S. dollar for most of fiscal year 2005 that effectively made our pricing more competitive with our foreign competitors. The growth in international revenues in fiscal year 2004 over fiscal year 2003 was due in part to factors such as (i) the relatively weak U.S. dollar that effectively made our pricing more competitive with our foreign competitors and (ii) the acquisition of the radiotherapy equipment service business of Mitsubishi Electric Co. in Japan in February 2004. The decrease in revenues growth rate for North America and the continuously strong revenue growth rate for our international regions are consistent with the orders growth patterns, and were due to the same factors, as discussed more fully in the Net Orders section of this MD&A. X-ray Products Revenues Revenues by region Fiscal Years (Dollars in millions) 2005 % Change 2004 % Change 2003 North America $ 74 29 % $ 57 3 % $ 56 Europe 27 26 % 22 10 % 20 Asia 88 7 % 82 12 % 73 Rest of world 6 38 % 4 9 % 4 Total International 121 12 % 108 11 % 97 Total X-ray Products $ 195 18 % $ 165 8 % $ 153 As a percentage of total revenues 14 % 13 % 15 % X-ray Products revenues increased 18% in fiscal year 2005 compared to fiscal year 2004 exceeding our expectation of long term growth rates for the X-ray Products business segment in the 5% to 10% range. All of our geographic regions contributed to the increase in X-ray Products revenues for fiscal years 2005 and 2004. The unusually strong growth in X-ray Products revenues in fiscal year 2005 over fiscal year 2004 was primarily driven by higher sales volume of our flat panel detectors in North America, as well as increased sales volume of our high power, anode grounded CT scanning tubes from primarily one OEM customer. The 8% increase in X-ray Products revenues for fiscal year 2004 over fiscal year 2003 was attributable to the continuing demand by our largest OEM customers for our high power, anode grounded CT scanning tube and to a lesser extent to increased revenues from our flat panel detectors with a second major OEM beginning to purchase our flat panel detectors in the second half of fiscal year 2004. 50 Other Revenues Revenues by sales classification Fiscal Years (Dollars in millions) 2005 % Change 2004 % Change 2003 Product $ 34 27 % $ 27 16 % $ 23 Service Contracts and Other 15 15 % 13 28 % 10 Total Other $ 49 23 % $ 40 20 % $ 33 As a percentage of total revenues 4 % 3 % 3 % For our Other category, which is comprised of GTC and our BrachyTherapy operations, the increase in revenues for fiscal year 2005 over fiscal year 2004 was driven exclusively by the BrachyTherapy business. Higher sales volume of HDR afterloaders for accelerated breast treatments in North America and Europe was the primary driver for the growth in the brachytherapy business. The increase in revenues for fiscal year 2004 compared to fiscal year 2003 was due almost exclusively to BrachyTherapy. The increases in service contracts and other revenues for fiscal years 2005 and 2004 were due in part to the growth in the installed base of our brachytherapy products and increased sales of service maintenance contracts of brachytherapy treatment planning software. Gross Margin Fiscal Years (Dollars in millions) 2005 % Change 2004 % Change 2003 (As Adjusted) (As Adjusted) Dollar by segment Oncology Systems $ 500 13 % $ 443 26 % $ 351 X-ray Products 67 19 % 56 5 % 54 Other 26 37 % 19 20 % 16 Gross margin 593 14 % 518 23 % 421 Percentage by segment Oncology Systems 43.9 % 43.0 % 41.1 % X-ray Products 34.6 % 34.3 % 35.3 % Total Company 42.9 % 41.9 % 40.4 % Both of our business segments and the Other category contributed to the 1 percentage point increase in total gross margin from fiscal years 2004 to 2005, although the increase in total gross margins was primarily due to the increase in the Oncology Systems gross margin. Total gross margin of 42.9% is the highest achieved annual gross margin since we became a standalone medical systems company in 1999. Our total gross margin increased by 1.5 percentage points from fiscal years 2003 to 2004 due primarily to a higher Oncology Systems gross margin offset partially by a lower X-ray Products gross margin. Total product gross margin was 43.0% in fiscal year 2005, compared to 42.9% and 41.5% in fiscal years 2004 and 2003, respectively. Total service contracts and other gross margin was 42.2% in fiscal year 2005, compared to 36.3% and 33.4% in fiscal years 2004 and 2003, respectively. Oncology Systems gross margin continued to improve and increased 0.9 percentage point from fiscal years 2004 to 2005. Oncology Systems product gross margin increased slightly to 44.3% in fiscal year 2005 from 44.2% in fiscal year 2004 due primarily to higher average selling price, lower product costs, lower warranty costs as a result of improved product engineering and design and partially offset by continuing shift to lower margin international revenues. Service contracts gross margin in Oncology Systems continued to show strong performance and increased significantly to 42.4% in fiscal year 2005 compared to 36.3% in 51 fiscal year 2004 due primarily to higher volumes and growth in higher margin software maintenance contracts in Oncology Systems. The increase of 1.9 percentage points in Oncology Systems gross margin for fiscal year 2004 from fiscal year 2003 resulted from severalfactors including higher sales volume yielding lower average product costs, improvements in service margins (partly reflecting the growth in higher margin software maintenance contracts), product mix shift towards accessory and other products for IMRT and higher amount of product acceptance revenues in fiscal year 2004 versus fiscal year 2003, all of which more than offset the shift in geographic mix for sales towards international regions, which typically have lower margins. X-ray Products gross margin in fiscal year 2005 increased slightly at 0.3 percentage point from fiscal year 2004 due to significant gross margin gains from the increasing sales volume of our flat panel detectors, partially offset by higher raw material costs and manufacturing costs associated with new X-ray tube types. We believe that the flat panel detectors, which have significantly higher gross margin than that of X-ray tube products, should contribute to higher total gross margin for this segment as the flat panel imaging business becomes a bigger part of the total X-ray Products business over time. The decline in X-ray Products gross margin for fiscal year 2004 over fiscal year 2003 was due to a combination of increased warranty costs for an existing tube product that we sell exclusively to one OEM and start-up costs for a new tube product. Research and Development Fiscal Years (Dollars in millions) 2005 % Change 2004 % Change 2003 Research and development $ 82 14 % $ 72 22 % $ 59 As a percentage of total revenues 6 % 6 % 6 % Our research and development expenses have remained in-line with our revenue growth. The increase in absolute dollars in research and development expenses for fiscal year 2005 was primarily driven by increased spending of $9.1 million in Oncology Systems. Our research and development efforts in Oncology Systems in fiscal year 2005 have been focused on the development of next generation products and accessories, specifically our next generation linear accelerator, promising technologies for cancer care imaging, and other technologies such as our Monte Carlo and dose calculation algorithms for our treatment planning software products and our new electronic health records within our VARiS information management software, as well as software projects related to Sigma Micro. We anticipate that we will continue to devote significant resources to research and development in the future. The increase in absolute dollars in research and development expenses in Oncology Systems for fiscal year 2005 compared to fiscal year 2004 was attributable primarily to: a) increased employee headcount, materials costs and consulting expenses of $6.1 million in total; b) increased expenses of $1.0 million related to the new projects from our recent acquisition of Sigma Micro; and c) increased expenses of $1.0 million resulting from the relatively weak U.S. dollar for our foreign operations as the research and development expenses are translated into U.S. dollars. The increase in absolute dollars in research and development expenses for fiscal year 2004 from fiscal year 2003 was primarily attributable to increased spending of $11.3 million in Oncology Systems. The increase in absolute dollars in research and development expenses for fiscal year 2004 compared to fiscal year 2003 was attributable primarily to: a) increased employee headcount, materials costs and consulting expenses of $7.7 million in total; b) increased expenses of $1.9 million related to the new projects from our recent acquisitions; and c) increased expenses of $1.7 million related to research grants. 52 Selling, General and Administrative Fiscal Years (Dollars in millions) 2005 % Change 2004 % Change 2003 Selling, general and administrative $ 206 9 % $ 189 15 % $ 164 As a percentage of total revenues 15 % 15 % 16 % Despite incurring approximately $5 million to comply with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we reduced selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues by about one half percentage point to 15% in fiscal year 2005 compared to fiscal year 2004. The increase in absolute dollars in selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal year 2005 compared to fiscal year 2004 was attributable primarily to: a) increased employee-related expenses of $13.8 million resulting from an increase in employee headcount in Oncology Systems, corporate headquarters and X-ray Products to support our growing business activities; b) increased incremental expenses of $4.5 million related to compliance with the required documentation and testing of internal control over financial reporting as mandated by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002; c) increased operating expenses of $2.9 million related to acquisitions; d) increased expenses of $2.6 million related to our information systems and e) increased expenses of $1.8 million resulting from the relatively weak U.S. dollar for our foreign operations as the selling, general and administrative expenses are translated into U.S. dollars. These increases were partially offset by (i) decreased employee-related expenses of $6.8 million for employee and management incentive plans; (ii) increased income on equity investment in dpiX Holding of $3.4 million and (iii) decreased fees of $2.6 million related to certain commission arrangements. The increase in absolute dollars in selling, general and administrative expenses, although lower as a percentage of total revenues for fiscal year 2004 compared to fiscal year 2003 was attributable primarily to: a) increased employee-related expenses of $9.5 million resulting from an increase in employee headcount in Oncology Systems and corporate headquarters to support our growing business activities; b) increased operating expenses of $8.5 million related to our acquisitions of Zmed, Inc., the Mitsubishi Electric Co. radiotherapy equipment service business and the OpTx Corporation business; and c) increased expenses of $4.0 million resulting from the relatively weak U.S. dollar for our foreign operations as the selling, general and administrative expenses are translated into U.S. dollars. Interest Income, Net Fiscal Years (Dollars in millions) 2005 % Change 2004 % Change 2003 Interest income, net $ 3.4 157 % $ 1.3 (57 )% $ 3.0 The increase in interest income, net in fiscal year 2005 compared to fiscal year 2004 was attributable to increase in interest rates in fiscal year 2005 over fiscal year 2004, partly offset by decreases in the levels of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities between fiscal years 2004 and 2005. The decline in interest income, net in fiscal year 2004 compared to fiscal year 2003 was primarily attributable to a one-time state income tax refund which contained an interest component of $0.8 million that was received in fiscal year 2003, as well as decreases in the levels of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and interest rates between the fiscal years 2003 and 2004. Taxes on Earnings Fiscal Years 2005 Change 2004 Change 2003 Effective tax rate 33 % (2 )% 35 % 35 % 53 The decrease in effective tax rate in fiscal year 2005 from fiscal year 2004 was primarily due to a shift of earnings towards countries with lower statutory rates. The effective tax rate in fiscal year 2004 was the same as in fiscal year 2003. In general, our effective income tax rate differs from the statutory rates largely as a function of benefits realized from foreign taxes, the extraterritorial income exclusion and research and development credit. Our future effective tax rate could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates. Earnings Per Diluted Share Fiscal Years 2005 % Change 2004 % Change 2003 Earnings per diluted share $ 1.50 27 % $ 1.18 28 % $ 0.92 The increase in earnings per diluted share in fiscal year 2005 from fiscal year 2004 can be attributed to the increase in total revenues, improvements in gross margins, the reduction in effective tax rate and the reduction in outstanding shares of common stock due to stock repurchases. The increase in earnings per diluted share in fiscal year 2004 from fiscal year 2003 can be attributed to the increase in total revenues, improvements in gross margins and slower growth in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues between the two fiscal years. Net Orders Total Net Orders (by segment and region) Fiscal Years (Dollars in millions) 2005 % Change 2004 % Change 2003 Oncology Systems: North America $ 710 3 % $ 687 10 % $ 623 Total International 625 29 % 484 37 % 354 Total Oncology Systems $ 1,335 14 % $ 1,171 20 % $ 977 X-ray Products: North America $ 76 28 % $ 59 49 % $ 40 Total International 128 3 % 125 22 % 102 Total X-ray Products $ 204 11 % $ 184 30 % $ 142 Other: $ 52 20 % $ 43 32 % $ 33 Total Net Orders $ 1,591 14 % $ 1,398 21 % $ 1,152 The increase in our total net orders for fiscal year 2005 over fiscal year 2004 was primarily due to the 14% increase in Oncology Systems net orders. While our North American Oncology Systems net orders grew modestly at 3% in fiscal year 2005 over fiscal year 2004, our international Oncology Systems net orders continued to show strong growth at 29% in fiscal year 2005 over fiscal year 2004. We also have seen a continued shift in our Oncology Systems business from North America to the international regions, with international net orders accounting for 47% of the total Oncology Systems net orders in fiscal year 2005, compared to 41% of the total Oncology Systems net orders in fiscal year 2004. We believe that the lower growth rate in North American Oncology Systems net orders in fiscal year 2005 over fiscal year 2004 was due to the continued slowdown in demand in North America for radiotherapy capital equipment, particularly equipment for IMRT. This slowdown came after several years of strong growth driven by rapid adoption of IMRT and as IMRT has become more of an established treatment methodology. Conversely, starting about three years ago, international regions entered a rapid adoption phase for IMRT technology 54 and demand for radiation therapy equipment in international regions strongly increased after several years of slow growth. This appears to be consistent with a historical pattern where the international regions and North American region have different cycles of demand and technology adoption, with one growing rapidly while the other is in a relatively slow growth phase. Also, last year and earlier this year, after the introduction of our new products for IGRT, we noted some confusion about IGRT technology in the radiotherapy community and longer decision-making time periods as customers evaluated IGRT, all of which we believe contributed to the overall slowdown in the North American region. We believe now that hospitals and clinics are beginning to have a better understanding of IGRT and its potential for improving the outcomes and cost effectiveness of cancer care. Similar to what we have experienced with IMRT, we expect that IGRT will become one of the main contributors to net orders and revenues growth in our Oncology Systems business segment in the coming years, with North America ahead of international regions in the timing of adoption. We continue to believe that the Oncology Systems business segment can sustain global long-term growth of 10% to 15% a year due to fundamental market factors for growth in the radiation therapy market that we believe have remained unchanged. In any given period, however, orders growth in either North America or international regions, or both, could be outside of this range. The actual timing of sales and revenue recognition will vary significantly based on the delivery requirements of individual orders and the readiness of individual customer sites for installation of our products and are usually shorter for some types of orders, such as upgrades (i.e., the addition of new features or accessories to existing equipment). Thus, orders in any quarter or period are not necessarily directly correlated to the level of sales or revenues in any particular future quarter or period. Moreover, as the overall mix of net orders includes a greater proportion of software products and newly introduced Oncology Systems products, which typically have longer time from order to completion of installation, and a higher percentage of our overall Oncology Systems business coming from international regions, which typically have a longer period from shipment to revenue recognition, the average time period within which orders convert into sales could lengthen. In fact, our Oncology Systems net orders and backlog grew substantially more than our revenues for fiscal years 2005 and 2004 and we estimate that the average time of orders in backlog has increased by about three months. X-ray Products have relatively short turn around from net orders to shipments. X-ray Products net orders increased for fiscal year 2005 compared to fiscal year 2004 due to continuing strong demand for our high power, anode grounded CT scanning tubes and robust demand for our flat panel detectors. After years of investment in flat panel technology, the flat panel product line is showing signs of becoming a significant contributor to our X-ray Products business segment. As the flat panel imaging business becomes a more significant part of the total X-ray Products business over time and as the demand for CT scanning tubes continues to have solid growth, we expect the long-term growth rates for X-ray Products business to increase by 5 percentage points to the 5% to 10% range. Backlog At September 30, 2005, we had a backlog of $1.2 billion, an increase of 21% compared to October 1, 2004. Our Oncology Systems backlog at September 30, 2005 increased by 22% from October 1, 2004, including a 14% increase for North America and a 33% increase for international regions. Fiscal Year 2006 Outlook Total Revenues: We expect that total revenues for fiscal year 2006 should increase by about 14% over the total for fiscal year 2005. Net Earnings Per Diluted Share: For fiscal year 2006, we anticipate that net earnings per diluted share should be in the range of $1.54 to $1.57. We expect that the annual impact of expensing stock options in 55 fiscal year 2006 will be between $0.19 and $0.22 per diluted share. Excluding the impact of expensing stock options, growth in net earnings per diluted share should be in the range of 16% to 18% for fiscal year 2006 over the comparable fiscal year 2005. Taxes on Earnings: For fiscal year 2006, we estimate that our effective tax rate for the full year will be approximately 33%. However, there may be variability in the quarterly tax rates should discrete items, such as settlement of a tax audit, arise. Our future effective tax rate depends on various factors, such as tax legislation, the geographic composition of our pre-tax earnings, research and development credits and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies. Net orders, Backlog and Fiscal year 2006 Outlook contain forward-looking statements and projections that are subject to the factors, risks and uncertainties set forth or referred to this MD&A and under Factors Affecting Our Business included in Item 1. Actual results and the outcome or timing of certain events may differ significantly. Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity is the measurement of our ability to meet potential cash requirements, including ongoing commitments to repay borrowings, acquire businesses and fund continuing operations. Our sources of cash include operations, stock option exercises and employee stock purchases, borrowings and interest income. Our cash usage is actively managed on a daily basis to ensure the maintenance of sufficient funds to meet our needs. Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities The following table summarizes our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities: (In millions) September 30, 2005 October 1, 2004 Increase/ (Decrease) (As Adjusted) Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities: Cash and cash equivalents $ 243 $ 133 $ 110 Marketable securities 139 260 (121 ) Total $ 382 $ 393 $ (11 ) The net decrease in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities during fiscal year 2005 was primarily a result of using cash and cash proceeds from maturities of marketable securities for the repurchase of common stock of $227 million, capital expenditures of $44 million, acquisition of business of $12 million, contribution of $8 million to the trust assets of our deferred compensation plan, which invests in corporate-owned life insurance contracts, repayments on bank borrowings of $5 million and advances of loans of $4 million. Cash provided by operating activities of $252 million and cash provided by the issuance of common stock of $38 million related to stock option exercises and employee stock purchases significantly offset these uses. At September 30, 2005, we had approximately $183 million or 48% of total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities in the United States. On the other hand, approximately $199 million or 52% of total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities was held abroad and could be subject to additional taxation if it was repatriated to the United States. We have not yet completed our evaluation of the impact of the repatriation provisions in the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, or the Jobs Creation Act. Based on our analysis to date, however, it is reasonably possible that we may repatriate up to $175 million, with the respective tax liability of up to $16 million. We currently expect to be in a position to finalize our assessment by the second quarter of fiscal year 2006. 56 Cash Flows Fiscal Years (In millions) 2005 2004 2003 (As Adjusted) (As Adjusted) Net cash flow provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 252 $ 234 $ 210 Investing activities 52 (36 ) (121 ) Financing activities (195 ) (142 ) (69 ) Effects of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 1 (3 ) (7 ) Net increase in cash and cash equivalents $ 110 $ 53 $ 13 Our primary cash inflows and outflows for fiscal years 2005, 2004 and 2003 were as follows: We generated net cash from operating activities of $252 million in fiscal year 2005, compared to $234 million and $210 million in fiscal years 2004 and 2003, respectively. The $18 million increase in cash flow from operating activities from fiscal years 2004 to 2005 was primarily driven by an increase in net earnings of $39 million, partially offset by a net decrease of $13 million in non-cash items, net, due primarily to the decrease in tax benefits from employee stock option exercises and a net change of approximately $8 million in operating assets and liabilities (working capital items). The major contributors to the change in working capital items in fiscal year 2005 over fiscal year 2004 were accounts receivable, accrued expenses and inventory. Accounts receivable and inventory increased primarily due to the continuing shift to a higher proportion of international deliveries, which typically have a longer collection cycle than North America and a longer period from shipment to cost recognition. The increase in inventories was also due to anticipated customer demands for both Oncology Systems and X-ray Products. Accrued expenses increased primarily due to an increase in deferred revenues and partially offset by a decrease in other accrued liabilities. The increase in deferred revenues resulted from increasing revenue recognition deferrals related to timing of completion of installation of our software products and our growing sales of new products, as well as the higher international proportion of our Oncology Systems business with the accompanying longer period from shipment to revenue recognition. The $24 million increase in net cash from operating activities from fiscal years 2003 to 2004 was a result of an increase in net earnings of $37 million and an increase in the tax benefit from employee stock options of $6 million, partially offset by the change in working capital and non-cash items, net, of $19 million. The major contributors to the change in working capital items in fiscal year 2004 over fiscal year 2003 were accounts receivable, accrued expenses, inventory and advance payments from customers. Accounts receivable increased primarily due to higher revenues in fiscal year 2004. The increase in inventories was primarily driven by inventories from our acquisitions and anticipated higher customer demands. Accrued expenses increased primarily due to an increase in accrued income taxes, which resulted from higher earnings in fiscal year 2004 compared to fiscal year 2003 and lower estimated tax payments for fiscal year 2004. Advance payments from customers increased due to more down payments received for increased orders in fiscal years 2004 over 2003. We expect that cash provided by operating activities may fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors, including fluctuations in our operating results, timing of product shipments, accounts receivable collections, inventory management, and the timing of tax and other payments. For additional discussion, see Factors Affecting our Business in Item 1. Investing activities provided $52 million of net cash in fiscal year 2005, compared to $36 million and $121 million of net cash used in fiscal years 2004 and 2003, respectively. Our net proceeds from maturities of marketable securities were $121 million and $67 million during fiscal years 2005 and 2004, respectively, compared to net purchases of marketable securities of $97 million during fiscal 57 year 2003. We used $12 million of net cash for the purchase of businesses during fiscal year 2005 compared to $72 million during fiscal year 2004 and less than $1 million in fiscal year 2003. Financing activities used net cash of $195 million in fiscal year 2005 compared to $142 million and $69 million in fiscal years 2004 and 2003, respectively. In fiscal year 2005, we used $227 million for repurchases of common stock and $5 million for repayment of bank borrowings and received proceeds of $38 million from stock option exercises and employee stock purchases. In fiscal year 2004, we used $202 million for repurchases of common stock and received $46 million in proceeds from stock option exercises and employee stock purchases. In fiscal year 2003, we used $105 million for repurchases of common stock and received $37 million in proceeds from stock option exercises and employee stock purchases. We expect our capital expenditures, which typically represent construction and/or purchases of facilities, manufacturing equipment, office equipment and furniture and fixtures, to be approximately 4.5% of revenues in fiscal year 2006. Our liquidity is affected by many factors, some of which are based on the normal ongoing operations of our business and some of which arise from uncertainties and conditions in the United States and global economies. Although our cash requirements will fluctuate as a result of the shifting influences of these factors, we believe that existing cash and cash equivalents and cash to be generated from operations will be sufficient to satisfy anticipated commitments for capital expenditures and other cash requirements through fiscal year 2006. We currently anticipate that we will continue to utilize our strong liquidity and cash flows from operations to repurchase our common stock, make strategic acquisitions, invest in the growth of our business and invest in systems and processes. Days Sales Outstanding Trade accounts receivable days sales outstanding, or DSO, were 82 days at September 30, 2005, compared to 74 days at October 1, 2004. Our accounts receivable and DSO are primarily impacted by timing of product shipments, collections performance and payment terms. The increase in DSO for fiscal year 2005 over fiscal year 2004 was related to our growing sales of new products and the continuing shift to a higher proportion of international sales, which typically have a longer collection cycle than North America, and slower collections performance for Oncology Systems in North America. Over the long-term, we expect our DSO to be around 80 days. Stock Repurchase Program On February 14, 2003, our Board of Directors authorized a repurchase of up to two million shares (on a pre-July 30, 2004 stock split basis) of our common stock through February 29, 2004. On November 12, 2003, our Board of Directors authorized an additional repurchase of up to three million shares (on a pre-July 30, 2004 stock split basis) of our common stock over the period through August 31, 2005. On November 19, 2004, our Board of Directors announced a further repurchase of up to six million shares of our common stock through December 31, 2005. During fiscal years 2005, 2004 and 2003, we paid $227 million, $202 million and $105 million, respectively, to repurchase 5,960,000 shares, 5,576,000 shares and 3,969,200 shares, respectively, of our common stock. All shares that have been repurchased have been retired. As of September 30, 2005, we could still repurchase up to an additional 1,500,000 shares of our common stock under the November 19, 2004 authorization. This authorization will expire on December 31, 2005 on any remaining shares of common stock not repurchased. 58 Contractual Obligations The following summarizes our contractual obligations as of September 30, 2005 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods: Payments Due By Period (In millions) Fiscal Year 2006 Fiscal Years 2007 - 2008 Fiscal Years 2009 - 2010 Beyond Total Long term debt(1) $ 2.7 $ 16.9 $ 17.0 $ 23.4 $ 60.0 Interest obligation on long term debt 4.0 7.1 4.7 3.1 18.9 Operating Leases(2) 13.5 15.0 9.6 10.2 48.3 Mandatorily redeemable instrument(3) 12.5 12.5 Total $ 20.2 $ 51.5 $ 31.3 $ 36.7 $ 139.7 (1) At September 30, 2005, we had $60 million of long-term debt. Long-term debt, including current maturities, increased $1.5 million from October 1, 2004 due to $6.8 million loans assumed through purchases of land and buildings in Las Vegas, offset by principal repayment of $5.3 million debt. The fixed interest rates on the outstanding debt on this date ranged from 6.70% to 7.58% with a weighted average interest rate of 6.89%. The unsecured term loans of the long term debt currently contain a covenant that requires us to pay prepayment penalties if we elect to pay off this debt before the maturity dates and the market interest rate is lower than the fixed interest rates of the debt at the time of repayment. It also contains covenants that limit future borrowings and cash dividend payments. The covenants also require us to maintain specified levels of working capital and operating results. For all fiscal years presented within the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company was in compliance with all restrictive covenants of the unsecured term loan agreements. (2) We lease office space and have entered into other lease commitments in North America as well as various locations in Europe, Asia, Australia and Latin America. Operating leases include future minimum lease payments under all our noncancelable operating leases as of September 30, 2005. (3) Following a decision by Mitsubishi Electric Co., or MELCO, to exit the radiotherapy equipment and service business and its desire to do so in a nondisruptive manner with an established radiotherapy equipment service provider, we entered into two separate transactions with MELCO contemporaneously whereby (i) we purchased MELCO radiotherapy equipment service business to service MELCO existing customers and (ii) we formed a three-year joint venture, or JVA, in Japan with MELCO that was effective as of February 3, 2004. The joint venture was accomplished through MELCO purchase on February 3, 2004, of a 35% ownership interest in our Japanese subsidiary, VMS KK, for 1.4 billion Japanese Yen, or US$13.5 million. At the end of the JVA period, MELCO is required to unconditionally sell and we are required to unconditionally repurchase MELCO 35% ownership interest in VMS KK at the original price (1.4 billion Japanese Yen). We accounted for MELCO 35% ownership interest as a mandatorily redeemable financial instrument and recorded such an instrument as long-term liabilities totaling $12.5 million at September 30, 2005. For further discussion regarding these two transactions with MELCO, see Note 3, Balance Sheet Components and Note 9, Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Total debt as a percentage of total capital decreased to 9.9% at September 30, 2005 compared to 10.2% (as adjusted) at October 1, 2004 largely due to the increases in retained earnings and capital in excess of par value during fiscal year 2005. The ratio of current assets to current liabilities decreased to 1.87 to 1 at September 30, 2005 from 1.94 to 1 (as adjusted) at October 1, 2004. 59 Environmental Matters We are subject to a variety of environmental laws around the world regulating the handling, storage, transport and disposal of hazardous materials that do or may create increased costs for some of our operations. Although we follow procedures that we consider appropriate under existing regulations, these procedures can be costly and we cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination or injury from these materials, and, in the event of such an incident, we could be held liable for any damages that result. In addition, we could be assessed fines or penalties for failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations. These costs, and any future violations or liability under environmental laws or regulations, could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, we may be required to incur significant additional costs to comply with future changes in existing environmental laws and regulations or new laws and regulations. For example, several countries are proposing to require manufacturers to take back, recycle and dispose of products at the end of the equipment useful life. The EU has adopted directives that when implemented will require medical equipment manufacturers to bear some or all of the cost of product disposal at the end of the products useful life, thus creating increased costs for our operations. The EU has also adopted a directive that may require the adoption of restrictions on the use of some hazardous substances in certain of our products sold in the EU. This directive could create increased costs for our operations. From the time we began operating, we handled and disposed of hazardous materials and wastes following procedures that were considered appropriate under regulations, if any, existing at the time. We also hired companies to dispose of wastes generated by our operations. Under various laws (such as the federal Superfund law) and under our obligations concerning operations before the spin-offs by the Company of VI and VSEA in 1999, we are overseeing environmental cleanup projects from our pre-spin-offs operations, and as applicable, reimbursing third parties (such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency or other responsible parties) for cleanup activities. Under the terms of the agreement governing the spin-offs, VI and VSEA are each obligated to indemnify us for one-third of these environmental cleanup costs (after adjusting for any insurance proceeds realized or tax benefits recognized by us). The cleanup projects we are overseeing are being conducted under the direction of or in consultation with relevant regulatory agencies. We estimate these cleanup projects will take up to approximately 30 years to complete. As described below, we have accrued a total of $16.5 million at September 30, 2005 to cover our liabilities for these cleanup projects: Our estimate of future costs to complete certain cleanup activities ranges from $3.8 million to $7.2 million. For these estimates, we have not discounted the costs to present dollars because of the uncertainties that make it difficult to develop a best estimate and have accrued $3.8 million, which is the amount at the low end of the range. For other cleanup projects, we have sufficient knowledge to develop better estimates of our future costs. Formal agreements with other parties defining the Company future liabilities or formal cleanup plans for these sites have been approved by or completed in accordance with requirements of the state or federal environmental agency with jurisdiction over the site. While our estimate of future costs to complete these cleanup projects, including reimbursements to third-party claims, ranges from $10.6 million to $45.8 million, our best estimate within that range is $18.9 million. For these projects we have accrued $12.7 million; which is our best estimate of the $18.9 million discounted to present dollars at 4%, net of inflation. 60 At September 30, 2005, our reserve for environmental liabilities, based upon future environmental related costs estimated as of that date, was calculated as follows: (In millions) Recurring Costs Non-Recurring Costs Total Anticipated Future Costs Fiscal Years: 2006 $ 0.9 $ 2.1 $ 3.0 2007 0.8 1.4 2.2 2008 0.9 0.8 1.7 2009 0.8 0.2 1.0 2010 0.8 0.3 1.1 Thereafter 11.6 2.1 13.7 Total costs $ 15.8 $ 6.9 22.7 Less imputed interest (6.2 ) Reserve amount $ 16.5 Recurring costs include expenses for such tasks as ongoing operation, maintenance and monitoring of cleanup while non-recurring costs include expenses for such tasks as soil excavation and treatment, injection/monitoring well installation and other costs for soil and groundwater in situ treatment by injection, ground and surface water treatment system construction, soil and groundwater investigation, certain governmental agency costs required to be reimbursed by us, governmental agency response costs (including agency costs required to be reimbursed by the responding company), treatment system and monitoring well removal and closure, and costs to defend against and settle pending and anticipated third-party claims. When we developed the estimates above, we considered the financial strength of other potentially responsible parties. These amounts are, however, only estimates and may be revised in the future as we get more information on these projects. We may also spend more or less than these estimates. Based on current information, we believe that our reserves are adequate, but as the scope of our obligations becomes more clearly defined, these reserves (and the associated indemnification obligations of VI and VSEA) may be modified and related charges/credits against earnings may be made. Although any ultimate liability arising from environmental-related matters described herein could result in significant expenditures that, if aggregated and assumed to occur within a single fiscal year, would be material to our consolidated financial statements, the likelihood of such occurrence is considered remote. Based on information currently available to us and our best assessment of the ultimate amount and timing of environmental-related events (and assuming VI and VSEA satisfy their indemnification obligations), we believe that the costs of these environmental-related matters are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements in any fiscal year. We spent $1.1 million, $2.1 million and $1.9 million, net of amounts borne by VI and VSEA, during fiscal years 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. We receive certain cash payments in the form of settlements and judgments from defendants, its insurers and other third parties from time to time. We have also reached an agreement with an insurance company under which the insurance company has agreed to pay a portion of our past and future environmental-related expenditures, and we therefore had a $3.2 million receivable primarily included in Other assets at September 30, 2005. We believe that this receivable is recoverable because it is based on a binding, written settlement agreement with a solvent and financially viable insurance company and the insurance company has paid the claims that we have made. Our present and past facilities have been in operation for many years, and over that time in the course of those operations, these facilities have used substances, that are or might be considered hazardous, and we 61 have generated and disposed of wastes, that are or might be considered hazardous. Therefore, it is possible that additional environmental issues may arise in the future that we cannot now predict. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements In conjunction with the sale of our products in the ordinary course of business, we provide standard indemnification of business partners and customers for losses suffered or incurred for patent, copyright or any other intellectual property infringement claims by any third parties with respect to our products. The term of these indemnification arrangements is generally perpetual. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these agreements is unlimited. As of September 30, 2005, we have not incurred any costs since the spin-offs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification arrangements. We have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and officers that may require us to indemnify our directors and officers against liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers, and to advance their expenses incurred as a result of any legal proceeding against them as to which they could be indemnified. Generally, the maximum obligation under such indemnifications is not explicitly stated and, as a result, the overall amount of these obligations cannot be reasonably estimated. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In November 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard ( SFAS ) No. 151, Inventory Costs, an amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4 . SFAS No. 151 clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and wasted material. SFAS No. 151 is effective for inventory costs incurred beginning in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2006. We do not believe the adoption of SFAS No. 151 will have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153, Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets, an amendment of APB Opinion No. 29 . SFAS No. 153 addresses the measurement of exchanges of nonmonetary assets and redefines the scope of transactions that should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged. SFAS No. 153 is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges beginning in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2006. We do not believe the adoption of SFAS No. 153 will have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In December 2004, the FASB issued Staff Position ( FSP ) No. 109-2, Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 ( FSP 109-2 ), which provides guidance under SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, with respect to recording the potential impact of the repatriation provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the Jobs Creation Act ) on enterprises income tax expense and deferred tax liability. The Jobs Creation Act was enacted on October 22, 2004. FSP 109-2 states that an enterprise is allowed time beyond the financial reporting period of enactment to evaluate the effect of the Jobs Creation Act on its plan for reinvestment or repatriation of foreign earnings for purposes of applying SFAS No. 109. We have not yet completed our evaluation of the impact of the repatriation provisions but currently expect to be in a position to finalize our assessment by the second quarter of fiscal year 2006. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment ( SFAS No. 123R ), which replaced SFAS No. 123 and superseded Accounting Principles Board Opinion ( APB ) No. 25. SFAS No. 123R addresses the accounting for share-based payment transactions in which a company receives employee services in exchange for either equity instruments of the company or liabilities that are based on the fair value of the company equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments. Under SFAS No. 123R, companies will no longer be able to account 62 for share-based compensation transactions using the intrinsic value method in accordance with APB No. 25, but will be required to account for such transactions using a fair value method and recognize the expense in the consolidated statement of earnings. Additionally, SFAS No. 123R clarifies the timing for recognizing compensation expense for awards granted to retirement eligible employees when the awards continue to vest after retirement. This compensation expense must be recognized over the period from the date of grant to the date retirement eligibility is met if it is shorter than the vesting term. SFAS No. 123R is effective beginning in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2006. In March 2005, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin ( SAB ) No. 107 regarding the SEC interpretation of SFAS No. 123R and the valuation of share-based payments for public companies. We have evaluated the requirements of SFAS No. 123R and SAB No. 107 and expect that the adoption of SFAS No. 123R and SAB No. 107 in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2006 will have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and net earnings per share. We expect to apply the Black-Scholes valuation model in determining the fair value of share-based payments to employees, which will then be amortized on a straight-line basis. We also expect to apply the modified prospective method, which requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options at the beginning of our first quarter of fiscal year 2006. In June 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections , a replacement of APB No. 20, Accounting Changes , and SFAS No. 3, Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements . SFAS No. 154 changes the requirements for accounting for and reporting a change in accounting principle. Previously, most voluntary changes in accounting principles required recognition via a cumulative effect adjustment within the net income of the period of the change. SFAS No. 154 requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements unless it is impracticable to determine either the period-specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change. SFAS No. 154 is effective for accounting changes made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005; however, this statement does not change the transition provisions of any existing accounting pronouncements. We do not believe the adoption of SFAS No. 154 will have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In June 2005, the FASB issued FSP No. FAS 143-1, Accounting for Electronic Equipment Waste Obligations ( FSP No. 143-1 ), which provides guidance on the accounting for certain obligations associated with the Directive on Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (the Directive ), which was adopted by the European Union ( EU ). Under the Directive, the waste management obligation for historical equipment (products put on the market on or prior to August 13, 2005) sold to commercial users either remains with the commercial user until the equipment is replaced or is the responsibility of a producer selling the user new like equipment. The Directive also provides, however, that the responsibility for the management for this historical equipment is negotiable at the time of sale of the new equipment. The Directive has not yet been implemented in every EU country and specific EU country requirements may vary. FSP No. 143-1 is required to be applied to the later of the first reporting period ending after June 8, 2005 or the date of the Directive adoption into law by the applicable EU member countries in which we have significant operations. FSP No. 143-1 does not address the accounting for the disposal of waste related to equipment put on the market after August 13, 2005. The adoption of FSP No. 143-1 did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
