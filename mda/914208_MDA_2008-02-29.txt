Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Executive Overview The following executive overview summarizes the significant trends affecting our results of operations and financial condition for the periods presented. This overview and the remainder of this management discussion and analysis supplements, and should be read in conjunction with, the Consolidated Financial Statements of Invesco Ltd. and its subsidiaries (collectively, the company or Invesco ) and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we had net income of $673.6 million, compared to $482.7 million during 2006. The 39.5% increase in net income was driven by the following factors: An increase in operating revenues of $632.2 million (19.5%) driven mainly by growth in average assets under management ( AUM ) of $64.9 billion (15.3%), while at the same time limiting the increase in operating expenses to $397.1 million (16.0%). Growth in equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates of $43.8 million, from $4.3 million in 2006 to $48.1 million in 2007. The factors above that contributed to the growth in operating income during the year ended December 31, 2007 were offset, in part, by the following: An increase of $67.1 million (6.3%) in employee compensation expense due predominantly to increases in base salaries, sales incentive bonuses and staff bonuses driven by performance against corporate objectives and $25.0 million in amortization of a 21 Table of Contents component of the cost of the October 2006 acquisition of WL Ross & Co, which was accounted for as prepaid compensation (see Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 2, Acquisitions and Dispositions for additional details). An increase in general and administrative expenses of $88.2 million (42.5%). The increase included growth in legal costs related to a $24.0 million insurance recovery in 2006 and to fund launches, a $12.8 million charge related to the relisting of the company on the New York Stock Exchange and a $9.8 million charge related to the proposed final settlement of market-timing private litigation that commenced in 2003. An increase in income tax expense of $102.7 million (40.3%), which was consistent with the increase in income before taxes. Invesco ended 2007 with a record year-end AUM of $500.1 billion, an 8.1% increase over 2006 resulting from a combination of market gains, positive flows into money market funds and foreign currency translation partially offset by net outflows of $3.4 billion. Larger AUM increased operating revenues to $3,878.9 million, a 19.5% increase over the previous year. Operating expenses increased 16.0% to $2,884.6 million. The growth in operating revenues exceeded the increase in operating expenses, producing record operating income of $994.3 million in 2007, an increase of 31.0% over operating income of $759.2 million in 2006, and a significant expansion of operating margin and net operating margin to 25.6% and 36.0% in 2007, respectively, from 23.4% and 31.4% in 2006, respectively. Diluted earnings per share improved 37.8%, from $1.19 in 2006 to $1.64 in 2007. See Schedule of Non-GAAP Information for a reconciliation of operating income to net operating income (and by calculation, a reconciliation of operating margin to net operating margin) and important additional disclosures. Achieving strong investment performance continues to be a strategic focus for Invesco. Within our retail products, the U.K. has continued to have strong relative performance versus its competitors throughout 2007. The U.S., Continental Europe and Asia were ahead of peers over most relevant time periods, while the relative performance in Canada tended to lag peers due to certain portfolios being underweight in the resources sector while being relatively overweight in consumer discretionary businesses. The strong Canadian dollar was an additional impediment for funds with higher-than-average investment in foreign securities. Many of our institutional products were ahead of benchmark over most relevant time periods with our fixed income and money market products once again delivering consistent outstanding relative performance. Industry Discussion Global equity markets generally increased for the full year of 2007. However, both equity and credit markets suffered sharp corrections at times during the fourth quarter, mainly due to sub-prime related write-downs from the large investment banks and tighter liquidity in short-term money markets. In North America during 2007, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&P 500, the Nasdaq Composite Index, and the S&P/TSX Composite (Canada) were up 8.9%, 5.5%, 10.7%. and 9.8%, respectively; in Europe the FTSE 100 was up 7.8% and the FTSE World Europe was up 3.3%; and in Asia the China SE Shanghai Composite was up 97.9% while the Nikkei 225 was down 10.2%. The Lehman Brothers U.S. Aggregate Bond Index returned 7.0% for the year, bolstered by two interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve in the fourth quarter, and despite credit concerns that increased across the broader economy. The markets continue to be volatile in early 2008. Our AUM at the end of 2007 were $500.1 billion (2006: $462.6 billion). At January 31, 2008, AUM decreased by $24.5 billion (4.9%) to $475.6 billion due primarily to this market volatility. Assets Under Management Average AUM for 2007 were $489.1 billion, compared to $424.2 billion in 2006. Net outflows for the year ended December 31, 2007, were $3.4 billion, with inflows of $119.9 billion and outflows of $123.3 billion. The primary driver of net outflows for 2007 were net outflows from the Stable Value product of $16.2 billion. These outflows occurred following the departure of several members of our Stable Value team to a competitor in April 2007. Our retail net inflows for 2007 were $6.0 billion, compared to net inflows of $0.5 billion in 2006. Institutional net outflows were $9.2 billion in 2007 (including the Stable Value net outflows of $16.2 billion) versus net outflows of $1.2 billion in 2006. Our Private Wealth Management (PWM) channel had net outflows of $0.2 billion in 2007 compared to net outflows of $0.7 billion in 2006. 22 Table of Contents Changes in AUM were as follows: $ in billions 2007 2006 2005 January 1, $ 462.6 $ 386.3 $ 382.1 Inflows 119.9 85.8 66.3 Outflows (123.3 ) (87.2 ) (82.5 ) Net flows (3.4 ) (1.4 ) (16.2 ) Net flows in money market funds and other 10.1 12.8 0.5 Market gains/reinvestment 20.0 46.5 24.4 Acquisitions/disposals 8.9 Foreign currency 10.8 9.5 (4.5 ) December 31, $ 500.1 $ 462.6 $ 386.3 Average long-term AUM $ 424.2 $ 366.3 $ 331.7 Average institutional money market AUM 64.9 57.9 45.9 Average AUM $ 489.1 $ 424.2 $ 377.6 Net revenue yield on AUM (annualized) (1) 59.1 bps 56.9 bps 57.4 bps Net revenue yield on AUM before performance fees (annualized) (1) 57.7 bps 55.0 bps 56.5 bps (1) Net revenue yield on AUM is equal to net revenue divided by average AUM. Net revenues are operating revenues less third-party distribution, service and advisory costs, plus our proportional share of net revenues from joint venture investments. See Schedule of Non-GAAP Information for a reconciliation of operating revenues to net revenues and important additional disclosures. Our revenues are directly influenced by the level and composition of our AUM. Therefore, movements in global capital market levels, net new business inflows (or outflows) and changes in the mix of investment products between asset classes may materially affect our revenues from period to period. The returns from global capital markets declined in 2007. The total returns (in local currency terms) of the FTSE 100, the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) all declined in 2007 from 2006: FTSE 100 from 14.8% to 7.8%, S&P 500 from 15.8% to 5.5% and the DJIA from 19.0% to 8.9%, respectively. The total returns of the NASDAQ increased slightly from 10.4% to 10.7%.

Certain funds and products were excluded from the analysis because of limited benchmark or peer group data. Had these been available, results may be different. These results are preliminary and subject to revision. Performance assumes the reinvestment of dividends. Past performance is not indicative of future results and may not reflect an investor experience. Within U.S. retail, over 64% of assets were in the top half of their respective peer groups on both a three- and five-year Lipper basis while 45% of assets were in the top half on a one-year basis. Morningstar peer groups result in 49%, 65%, and 50% of AUM being in the top half on a one-, three- and five-year basis, respectively. During 2007, we evaluated, rationalized and merged five funds in the U.S. retail product line and introduced six new target date allocation funds as part of our efforts to ensure we are delivering the best possible investment solutions to our clients. In our Canadian retail operations, certain portfolios lagged peers in 2007 due to being underweight in the resources sectors while overweight in consumer discretionary businesses. The strong Canadian dollar was an additional headwind for funds with higher-than-average investment in foreign securities. The U.K. retail operations have produced particularly strong results across all measured time frames. In Continental Europe and Asia, 72%, 57% and 85% of AUM are performing in the top half of their peer groups on a one-, three- and five-year basis, respectively. In our institutional operations, over 98% of our money market assets were in the top-half of their respective peer groups over one-, three-and five-year periods. At least 89% of alternatives and fixed income AUM were ahead of benchmark over three and five year periods. The institutional equity products experienced some relative weakness over a one year period but had 56% of AUM ahead of benchmark over a three- and five-year period. Although measuring our investment performance against benchmarks is an important criterion, our institutional operations are also evaluated against peer groups and consultant perception. Results of Operations Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2007 Compared with the Year Ended December 31, 2006 Operating Revenues and Net Revenues Operating revenues increased by 19.5% in 2007 to $3,878.9 million (2006: $3,246.7 million). Net revenues are operating revenues less third-party distribution, service and advisory costs, plus our proportional share of net revenues from joint venture arrangements. Net revenues increased by 19.0% in 2007 to $2,888.4 million (2006: $2,428.0 million). See Schedule of Non-GAAP Information for additional important disclosures regarding the use of net revenues. The main categories of revenues, and the dollar and percentage change between the periods, are as follows: 25 Table of Contents $ % $ in millions 2007 2006 Change Change Investment management fees 3,080.1 2,508.2 571.9 22.8 % Performance fees 70.3 82.1 (11.8 ) (14.4 )% Service and distribution fees 593.1 534.9 58.2 10.9 % Other 135.4 121.5 13.9 11.4 % Total operating revenues 3,878.9 3,246.7 632.2 19.5 % Third-party distribution, service and advisory costs (1,051.1 ) (826.8 ) (224.3 ) (27.1 )% Proportional share of revenues, net of third-party distribution costs, from joint venture investments 60.6 8.1 52.5 648.1 % Net revenues 2,888.4 2,428.0 460.4 19.0 % Investment Management Fees Investment management fees are derived from providing professional services to manage client accounts and include fees received from retail mutual funds, unit trusts, investment companies with variable capital (ICVCs), investment trusts and institutional advisory contracts. Investment management fees for products offered in the retail distribution channel are generally calculated as a percentage of the daily average asset balances and therefore vary as the levels of AUM change resulting from inflows, outflows and market movements. Investment management fees for products offered in the institutional and private wealth management distribution channels are calculated in accordance with the underlying investment management contracts and also vary in relation to the level of client assets managed. Investment management fees increased 22.8% in 2007 to $3,080.1 million (2006: $2,508.2 million) due to increases in assets under management during the year. AUM at December 31, 2007 were $500.1 billion (2006: $462.6 billion). Performance Fees Performance fee revenues are only generated on certain management contracts when certain performance hurdles are achieved. They are recorded in operating revenues as of the performance measurement date, or on the date of achievement of the performance hurdle, when the outcome can be estimated reliably. The performance measurement date is defined in each contract in which incentive and performance fee revenue agreements are in effect. Performance fees will fluctuate from period to period and may not correlate with general market changes, since most of the fees are driven by relative performance to the respective benchmark rather than absolute performance. In 2007, these fees decreased 14.4% to $70.3 million (2006: $82.1 million). The performance fees generated in 2006 were the result of outstanding investment performance across a number of our investment disciplines. Service and Distribution Fees Service fees are generated through fees charged to cover several types of expenses, including fund accounting fees, SEC filings and other maintenance costs for mutual funds, unit trusts and ICVCs, and administrative fees received from closed-ended funds. Service fees also include transfer agent fees, which are fees charged to cover the expense of transferring shares of a mutual fund or units of a unit trust into the investor name. Distribution fees include 12b-1 fees received from certain mutual funds to cover allowable sales and marketing expenses for those funds and also include asset-based sales charges paid by certain mutual funds for a period of time after the sale of those funds. Distribution fees typically vary in relation to the amount of client assets managed. Retail products offered outside of the U.S. do not generate a separate distribution fee, as the quoted management fee rate is inclusive of these services; instead fees for distribution services are included within investment management fee revenues for these locations. In 2007, service and distribution fees increased 10.9% to $593.1 million (2006: $534.9 million) due to increased sales and assets under management. 26 Table of Contents Other Revenues Other revenues include fees derived primarily from transaction commissions received upon the closing of new investments into certain of our retail funds and fees received upon the closing of real estate investment transactions in our real estate group. Real estate transaction fees are derived from commissions earned through the buying and selling of properties. The performance measurement date in which revenues are recorded is the date on which the transaction is legally closed. Other revenues also include the revenues of consolidated investment products. In 2007, other revenues increased 11.4% to $135.4 million (2006: $121.5 million) driven by increases in sales volumes of funds subject to front-end commissions, offset by declines in real estate transaction fees from 2006. Increases in other revenues were also offset by decreases in the revenues of consolidated investment products, which were primarily the result of the deconsolidation of certain variable interest entities following the company determination that it was no longer the primary beneficiary of those entities. See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 18, Consolidated Investment Products. Third-Party Distribution, Service and Advisory Costs Third-party distribution, service and advisory costs include renewal commissions paid to independent financial advisors for as long as the clients assets are invested and are payments for the servicing of the client accounts. Renewal commissions are calculated based upon a percentage of the AUM value. Third-party distribution costs also include the amortization of upfront commissions paid to broker/dealers for sales of fund shares with a contingent deferred sales charge (a charge levied to the investor for client redemption of AUM within a certain contracted period of time). The distribution commissions are amortized over the contractual AUM-retention period. Also included in third-party distribution, service and advisory costs are sub-transfer agency fees that are paid to a third party for transferring shares of a mutual fund or units of a unit trust into the investor name. Third-party distribution, service and advisory costs may increase or decrease at a rate different from the rate of change in service and distribution fee revenues due to the inclusion of distribution, service and advisory costs for the U.K. and Canada, where the related revenues are recorded as investment management fee revenues, as noted above. Third-party distribution, service and advisory costs increased 27.1% in 2007 to $1,051.1 million (2006: $826.8 million), driven by increased renewal commissions generated by increased assets under management. Additionally, the trend towards platform and fund supermarket sales in the U.K. has further contributed to the increase in these costs. Proportional share of revenues, net of third-party distribution costs, from joint venture investments Management believes that the addition of our proportional share of revenues, net of third-party distribution costs, from joint venture arrangements should be added to operating revenues to arrive at net revenues, as it is important to evaluate the contribution to the business that our joint venture arrangements are making. See Schedule of Non-GAAP Information for additional disclosures regarding the use of net revenues. The company most significant joint venture arrangement, as identified in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 3, Investments, is our 49.0% investment in INVESCO Great Wall Fund Management Company Limited. The 648.1% increase in our proportional share of revenues, net of third-party distribution costs, to $60.6 million in 2007 (2006: $8.1 million), is driven by the significant growth in assets under management in this joint venture. Operating Expenses During 2007, operating expenses increased 16.0% to $2,884.6 million (2006: $2,487.5 million), driven by increases in employee compensation, third-party distribution, service and advisory costs and general and administrative costs. The main categories of operating expenses are as follows: $ % $ in millions 2007 2006 Change Change Employee compensation 1,137.6 1,070.5 67.1 6.3 % Third-party distribution, service and advisory 1,051.1 826.8 224.3 27.1 % Marketing 157.6 138.8 18.8 13.5 % Property, office and technology 242.5 230.7 11.8 5.1 % General and administrative 295.8 207.6 88.2 42.5 % Restructuring charge 13.1 (13.1 ) (100.0 )% Total operating expenses 2,884.6 2,487.5 397.1 16.0 % 27 Table of Contents The table below sets forth these cost categories as a percentage of total operating expenses, operating revenues and net revenues, which we believe provides useful information as to the relative significance of each type of cost. % of % of Total % of % of Total % of % of Operating Operating Net Operating Operating Net $ in millions 2007 Expenses Revenues Revenues* 2006 Expenses Revenues Revenues* Employee compensation 1,137.6 39.4 % 29.3 % 39.4 % 1,070.5 43.0 % 33.0 % 44.1 % Third-party distribution, service and advisory 1,051.1 36.4 % 27.1 % N/A 826.8 33.2 % 25.5 % N/A Marketing 157.6 5.5 % 4.1 % 5.5 % 138.8 5.6 % 4.3 % 5.7 % Property, office and technology 242.5 8.4 % 6.3 % 8.4 % 230.7 9.3 % 7.1 % 9.5 % General and administrative 295.8 10.3 % 7.6 % 10.2 % 207.6 8.3 % 6.4 % 8.6 % Restructuring charge 13.1 0.6 % 0.4 % 0.5 % Total operating expenses 2,884.6 100.0 % 74.4 % N/A 2,487.5 100.0 % 76.7 % N/A * Net revenues are operating revenues less third-party distribution, service and advisory costs, plus our proportional share of net revenues from joint venture investments. See Schedule of Non-GAAP Information for a reconciliation of operating revenues to net revenues and important additional disclosures. Employee Compensation Employee compensation continues to be the largest component of total operating expenses, accounting for 39.4% of total operating expenses for 2007 (2006: 43.0%). Competitive compensation is critical for the success of the company in attracting and retaining the highest caliber employees. Employee compensation increased $67.1 million, or 6.3%, in 2007 from 2006 due predominantly to increases in base salaries, sales incentive bonuses and staff bonuses for performance against corporate objectives, and $25.0 million in amortization related to a component of the cost of the October 2006 acquisition of WL Ross & Co., which was accounted for as prepaid compensation (see Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 2, Acquisitions and Dispositions ). Third-Party Distribution, Service and Advisory Costs Third-party distribution, service and advisory costs are discussed above in the operating and net revenues section. Marketing Marketing expenses include marketing support payments, which are payments made to distributors of certain of our retail products over and above the 12b-1 distribution payments. These fees are contracted separately with each distributor. Marketing expenses also include the cost of direct advertising of our products through trade publications, television and other media. Public relations costs, such as the marketing of the company products through conferences or other sponsorships, are also included in marketing costs, as well as the cost of marketing-related employee travel. Marketing expenses increased 13.5% in 2007 to $157.6 million (2006: $138.8 million) due to increased marketing support payments related to increased sales and AUM in the U.S. but were relatively flat as a percentage of net revenues (5.5% of net revenues in 2007 vs. 5.7% of net revenues in 2006). Property, Office and Technology Property, office and technology expenses include rent and utilities for our various leased facilities, depreciation of company-owned property and capitalized computer equipment costs, minor non-capitalized computer equipment and software purchases and related maintenance payments, and costs related to externally provided computer, record-keeping and portfolio management services. 28 Table of Contents Property, office and technology costs increased 5.1% to $242.5 million in 2007 from $230.7 million in 2006, due primarily to a $7.4 million lease charge for unused office space. General and Administrative General and administrative expenses include professional services costs, such as information service subscriptions, consulting fees, professional insurance costs, audit, tax and legal fees, non-marketing related employee travel expenditures, recruitment and training costs, and the amortization of certain intangible assets. General and administrative expenses increased by $88.2 million (42.5%) to $295.8 million in 2007 from $207.6 million in 2006. This increase included growth in legal and other costs related to a $24.0 million insurance recovery in 2006 and to fund launch costs for a broad array of new ETF products through PowerShares. In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2007, we recorded a $12.8 million charge related to the relisting of the company on the New York Stock Exchange and a $9.8 million charge related to the proposed final settlement of market-timing private litigation that commenced in 2003. Restructuring Charge We did not incur any restructuring costs in 2007. In 2006, we recorded $13.1 million in remaining charges related to the operational restructuring efforts that began in 2005. See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 13, Restructuring Charge, for additional information. Operating Income, Net Operating Income, Operating Margin and Net Operating Margin Operating income increased 31.0% to $994.3 million in 2007 from $759.2 million in 2006, driven by the growth in operating revenues. Operating margin (operating income divided by operating revenues) was 25.6% in 2007, up from 23.4% in 2006. Net operating income (operating income plus our proportional share of the operating income from joint venture arrangements) increased 36.4% to $1,039.8 million in 2007 from $762.1 million in 2006. Net operating margin is equal to net operating income divided by net revenues. Net revenues are equal to operating revenues less third-party distribution, service and advisory costs, plus our proportional share of the net revenues from our joint venture arrangements. Net operating margin was 36.0% in 2007, up from 31.4% in 2006. See Schedule of Non-GAAP Information for a reconciliation of operating revenues to net revenues, a reconciliation of operating income to net operating income and additional important disclosures regarding net revenues, net operating income and net operating margins. Other Income and Expenses Interest income increased 80.3% to $48.5 million in 2007 from $26.9 million in 2006 largely as a result of growth in our interest-earning cash balances during the year. Interest expense decreased 7.6% to $71.3 million in 2007 from $77.2 million in 2006 due to lower credit facility balances and a lower coupon interest rate on the new senior notes issued in April 2007. Other gains and losses, net decreased 63.1% to $9.9 million in 2007 from $26.8 million in 2006. Included in other gains and losses, net are gains on disposals of investments, which increased to $32.2 million in 2007 from $18.1 million in 2006, primarily driven by gains realized upon the redemption of seed money investments. Also included in other gains are net foreign exchange gains and losses. In 2007, we incurred $10.3 million in net foreign exchange losses; whereas in 2006 we benefited from $8.5 million in net foreign exchange gains. Additionally, we incurred $13.6 million in write-downs and losses on seed capital investments during 2007 (2006: $1.7 million). See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 15, Other Gains and Losses, Net, for additional details related to other gains and losses. Included in other income and expenses are net other realized and unrealized gains of consolidated investment products. These net gains decreased 27.2% to $214.3 million in 2007 from $294.3 million in 2006, primarily due to the deconsolidation of certain variable interest entities for which we determined that we were no longer the primary beneficiary. 29 Table of Contents Income Tax Provision Our subsidiaries operate in several taxing jurisdictions around the world, each with its own statutory income tax rate. As a result, our effective tax rate will vary from year to year depending on the mix of the profits and losses of our subsidiaries. The majority of our profits are earned in the U.S., Canada and the U.K. The current U.K. statutory tax rate is 30.0%, the Canadian statutory tax rate is 36.0% and the U.S. Federal statutory tax rate is 35.0%. On July 19, 2007, legislation was enacted that will decrease the U.K. tax rate to 28.0% effective April 1, 2008. On December 14, 2007, legislation was enacted to reduce the Canadian income tax rate over the next five years. Beginning January 1, 2008, the Canadian tax rate will be reduced to 33.5%, with further reductions to 33.0% in 2009, 32.0% in 2010, 30.5% in 2011, and finally 29.0% in 2012. Our effective tax rate excluding minority interest for 2007 was 34.6%, as compared to 34.5% in 2006. In 2007 a larger percentage of our profits originated from the U.K. than in 2006, which further decreased our effective tax rate. Similar to 2006, this reduction was offset by state taxes, additional taxes on subsidiary dividends, and an increase in the net valuation allowance for subsidiary operating losses. In 2007, we also reduced our Canadian and U.K. deferred tax assets to reflect the tax rate changes discussed above and we incurred transaction costs associated with our change in listing and domicile that were not deductible for tax purposes. The inclusion of income from minority interests reduced our effective tax rate to 28.7% in 2007 and 24.6% in 2006. Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2006 Compared with the Year Ended December 31, 2005 Operating Revenues and Net Revenues Operating revenues increased by 13.0% in 2006 to $3,246.7 million (2005: $2,872.6 million). Net revenues are operating revenues less third-party distribution, service and advisory costs, plus our proportional share of revenues, net of third-party distribution costs, from joint venture arrangements. Net revenues increased by 12.1% in 2006 to $2,428.0 million (2005: $2,166.6 million). See Schedule of Non-GAAP Information for additional important disclosures regarding the use of net revenues. The main categories of revenues, and the dollar and percentage change between the periods, are as follows: $ % $ in millions 2006 2005 Change Change Investment management fees 2,508.2 2,166.7 341.5 15.8 % Performance fees 82.1 33.5 48.6 145.1 % Service and distribution fees 534.9 538.2 (3.3 ) (0.6 )% Other 121.5 134.2 (12.7 ) (9.5 )% Total operating revenues 3,246.7 2,872.6 374.1 13.0 % Third-party distribution, service and advisory costs (826.8 ) (706.0 ) (120.8 ) (17.1 )% Proportional share of revenues, net of third-party distribution costs, from joint venture investments 8.1 8.1 N/A Net revenues 2,428.0 2,166.6 261.4 12.1 % Investment Management Fees Investment management fees increased 15.8% in 2006 over 2005, due to market appreciation on fund assets, investment performance and increased sales in Europe of the Dublin-based offshore fund range and the U.K. onshore fund range. Performance fees Performance fees increased to $82.1 million in 2006 from $33.5 million in 2005, as several institutional products exceeded performance hurdles. In the U.K., strong investment performance contributed to the increase in performance fees. 30 Table of Contents Service and Distribution Fees In 2006, increases in service revenues in the U.K., in line with higher AUM, were offset by decreases in distribution and transfer agent revenues. Distribution fees declined due to the full year of 12b-1 rate reductions on certain U.S. retail products. The decline in transfer agent fee revenues arose primarily in U.S. retail from a change in the sub-transfer agent methodology, account fee rate changes, and fewer open accounts. Distribution and transfer agent fees in 2005 included revenues from AMVESCAP Retirement, which was sold in the second half of 2005, thereby further contributing to the decline in revenues in 2006. Other Revenues In 2006, other revenues decreased 9.5% from 2005, primarily due to lower real estate transaction commissions and reduced transaction commissions following the sale of our German banking license. In 2005, other revenues included fees earned from our German banking business, such as interest earned from balances available on demand from clients and credit institutions and commissions earned from derivative instruments. Third-Party Distribution, Service and Advisory Costs Third-party distribution, service and advisory costs increased 17.1% to $826.8 million in 2006 (2005: $706.0 million) due primarily to increases in renewal commissions, partially offset by declines in third-party distribution fees. Proportional share of revenues, net of third-party distribution costs, from joint venture investments Management believes that the addition of our proportional share of revenues, net of third-party distribution costs, from joint venture arrangements should be added to operating revenues to arrive at net revenues, as it is important to evaluate the contribution to the business that our joint venture arrangements are making. See Schedule of Non-GAAP Information for additional disclosures regarding the use of net revenues. The $8.1 million increase in our proportional share of revenues, net of third-party distribution costs, in 2006 (2005: $nil), is driven by the growth in assets under management in our Chinese joint venture, Invesco Great Wall Fund Management Company Limited. Operating Expenses The main categories of operating expenses are as follows: $ % $ in millions 2006 2005 Change Change Employee compensation 1,070.5 1,044.7 25.8 2.5 % Third-party distribution, service and advisory 826.8 706.0 120.8 17.1 % Marketing 138.8 139.5 (0.7 ) (0.5 )% Property, office and technology 230.7 270.9 (40.2 ) (14.8 )% General and administrative 207.6 224.4 (16.8 ) (7.5 )% Restructuring charge 13.1 62.6 (49.5 ) (79.1 )% Goodwill impairment 16.6 (16.6 ) (100.0 )% Total operating expenses 2,487.5 2,464.7 22.8 0.9 % 31 Table of Contents The table below sets forth these cost categories as a percentage of total operating expenses, operating revenues and net revenues, which we believe provides useful information as to the relative significance of each type of cost. % of % of Total % of % of Total % of % of Operating Operating Net Operating Operating Net $ in millions 2006 Expenses Revenues Revenues* 2005 Expenses Revenues Revenues* Employee compensation 1,070.5 43.0 % 33.0 % 44.1 % 1,044.7 42.4 % 36.4 % 48.2 % Third-party distribution, service and advisory 826.8 33.2 % 25.5 % N/A 706.0 28.6 % 24.6 % N/A Marketing 138.8 5.6 % 4.3 % 5.7 % 139.5 5.7 % 4.8 % 6.4 % Property, office and technology 230.7 9.3 % 7.1 % 9.5 % 270.9 11.0 % 9.4 % 12.5 % General and administrative 207.6 8.3 % 6.4 % 8.6 % 224.4 9.1 % 7.8 % 10.4 % Restructuring charge 13.1 0.6 % 0.4 % 0.5 % 62.6 2.5 % 2.2 % 2.9 % Goodwill impairment 16.6 0.7 % 0.6 % 0.8 % Total operating expenses 2,487.5 100.0 % 76.7 % N/A 2,464.7 100.0 % 85.8 % N/A * Net revenues are operating revenues less third-party distribution, service and advisory costs, plus our proportional share of net revenues from joint venture investments. See Schedule of Non-GAAP Information for a reconciliation of operating revenues to net revenues and important additional disclosures. Employee Compensation Employee compensation continues to be the largest component of total operating expenses, accounting for 43.0% of total operating expenses for 2006: (2005: 42.4%). Employee compensation expenses increased $25.8 million, or 2.5%. in 2006 from 2005, due primarily to $84.2 million in incremental non-cash amortization of share-related compensation programs, including a charge of $44.7 million ($0.08 per share, net of tax) relating to the cumulative previously unrecognized cost to the company of performance-based share options granted in 2003 that vested in February 2007. No expense for these options was recorded in 2005 as it was not expected in 2005 that the awards would vest. An increase of $15.5 million in staff bonuses and smaller increases in sales incentive bonuses also contributed to the overall rise in compensation costs. The increases in share-based payment and bonus costs were offset by decreases in base salary and pension costs in 2006, reflecting lower headcount levels. Third-Party Distribution, Service and Advisory Costs Third-party distribution, service and advisory costs increased 17.1% to $826.8 million in 2006 (2005: $706.0 million) due primarily to increases in renewal commissions, partially offset by declines in third-party distribution fees. Marketing Marketing expenses decreased 0.5% in 2006 from 2005 and were 5.7% of net revenues in 2006 compared to 6.4% of net revenues in 2005. Property, Office and Technology Property, office and technology costs decreased 14.8% to $230.7 million in 2006 from $270.9 million in 2005. Lower costs reflect a reduction in the amount of leased office space and lower depreciation expense caused by a decline in overall hardware purchases. General and Administrative General and administrative costs decreased 7.5% in 2006 compared to 2005. In 2006 legal costs, which included a $6.0 million settlement, were offset by a $24.0 million insurance recovery related to market timing litigation in prior years. Professional insurance costs declined in 2006 due to reduced premiums, and general recruitment costs declined in 2006. These declines were partially offset by increases in external consulting costs related to various strategic initiatives. 32 Table of Contents Restructuring Charge In 2006 we recorded $13.1 million in remaining charges related to the operational and structural restructuring efforts that began in 2005. In 2005, we incurred $62.6 million in restructuring costs. See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 13, Restructuring Charge, for additional information. Goodwill Impairment In 2005, we recorded a $16.6 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge related to our Private Wealth Management business. See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 8, Goodwill for additional details. Operating Income, Net Operating Income, Operating Margin and Net Operating Margin Operating income increased 86.1% to $759.2 million in 2006 from $407.9 million in 2005, driven by the growth in operating revenues. Operating margin (operating income divided by operating revenues) was 23.4% in 2006, up from 14.2% in 2005. Net operating income (operating income plus our proportional share of the operating income from joint venture arrangements) increased 86.8% to $762.1 million in 2006 from $407.9 million in 2005. Net operating margin is equal to net operating income divided by net revenues. Net revenues are equal to operating revenues less third-party distribution, service and advisory costs, plus our proportional share of the net revenues from our joint venture arrangements. Net operating margin was 31.4% in 2006, up from 18.8% in 2005. See Schedule of Non-GAAP Information below for a reconciliation of operating revenues to net revenues, a reconciliation of operating income to net operating income and additional important disclosures regarding net revenues, net operating income and net operating margins. Other Income and Expenses Interest income increased 61.1% to $26.9 million in 2006 from $16.7 million in 2005 as a result, largely, of growth in our interest-earning cash balances during the year. Other gains and losses, net increased $26.8 million in 2006 from $13.4 million in 2005, driven by the realization of gains from our investments in collateralized debt obligations, fund seed money and foreign exchange gains. In 2005, we recognized $32.6 million in gain upon the sale of the AMVESCAP Retirement business. Income Tax Provision Our effective tax rate excluding minority interest for 2006 was 34.5%, as compared to 40.8% in 2005. In 2006 a larger percentage of our profits originated from the U.K. than in 2005, which further decreased our effective tax rate. This reduction was offset by state taxes, additional taxes on subsidiary dividends, and an increase in the net valuation allowance for subsidiary operating losses. In 2005, our effective tax rate excluding minority interest was higher due primarily to the absence of lower taxed profits, Europe and Asia operating losses, nondeductible restructuring expenses and nondeductible investment write-downs. The inclusion of income from minority interests reduced our effective tax rate to 24.6% in 2006 and 31.4% in 2005. Schedule of Non-GAAP Information Net revenues, net operating income and net operating margin are non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes that these measures are additional meaningful measures to evaluate our operating performance. The most comparable U.S. GAAP measures are operating revenues, operating income and operating margin. Management believes that the deduction of third-party distribution, service and advisory costs from operating revenues in the computation of net revenues and the related computation of net operating margin provides useful information to investors because the distribution, service and advisory fee amounts represent costs that are passed through to external parties, which essentially are a share of the related revenues. Management also believes that the addition of our proportional share of operating revenues, net of distribution costs, from joint venture investments in the computation of net revenues and the addition of our proportional share of operating income in the related computations of net operating income and net operating margin also provides useful information to investors, as management considers it appropriate to evaluate the contribution of its growing joint venture investment to the operations of the business. Net revenues, net operating income and net operating margin should not be considered as substitutes for any measures derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. 33 Table of Contents The following is a reconciliation of operating revenues, operating income and operating margin on a U.S. GAAP basis to net revenues, net operating income and net operating margin.

Details regarding changes in cash balances are provided within our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 34 Table of Contents Invesco has local capital requirements in several jurisdictions, as well as regional requirements for entities that are part of the European sub-group. These requirements mandate the retention of liquid resources in those jurisdictions, which we meet in part by holding cash. This retained cash can be used for general business purposes in the European sub-group or in the countries where it is located. Due to the capital restrictions, the ability to transfer cash between certain jurisdictions may be limited. In addition, transfers of cash between international jurisdictions may have adverse tax consequences that may substantially limit such activity. At December 31, 2007, the European sub-group had cash and cash equivalent balances of $758.1 million, much of which is used to satisfy these regulatory requirements. We are in compliance with all regulatory minimum net capital requirements. Unsettled Fund Receivables Unsettled fund receivables increased from $561.6 million at December 31, 2006 to $605.5 million at December 31, 2007 due to the timing of fund and investor settlements. Unsettled fund receivables are created by the normal settlement periods on transactions initiated by certain clients of our U.K. and offshore funds. We are legally required to establish a receivable and a substantially offsetting payable at trade date with both the investor and the fund for normal purchases and sales. Investments (Non-current and current) As of December 31, 2007, we had $299.5 million in investments, of which $122.3 million were non-current investments and $177.2 million were current investments. Included in current investments are $60.9 million of seed money in affiliated funds and $58.8 million of investments related to assets held for deferred compensation plans. Included in non-current investments are $74.7 million in equity method investments in our Chinese joint venture and in certain of the company private equity, real estate and other investment. Additionally, non-current investments include $39.0 million of investments in collateralized loan and debt obligation structures managed by us. Our investments in collateralized debt obligation structures are generally in the form of a relatively small portion of the unrated, junior, subordinated position. As such these positions would share in the first losses to be incurred if the structures were to experience significant increases in default rates of underlying investments above historical levels. Assets Held for Policyholders and Policyholder Payables One of our subsidiaries, Invesco Pensions Limited, is an insurance-type company that was established to facilitate retirement savings plans in the U.K. The entity holds assets that are managed for its clients on its balance sheet with an equal and offsetting liability. The increasing balance in these accounts was the result of success in growing this product offering. Investments of consolidated investment products Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation (FIN) No. 46(R), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51 requires that the primary beneficiary of variable interest entities (VIEs) consolidate the VIEs. A VIE is an entity that does not have sufficient equity to finance its operations without additional subordinated financial support, or an entity for which the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests. Generally, limited partnership entities where the general partner does not have substantive equity investment at risk and where the other limited partners do not have substantive (greater than 50%) rights to remove the general partner or to dissolve the limited partnership are also VIEs. The primary beneficiary is the party to the VIE who absorbs a majority of the losses or absorbs the majority of the rewards generated by the VIE. Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 04-5, Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights requires that the general partner in a partnership that is not a VIE consolidate the partnership, because the general partner is deemed to control the partnership where the other limited partner do not have substantive kick-out or participation rights. Investments of consolidated investment products include the investments of both consolidated VIEs and partnerships that have been consolidated under EITF 04-5. As of December 31, 2007, investments of consolidated investment products totaled $1,205.6 million (2006: $1,482.0 million). These investments are offset primarily in minority interests on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, as the company equity investment in these structures is very small. The decrease from 2006 reflects the deconsolidation of certain previously-consolidated VIEs resulting from the company determination that it was no longer was the primary beneficiary of these entities. 35 Table of Contents Goodwill Goodwill increased from $6,360.7 million at December 31, 2006 to $6,848.0 million at December 31, 2007 primarily due to the impact of foreign currency translation for certain subsidiaries whose functional currency differs from that of the parent. The weakening of the U.S. dollar during 2007, mainly against that of the Canadian dollar, resulted in a $332.4 million increase in goodwill, upon consolidation, with a corresponding increase to equity. Additional goodwill was also recorded in 2007 related to the earn-out on the Power Shares acquisition ($129.6 million), the earn-out on the Stein Roe acquisition ($11.3 million) and other acquisition-related adjustments ($17.0 million). Current Portion of Long-term Debt This balance decreased from December 31, 2006 as a result of the maturity and repayment, on January 15, 2007, of $300.0 million of 5.9% senior notes. Long-term Debt The increase in this balance was due to the issuance of $300.0 million of 5.625% senior notes on April 17, 2007. Minority interests in equity of consolidated entities Minority interests in equity of consolidated entities decreased from $1,504.6 million at December 31, 2006 to $1,121.2 million at December 31, 2007 primarily due to the deconsolidation of VIEs for which the company determined that it was no longer the primary beneficiary of the arrangements as a result of reconsideration events. The minority interests in equity of consolidated entities are generally offset by the investments of consolidated investment products, as the company equity investment in the investment products is very small. Total Equity Shareholders equity increased from $6,164.0 million at December 31, 2006 to $6,590.6 million at December 31, 2007, an increase of $426.6 million. The increase included net income of $673.6 million, share issuance on employee option exercises of $137.4 million, and foreign currency translation gains of $351.1 million with respect to subsidiaries whose functional currency differs from that of the parent. These increases were partially offset by $352.9 million in share repurchases under a plan initiated in June 2007 and share purchases of $330.8 million to be held by employee trusts in association with share-based compensation arrangements. Liquidity and Capital Resources The existing capital structure of the company, together with the cash flow from operations and borrowings under the credit facility, should provide the company with sufficient resources to meet present and future cash needs. We believe that our cash flow from operations and credit facilities, together with our ability to obtain alternative sources of financing, will enable us to meet operating, debt and other obligations as they come due and anticipated future capital requirements. Invesco has local capital requirements in several jurisdictions, as well as regional requirements for entities that are part of the European sub-group. These requirements require the retention of liquid resources in those jurisdictions, which we meet in part by holding cash. This retained cash can be used for general business purposes in the European sub-group or in the countries where it is located. Due to the capital restrictions, the ability to transfer cash between certain jurisdictions may be limited. In addition, transfers of cash between international jurisdictions may have adverse tax consequences that may substantially limit such activity. At December 31, 2007, the European sub-group had cash and cash equivalent balances of $758.1 million, much of which is used to satisfy these regulatory requirements. We are in compliance with all regulatory minimum net capital requirements. 36 Table of Contents Cash Flows The ability to consistently generate cash from operations in excess of capital expenditures and dividend payments is one of our company fundamental financial strengths. Operations continue to be financed from current earnings and borrowings. Our principal uses of cash, other than for operating expenses, include dividend payments, capital expenditures, acquisitions, purchase of our shares in the open market and investments in certain new investment products. Cash flows of consolidated investment products (discussed in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 18, Consolidated Investment Products) are reflected in Invesco cash provided by operating activities, provided by/(used in) investing activities and used in financing activities. Cash held by consolidated investment products is not available for general use by Invesco, nor is Invesco cash available for general use by its consolidated investment products. Cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 are summarized as follows: $ in millions 2007 2006 2005 Cash flow from: Operating activities 913.7 455.9 306.9 Investing activities (46.4 ) (258.7 ) 112.0 Financing activities (740.8 ) (163.1 ) (251.0 ) Increase/(decrease) in cash and cash equivalents 126.5 34.1 167.9 Cash and cash equivalents, beginning of year 778.9 709.5 546.9 Foreign exchange 10.4 35.3 (5.3 ) Cash and cash equivalents, end of year* 915.8 778.9 709.5 * Included in cash and cash equivalents are $3.3 million of client cash (2006: $2.9 million; 2005: $227.1 million). The decrease in client cash was due primarily to one depository account sponsored by our former banking subsidiary being replaced by an unaffiliated investment fund. Operating Activities Cash provided by operating activities is generated by the receipt of investment management and other fees generated from AUM, offset by operating expenses. Cash provided by operating activities in 2007 was $913.7 million, an increase of $457.8 million or 100.4% over 2006. Changes in operating assets and liabilities contributed $307.2 million of the increase, and higher net income contributed $190.9 million of the increase in cash flows generated from operating activities. Cash provided by operating activities in 2006 was $455.9 million, an increase of $149.0 million 48.6% over 2005. The increase was reduced by the decline in customer and counterparty payables, a component of current liabilities, resulting from one depository account sponsored by our former banking subsidiary being replaced by an unaffiliated investment fund. Investing Activities In our institutional operations, we periodically invest through a relatively small portion of the unrated, junior subordinated position in our collateralized loan and debt obligation structures and in our private equity funds, as is customary in the industry. Other investors into these structures have no recourse against the company for any losses sustained in the structures. Many of our private equity products are structured as limited partnerships. Our investment may take the form of the general partner or as a limited partner. We received $10.1 million (2006: $13.6 million; 2005: $13.4 million) in return of capital from such investments. We also make seed investments in affiliated funds to assist in the launch of new funds. During 2007, we invested $21.6 million in new funds and recaptured $4.8 million from redemptions of prior investments. During the fiscal years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, our capital expenditures were $36.7 million, $37.9 million and $38.8 million, respectively. These expenditures related principally in each year to technology initiatives, including new platforms from which we maintain our portfolio management systems and fund accounting systems, improvements in computer hardware and software desktop 37 Table of Contents products for employees, new telecommunications products to enhance our internal information flow, and back-up disaster recovery systems. Also, in each year, a portion of these costs related to leasehold improvements made to the various buildings and workspaces used in our offices. These projects have been funded with proceeds from our operating cash flows. During the fiscal years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, our capital divestitures were not significant relative to our total fixed assets. Net cash outflows of $56.0 million in 2007 and $200.1 million in 2006 related primarily to the acquisitions of PowerShares and WL Ross & Co. In 2005, we received $53.6 million in cash from business dispositions, primarily related to the sale of the retirement business. Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities increased from $163.1 million in 2006 to $740.8 million in 2007, primarily due to the purchase of shares held by employee trusts (held in treasury) totaling $363.1 million and the purchase of treasury shares totaling $352.9 million under our share repurchase program. Net cash used in financing activities decreased from $251.0 million in 2005 to $163.1 million in 2006 as the increase in net inflows from share issuances and borrowings offset the increase in dividends paid and purchase of shares to meet the requirements of share-based compensation awards. A summary of shares purchased by month for the fourth quarter of 2007 is presented in Part II, Item 5, Market for Registrant Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities . Dividends An interim dividend of $0.164 per INVESCO PLC American Depositary share was declared on August 2, 2007 and paid on October 25, 2007. On February 1, 2008, the board of directors declared a final (semi-annual) 2007 dividend of $0.22 per Invesco Ltd. common share, payable on April 7, 2008, to shareholders of record as of March 19, 2008. Shareholders who have a United Kingdom address and are directly registered with our transfer agent, The Bank of New York Mellon, will receive the dividend in Sterling. The following table sets forth the historical amounts for interim, final and total dividends per American Depositary Share in respect of each year indicated: U.S. Cents per American Depositary Share Years Ended December 31, Interim Final Total 2003 16.63 23.31 39.94 2004 9.02 19.00 28.02 2005 14.02 20.33 34.35 2006 15.40 20.80 36.20 2007 16.40 22.00 (1) 38.40 (1) The final dividend for 2007 was declared on February 1, 2008. The scheduled payment date is April 7, 2008 to shareholders of record on March 19, 2008. If dividends will be paid in the future, they will be declared in U.S. dollars on a quarterly basis. The declaration, payment and amount of any future dividends will be declared by our board of directors and will depend upon, among other factors, our earnings, financial condition and capital requirements at the time such declaration and payment are considered. The board of directors has a policy of managing dividends in a prudent fashion, with due consideration given to income levels, overall cash and debt levels, and historical dividend payouts. 38 Table of Contents Debt Our total indebtedness at December 31, 2007 is $1,276.4 million and is comprised of the following: $ in millions Unsecured Senior Notes: 5.9% due January 15, 2007 4.5% due December 15, 2009 300.0 5.625% due April 17, 2012 300.0 5.375% due February 27, 2013 350.0 5.375% due December 15, 2014 200.0 Floating rate credit facility expiring March 31, 2010 126.4 Total long-term debt 1,276.4 Less: current maturities of long-term debt Long-term debt 1,276.4 Debt proceeds have been used by the company to form part of the consideration paid for acquisitions and also for the integration of the acquired businesses over time. On January 16, 2007, $300.0 million of our 5.9% senior notes matured and was paid using a draw on our credit facility. On April 17, 2007 the company issued $300.0 million five-year 5.625% senior notes. The net proceeds from the offering were used to repay amounts outstanding under our credit facility and for general corporate purposes. Interest is paid semi-annually on the senior notes. The senior notes are unsecured. On March 31, 2005, we entered into a five-year unsecured $900.0 million credit facility with a group of lenders that was amended and restated in December 2007 in conjunction with the redomicile and relisting of the company. The company draws and repays its credit facility balances and utilizes the credit facility for working capital and other cash needs. The financial covenants under our credit agreement include a leverage ratio of not greater than 3.25:1.00 (debt/EBITDA, as defined in the credit facility) and an interest coverage ratio of not less than 4.00:1.00 (EBITDA as defined in the credit facility/interest payable for the four consecutive fiscal quarters). The breach of any covenant would result in a default under the credit facility, which could lead to lenders requiring all balances under the credit facility, together with accrued interest and other fees, to be immediately due and payable. This credit facility also contains customary affirmative operating covenants and negative covenants that, among other things, restrict certain of our subsidiaries ability to incur debt, transfer assets, merge, make loans and other investments and create liens. As of December 31, 2007, we were in compliance with our debt covenants. The coverage ratios, as defined in our credit facility, were as follows during 2007, 2006 and 2005: 2007 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Leverage Ratio 1.18 0.97 0.91 1.04 Interest Coverage Ratio 12.96 13.54 14.30 17.81 2006 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Leverage Ratio 1.62 1.60 1.46 1.24 Interest Coverage Ratio 9.22 10.69 11.67 12.93 2005 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Leverage Ratio 1.95 1.80 1.73 1.82 Interest Coverage Ratio 8.00 7.58 7.53 8.13 We have received credit ratings of A3 and BBB+ from Moody and Standard & Poor credit rating agencies, respectively, as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Both Standard & Poor and Moody have a stable outlook for the rating as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. According to Moody s, obligations rated A are considered upper medium grade and are subject to low credit risk. Invesco rating of A3 is at the low end of the A range (A1, A2, A3), but three notches above the lowest investment grade rating of Baa3. Standard and Poor rating of BBB+ is at the upper end of the BBB rating, with BBB- representing Standard and Poor lowest investment grade rating. According to Standard and Poor s, BBB obligations exhibit adequate protection parameters; however adverse economic conditions or changing circumstances are more likely to lead to a weakened capacity of the obligor to meet its financial commitments. We believe that rating agency concerns include but are not limited to: our ability to sustain net positive asset flows across customer channels, product type and geographies, our substantial indebtedness, and our ability to maintain consistent positive investment performance. 39 Table of Contents Material deterioration of these factors, and others defined by each rating agency, could result in downgrades to our credit ratings, thereby limiting our ability to generate additional financing or receive mandates. Because our credit facility borrowing rates are not tied to credit ratings, and interest rates on our outstanding senior notes are fixed, there is no direct correlation between changes in ratings and interest expense of the company. However, management believes that solid investment grade ratings are an important factor in winning and maintaining institutional business and strives to manage the company to maintain such ratings. Disclosure of these ratings is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold our debt. These credit ratings may be subject to revision or withdrawal at anytime by Moody or Standard & Poor s. Each rating should be evaluated independently. Credit and Liquidity Risk Capital management involves the management of the company liquidity and cash flows. The company manages its capital by reviewing annual and projected cash flow forecasts and by monitoring credit, liquidity and market risks, such as interest rate and foreign currency risks (as discussed in Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk ), through measurement and analysis. The company is primarily exposed to credit risk through its cash and cash equivalent deposits, which are held by external firms. The company invests its cash balances with high credit-quality financial institutions; however, we have chosen to limit the number of firms with which we invest. These arrangements create exposure to concentrations of credit risk. Credit Risk Credit risk is the risk that one party to a financial instrument will cause a financial loss for the other party by failing to discharge an obligation. The company is subject to credit risk in the following areas of its business: All cash and cash equivalent balances are subject to credit risk, as they represent deposits made by the company with external banks and other institutions. As of December 31, 2007, our maximum exposure to credit risk related to our cash and cash equivalent balances is $915.8 million. Certain trust subsidiaries of the company accept deposits and place deposits with other institutions on behalf of our customers. As of December 31, 2007, our maximum exposure to credit risk related to these transactions is $3.3 million. The company does not utilize credit derivatives or similar instruments to mitigate the maximum exposure to credit risk. The company does not expect any counterparties to its financial instruments to fail to meet their obligations. Liquidity Risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the company will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with its financial liabilities. The company is exposed to liquidity risk through its $1,276.4 million in total long-term debt. The company actively manages liquidity risk by preparing cash flow forecasts for future periods, reviewing them regularly with senior management, maintaining a committed credit facility, scheduling significant gaps between major debt maturities and engaging external financing sources in regular dialog. Effects of Inflation Inflation can impact our organization primarily in two ways. First, inflationary pressures can result in increases in our cost structure, especially to the extent that large expense components such as compensation are impacted. To the degree that these expense increases are not recoverable or cannot be counterbalanced through pricing increases due to the competitive environment, our profitability could be negatively impacted. Secondly, the value of the investments that we manage may be negatively impacted when inflationary expectations result in a rising interest rate environment. Declines in the values of these investments could lead to reduced revenues as management fees are generally calculated based upon the size of assets under management. Off Balance Sheet Commitments The company transacts with various private equity, real estate and other investment entities sponsored by the company for the investment of client assets in the normal course of business. Certain of these investments are considered to be variable interest entities of which the company 40 Table of Contents is the primary beneficiary and certain of these investments are limited partnerships for which the company is the general partner and is deemed to have control (with the absence of substantive kick-out or participation rights of the other limited partners) and are consolidated into the company financial statements under EITF 04-5 (see Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 18, Consolidated Investment Products and Note 1, Accounting Policies for additional information on consolidated and unconsolidated investment products). Many of our private equity products are structured as limited partnerships. Our investment may take the form of the general partner or as a limited partner. The private equity funds are structured such that each partner makes capital commitments that are to be drawn down over the life of the partnership as investment opportunities are identified. At December 31, 2007, our undrawn capital commitments were $60.2 million (2006: $19.2 million). The volatility and valuation dislocations that occurred during 2007 in certain sectors of the fixed income market have generated some pricing issues in many areas of the market. As a result of these valuation dislocations, during the fourth quarter of 2007, Invesco elected to enter into contingent support agreements for two of its investment trusts to enable them to sustain a stable pricing structure. These two trusts are unregistered trusts that invest in fixed income securities and are available only to accredited investors. The fair value of these agreements at December 31, 2007 was estimated to be $4.5 million, which was recorded in other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at that date. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the maximum support that could be provided under these agreements is $33.0 million. No payments have been made under either agreement nor has Invesco realized any losses from the support agreements through the date of this Report. These trusts were not consolidated because the company was not deemed to be the primary beneficiary under FIN 46R. Contractual Obligations We have various financial obligations that require future cash payments. The following table outlines the timing of payment requirements related to our commitments as of December 31, 2007: Within 1-3 3-5 More Than $ in millions Total 1 Year Years Years 5 Years Total debt 1,276.4 426.4 300.0 550.0 Estimated interest payments on total debt (1) 290.1 59.9 106.4 92.9 30.9 Finance leases 0.4 0.1 0.1 0.2 Operating leases (2) 588.0 64.5 121.0 99.8 302.7 Defined benefit pension and post-retirement medical obligations (3) 428.7 10.9 21.9 27.2 368.7 Acquisition liabilities (4) 129.6 129.6 Total 2,713.2 265.0 675.8 520.1 1,252.3 (1) Total debt includes $1,150.0 million of fixed rate debt. Fixed interest payments are therefore reflected in the table above in the periods they are due. The credit facility, $900.0 million at December 31, 2007, provides for borrowings of various maturities. Interest is payable based upon LIBOR, Prime, Federal Funds or other bank-provided rates in existence at the time of each borrowing. Estimated credit facility interest payments in the table above are based upon an assumption that the credit facility balance of $126.4 million and the interest rate that existed at December 31, 2007 will remain until credit facility maturity on March 31, 2010. (2) Operating leases reflect obligations for leased building space and sponsorship and naming rights agreements . See Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 20, Operating Leases for sublease information. (3) See Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 21, Retirement Benefit Plans for detailed benefit pension and post-retirement plans. (4) Acquisition liabilities include deferred consideration payable in respect of the PowerShares and HVB acquisitions. Other contingent payments related to acquisitions at December 31, 2007 include $500.0 million related to the PowerShares acquisition and $220.0 million related to the WL Ross & Co. acquisition, which are excluded until such time as they are probable and reasonably estimable. (5) Due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2007, the company is unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities. Therefore, $69.0 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. See Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 16 Taxation for a discussion on income taxes. 41 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our significant accounting policies are disclosed in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 1, Accounting Policies to our Consolidated Financial Statements, contained elsewhere within this Report. The accounting policies and estimates that we believe are the most critical to an understanding of our results of operations and financial condition are those that require complex management judgment regarding matters that are highly uncertain at the time policies were applied and estimates were made. These accounting policies and estimates are discussed below. Different estimates reasonably could have been used in the current period that would have had a material effect on these financial statements, and changes in these estimates are likely to occur from period-to-period in the future. Share-Based Compensation. We have issued equity-settled share-based awards to certain employees, which are measured at fair value at the date of grant. These awards consist of restricted and deferred share incentive awards and share option awards. Time-vested awards vest ratably over or cliff-vest at the end of a period of continued employee service. Performance-vested awards cliff-vest at the end of a defined vesting period of continued employee service upon the company attainment of certain performance criteria, generally the attainment of cumulative EPS growth targets at the end of the vesting period reflecting a compound annual growth rate of between 10.0% and 15.0% per annum during a three-year period. Time-vested and performance-vested share incentive awards are granted in the form of restricted shares or deferred share awards. Dividends accrued directly to the employee holder of restricted shares, and cash payments in lieu of dividends are made to employee holders of certain deferred share awards. There is therefore no discount to the fair value of these share incentive awards at their grant date. The fair value of these awards is determined at the grant date and is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the company estimate of shares that will eventually vest. The forfeiture rate applied to most grants is 5% per annum, based upon our historical experience with respect to employee turnover. Fair value for restricted and deferred share awards representing equity interests identical to those associated with shares traded in the open market are determined using the market price at the time of grant. Fair value is measured by use of the Black Scholes valuation model for certain deferred share incentive awards that do not include dividend rights and a stochastic model (a lattice-based model) for share option awards. The expected life of share-based payment awards used in these models is adjusted, based on management best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioral considerations. Changes in the assumptions used in the stochastic valuation model for share option awards, as well as changes in the company estimates of vesting (including the company evaluation of performance conditions associated with certain share-based payment awards and assumptions used in determining award lapse rates) could have a material impact on the share-based payment charge recorded in each year. Assumptions used in association with option awards granted during 2005 are presented in the table below (no option awards were granted in 2006 or 2007). 2005 Weighted average share price * 876p Weighted average exercise price * 878p Expected volatility 52.0 % Expected term 7.8 years Risk free rate 4.2 % Expected dividends 2.2 % * Share option prices are in pounds sterling, the currency of the awards. Upon exercise, the exercise price will be converted to U. S. dollars using the rate prevailing on the exercise date. Deferred share awards that do not include dividend rights or cash payments in lieu of dividends are valued using the Black-Scholes model. There were no such awards granted in 2007. The assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model for these awards granted in 2006 and 2005 are as follows: 2006 2005 Weighted average share price * 1034p 666p Expected term 5.3 years 4.0 years Expected dividend yield 1.84 % 2.25 % * Share option prices are in pounds sterling, the currency of the awards. Upon exercise, the exercise price will be converted to U. S. dollars using the rate prevailing on the exercise date. 42 Table of Contents The table below is a summary, as of December 31, 2007, of equity-settled stock-based compensation awards outstanding under the company non-retirement stock-based compensation programs.

See Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 17, Earnings Per Share. Other Compensation Arrangements. We offer certain performance-based cash awards to many of our employees that are based upon purely discretionary determinations or, alternatively, certain formulaic compensation arrangements. The formulaic arrangements require that we monitor on an ongoing basis whether or not pre-established metrics are expected to be met in order to properly record the related expense amounts. Because many of the metrics relate to matters that are highly uncertain or susceptible to change, our estimates may not accurately reflect the ultimate outcomes that will be achieved, and associated expense that should be recognized, with respect to these compensation arrangements. 43 Table of Contents Taxation. After compensation and related costs, our provision for income taxes on our earnings is our largest annual expense. We operate in several countries and several states through our various subsidiaries, and must allocate our income, expenses, and earnings under the various laws and regulations of each of these taxing jurisdictions. Accordingly, our provision for income taxes represents our total estimate of the liability that we have incurred for doing business each year in all of our locations. Annually we file tax returns that represent our filing positions within each jurisdiction and settle our return liabilities. Each jurisdiction has the right to audit those returns and may take different positions with respect to income and expense allocations and taxable earnings determinations. Because the determinations of our annual provisions are subject to judgments and estimates, it is possible that actual results will vary from those recognized in our financial statements. As a result, it is likely that additions to, or reductions of, income tax expense will occur each year for prior reporting periods as actual tax returns and tax audits are settled. Income taxes are provided for in accordance with FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts in the Consolidated Financial Statements, using the statutory tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. As a multinational corporation, the company operates in various locations outside of Bermuda and generates substantially all of its earnings from our subsidiaries. Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxes that would be payable on the unremitted earnings of the company subsidiaries, consolidated investment products, and joint ventures, except where it is our intention to continue to indefinitely reinvest the undistributed earnings. Our Canadian and U.S. subsidiaries continue to be directly owned by Invesco Holding Company Limited (formerly INVESCO PLC, our predecessor company), which is directly owned by Invesco Ltd. Our Canadian unremitted earnings, for which we are indefinitely reinvested, are estimated to be $880 million at December 31, 2007 compared with $600 million at December 31, 2006. If distributed as a dividend, Canadian withholding tax of 5.0% would be due. Deferred tax liabilities in the amount of $14.1million (2006: $7.0 million) for additional U.K. tax have been recognized for unremitted earnings of certain subsidiaries that have regularly remitted earnings and are expected to continue to remit earnings in the foreseeable future. Dividends from our investment in the U.S. should not give rise to additional tax as there is no withholding tax between the U.S. and U.K., the underlying U.S. tax rate is greater than the U.K. tax rate, and we have U.K. tax credits available. There are no additional taxes on dividends from the U.K. to Bermuda. 44 Table of Contents Net deferred tax assets have been recognized in the U.S., U.K., and Canada based on management belief that operating income and capital gains will, more likely than not, be sufficient to realize the benefits of these assets over time. In the event that actual results differ from these estimates, or if our historical trends of positive operating income in any of these locations changes, we may be required to record a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets, which may have a significant effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Invesco adopted the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 , ( FIN 48 ) on January 1, 2007. This interpretation prescribes a specific recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The two-step process prescribed by FIN 48 for evaluating a tax position involves first determining whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing authorities. If it is, the second step then requires a company to measure this tax position benefit as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. As a result of the implementation of FIN 48, Invesco increased its net tax contingencies liability by $17.6 million. The increase in the liability and the related change in deferred taxes were accounted for as a decrease to retained earnings at January 1, 2007. Invesco classifies any interest and penalties on tax liabilities (or any overpayments) on the Consolidated Statements of Income as components of income tax expense. Goodwill. Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the net of the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed and is recorded in the functional currency of the acquired entity. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the single reporting unit level on an annual basis, or more often if events or circumstances indicate that impairment may exist. If the carrying amount of goodwill at the reporting unit exceeds its implied fair value, then a charge for the excess would be recorded as an impairment loss. The principal method of determining fair value of the reporting unit is an income approach where future cash flows are discounted to arrive at a single present value amount. The discount rate used is derived based on the time value of money and the risk profile of the stream of future cash flows. Recent results and projections based on expectations regarding revenues, expenses, capital expenditures and acquisition earn out payments produce a present value for the reporting unit. While the company believes all assumptions utilized in our assessment are reasonable and appropriate, changes in these estimates could produce different fair value amounts and therefore different goodwill impairment assessments. The most sensitive of these assumptions are the estimated cash flows and the use of our weighted average cost of capital as the discount rate to determine present value. The company also utilizes a market approach to provide a secondary fair value of the reporting unit by using comparable company and transaction multiples to estimate values for our single reporting unit. Discretion and judgment is required in determining whether the transaction data available represents information for companies of comparable nature, scope and size. 45 Table of Contents We have determined that we have one reporting unit as defined under FASB Statement No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information. Our goodwill impairment testing conducted during 2007 and 2006 indicated that there was no impairment at the reporting unit level. With respect to the 2007 impairment test, neither a 5.0% increase in the discount rate, nor the impact on revenues of a 5.0% reduction in our assumed AUM would have changed the conclusion. The company cannot predict the occurrence of future events that might adversely affect the reported value of goodwill that totaled $6,848.0 million and $6,360.7 million at December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006, respectively. Such events include, but are not limited to, strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions, the impact of the economic environment on the company assets under management, or a material negative change in assets under management and related management fees. Investments. Most of our investments are carried at fair value on our balance sheet with the periodic mark-to-market recorded either in accumulated other comprehensive income in the case of available-for-sale investments or directly to earnings in the case of trading assets. Fair value is generally determined by reference to an active trading market, using quoted close or bid prices as of each reporting period end. When a readily ascertainable market value does not exist for an investment (such as our collateralized loan and debt obligations, discussed below) the fair value is calculated based on the expected cash flows of its underlying net asset base, taking into account applicable discount rates and other factors. Since assumptions are made in determining the fair values of investments for which active markets do not exist, the actual value that may be realized upon the sale of these investments could differ from the current carrying values. Fair value calculations are also required in association with our quarterly impairment testing of investments. The accuracy of our other than temporary impairment assessments are dependent upon the extent to which we are able to accurately determine fair values. The company provides investment management services to a number of collateralized loan and debt obligation entities (CLO/CDOs). These entities are investment vehicles created for the sole purpose of issuing collateralized loan and debt instruments that offer investors the opportunity for returns that vary with the risk level of their investment. The notes issued by the CLO/CDOs are backed by diversified portfolios consisting primarily of loans or structured debt. The company earns investment management fees, including subordinated management fees in some cases, for managing the collateral for the CLO/CDO entities, as well as incentive fees that are contingent on certain performance conditions. The company has invested in certain of the entities, generally taking a relatively small portion of the unrated, junior subordinated position. At December 31, 2007, the company held $39.0 million of investment in these CLO/CDOs, which represents its maximum risk of loss. Our interests in collateralized loan or debt entities are generally subordinated to other interests in the entity and entitles the investor to receive the residual cash flows, if any, from the entity. As a result, the company investment is sensitive to changes in the credit quality of the issuers of the collateral securities, including changes in the forecasted default rates and any declines in anticipated recovery rates. Investors in CLO/CDOs have no recourse against the company for any losses sustained in the CLO/CDO structure. Management has concluded that the company is not the primary beneficiary of any of the CLO/CDO entities and it has recorded its investments at fair value primarily using discounted cash flow analyses. The excess of actual and anticipated future cash flows over the initial investment at the date of purchase is recognized as interest income over the life of the investment using the effective yield method in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) 99-20, Recognition of Interest Income and Impairment on Purchased and Retained Beneficial Interests in Securitized Financial Assets. The company reviews cash flow estimates throughout the life of each CLO/CDO entity. Cash flow estimates are based on the underlying pool of securities and take into account the overall credit quality of the issuers, the forecasted default rate of the securities and the company past experience in managing similar securities. If the updated estimate of future cash flows (taking into account both timing and amounts) is less than the last revised estimate, an impairment loss is recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its fair value and is recorded through the income statement if the decline in value is determined to be other than temporary. Fair value is determined using current information, notably market yields and projected cash flows based on forecasted default and recovery rates that a market participant would use in determining the current fair value of the equity interest. Market yields, default rates and recovery rates used in the company estimate of fair value vary based on the nature of the investments in the underlying collateral pools. In periods of rising credit default rates and lower debt recovery rates, the fair value, and therefore carrying value, of the company investments in these CLO/CDO entities may be adversely affected. An increase or decrease in the discount rate of 1.0% would change the valuation of the CLO/CDOs by $0.9 million (2006: $1.2 million; 2005: $1.3 million). 46 Table of Contents Consolidated Investment Products . Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation (FIN) No. 46(R), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51 requires that the primary beneficiary of variable interest entities (VIEs) consolidate the VIEs. A VIE is an entity that does not have sufficient equity to finance its operations without additional subordinated financial support, or an entity for which the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests. Generally, limited partnership entities where the general partner does not have substantive equity investment at risk and where the other limited partners do not have substantive (greater than 50%) rights to remove the general partner or to dissolve the limited partnership are also VIEs. The primary beneficiary is the party to the VIE who absorbs a majority of the losses or retains the majority of the rewards generated by the VIE. Additionally, certain investment products are structured as limited partnerships of which the company is the general partner and is deemed to have control with the lack of substantive kick-out or participation rights of the other limited partners. These investment products are also consolidated into the company financial statements under Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 04-5, Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights. Assessing if an entity is a VIE or an entity falling under the consolidation requirements of EITF 04-5 involves judgment and analysis on a structure-by-structure basis. Factors included in this assessment include the legal organization of the entity, the company contractual involvement with the entity and any related party or defacto agent implications of the company involvement with the entity. Determining if the company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE also requires significant judgment, as the calculation of expected losses and residual returns involves estimation and probability assumptions. If current financial statements are not available for consolidated VIEs or an investment product consolidated under EITF 04-5, estimation of investment valuation is required, which includes assessing portfolio activity since the last financial statement date and making inquiries of the fund manager. Significant changes in these assumptions could impact the reported value of the investments held by consolidated investment products and the related minority interest. As of December 31, 2007, the company consolidated VIEs that held investments of $826.5 million (2006: $1,227.8 million) and partnership investments under EITF 04-5 of $379.1 million (2006: $254.2 million) and also determined that certain previously-consolidated VIEs should be deconsolidated since the company no longer was the primary beneficiary of these entities. As circumstances, supporting estimates and factors change, the determination of VIE and primary beneficiary status may change, as could the determination of the necessity of consolidation under EITF 04-5. Contingencies. Contingencies arise when we have a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event that is both probable and reasonably estimable. We must from time to time make material estimates with respect to legal and other contingencies. The nature of our business requires compliance with various state and federal statutes and exposes us to a variety of legal proceedings and matters in the ordinary course of business. While the outcomes of matters such as these are inherently uncertain and difficult to predict, we maintain reserves reflected in other current and other non-current liabilities, as appropriate, for identified losses that are, in our judgment, probable and reasonably estimable. Management judgment is based on the advice of legal counsel, ruling on various motions by the court where a complaint against the company has been filed, review of the outcome of similar matters, if applicable, and review of guidance from state or federal agencies, if applicable. Deferred contingent consideration payable in relation to a business acquisition is recorded when the outcome of the contingency is resolved and the consideration is issued or becomes issuable.
