ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OVERVIEW The Company is the largest operator of retail farm and ranch stores in the United States, focused on supplying the lifestyle needs of recreational farmers and ranchers and those who enjoy the rural lifestyle, as well as tradesmen and small businesses. Stores are located in towns outlying major metropolitan markets and in rural communities. The Company offers the following comprehensive selection of merchandise: (1) equine, pet and animal products, including items necessary for their health, care, growth and containment; (2) maintenance products for agricultural and rural use; (3) hardware and tool products; (4) seasonal products, including lawn and garden power equipment; (5) truck, trailer and towing products; and (6) work clothing for the entire family. The Company's stores currently range in size from approximately 7,000 to 23,000 square feet of inside selling space and also utilize outside selling space. Currently, the Company is developing stores utilizing one of five standard prototypes. These prototypes typically range in size from 17,000 square feet of inside selling space to 18,700 square feet of inside selling space and all prototypes utilize outside selling space. The Company also utilizes existing store structures which typically range in size from 17,000 to 19,000 square feet of inside selling space and also utilize outside selling space. The Company operated 515 retail farm and ranch stores in 32 states as of December 25, 2004. The fiscal year of the Company includes 52 or 53 weeks and ends on the last Saturday of the calendar year. References to fiscal year mean the year in which that fiscal year began. Each of the fiscal years ended December 25, 2004, December 27, 2003 and December 28, 2002 contain 52 weeks. (Fiscal 2005 will be a 53-week year.) The Company's current and long-term growth strategy is to (1) expand geographic market presence, through opening new retail stores, (2) enhance financial performance through same-store sales increases, achieved through aggressive merchandising programs with an "everyday low prices" philosophy, supported by strong customer service, and (3) leverage operating costs, especially advertising and distribution. The Company has experienced considerable growth in recent years, including the addition of 113 stores in fiscal 2002, including a single acquisition of 87 stores, 31 in fiscal 2003 and 53 in fiscal 2004. This growth has increased the Company's market presence in the Southwest, primarily in Texas; in the Southeast, primarily in Florida; in the central northern part of the United States, primarily in Ohio, Michigan and Indiana; and in the Northeast, primarily in New York and Pennsylvania. During fiscal 2004, the Company opened its first stores in Connecticut and California. The Company operated 515 stores in 32 states as of December 25, 2004 and has plans to open 60 to 65 stores in fiscal 2005 and 70 to 76 stores in fiscal 2006. The Company believes it has developed a proven method for selecting store sites and has identified over 800 potential additional markets for new stores in the United States. In addition, the Company continues to identify opportunities to relocate existing stores. The Company plans to relocate a total of 20 to 25 stores in fiscal 2005 and additional stores each year over the next several years. Store relocations are typically undertaken to move small, older stores to full-size formats in improved retail areas. The Company has relocated 55 stores since 2001. The Company has placed significant emphasis on its merchandising programs, evaluating the sales and profitability of its products through detailed line reviews, review of vendor performance measures and modification of the overall product offerings. These efforts, coupled with a strong marketing program and in-depth product knowledge training of store employees, have enhanced sales and financial performance. RESTATEMENT OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS On February 7, 2005, the Office of the Chief Accountant of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") issued a letter to the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants expressing its views regarding certain operating lease accounting issues and their application under generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). In light of this letter, the Company's management initiated a review of its lease-related accounting methods and determined that the Company's methods of accounting for (1) amortization of leasehold improvements, (2) leasehold improvements funded by landlord incentives and (3) rent expense prior to commencement of operations and rent payments, while in line with common industry practice, were not in accordance with GAAP. As a result, the Company restated its consolidated financial statements for each of the fiscal years ended December 27, 2003 and December 28, 2002, and the first three quarters of fiscal 2004 included in this Report. 13 <PAGE> Previously the Company had amortized its leasehold improvements over the shorter of (1) the estimated life of the asset, or (2) the lease term, including the first five-year renewal option for initial term leases of 10 years or less. Management determined that the appropriate interpretation of the lease term under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 13, "Accounting for Leases," ("SFAS 13") is the sum of the fixed noncancellable term and any options where, at the inception of the lease, renewal is reasonably assured. Management determined that renewal of the majority of lease terms associated with leasehold improvements whose useful lives included the option period, while expected, were not reasonably assured under SFAS 13. Accordingly, the Company accelerated the amortization of those leasehold improvements to coincide with the end of the fixed noncancellable term of the lease. Additionally, the Company had historically accounted for leasehold improvements funded by landlord incentives as reductions in the cost of the related leasehold improvements reflected in the consolidated balance sheets and the capital expenditures reflected in investing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. Management determined that the appropriate interpretation of Financial Accounting Standards Board Technical Bulletin No. 88-1, "Issues Relating to Accounting for Leases," requires these incentives to be recorded as deferred rent liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets and as a component of operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. Additionally, this adjustment resulted in a reclassification of the deferred rent amortization from depreciation and amortization expense to selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income and included as an additional cost component of capital expenditures in investing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. Finally, the Company had historically recognized rent holiday periods on a straight-line basis over the lease term commencing on the related retail store opening date. The store opening date coincides with the commencement of business operations, which is the intended use of the property. Management re-evaluated Financial Accounting Standards Board Technical Bulletin No. 85-3, "Accounting for Operating Leases with Scheduled Rent Increases," and determined that, consistent with the letter issued by the Office of the Chief Accountant, the lease term should include the pre-opening period of construction, renovation, fixturing and merchandise placement (typically two to six months prior to store opening). The correction of this error requires the Company to record additional deferred rent in other accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities and to adjust retained earnings in the consolidated balance sheets, as well as to restate rent expense in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income. The cumulative effect of these corrections is a reduction to retained earnings of $3.0 million (net of taxes of $1.7 million) as of the beginning of fiscal 2002 and reductions to retained earnings of $1.3 million (net of taxes of $0.8 million), $0.8 million (net of taxes of $0.4 million) and $0.6 million (net of taxes of $0.4 million) for the fiscal years ended 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. These adjustments did not have any impact on the overall cash flows of the Company. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for a summary of the effects of this restatement on the Company's consolidated balance sheet as of December 27, 2003, as well as the Company's consolidated statements of income and cash flows for fiscal years 2003 and 2002. The accompanying discussion in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations gives effect to these corrections. SEASONALITY AND WEATHER The Company's business is highly seasonal. Historically, the Company's sales and profits have been the highest in the second and fourth fiscal quarters of each year due to the sale of seasonal products. The Company typically operates at approximately break even in the first fiscal quarter of each year. Unseasonable weather, excessive rain, drought, and early or late frosts may also affect the Company's sales. The Company believes, however, that the impact of adverse weather conditions is somewhat mitigated by the geographic dispersion of its stores. The Company experiences a buildup of inventory and accounts payable during its first fiscal quarter each year for purchases of seasonal product in anticipation of the April through June spring selling season and again during its third fiscal quarter in anticipation of the October through December winter selling season. 14 <PAGE> SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Management's discussion and analysis of the Company's financial position and results of operations are based upon the Company's consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make informed estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The Company's significant accounting policies, including areas of critical management judgments and estimates, have primary impact on the following financial statement areas: - Inventory valuation - Self insurance - Sales returns The Company's critical accounting policies are subject to judgments and uncertainties, which affect the application of such policies. (See Note 1 to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this report for a discussion of the Company's critical accounting policies.) The Company's financial position and/or results of operations may be materially different when reported under different conditions or when using different assumptions in the application of such policies. In the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual amounts, adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information. QUARTERLY FINANCIAL DATA As more fully discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its accounting methods for the amortization of leasehold improvements, leasehold improvements funded by landlord incentives, and rent expense prior to commencement of operations and rent payments. The Company's unaudited quarterly operating results for each fiscal quarter of 2004 and 2003, restated to reflect this change, are shown below (in thousands, except per share amounts): <TABLE> <CAPTION> FIRST SECOND THIRD FOURTH 2004 QUARTER QUARTER QUARTER QUARTER TOTAL - ---- --------- --------- --------- --------- ---------- <S> <C> <C> <C> <C> <C> Net sales $ 330,554 $ 525,919 $426,384 $455,986 $1,738,843 Gross margin 99,169 160,543 119,576 145,399 524,687 Income from operations 5,887 49,241 12,128 34,290 101,546 Net income 3,445 31,004 7,612 22,008 64,069 Net income per share: Basic $ 0.09 $ 0.81 $ 0.20 $ 0.58 $ 1.68 Diluted $ 0.08 $ 0.76 $ 0.19 $ 0.54 $ 1.57 Same-store sales increase 12.4% 10.0% 10.1% 7.7% 9.9% FIRST SECOND THIRD FOURTH 2003 QUARTER QUARTER QUARTER QUARTER TOTAL - ---- --------- --------- --------- --------- ---------- Net sales $ 273,760 $ 449,391 $ 361,204 $ 388,530 $1,472,885 Gross margin 80,797 136,292 109,233 122,578 448,900 Income from operations 3,957 43,759 19,626 28,331 95,673 Net income before cumulative effect of accounting change 1,858 27,121 11,900 16,703 57,582 Net income including cumulative effect of accounting change (30) 27,121 11,900 16,703 55,694 Net income per share, before cumulative effect of accounting change: Basic $ 0.05 $ 0.73 $ 0.32 $ 0.45 $ 1.55 Diluted $ 0.05 $ 0.68 $ 0.29 $ 0.41 $ 1.43 Net income per share, including cumulative effect of accounting change: Basic $ 0.00 $ 0.73 $ 0.32 $ 0.45 $ 1.50 Diluted $ 0.00 $ 0.68 $ 0.29 $ 0.41 $ 1.38 Same-store sales increase 3.9% 1.2% 13.7% 9.6% 7.0% </TABLE> 15 <PAGE> The previously reported unaudited quarterly operating results for each fiscal quarter of 2004 and 2003 are shown below (in thousands, except per share amounts): <TABLE> <CAPTION> FIRST SECOND THIRD FOURTH 2004 QUARTER QUARTER QUARTER QUARTER TOTAL - ---- --------- --------- --------- --------- ---------- <S> <C> <C> <C> <C> <C> Net sales $ 330,554 $ 525,919 $426,384 $455,986 $1,738,843 Gross margin 99,169 160,543 119,576 145,399 524,687 Income from operations 6,475 49,823 12,660 34,711 103,669 Net income 3,821 31,376 7,952 22,257 65,406 Net income per share: Basic $ 0.10 $ 0.82 $ 0.21 $ 0.58 $ 1.71 Diluted(a) $ 0.09 $ 0.77 $ 0.20 $ 0.55 $ 1.61 Same-store sales increase 12.4% 10.0% 10.1% 7.7% 9.9% </TABLE> (a) Due to a miscalculation in the determination of diluted shares, the Company previously reported diluted shares of 41,812,000, 41,828,000 and 41,756,000 for the first, second and third quarters of fiscal 2004 which resulted in diluted earnings per share of $0.09, $0.75, and $0.19, respectively.

The table reflects actual and pro-forma information. The pro-forma information provides results as if the fiscal 2003 adoption of EITF 02-16 had occurred prior to fiscal 2002. (See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.) <TABLE> <CAPTION> (PRO-FORMA) 2004 2003 2002 2004 2003 2002 ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ <S> <C> <C> <C> <C> <C> <C> Net sales 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% Cost of merchandise sold 69.8 69.5 71.7 69.8 69.5 69.1 ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ Gross margin 30.2 30.5 28.3 30.2 30.5 30.9 Selling, general and administrative expenses 22.8 22.5 21.5 22.8 22.5 24.2 Depreciation and amortization 1.6 1.5 1.5 1.6 1.5 1.5 ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ Income from operations 5.8 6.5 5.3 5.8 6.5 5.2 Interest expense, net 0.1 0.2 0.4 0.1 0.2 0.4 ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ Income before income taxes 5.7 6.3 4.9 5.7 6.3 4.8 Income tax provision 2.0 2.4 1.8 2.0 2.4 1.7 ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ Net income before cumulative effect of accounting change 3.7 3.9 3.1 3.7 3.9 3.1 Cumulative effect of accounting change -- 0.1 -- -- -- -- ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ Net income 3.7% 3.8% 3.1% 3.7% 3.9% 3.1% ====== ====== ====== ====== ====== ====== </TABLE> FISCAL 2004 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2003 Net sales increased 18.1% to $1,738.8 million in fiscal 2004 from $1,472.9 million in fiscal 2003. This increase resulted from the opening of new stores as well as a same-store sales improvement of 9.9%. The Company's favorable performance versus prior year was driven primarily by the opening of 53 new stores, market share gains in certain markets, continued improvement in merchandising programs and successful implementation of new initiatives in presentation, purchasing and product selection. Same-store sales increases were generally experienced across all product lines, with equine, pet and animal products representing the strongest category. The Company's average ticket increased 4.7% to $39.83 for the twelve months ended fiscal 2004. Increased average transaction counts also contributed to the increase in same-store sales. The same-store sales increase includes an approximate 2.6% gain for fiscal year 2004 which is attributed to increases in selling prices resulting from rising steel, grain and petroleum-related product costs. In fiscal 2004, the Company opened 53 new stores (compared to 31 in the prior year), relocated 20 stores (compared to 18 in the prior year) and closed one store (compared to one in the prior year). As a percent of sales, gross margin decreased 30 basis points to 30.2% for fiscal 2004 from 30.5% for fiscal 2003. Gross margin was negatively impacted primarily by higher than anticipated freight costs (caused primarily by increased fuel costs and demand in the freight industry) and absorption of some of the impact of higher steel and other commodity costs. The impact of cost increases was partially recovered through higher selling prices. As a percent of sales, selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses were 22.8% and 22.5% for fiscal 2004 and 2003, respectively. The loss in SG&A leverage was due primarily to approximately $3.2 million in expenses incurred for the consolidation and relocation of the Company's Store Support Center. Additionally, new store openings trailed behind schedule during the middle of the year, resulting in a reduction of sales leverage for related expenses. Depreciation and amortization expense increased 25.9% in fiscal 2004 over the prior year due mainly to costs associated with new and relocated stores, remodeled existing stores and new distribution facilities. Net interest expense decreased 58.2% in fiscal 2004 from the prior year. This decrease reflects stronger cash flow and less cash requirements for store openings, which resulted in reduced average long-term borrowings under the Company's revolving credit agreement. 17 <PAGE> The Company's effective tax rate was 36.0% for fiscal 2004 compared to 37.6% in the prior year, resulting primarily from a lower effective state income tax rate due to the allocation of income by state. As a result of the foregoing factors, net income for fiscal 2004 increased to $64.1 million, or $1.57 per diluted share, compared to net income of $55.7 million, or $1.38 per diluted share, in the prior year. Exclusive of the cumulative effect of the change in 2003 in the Company's method of accounting for consideration received from vendors, net income for fiscal 2003 was $57.6 million or $1.43 per diluted share. The increase in net income for fiscal 2004 is primarily a result of the factors discussed above and leveraging operating costs with the opening of new stores. FISCAL 2003 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2002 Net sales increased 21.7% to $1,472.9 million in fiscal 2003 from $1,210.0 million in fiscal 2002. This increase resulted from the opening of new stores as well as a same-store sales improvement of 7.0%. The Company's favorable performance versus prior year was driven primarily by the opening of 31 new stores, market share gains in certain markets, continued improvement in merchandising programs, improved in-store execution and the first full year of operations for the 113 stores opened in fiscal 2002. In fiscal 2003, the Company opened 31 new stores (compared to 113 in the prior year), closed one store (compared to three in the prior year) and relocated 18 stores (compared to 16 in the prior year). The Company substantially expanded its store base during 2002 due to its purchase of property and lease rights from Quality Stores, Inc. As a percent of sales, gross margin increased 220 basis points to 30.5% for fiscal 2003 from 28.3% for fiscal 2002. Assuming the provisions of EITF 02-16 had been applied prior to fiscal 2002, fiscal 2003 gross margin would have decreased 40 basis points from 30.9% in fiscal 2002. The majority of this decline is attributable to a return to a more normal level of vendor funding in fiscal 2003. Specifically, vendors provided additional funds in fiscal 2002 in connection with the opening of 87 new stores as a result of the purchase of certain properties and lease rights from Quality Stores, Inc. As a percent of sales, SG&A expenses were 22.5% and 21.5% for fiscal 2003 and 2002, respectively. Assuming the provisions of EITF 02-16 had been applied prior to fiscal 2002 and exclusive of non-recurring expansion costs of $10.7 million experienced in fiscal 2002 (these costs include pre-opening transition and training costs related to the 87 new stores, costs for store relocations and three store closings as a result of the purchase of the aforementioned properties and lease rights from Quality Stores, Inc.), fiscal 2003 SG&A expenses as a percent of sales decreased 80 basis points from 23.3% for fiscal 2002. This decrease is primarily a result of controlled spending and greater leverage from increased sales. Depreciation and amortization expense increased 20.2% in fiscal 2003 over the prior year due mainly to costs associated with new and relocated stores, as well as remodeled existing stores. Net interest expense decreased 26.8% in fiscal 2003 over the prior year. This decrease reflects stronger cash flow and less cash requirements for store openings, which resulted in reduced average long-term borrowings under the Company's revolving credit agreement. The Company's effective tax rate increased to 37.6% for fiscal 2003 compared with 36.2% for fiscal 2002. This increase is due to increased income in states with higher tax rates. As a result of the foregoing factors, net income for fiscal 2003 increased to $55.7 million, or $1.38 per diluted share, compared to net income of $38.2 million, or $0.97 per diluted share, in the prior year. Exclusive of the cumulative effect of the accounting change, net income for fiscal 2003 was $57.6 million or $1.43 per diluted share. This increase is primarily a result of increased leverage from increased sales at both new and existing stores. Additionally, certain store expansion costs incurred in the Company's significant expansion in 2002, which was primarily the result of the purchase of property and lease rights from Quality Stores, Inc. in the first quarter of 2002, were non-recurring. The expansion increased the size of the Company by over 25% and was completed in a very compressed timeframe. As such, the Company incurred significant incremental costs to achieve the state of readiness required to enable all stores to open within the desired time frame and such costs are not considered by management to be indicative of normal pre-opening or recurring expenses. Management believes that disclosing the effect of the significant 2002 store expansion improves the investor's ability to reasonably evaluate the Company's longer-term business trends. 18 <PAGE> CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE Emerging Issue Task Force Issue No. 02-16 ("EITF 02-16"), "Accounting by a Customer (including a Reseller) for Certain Consideration Received from a Vendor" provides guidance for the accounting treatment and income statement classification for consideration given by a vendor to a retailer in connection with the sale of the vendor's products or for the promotion of sales of the vendor's products. The EITF concluded that such consideration received from vendors should be reflected as a decrease in prices paid for inventory and recognized in cost of sales as the related inventory is sold. Prior to adopting this pronouncement, the Company classified all vendor-provided marketing support funds as a reduction in selling, general and administrative expenses. The effect of applying EITF 02-16 on prior-period financial statements would have resulted in a change to previously reported net income, thus, the Company has reported the adoption of EITF 02-16 as a cumulative effect adjustment. Accordingly, in the first quarter of fiscal 2003, the Company recorded a cumulative effect of accounting change of $3.1 million ($1.9 million net of income taxes) for the impact of this adoption on prior fiscal years. The following Pro-forma financial information for the fiscal year ended December 28, 2002 reflects the impact of EITF 02-16 as if it had been adopted prior to fiscal 2002 (in thousands, except per share amounts): <TABLE> <CAPTION> AS REPORTED PRO-FORMA -------------------------- ------------------------- % OF % OF SALES SALES ----- ----- <S> <C> <C> <C> <C> Net sales $ 1,209,990 100.0% $ 1,209,990 100.0% Cost of merchandise sold 867,803 71.7 836,095 69.1 ------------- ------- ------------- ------ Gross margin 342,187 28.3 373,895 30.9 Selling, general and administrative expenses 259,733 21.5 293,132 24.2 Depreciation and amortization 17,970 1.5 17,970 1.5 ------------- ------- ------------- ------ Income from operations 64,484 5.3 62,793 5.2 Interest expense, net 4,707 0.4 4,707 0.4 ------------- ------- ------------- ------ Income before income taxes 59,777 4.9 58,086 4.8 Income tax provision 21,612 1.8 21,001 1.7 ------------- ------- ------------- ------ Net income $ 38,165 3.1% $ 37,085 3.1% ============= ======= ============= ====== Net income per share: Basic $ 1.06 $ 1.03 Diluted $ 0.97 $ 0.94 Weighted average shares outstanding: Basic 36,112 36,112 Diluted 39,277 39,277 </TABLE> LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES In addition to normal operating expenses, the Company's primary ongoing cash requirements are for expansion, remodeling and relocation programs, including inventory purchases and capital expenditures. The Company's primary ongoing sources of liquidity are funds provided from operations, commitments available under its revolving credit agreement, capital and operating leases and normal trade credit. The Company's inventory and accounts payable levels typically build in the first and third fiscal quarters in anticipation of the spring and winter selling seasons, respectively. 19 <PAGE> WORKING CAPITAL At December 25, 2004, the Company had working capital of $216.8 million, a $35.5 million increase from December 27, 2003. This increase is primarily attributable to changes in the following components of current assets and current liabilities (in millions): <TABLE> <CAPTION> 2004 2003 VARIANCE <S> <C> <C> <C> Current assets: Cash and cash equivalents $ 28.9 $ 20.0 $ 8.9 Inventories 385.1 324.5 60.6 Prepaid expenses and other current assets 30.5 27.6 2.9 Other, net 13.9 11.1 2.8 ---------- --------- ---------- 458.4 383.2 75.2 ---------- --------- ---------- Current liabilities: Accounts payable $ 147.9 $ 131.6 $ 16.3 Accrued expenses 92.8 70.0 22.8 Other, net 0.9 0.3 0.6 ---------- --------- ---------- 241.6 201.9 39.7 ---------- --------- ---------- Working capital $ 216.8 $ 181.3 $ 35.5 ========== ========= ========== </TABLE> The increases in cash and cash equivalents, prepaid expenses and other current assets, and accrued expenses is generally due to the increase in the number of stores in operation and resulting increases in sales, growth in operations, and timing of payments. The increase in inventories and related increase in accounts payable resulted primarily from additional inventory for new stores and an increase in average inventory per store due to increased sales expectations and increased cost of certain products containing steel, grain or petroleum. Trade credit arises from the Company's vendors granting extended payment terms for inventory purchases. Payment terms generally vary from 30 days to 180 days depending on the inventory product. BORROWINGS AND CREDIT FACILITIES In November 2000, the Company entered into a three-year unsecured senior revolving credit agreement with Bank of America, N.A., as agent for a lender group, whereby the Company was permitted to borrow up to $125 million. In August 2002, the Company entered into a replacement credit agreement with Bank of America, N.A., as agent for a lender group (the "Credit Agreement"), expanding the maximum available borrowing from $125 million to $155 million, extending the maturity to February 2006 and increasing the number of participating banks from seven to ten. The outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement totaled $32.3 million at December 25, 2004 and $19.4 million at December 27, 2003. The balance of funds available under the Credit Agreement may be utilized for borrowings and up to $50 million for letters of credit, of which $12.7 million and $8.1 million were outstanding at December 25, 2004 and December 27, 2003, respectively. These letters of credit were issued primarily for the purchase of inventory. The Credit Agreement bears interest at either the bank's base rate (5.25% at December 25, 2004) or the London Inter-Bank Offer Rate ("LIBOR") (2.42% at December 25, 2004) plus an additional amount ranging from 0.75% to 1.5% per annum, adjusted quarterly based on Company performance (0.75% at December 25, 2004). The Company is also required to pay, quarterly in arrears, a commitment fee ranging from 0.20% to 0.35% per annum (0.20% at December 25, 2004) and adjusted quarterly based on Company performance, on the average daily unused portion of the credit line. There are no compensating balance requirements associated with the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement contains certain restrictions regarding additional indebtedness, capital expenditures, business operations, guarantees, investments, mergers, consolidations and sales of assets, transactions with subsidiaries or affiliates, and liens. In addition, the Company must comply with certain quarterly restrictions (based on a rolling four-quarters basis) regarding net worth, leverage ratio, fixed charge coverage, current ratio requirements and spending limits on capital expenditures. The Company was in compliance with all covenants at December 25, 2004. 20 <PAGE> The Credit Agreement was amended on January 28, 2004 and September 30, 2004. Both amendments included changes to certain financial covenants, primarily to provide flexibility for capital expenditures. The January 2004 amendment extended the maturity to February 28, 2007 and the September 2004 amendment extended the maturity to February 27, 2008. SOURCES AND USES OF CASH The Company's primary source of liquidity is cash provided by operations. Principal uses of cash for investing and financing activities are capital expenditures and payments on debt, respectively. The following table presents a summary of cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the last three fiscal years (in thousands): <TABLE> <CAPTION> 2004 2003 2002 -------- -------- ------ <S> <C> <C> <C> Net cash provided by operations $ 77.1 $ 63.9 $ 47.2 Net cash used in investing activities (87.3) (43.4) (63.2) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities 19.2 (14.3) 20.8 ------- -------- -------- Net increase in cash and cash equivalents $ 9.0 $ 6.2 $ 4.8 ======= ======== ======== </TABLE> OPERATING ACTIVITIES The $13.2 million increase in net cash provided by operations in fiscal 2004 over fiscal 2003 is primarily due to changes in the following operating activities (in millions): <TABLE> <CAPTION> 2004 2003 VARIANCE -------- --------- -------- <S> <C> <C> <C> Net income $ 64.1 $ 55.7 $ 8.4 Depreciation and amortization 27.2 21.6 5.6 Deferred income taxes (4.6) 6.6 (11.2) Inventories and accounts payable (44.2) (21.6) (22.6) Prepaid expenses and other current assets (2.2) (10.8) 8.6 Accrued expenses 22.7 7.0 15.7 Other, net 14.1 5.4 8.7 --------- --------- -------- Net cash provided by operations $ 77.1 $ 63.9 $ 13.2 ========== ========= ======== </TABLE> The increase in net cash provided by operations in fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003 is primarily due to the improvement in net earnings (exclusive of depreciation and amortization), offset by a net increase in inventory and accounts payable. Increases in prepaid expenses and other current assets and accrued expenses also contributed to the growth in cash provided by operations. These increases were primarily due to the growth in the Company's business during the year and the timing of payments. The $16.7 million increase in net cash provided by operations in fiscal 2003 from fiscal 2002 is primarily due to changes in the following operating activities (in millions): <TABLE> <CAPTION> 2003 2002 VARIANCE ---------- ---------- -------- <S> <C> <C> <C> Net income $ 55.7 $ 38.2 $ 17.5 Depreciation and amortization 21.6 18.0 3.6 Deferred income taxes 6.6 (4.3) 10.9 Inventories and accounts payable (21.6) (33.4) 11.8 Prepaid expenses and other current assets (10.8) 0.3 (11.1) Accrued expenses 7.0 22.4 (15.4) Other, net 5.4 6.0 (0.6) ---------- ---------- -------- Net cash provided by operations $ 63.9 $ 47.2 $ 16.7 ========== ========== ======== </TABLE> The increase in net cash provided by operations in fiscal 2003 compared with fiscal 2002 is primarily due to the increase in the number of stores in operation. In addition to the 31 stores opened in 2003, it was also the first full year of operations for the 113 stores opened in 2002. As a result of this aggressive expansion, the Company experienced a dramatic increase in all working capital components. Strong sales performance generated increased cash flows and inventory requirements thereby driving proportionate increases in operating expenses. 21 <PAGE> INVESTING ACTIVITIES Investing activities used $87.3 million, $43.4 million, and $63.2 million in fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The majority of this cash requirement relates to the Company's capital expenditures. The Company's significant store expansion, coupled with required investment in infrastructure costs, required the following capital expenditures (in thousands): <TABLE> <CAPTION> 2004 2003 2002 --------- --------- --------- <S> <C> <C> <C> New and relocated stores and stores not yet opened $ 30,758 $ 18,990 $ 61,278 Existing stores 10,033 9,829 4,193 Distribution center capacity and improvements 41,024 17,217 417 Information technology 9,105 3,320 1,055 Corporate and other 2,069 626 151 --------- --------- --------- $ 92,989 $ 49,982 $ 67,094 ========= ========= ========= </TABLE> The Company's long-term growth strategy anticipates continued geographic market expansion, further concentration within existing markets and additional investment in distribution facilities. This growth will require continuing investment in information technology and people. The costs reflected are typically building improvements as the Company leases the majority of its facilities. The Company currently estimates that capital expenditures will be approximately $81.7 million in fiscal 2005, as follows (in thousands): New and relocated stores and stores not yet opened $ 40,200 Existing stores 16,700 Distribution center capacity and improvements 20,800 Information technology 3,300 Corporate and other 700 --------- $ 81,700 ========= FINANCING ACTIVITIES Financing activities provided $19.2 million, used $14.3 million, and provided $20.8 million in fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, largely as a result of borrowing requirements created by operations, partially offset by proceeds received from the issuance of stock under stock incentive programs. The Company believes that its cash flow from operations, borrowings available under the Credit Agreement, and normal trade credit will be sufficient to fund the Company's operations and its capital expenditure needs, including store openings, relocations and renovations, over the next several years. SIGNIFICANT CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS The following table reflects the Company's future obligations and commitments as of December 25, 2004 (in thousands): <TABLE> <CAPTION> PAYMENT DUE BY PERIOD -------------------------------------------------------------------------- TOTAL CONTRACTUAL LESS THAN MORE THAN OBLIGATIONS 1 YEAR 1-3 YEARS 4-5 YEARS 5 YEARS ----------- ----------- ---------- ---------- ----------- <S> <C> <C> <C> <C> <C> Long term debt (a) $ 32,279 $ -- $ -- $ 32,279 $ -- Operating leases 736,030 73,094 142,416 126,640 393,880 Capital leases (b) 6,135 1,037 1,441 572 3,085 Purchase obligations (c) 908 434 474 -- -- ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- --------- $ 775,352 $ 74,565 $ 144,331 $ 159,491 $ 396,965 ========== ========== ========== ========== ========= </TABLE> (a) Long term debt balances represent principal maturities, excluding interest. At December 25, 2004, this entire amount relates to the Company's Credit Agreement. (b) Capital lease obligations include related interest. (c) The amounts for purchase obligations include commitments for data transfer for information technology use. The Company has outstanding standby letters of credit of $12.7 million as of December 25, 2004. 22 <PAGE> OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS The extent of the Company's off-balance sheet arrangements is operating leases and outstanding letters of credit. The balances for these arrangements are discussed above. Leasing buildings and equipment for retail stores and offices rather than acquiring these significant assets allows the Company to utilize financial capital to operate the business rather than maintain assets. Letters of credit allow the Company to purchase inventory in a timely manner. KNOWN TRENDS, EVENTS, DEMANDS, COMMITMENTS AND UNCERTAINTIES LITIGATION AND INTERNAL INVESTIGATION In July 2004, a purported shareholder derivative lawsuit was filed in the Chancery Court for Davidson County, Tennessee by the Hawaii Laborers Pension Plan against each of the Company's directors, certain of its officers and one former director. The Company was named as a nominal defendant. On September 17, 2004, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint which alleged breaches of fiduciary duty, acts of bad faith, abuse of control, mismanagement, waste of corporate assets, unjust enrichment and other violations of Tennessee law relating to the preparation of the Company's financial statements. The amended complaint sought, on behalf of the Company, unspecified damages, a constructive trust on certain of the defendant's proceeds from selling Company stock, injunctive relief, restitution, the plaintiff's costs and disbursements and such other relief as the Court deemed proper. On October 8, 2004, the Company moved to dismiss the amended complaint for failure to make a pre-suit demand on the Board of Directors. On December 3, 2004, the Court granted the Company's motion to dismiss and ordered that all claims in the amended complaint be dismissed without prejudice. On February 17, 2005, the Court entered an order denying a motion by the plaintiff to alter or amend the December 3, 2004 order and judgment dismissing the amended complaint. The plaintiff has until March 21, 2005 to file a notice of appeal of the order. The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors has completed its previously disclosed investigation of the claims set forth in the derivative lawsuit. In July 2004, shortly after the Company learned of the derivative lawsuit, the Board of Directors directed the Audit Committee to conduct an investigation of the allegations. These allegations concerned the Company's accounting accruals and reserves for inventory, employee bonuses, payroll-related liabilities and vendor credits. The Audit Committee promptly retained independent legal counsel with no prior connection to the Company to assist the Audit Committee in evaluating these issues. The Audit Committee and its advisors were provided with full access to Company employees and documents. During the course of the Audit Committee's investigation, independent counsel, with the assistance of accountants that they retained, interviewed Company employees, met with the Company's external auditors, and reviewed a substantial amount of documentation related to the issues described above. The Audit Committee later expanded the review to encompass the Company's other reserves or accruals that involved management judgment. Based on the investigation of the allegations described above, the Audit Committee determined that there were no material errors requiring restatement of the Company's previously reported financial statements as they relate to such matters and found no evidence of fraud or misconduct by any of the Company's employees. In reaching its conclusion that restatement of the Company's previously reported financial statements was not required, the Audit Committee considered (1) the impact of the documentation insufficiencies and/or errors on each of the periods affected, (2) the lack of any material changes in prior period trends or earnings, (3) the nature of the documentation insufficiencies and errors, and (4) the age of financial statements impacted. The Audit Committee has reported its findings to the Company's Board of Directors and management, both of whom concurred with the Audit Committee's determination. The Company's external auditors have also concurred with the determination. 23 <PAGE> While the Audit Committee determined that restatement of the Company's prior reported financial statements was not required for such matters, the Audit Committee found the following documentation insufficiencies and/or errors: o In fiscal 2000, management calculated a total accrual of $4.3 million for the Company's excess and slow moving inventory valuation reserve. A $1.0 million portion of this reserve (representing approximately 0.5% of the total year end inventory balance) relating to costs anticipated to be incurred to move inventory from one store location to another was not sufficiently supported. In fiscal 2001, the rationale and calculation of this portion of the reserve was changed to a mechanical formula, but a $0.8 million portion of the reserve (representing 0.4% of the total year end inventory) was still not sufficiently supported. By the third quarter of fiscal 2002, the entire inventory valuation reserve was properly supported. o Due to larger than typical performance based bonuses in fiscal 2002, the maximum limits on certain fringe benefits were met, resulting in a lower than estimated fringe benefit expense being incurred. This circumstance resulted in the year-end estimate being overstated by $790,000. Also, due to forfeitures resulting from employee terminations after the end of year, the Company's ultimate incentive payments for fiscal 2002 were reduced by $137,000. The combination of these two circumstances resulted in the Company's incentive expense for the first quarter of fiscal 2003 being reduced by $927,000. o In estimating certain payroll-related liabilities for fiscal 1999 through the second quarter of fiscal 2004, management did not sufficiently document its rationale and support for certain judgments concerning estimated claims incurred but not reported for medical costs, workers' compensation and general liability. Since the second quarter of fiscal 2004, the rationale and support for these liabilities have been fully documented. The Audit Committee concluded that the items addressed above have been fully corrected, also noting that management has dedicated additional accounting and other resources to these areas to further enhance controls. Following the December 2004 dismissal of the derivative suit, attorneys representing the plaintiff in the shareholder derivative suit wrote the Company's Board of Directors demanding that the Company commence legal proceedings against the directors and officers whom the plaintiff had unsuccessfully sued for essentially the same matters alleged in the derivative suit. The Company's Board of Directors engaged the independent legal counsel and legal counsel retained the accountants which assisted the Audit Committee in its investigation of the allegations in the derivative suit to advise the Board with respect to the demand. Following a review of the investigation of the allegations set forth in the demand letter and the derivative suit, the non-employee members of the Company's Board of Directors determined that the claims proposed in the demand letter and derivative suit have no merit and that pursuing such claims would not be in the best interests of the Company. Based on this determination, the Company's Board of Directors refused the shareholder's demand to pursue legal action. SELF INSURANCE During the third fiscal quarter of 2004, the Company determined, through assistance with insurance industry analysts, that one of its former insurance carriers appears insolvent. The carrier insures the Company for both workers' compensation and general liability claims for policy years 1999 through 2001. The Company's exposure to related claims are at risk of not being limited to previously established stop-loss aggregates. A charge of $0.5 million was recognized in the current year for the estimated additional cost to the Company due to the expected loss of stop-loss coverage. This additional estimated liability was determined using a third party actuary service. There can be no assurance that the Company will not incur additional claims in excess of the estimated amounts. 24 <PAGE> SALES TAX COMPLIANCE A portion of the Company's sales are with tax-exempt customers. The Company obtains exemption information as a necessary part of each tax exempt transaction. Many of the states in which the Company conducts business will audit the Company to verify its compliance with applicable sales tax laws. The business activities of the Company's customers and the intended use of the unique products sold by the Company create a challenging and complex environment of compliance. These circumstances also create some risk that the Company could be challenged as to the propriety of its sales tax compliance. While the Company believes it reasonably enforces sales tax compliance with its customers and endeavors to fully comply with all applicable sales tax regulations, there can be no assurance that the Company, upon final completion of such audits, would not have a significant liability for disallowed exemptions. Management believes it has adequately provided for such liability based on known assessments and expected settlements. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") published FASB Statement No. 123 (revised 2004), "Share-Based Payment" ("SFAS 123(R)" or the "Statement"). SFAS 123(R) requires that the compensation cost relating to share-based payment transactions, including grants of employee stock options, be recognized in financial statements. That cost will be measured based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued. SFAS 123(R) covers a wide range of share-based compensation arrangements including stock options, restricted share plans, performance-based awards, share appreciation rights, and employee share purchase plans. SFAS 123(R) specifies that the fair value of an employee stock option must be based on an observable market price or, if an observable market price is not available, the fair value must be estimated using a valuation technique meeting specific criteria established in the standard. The Statement is effective for public companies at the beginning of the first interim or annual period beginning after June 15, 2005 (the third quarter of fiscal 2005 for the Company). The Statement will have no impact on the Company's overall financial position. The impact of this Statement on the Company's results of operations in fiscal 2005 and beyond is expected to be significant and will depend upon various factors, among them being future compensation strategies. The impact of adoption of this Statement cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future. The pro-forma compensation costs presented in Note 1 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and in prior filings for the Company have been calculated using a Black-Scholes option pricing model and may not be indicative of amounts which should be expected in future years. As of the date of this filing, the Company has not determined which option pricing model is most appropriate for future option grants or which method of adoption the Company will apply. In November 2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 151, "Inventory Costs, an Amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4" ("SFAS 151"). The purpose of this statement is to clarify the accounting of abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and waste material. ARB No. 43 stated that under some circumstances these costs may be so abnormal that they are required to be treated as current period costs. SFAS 151 requires that these costs be treated as current period costs regardless if they meet the criteria of "so abnormal." The provisions of SFAS 151 shall be effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. Although the Company will continue to evaluate the application of SFAS 151, management does not believe adoption will have a material impact on its results of operations or financial position. In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 153, "Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets, an Amendment of APB Opinion No. 29" ("SFAS 153"). SFAS 153 is based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged. SFAS 153 is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005, with earlier application permitted. Although the Company will continue to evaluate the application of SFAS 153, management does not believe adoption will have a material impact on its results of operations or financial position. 25 <PAGE> RISK FACTORS EFFECT OF INFLATION ON OPERATIONS Although the Company cannot accurately determine the full effect of inflation on its operations, it believes its sales and results of operations have been affected by inflation. During fiscal 2004, the Company recognized a LIFO charge of approximately $9.6 million relating to inflation in certain product categories such as steel, grain and petroleum based products. The Company has also experienced inflation in transportation and other costs. The Company increased its retail prices to recoup a portion of this inflation, resulting in a positive impact on same-store sales of an estimated 2.6%. The Company is subject to market risk with respect to the pricing of certain products and services, which include, among other items, steel, grain, petroleum, corn, soybean and other commodities as well as transportation services. If prices of these materials and services continue to increase in a significant manner, consumer demand may fall and/or the Company may not be able to pass such increases on to its customers and, as a result, sales and/or gross margins could decline. The Company has been successful in reducing or mitigating the effects of inflation, principally through selective buying from the most competitive vendors and by increasing retail prices. Due to the competitive environment, such conditions have and may continue to adversely impact the Company's gross margins. GROWTH THROUGH OPENING NEW STORES The Company's key business strategy is to expand its base of Tractor Supply Company stores. If the Company is unable to implement this strategy, the Company's ability to increase its sales, profitability, and cash flow could be impaired significantly. To the extent that the Company is unable to open new stores as the Company anticipates (due to unforeseen delays in construction or site approval), the Company's sales growth would be dependent on increases in same-store sales. MANAGEMENT OF GROWTH Even if the Company is able to implement, to a significant degree, its key business strategy of expanding its store base, it may experience managerial or operational problems, which may prevent any significant increase in profitability or negatively impact its cash flow. COMPETITION The Company operates in a highly competitive market. The principal competitive factors include location of stores, price and quality of merchandise, in-stock consistency, merchandise assortment and presentation, and customer service. The Company believes it has successfully differentiated itself from general merchandise, home center retailers and other specialty and discount retailers by focusing on its specialized market niche (i.e., supplying the lifestyle needs of recreational farmers and ranchers and those who enjoy the rural lifestyle, as well as tradesmen and small businesses). However, the Company does face select competition from these entities, as well as competition from independently owned retail farm and ranch stores, several privately-held regional farm store chains and farm cooperatives. Some of these competitors are units of large national or regional chains that have substantially greater financial and other resources than the Company. IMPROVEMENTS TO THE COMPANY'S SUPPLY CHAIN MAY NOT BE FULLY SUCCESSFUL An important part of the Company's efforts to achieve efficiencies, cost reductions, and sales and cash flow growth is the identification and implementation of improvements to the Company's supply chain, including inventory replenishment systems, merchandise ordering, transportation, and receipt processing. Significant changes to the Company's supply chain could have a materially adverse impact on operating results. CHANGES IN CUSTOMER DEMANDS COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY'S SALES, OPERATING RESULTS AND CASH FLOW The Company's success depends on its ability to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to changing customer demand and preferences for products and supplies used in recreational farming and ranching. If the Company misjudges the market, the Company may significantly overstock unpopular products and be forced to take significant inventory markdowns. However, shortages of key items could also have a materially adverse impact on operating results. 26 <PAGE> RISKS RELATING TO FOREIGN SUPPLIERS The Company relies on foreign manufacturers for various products that we sell. In addition, many of our domestic suppliers purchase a portion of their products from foreign sources. This reliance increases the risk of inadequate and untimely supplies of various products due to local political, economic, social, or environmental conditions, transportation delays, restrictive actions by foreign governments, or changes in United States laws and regulations affecting imports or domestic distribution. SEASONALITY AND WEATHER The Company's business is highly seasonal. Historically, the Company's sales and profits have been the highest in the second and fourth fiscal quarters of each year due to the sale of seasonal products. The Company typically operates at approximately break even in the first quarter of each year. Unseasonable weather, excessive rain, drought, and early or late frosts during the second or fourth quarters of each year could have a significant affect the Company's sales and results of operations. The Company believes, however, that the impact of adverse weather conditions is somewhat mitigated by the geographic dispersion of its stores. OUR INFORMATION SYSTEMS MAY PROVE INADEQUATE The Company depends on management information systems for many aspects of its business. The Company will be materially adversely affected if management information systems are disrupted or it is unable to improve, upgrade, maintain, and expand systems, particularly in light of the continued significant increases in the number of stores.
