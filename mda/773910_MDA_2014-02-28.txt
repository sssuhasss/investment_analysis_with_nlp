Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read together with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements , which are included in this report in Item 8, and the information set forth in Risk Factors under Item 1A. Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms Anadarko and Company refer to Anadarko Petroleum Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries. OVERVIEW Anadarko met or exceeded its key operational objectives in 2013 . The Company increased sales volumes per day by approximately 7% over 2012 and added 528 million barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) of proved reserves. Additionally, the Company continued its deepwater exploration and appraisal drilling success with a 67% success rate in 2013 . The Company ended 2013 with $3.7 billion of cash on hand, availability of its $5.0 billion senior secured revolving credit facility maturing in September 2015 ($5.0 billion Facility), and access to credit and capital markets as needed. Management believes that the Company is positioned to continue to satisfy its operational objectives and capital commitments with cash on hand, available borrowing capacity, and cash flows from operations. Mission and Strategy Anadarko mission is to deliver a competitive and sustainable rate of return to shareholders by developing, acquiring, and exploring for oil and natural-gas resources vital to the world health and welfare. Anadarko employs the following strategy to achieve this mission: explore in high-potential, proven basins identify and commercialize resources employ a global business development approach ensure financial discipline and flexibility Exploring in high-potential, proven, and emerging basins worldwide provides the Company with growth opportunities. Anadarko exploration success has created value by increasing future resource potential, while providing the flexibility to mitigate risk by monetizing discoveries. Developing a portfolio of primarily unconventional resources provides the Company a stable base of capital-efficient and predictable development opportunities that, in turn, positions the Company for consistent growth at competitive rates. Anadarko global business development approach transfers core skills across the globe to assist in the discovery and development of world-class resources that are accretive to the Company performance. These resources help form an optimized global portfolio where both surface and subsurface risks are actively managed. A strong balance sheet is essential for the development of the Company assets, and Anadarko is committed to disciplined investment in its businesses to efficiently manage commodity price cycles. Maintaining financial discipline enables the Company to capitalize on the opportunities afforded by its global portfolio, while allowing the Company to pursue new strategic growth opportunities. 53 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Significant 2013 operating and financial activities include the following: Overall Anadarko full-year sales volumes averaged 781 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (MBOE/d), representing a 7% increase over 2012 . Anadarko liquids sales volumes were 339 thousand barrels per day (MBbls/d), representing a 7% increase over 2012 , primarily due to increased sales volumes in the Wattenberg field, the Eagleford shale, and the East Texas/North Louisiana horizontal development. The Company achieved a 67% success rate from deepwater exploration and appraisal drilling in 2013 . The Company recognized an $850 million contingent loss related to the Adversary Proceeding. See Note 17 Contingencies Tronox Litigation in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. U.S. Onshore The Rocky Mountains Region (Rockies) full-year sales volumes averaged 327 MBOE/d, representing a 3% increase over 2012 , primarily from the Wattenberg field. The Southern and Appalachia Region full-year sales volumes averaged 257 MBOE/d, representing a 30% increase over 2012 , primarily from the Marcellus and Eagleford shales, and the East Texas/North Louisiana horizontal development. Anadarko acquired certain oil and gas properties and related assets in the Moxa area of Wyoming for $310 million. Anadarko exchanged certain oil and gas properties in the Wattenberg field with a third party, which allowed the Company to consolidate its working interest and operated acreage positions in the field. The Company sold its interest in the Pinedale/Jonah assets in the Rockies to a third party for $581 million in January 2014, recognizing a loss of $701 million in 2013. Gulf of Mexico Gulf of Mexico full-year sales volumes averaged 96 MBOE/d, representing a 17% decrease from 2012 , primarily due to natural production declines. The Company entered into a carried-interest arrangement that requires a third-party partner to fund $860 million of Anadarko capital costs in exchange for a 12.75% working interest in the Heidelberg development. Anadarko 80-MBbls/d Lucius spar was installed on location in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and well-completion activities were initiated. The Company drilled three successful exploration wells and three appraisal wells. The Company increased its ownership position in the Coronado discovery from 15% to 35% and will assume operatorship following the drilling of an appraisal well, which was spud in the fourth quarter of 2013. 54 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements International International full-year sales volumes averaged 90 MBOE/d, representing a 7% increase from 2012 , primarily in Ghana. The Company drilled two successful exploration wells in Mozambique. Anadarko and its partners continue to make progress marketing liquefied natural gas (LNG) to be produced from Anadarko-operated Rovuma Offshore Area 1 in Mozambique. The partners have reached non-binding Heads of Agreements for long-term LNG sales to buyers in Asian markets covering approximately two-thirds of the first 5-million-tonne-per-annum train. The Company participated in ten successful appraisal wells: six in Mozambique, two in Ghana, and two in Brazil. Anadarko and its partners achieved initial oil production at the El Merk project and production from the facility increased throughout the year as two oil trains and a natural-gas processing and NGLs extraction train were completed and brought online. Final commissioning of the NGLs extraction train is ongoing and will be completed in the first quarter of 2014. Anadarko and its partners received government approval for the Plan of Development for the Tweneboa/Enyenra/Ntomme (TEN) deepwater oil project offshore Ghana. Anadarko sold a 10% working interest in Rovuma Offshore Area 1 in Mozambique for $2.64 billion in February 2014. Financial Anadarko net income attributable to common stockholders for 2013 totaled $801 million , which included an $850 million contingent loss related to the Adversary Proceeding and $794 million of impairment expense primarily related to certain Gulf of Mexico properties and domestic onshore properties. The Company generated $8.9 billion of cash flow from operations in 2013 , including $730 million related to the resolution of the Algeria exceptional profits tax dispute, and ended 2013 with $3.7 billion of cash on hand. Anadarko increased the quarterly dividend paid to its common stockholders from $0.09 per share to $0.18 per share. The following discussion pertains to Anadarko results of operations, financial condition, and changes in financial condition. Any increases or decreases for the year ended December 31, 2013 , refer to the comparison of the year ended December 31, 2013 , to the year ended December 31, 2012 . Similarly, any increases or decreases for the year ended December 31, 2012 , refer to the comparison of the year ended December 31, 2012 , to the year ended December 31, 2011 . The primary factors that affect the Company results of operations include commodity prices for natural gas, crude oil, and natural gas liquids (NGLs); sales volumes; the Company ability to discover additional reserves; the cost of finding such reserves; and operating costs. 55 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements RESULTS OF OPERATIONS millions except per-share amounts and percentages 2013 2012 2011 Financial Results Natural-gas, oil and condensate, and NGLs sales $ 13,828 $ 12,396 $ 12,834 Gathering, processing, and marketing sales 1,039 911 1,048 Gains (losses) on divestitures and other, net (286 ) 104 85 Total revenues and other 14,581 13,411 13,967 Costs and expenses (1) 11,248 9,684 15,837 Other (income) expense (2) 1,227 162 1,554 Income tax expense (benefit) 1,165 1,120 (856 ) Net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders $ 801 $ 2,391 $ (2,649 ) Net income (loss) per common share attributable to common stockholders diluted $ 1.58 $ 4.74 $ (5.32 ) Average number of common shares outstanding diluted 505 502 498 Operating Results Adjusted EBITDAX (3) $ 9,403 $ 8,966 $ 8,869 Total proved reserves (MMBOE) 2,792 2,560 2,539 Annual sales volumes (MMBOE) 285 268 248 Capital Resources and Liquidity Cash provided by operating activities $ 8,888 $ 8,339 $ 2,505 Capital expenditures 8,523 7,311 6,553 Total debt 13,565 13,269 15,230 Stockholders equity $ 21,857 $ 20,629 $ 18,105 Debt to total capitalization ratio 38.3 % 39.1 % 45.7 % _______________________________________________________________________________ MMBOE million barrels of oil equivalent (1) Includes Deepwater Horizon settlement and related costs of $15 million in 2013 , $18 million in 2012 , and $3.9 billion in 2011 , and a credit of $1.8 billion for previously recognized expenses related to the favorable resolution of the Algeria exceptional profits tax dispute in 2012 .

Production of natural gas, crude oil, and NGLs is usually not affected by seasonal swings in demand. 57 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Natural-Gas Sales Volumes, Average Prices, and Revenues 2013 Inc/(Dec) vs. 2012 2012 Inc/(Dec) vs. 2011 2011 United States Sales volumes Bcf 968 6 % 913 7 % 852 MMcf/d 2,652 6 2,495 7 2,334 Price per Mcf $ 3.50 31 $ 2.68 (31 ) $ 3.87 Natural-gas sales revenues (millions) $ 3,388 39 $ 2,444 (26 ) $ 3,300 _______________________________________________________________________________ Bcf billion cubic feet MMcf/d million cubic feet per day Mcf thousand cubic feet The Company natural-gas sales volumes increased 157 MMcf/d for the year ended December 31, 2013 . Sales volumes for the Southern and Appalachia Region increased 246 MMcf/d primarily due to horizontal drilling and infrastructure expansions in the Eagleford and Marcellus shales, as well as new wells drilled in the liquids-rich East Texas/North Louisiana horizontal development. These increases were partially offset by lower sales volumes in the Gulf of Mexico of 47 MMcf/d primarily due to natural production declines. Also, sales volumes for the Rockies decreased 42 MMcf/d primarily due to a natural production decline in the Powder River basin, partially offset by higher sales volumes in the Wattenberg field due to increased horizontal drilling. The Company natural-gas sales volumes increased 161 MMcf/d for the year ended December 31, 2012 , primarily due to higher sales volumes in the Southern and Appalachia Region of 220 MMcf/d as wells drilled in previous years were brought online through 2012 infrastructure expansions in the Eagleford and Marcellus shale and new wells were drilled in the liquids-rich East Texas/North Louisiana horizontal development. Also, the Company had higher sales volumes in the Rockies of 52 MMcf/d associated with drilling in the Greater Natural Buttes and the Wattenberg field. These increases were partially offset by reduced sales volumes in the Gulf of Mexico of 111 MMcf/d primarily due to natural production declines. The average natural-gas price Anadarko received increased for the year ended December 31, 2013 , as higher-than-normal residential and commercial demand early in the year reduced overall natural gas storage below the previous year record levels. Natural-gas prices were further supported by higher demand in the fourth quarter of 2013, a reduction in natural-gas imports from Canada, and continued strength in exports to Mexico. Anadarko average natural-gas price received decreased for the year ended December 31, 2012 , due to continued growth in U.S. natural-gas production, reduced U.S. natural-gas demand as a result of mild winter temperatures, and above-average U.S. natural-gas storage levels in 2012. 58 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Crude-Oil and Condensate Sales Volumes, Average Prices, and Revenues 2013 Inc/(Dec) vs. 2012 2012 Inc/(Dec) vs. 2011 2011 United States Sales volumes MMBbls 58 6 % 55 14 % 48 MBbls/d 158 6 149 14 132 Price per barrel $ 97.02 $ 97.46 $ 97.70 International Sales volumes MMBbls 33 7 % 31 (2 )% 31 MBbls/d 90 7 84 (2 ) 85 Price per barrel $ 109.15 (2 ) $ 111.11 2 $ 109.20 Total Sales volumes MMBbls 91 6 % 86 8 % 79 MBbls/d 248 6 233 8 217 Price per barrel $ 101.41 (1 ) $ 102.35 $ 102.24 Oil and condensate sales revenues (millions) $ 9,178 5 $ 8,728 8 $ 8,072 _______________________________________________________________________________ MMBbls million barrels MBbls/d thousand barrels per day Anadarko total crude-oil and condensate sales volumes increased 15 MBbls/d for the year ended December 31, 2013 . Sales volumes for the Rockies increased 15 MBbls/d primarily in the Wattenberg field due to increased horizontal drilling. Sales volumes for the Southern and Appalachia Region increased 6 MBbls/d, as a result of horizontal drilling and infrastructure expansions in the Eagleford shale. Internationally, sales volumes increased 6 MBbls/d primarily in Ghana as a result of enhanced production due to successful acid stimulations and additional Phase 1A Jubilee wells brought online, as well as timing of cargo liftings. Sales volumes in the Gulf of Mexico decreased 10 MBbls/d primarily due to natural production declines. Anadarko crude-oil and condensate sales volumes increased 16 MBbls/d for the year ended December 31, 2012 . Increased horizontal drilling in the Wattenberg field led to a 9 MBbls/d sales-volume improvement in the Rockies. Horizontal drilling in the Eagleford shale and Bone Spring/Avalon formations also contributed to increased sales volumes in the Southern and Appalachia Region of 8 MBbls/d. Anadarko average crude-oil price received decreased slightly for the year ended December 31, 2013 , due to modestly lower international crude oil prices. Approximately 70% of Anadarko crude-oil sales volumes were based on prices that were either directly indexed to, or highly correlated to, Brent crude. Anadarko average crude-oil price received increased for the year ended December 31, 2012 , primarily due to supply disruption concerns associated with political and civil unrest in the Middle East and North Africa, and steady global demand growth. 59 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Natural-Gas Liquids Sales Volumes, Average Prices, and Revenues 2013 Inc/(Dec) vs. 2012 2012 Inc/(Dec) vs. 2011 2011 United States Sales volumes MMBbls 33 10 % 30 12 % 27 MBbls/d 91 10 83 12 74 Price per barrel $ 37.97 (6 ) $ 40.44 (25 ) $ 53.95 Natural-gas liquids sales revenues (millions) $ 1,262 3 $ 1,224 (16 ) $ 1,462 NGLs sales represent revenues from the sale of products derived from the processing of Anadarko natural-gas production. The Company NGLs sales volumes increased 8 MBbls/d for the year ended December 31, 2013 . Sales volumes for the Southern and Appalachia Region increased 12 MBbls/d as a result of continued horizontal drilling and infrastructure expansion in the Eagleford shale and horizontal drilling in the liquids-rich East Texas/North Louisiana horizontal development. This increase was partially offset by lower sales volumes in the Rockies of 2 MBbls/d primarily due to ethane rejection in 2013 , and in the Gulf of Mexico of 2 MBbls/d due to natural production declines. Anadarko NGLs sales volumes increased by 9 MBbls/d for the year ended December 31, 2012 , as a result of drilling in liquids-rich areas, primarily in the Southern and Appalachia Region at the Eagleford shale and the East Texas/North Louisiana horizontal development. Anadarko average NGLs price received decreased for the year ended December 31, 2013 , primarily due to lower market prices for ethane and butanes as a result of higher U.S. inventory and production levels. Anadarko average NGLs price decreased for the year ended December 31, 2012 , primarily due to lower market prices for ethane and propane. Ethane demand was reduced by down-time for maintenance and conversion upgrades at petrochemical facilities. Mild winter temperatures across much of the United States in 2011 reduced demand for propane and contributed to above-average levels of propane stockpiles. Gathering, Processing, and Marketing Margin millions except percentages 2013 Inc/(Dec) vs. 2012 2012 Inc/(Dec) vs. 2011 2011 Gathering, processing, and marketing sales $ 1,039 14 % $ 911 (13 )% $ 1,048 Gathering, processing, and marketing expense 869 14 763 (4 ) 791 Gathering, processing, and marketing margin $ 170 15 $ 148 (42 ) $ 257 Marketing margins represent the margin earned by purchasing and selling third-party oil and natural gas. Processing margin represents the margin earned by purchasing third-party natural gas and selling the extracted NGLs and remaining residue gas. The Company also earns gathering revenue and processing fees by providing gathering and processing services to third parties. Operating and transportation expenses relate to the Company costs to perform these activities, excluding the purchase of commodities that are included in the margin. For the year ended December 31, 2013 , the gathering, processing, and marketing margin increased $22 million . This increase was primarily due to higher gathering revenue as a result of increased throughput across several of Anadarko gathering systems and higher marketing margins, partially offset by increased transportation expenses due to increased third-party volumes and increased demand fees. For the year ended December 31, 2012 , the gathering, processing, and marketing margin decreased $109 million primarily due to lower commodity prices, which led to reduced natural-gas processing margins and decreased marketing margins, and higher transportation expenses primarily due to higher demand fees. This decrease was partially offset by additional revenues earned and expenses incurred for midstream assets acquired in February 2011 and May 2011, and an increase in gathering and processing revenues associated with increased throughput volumes across several of Anadarko fee-based systems. 60 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Gains (Losses) on Divestitures and Other, net Gains (losses) on divestitures and other, net decreased $ 390 million primarily due to losses on divestitures in 2013. In the fourth quarter of 2013, the Company recognized losses on assets held for sale of $704 million , primarily associated with the divestiture of the Pinedale/Jonah assets in the Rockies, which closed in January 2014 for sale proceeds of $581 million. This decrease was partially offset by a $140 million gain in 2013 associated with the Company divestiture of its interests in a soda ash joint venture. The Company divested its interests in the soda ash joint venture for $310 million and potential additional consideration based on future revenue of the joint venture, while retaining its royalty interest in soda ash mined by the joint venture from the Company Land Grant. In 2013, gains on divestitures also included $94 million primarily related to the divestiture of certain oil and gas properties in the United States compared to net losses on similar divestitures of $71 million in 2012 primarily related to the sale of oil and gas properties in Indonesia. See Note 2 Acquisitions, Divestitures, and Assets Held for Sale in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information on assets held for sale. For the year ended December 31, 2012 , gains (losses) on divestitures and other, net increased $19 million primarily due to increased mineral revenue of $36 million related to increased mining of soda ash on Anadarko Land Grant and higher per-ton average sales prices. Increased mineral revenue was partially offset by an increase in net losses on divestitures of $17 million. Gains (losses) on divestitures for 2012 included net losses of $71 million, as discussed above. Gains (losses) on divestitures for 2011 included net losses of $54 million primarily related to write-downs of $422 million of assets held for sale. In 2011, the Company began marketing certain domestic properties from the oil and gas exploration and production reporting segment and the midstream reporting segment in order to redirect its operating activities and capital investment to other areas. Also included in 2011 was a $76 million loss that occurred in connection with the Company purchase of the Wattenberg Plant. These losses were partially offset by 2011 gains of $419 million for receipt and final settlement of contingent consideration related to the 2008 divestiture of its interest in the Peregrino field offshore Brazil and $21 million from the acquisition-date fair-value remeasurement of the Company pre-acquisition 7% equity interest in the Wattenberg Plant.

Oil and gas operating expenses per BOE increased by $0.18 for the year ended December 31, 2013 , primarily due to these higher costs, partially offset by increased sales volumes. For the year ended December 31, 2012 , oil and gas operating expenses decreased by $17 million primarily due to lower workover expenses of $67 million as a result of fewer workovers primarily in the Gulf of Mexico and the Rockies, partially offset by $52 million of higher operating expenses from increased activity in Ghana. Per-BOE oil and gas operating expenses decreased by $0.35 for the year ended December 31, 2012 , primarily as a result of increased sales volumes, while production costs remained flat as a result of efficiency gains, and lower workover expenses as discussed above. 61 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Oil and gas transportation and other expenses increased by $ 67 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 , and $64 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 , primarily due to higher gas-gathering and transportation costs attributable to higher volumes and increased costs related to growth in the Company U.S. onshore asset base. Oil and gas transportation and other expenses per BOE increased by $0.02 for the year ended December 31, 2013 , primarily due to the higher costs discussed above, partially offset by increased sales volumes. Oil and gas transportation and other expenses per BOE decreased by $0.02 for the year ended December 31, 2012 , primarily due to increased sales volumes, partially offset by the higher costs discussed above. millions 2013 2012 2011 Exploration Expense Dry hole expense $ 556 $ 440 $ 154 Impairments of unproved properties 308 1,104 471 Geological and geophysical expense 208 151 246 Exploration overhead and other 257 251 205 Total exploration expense $ 1,329 $ 1,946 $ 1,076 Exploration expense decreased $ 617 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 . Impairments of unproved properties decreased $796 million primarily due to $845 million of 2012 impairments, which included $721 million related to Powder River coalbed methane properties primarily due to lower natural-gas prices and $124 million related to a Gulf of Mexico natural-gas property that the Company does not expect to develop under the forecasted natural-gas price environment. In addition, unproved property impairments for the year ended December 31, 2013 , decreased by $144 million as a result of a change in the Company estimated success rate associated with unproved Gulf of Mexico properties. The decrease was partially offset by unproved oil and gas property impairments in 2013 due to changes to the Company drilling plans, which included $89 million for an unproved property in Block 43/11 in the South China Sea, $53 million for an unproved property in the Esp rito Santo basin in Brazil, and $53 million for a domestic onshore unproved property. For the year ended December 31, 2013 , dry hole expense increased by $116 million primarily due to 2013 dry hole expense for wells in the Gulf of Mexico, Sierra Leone, Kenya, C te d Ivoire, and New Zealand, partially offset by 2012 dry hole expense for wells in Brazil, Sierra Leone, the Gulf of Mexico, Ghana, and C te d Ivoire. Geological and geophysical expense increased $57 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 , primarily due to 2013 seismic purchases in Colombia and the Gulf of Mexico. Exploration expense increased $870 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 . Impairments of unproved properties increased $633 million primarily due to $845 million of 2012 impairments for certain unproved properties in the Rockies and the Gulf of Mexico as discussed above, partially offset by 2011 impairments of certain unproved properties in the Gulf of Mexico of $124 million and Indonesia of $63 million due to decreases in the estimated recoverable cash flows. Dry hole expense increased $286 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 , primarily due to wells in Brazil, Sierra Leone, C te d Ivoire, Mozambique, and the Gulf of Mexico. Geological and geophysical expense decreased $95 million primarily due to fewer seismic purchases in Kenya, Liberia, New Zealand, and Mozambique. Exploration overhead and other increased $46 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 , primarily due to increased exploration activity in U.S. onshore and Mozambique. 62 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements millions except percentages 2013 Inc/(Dec) vs. 2012 2012 Inc/(Dec) vs. 2011 2011 General and administrative $ 1,090 (13 )% $ 1,246 18 % $ 1,060 Depreciation, depletion, and amortization 3,927 (1 ) 3,964 3 3,830 Other taxes 1,077 (12 ) 1,224 (18 ) 1,492 Impairments 794 104 389 (78 ) 1,774 For the year ended December 31, 2013 , general and administrative (G&A) expense decreased by $ 156 million due to reduced legal-related expenses of $101 million and lower employee-related expenses of $60 million. The reduced legal-related expenses were primarily related to lower Tronox legal expenses in 2013 and the third-party reimbursement during 2013 of the Company legal expenses associated with the Algeria exceptional profits tax settlement. The lower employee-related expenses were primarily related to the 2012 expense associated with Unit Appreciation Rights (UARs), partially offset by higher 2013 employee-related expenses associated with operational expansions. The UARs were awarded in prior years to certain officers of the general partner of Western Gas Partners, LP (WES), a consolidated subsidiary of Anadarko, pursuant to the Western Gas Holdings, LLC (WGH) Equity Incentive Plan. This expense was related to the change in fair value of the UARs upon the initial public offering (IPO) of Western Gas Equity Partners, LP (WGP), a consolidated subsidiary formed to own substantially all of Anadarko partnership interests in WES. For the year ended December 31, 2012 , G&A expense increased by $186 million due to higher employee-related expenses of $150 million primarily related to expense associated with the UARs discussed above and $41 million due to legal-related expenses primarily related to increased Tronox legal expenses in 2012. For the year ended December 31, 2013 , depreciation, depletion, and amortization (DD&A) expense decreased by $ 37 million primarily due to accelerated expense in 2012 associated with the depletion of fields in the Gulf of Mexico, partially offset by higher volumes in 2013. For the year ended December 31, 2012 , DD&A expense increased by $134 million primarily due to higher sales volumes, accelerated expense in 2012 as discussed above, and the start of production at Caesar/Tonga in March 2012. These increases were partially offset by lower per-barrel DD&A rates resulting from asset impairments recognized in the fourth quarter of 2011 and reserves additions in 2012 in the Southern and Appalachia Region. For the year ended December 31, 2013 , other taxes decreased by $ 147 million primarily related to lower Algerian exceptional profits taxes of $116 million due to a lower Algeria effective tax rate resulting from the resolution of the Algeria exceptional profits tax dispute and lower crude-oil prices. In addition, lower sales volumes and crude-oil prices resulted in a $33 million decrease in U.S. production and severance taxes primarily in Alaska. For the year ended December 31, 2012 , other taxes decreased by $268 million primarily related to lower Algeria exceptional profits taxes of $184 million due to a lower Algeria effective tax rate resulting from the resolution of the Algeria exceptional profits tax dispute. Other taxes also decreased due to lower commodity prices, which resulted in lower U.S. production and severance taxes of $55 million, and lower ad valorem taxes of $27 million. Impairment expense of $794 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 , included $562 million due to a reduction in estimated future net cash flows per barrel and downward revisions of reserves for certain Gulf of Mexico properties that the Company no longer plans to develop. In addition, impairment expense included $142 million for certain domestic onshore oil and gas properties due to downward revisions of reserves that the Company no longer plans to develop and $49 million for related midstream assets. Impairment expense also included $30 million for certain midstream properties due to a reduction in estimated future cash flows, and $11 million related to the Company Venezuelan cost-method investment due to declines in estimated recoverable value. Declines in commodity prices or negative reserves revisions could result in additional impairments. See Note 5 Impairments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information on impairments and Risk Factors under Item 1A of this Form 10-K for further discussion on the risks associated with oil, natural-gas, and NGLs prices. 63 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Impairment expense was $389 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 . The Company recognized impairments of $363 million related to oil and gas exploration and production reporting segment properties located in the United States, $13 million related to midstream properties, and $13 million related to the Company Venezuelan cost-method investment. Impairment expense for U.S. oil and gas exploration and production reporting segment properties included $259 million related to lower natural-gas prices. Impairment expense for U.S. properties also included $79 million related to downward reserves revisions for a Gulf of Mexico property that was near the end of its economic life and $25 million for a platform in the Gulf of Mexico. Impairment expense of $1.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2011, included $1.2 billion related to oil and gas exploration and production reporting segment properties located in the United States, $458 million for midstream reporting segment properties, and $91 million related to the Company Venezuelan cost-method investment. Impairment expense of $952 million for U.S. onshore oil and gas properties and $446 million for associated midstream properties was triggered by lower natural-gas prices. Impairment expense also included $162 million for certain Gulf of Mexico properties related to declines in estimated recoverable reserves, and $100 million related to onshore properties due to changes in projected cash flows resulting from the Company intent to divest of the properties. millions 2013 2012 2011 Algeria exceptional profits tax settlement $ 33 $ (1,797 ) $ Deepwater Horizon settlement and related costs 15 18 3,930 In March 2012, Anadarko and Sonatrach resolved the exceptional profits tax dispute. The resolution provided for delivery to the Company of crude oil valued at $1.7 billion and the elimination of $62 million of previously recorded and unpaid transportation charges. The Company recognized a $1.8 billion credit in the Costs and Expenses section of the Consolidated Statement of Income for 2012 to reflect the effect of this agreement for previously recorded expenses. During 2013, the Company revised its estimate of income tax expense related to the elimination of previously recorded and unpaid transportation charges and recognized a $33 million unfavorable adjustment to the settlement, which was offset by an equivalent income tax benefit also recognized in 2013. At December 31, 2013, the Company had collected all of the $1.7 billion associated with the Algeria exceptional profits tax receivable. In October 2011, the Company and BP Exploration & Production Inc (BP) entered into the Settlement Agreement, under which the Company paid $4.0 billion in cash and transferred its interest in the Macondo well and the Mississippi Canyon Block 252 lease to BP, and BP agreed to accept this consideration in full satisfaction of its claims against Anadarko. Refer to Note 17 Contingencies Deepwater Horizon Events in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for discussion and analysis of these events. Deepwater Horizon settlement and related costs included legal expenses and related costs associated with the Deepwater Horizon events of $15 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 , and $18 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 . For the year ended December 31, 2011 , Deepwater Horizon settlement and related costs included a $4.0 billion expense for the Company cash payment made to BP pursuant to the Settlement Agreement discussed above, as well as $93 million of legal expenses and other related costs associated with the Deepwater Horizon events. These amounts were partially offset by a $163 million gain recognized in 2011 for insurance recoveries associated with the Deepwater Horizon events. Although Anadarko has been indemnified by BP for certain costs, the Company may be required to recognize a liability for amounts in advance of or in connection with recognizing a receivable from BP for the related indemnity payment. In all circumstances, however, the Company expects that any additional indemnified liability that may be recorded by the Company will be subsequently recovered from BP itself or through the guarantees of BPCNA or BP p.l.c. Additionally, as part of the Settlement Agreement, BP has agreed that, to the extent it receives value in the future from claims that it has asserted or could assert against third parties arising from or relating to the Deepwater Horizon events, it will make cash payments (not to exceed $1.0 billion in the aggregate) to Anadarko, on a current and continuing basis, equal to 12.5% of the aggregate value received by BP in excess of $1.5 billion. Any payments received by the Company pursuant to this arrangement will be accounted for as a reimbursement of the $4.0 billion 2011 payment made to BP as part of the Settlement Agreement. 64 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Other (Income) Expense millions except percentages 2013 Inc/(Dec) vs. 2012 2012 Inc/(Dec) vs. 2011 2011 Interest Expense Current debt, long-term debt, and other $ 949 (1 )% $ 963 (2 )% $ 986 Capitalized interest (263 ) (19 ) (221 ) (50 ) (147 ) Interest expense $ 686 (8 ) $ 742 (12 ) $ 839 Anadarko interest expense decreased by $56 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 , primarily due to an increase in capitalized interest of $42 million related to higher construction-in-progress balances for long-term capital projects. Additionally, interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2013 , decreased $31 million as a result of the repayment of outstanding borrowings during 2012 associated with the five-year, $5.0 billion Facility. The decrease for the year ended December 31, 2013 , was partially offset by $18 million of interest expense for outstanding borrowings primarily related to WES 4.000% Senior Notes due 2022. For additional information, see Liquidity and Capital Resources and Interest-Rate Risk under Item 7A of this Form 10-K. Anadarko interest expense decreased by $97 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 , primarily due to an increase in capitalized interest of $74 million related to higher construction-in-progress balances for long-term capital projects. Additionally, interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2012 , decreased by $32 million as a result of interest incurred during 2011 related to the Company capital lease obligations for a floating production, storage, and offloading vessel (FPSO) for the Company Jubilee field operations in Ghana. In December 2011, the Company and its partners in the Jubilee project purchased the vessel, resulting in cancellation of the capital lease obligation. millions 2013 2012 2011 (Gains) Losses on Derivatives, net (Gains) losses on commodity derivatives, net $ 141 $ (387 ) $ (562 ) (Gains) losses on interest-rate and other derivatives, net (539 ) 61 1,023 (Gains) losses on derivatives, net $ (398 ) $ (326 ) $ 461 (Gains) losses on derivatives, net represents the changes in fair value of the Company derivative instruments. Anadarko enters into commodity derivatives to manage the risk of changes in the market prices for its anticipated sales of production and enters into interest-rate swaps to fix or float interest rates on existing or anticipated indebtedness to manage exposure to unfavorable interest-rate changes.

In 2013, as a result of a bankruptcy declaration by a third party, the U.S. Department of the Interior ordered Anadarko to decommission offshore wells and production facilities previously sold to the third party and not related to the Company current operations. During 2013, the Company recognized a decommissioning charge of $117 million. Anadarko expects to complete decommissioning of the production facilities in 2014 and the wells in 2015. Also, the Company was previously notified that, as a result of a prior acquisition, it is one of 27 potentially responsible parties with respect to a landfill located in California and recorded a restoration liability of $50 million in 2013. These decreases to other income were partially offset by the 2013 reversal of the $56 million tax indemnification liability associated with the 2006 sale of the Company Canadian subsidiary. The indemnity was reversed as a result of certain Canadian tax legislative changes. Total other income increased $8 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 , due to changes in foreign-currency gains/losses. These gains/losses reflected the impact of exchange-rate changes primarily applicable to foreign currency held in escrow pending final determination of the Company Brazilian tax liability attributable to the 2008 divestiture of the Peregrino field offshore Brazil. millions 2013 2012 2011 Tronox-related contingent loss $ 850 $ (250 ) $ 250 During 2013, the Company recognized an $850 million contingent loss related to the Adversary Proceeding. During 2012, the Company reversed the $250 million Tronox-related contingent loss recognized in 2011. See Note 17 Contingencies Tronox Litigation in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Income Tax Expense millions except percentages 2013 2012 2011 Income tax expense (benefit) $ 1,165 $ 1,120 $ (856 ) Effective tax rate 55 % 31 % 25 % The increase from the 35% U.S. federal statutory rate for the year ended December 31, 2013 , was primarily attributable to the tax impact from foreign operations, non-deductible Algerian exceptional profits tax, and deferred tax adjustments. The decrease from the 35% U.S. federal statutory rate for the year ended December 31, 2012 , was primarily attributable to the non-taxable resolution of the Algeria exceptional profits tax dispute. This amount was partially offset by the tax impact from foreign operations and non-deductible Algerian exceptional profits tax. The Company reported a loss before income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2011 . As a result, items that ordinarily increase or decrease the tax rate will have the opposite effect. The decrease from the 35% U.S. federal statutory rate for the year ended December 31, 2011 , was primarily attributable to non-deductible Algerian exceptional profits tax, the tax impact from foreign operations, and items resulting from business acquisitions and other items. These amounts were partially offset by state income tax benefits of the loss. For additional information on income tax rates, see Note 19 Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. 66 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests The Company net income attributable to noncontrolling interests of $140 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 , $54 million for 2012 , and $81 million for 2011 , related to public ownership interests in WES for all periods and WGP for 2013 and 2012. Public ownership of WES was 56.4% at December 31, 2013 , 51.8% at December 31, 2012 , and 54.7% at December 31, 2011 . In December 2012, WGP completed its IPO of approximately 20 million common units representing limited partner interests in WGP at a price of $22.00 per common unit. Public ownership of WGP was 9.0% at December 31, 2013 and 2012 . See Note 9 Noncontrolling Interests in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. OPERATING RESULTS Segment Analysis Adjusted EBITDAX To assess the performance of Anadarko operating segments, the chief operating decision maker analyzes Adjusted EBITDAX. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDAX as income (loss) before income taxes; exploration expense; DD&A; impairments; interest expense; total (gains) losses on derivatives, net, less net cash received in settlement of commodity derivatives; and certain items not related to the Company normal operations, less net income attributable to noncontrolling interests. During the periods presented, certain items not related to the Company normal operations included Deepwater Horizon settlement and related costs, Algeria exceptional profits tax settlement, Tronox-related contingent loss, and certain other nonoperating items included in other (income) expense, net. The Company definition of Adjusted EBITDAX, which is not a GAAP measure, excludes exploration expense, as it is not an indicator of operating efficiency for a given reporting period. However, exploration expense is monitored by management as part of costs incurred in exploration and development activities. Similarly, DD&A and impairments are excluded from Adjusted EBITDAX as a measure of segment operating performance because capital expenditures are evaluated at the time capital costs are incurred. Adjusted EBITDAX also excludes interest expense to allow for assessment of segment operating results without regard to Anadarko financing methods or capital structure. Total (gains) losses on derivatives, net, less net cash received in settlement of commodity derivatives are excluded from Adjusted EBITDAX because these (gains) losses are not considered a measure of asset operating performance. Finally, net income attributable to noncontrolling interests is excluded from the Company measure of Adjusted EBITDAX because it represents earnings that are not attributable to the Company common stockholders. Management believes that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDAX provides information useful in assessing the Company financial condition and results of operations and that Adjusted EBITDAX is a widely accepted financial indicator of a company ability to incur and service debt, fund capital expenditures, and make distributions to stockholders. Adjusted EBITDAX, as defined by Anadarko, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Therefore, Anadarko consolidated Adjusted EBITDAX should be considered in conjunction with net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders and other performance measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, such as operating income or cash flows from operating activities. Adjusted EBITDAX has important limitations as an analytical tool because it excludes certain items that affect net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders and net cash provided by operating activities. Adjusted EBITDAX should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of Anadarko results as reported under GAAP. Below is a reconciliation of consolidated Adjusted EBITDAX to income (loss) before income taxes, and consolidated Adjusted EBITDAX by reporting segment. 67 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Adjusted EBITDAX millions except percentages 2013 Inc/(Dec) vs. 2012 2012 Inc/(Dec) vs. 2011 2011 Income (loss) before income taxes $ 2,106 (41 )% $ 3,565 NM $ (3,424 ) Exploration expense 1,329 (32) 1,946 81 % 1,076 DD&A 3,927 (1) 3,964 3 3,830 Impairments 794 104 389 (78) 1,774 Interest expense 686 (8) 742 (12) 839 Total (gains) losses on derivatives, net, less net cash received in settlement of commodity derivatives (307 ) (169) 443 (34) 675 Deepwater Horizon settlement and related costs 15 (17) 18 (100) 3,930 Algeria exceptional profits tax settlement 33 102 (1,797 ) NM Tronox-related contingent loss 850 NM (250 ) NM 250 Certain other nonoperating items 110 NM NM Less net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 140 159 54 (33) 81 Consolidated Adjusted EBITDAX $ 9,403 5 $ 8,966 1 $ 8,869 Adjusted EBITDAX by segment Oil and gas exploration and production $ 9,238 9 $ 8,500 (3) $ 8,787 Midstream 508 7 474 13 419 Marketing (125 ) (20) (104 ) (65) (63 ) Other and intersegment eliminations (218 ) NM 96 135 (274 ) Oil and Gas Exploration and Production The increase in Adjusted EBITDAX for the year ended December 31, 2013 , was primarily due to higher sales volumes for all products and higher natural-gas prices, partially offset by lower crude-oil and NGLs prices and losses on divestitures primarily related to the Pinedale/Jonah assets in the Rockies. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDAX for the year ended December 31, 2012 , was primarily due to lower NGLs and natural-gas prices, partially offset by higher sales volumes. Midstream The increase in Adjusted EBITDAX for the year ended December 31, 2013 , was primarily due to higher gathering revenue as a result of increased throughput across several of Anadarko gathering systems. For the year ended December 31, 2012 , the increase in Adjusted EBITDAX resulted from additional operating income from assets acquired in February 2011 and May 2011, and an increase in gathering and processing revenues associated with increased throughput across several of Anadarko fee-based systems. This increase was partially offset by lower commodity prices, which led to reduced natural-gas processing margins. Marketing Marketing earnings primarily represent the margin earned on sales of natural gas, oil, and NGLs purchased from third parties. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDAX for the year ended December 31, 2013 , resulted from higher transportation expenses due to increased third-party volumes and increased demand fees, partially offset by higher margins primarily associated with natural-gas and NGLs sales. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDAX for the year ended December 31, 2012 , resulted from lower margins as a result of lower sales prices and increased transportation expenses primarily due to higher demand fees. 68 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Other and Intersegment Eliminations Other and intersegment eliminations consists primarily of corporate costs, income from hard minerals investments and royalties, and net cash received in settlement of commodity derivatives. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDAX for the year ended December 31, 2013 , was primarily due to a decrease in net cash received in settlement of commodity derivatives in 2013, partially offset by 2012 expense associated with the change in the fair value of the general partner UARs in connection with the WGP IPO. The UARs were awarded in prior years to certain officers of the general partner of WES, pursuant to the WGH Equity Incentive Plan. The increase in Adjusted EBITDAX for the year ended December 31, 2012 , was primarily due to an increase in net cash received in settlement of commodity derivatives in 2012 , partially offset by the 2012 expense associated with general partner UARs discussed above. Proved Reserves Anadarko is focused on growth and profitability, and reserves replacement is a key to growth. Future profitability partially depends on commodity prices and the cost of finding and developing oil and gas reserves. Reserves growth can be achieved through successful exploration and development drilling, improved recovery, or acquisition of producing properties. Additional reserves information is contained in the Supplemental Information on Oil and Gas Exploration and Production Activities (Supplemental Information) under Item 8 of this Form 10-K.

Proved Reserves Additions and Revisions During 2013 , the Company added 528 MMBOE of proved reserves as a result of additions (purchases in place, discoveries, and extensions) and revisions. The Company expects the majority of future reserves growth to come from revisions associated with infill drilling (reserves bookings related to infill wells are treated as positive revisions due to increases in expected recovery), extensions of current fields, new discoveries in U.S. onshore and the Gulf of Mexico, successful exploration in international growth areas, and purchases of properties in strategic areas. 69 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Additions During 2013 , Anadarko added 145 MMBOE of proved reserves through extensions and discoveries primarily as a result of successful drilling in the Marcellus shale and the Gulf of Mexico. Although shale plays represent only about 13% of the Company total proved reserves at December 31, 2013 , growth in the shale plays contributed 70 MMBOE, or 48%, of the total extensions and discoveries. In addition, Anadarko added 36 MMBOE of developed reserves through acquisition activities almost exclusively in the Rockies. During 2012 , Anadarko added 82 MMBOE of proved reserves primarily as a result of successful drilling in the Marcellus shale and the Gulf of Mexico. Shale plays contributed 66 MMBOE of the total extensions and discoveries in 2012 . During 2011 , Anadarko added 174 MMBOE of proved reserves primarily as a result of successful drilling in the Marcellus and Eagleford shales and the Gulf of Mexico. Shale plays contributed 119 MMBOE of the 2011 additions. Revisions Total revisions in 2013 resulted in an increase of 347 MMBOE, or 14%, of the beginning-of-year reserves base. Total revisions include the effects of new infill drilling, changes in commodity prices and other updates reflecting changes in economic conditions, changes in reservoir performance, and changes in development plans. Total 2013 revisions included an increase of 410 MMBOE related to successful infill drilling, primarily in large onshore areas such as Wattenberg, Greater Natural Buttes, and the Eagleford shale and 30 MMBOE resulting from improved oil and natural-gas prices. Partially offsetting these positive revisions were decreases of 53 MMBbls of NGLs reserves due to lower ethane prices and 40 MMBOE due to other non-price-related revisions primarily in the Rockies. Total revisions in 2012 were 284 MMBOE or 11% of the beginning-of-year reserves base. Total 2012 revisions included an increase of 383 MMBOE related to successful infill drilling, primarily in Greater Natural Buttes, Wattenberg, and Carthage, and 33 MMBOE resulting from the resolution of the Algeria exceptional profits tax dispute. Partially offsetting these positive revisions were decreases of 68 MMBOE due to lower commodity prices, 56 MMBOE at Wattenberg primarily due to removing reserves associated with the discontinued vertical drilling program, and 8 MMBOE from all other assets. Total revisions in 2011 were 218 MMBOE or 9% of the beginning-of-year reserves base. The revisions included an increase of 203 MMBOE related to the continuation of successful infill drilling in large onshore areas, including Greater Natural Buttes, Wattenberg, and Pinedale fields; 182 MMBOE of positive revisions to prior estimates; and 8 MMBOE associated with higher oil prices. These positive revisions were partially offset by the transfer of 175 MMBOE of proved reserves to unproved categories as a result of changes to development plans and economic conditions experienced during 2011. Sales in Place In 2013 , the Company sold U.S. properties or interests in U.S. properties containing 12 MMBOE of proved undeveloped reserves. Sales were almost exclusively associated with a partial sale of a working interest in the Gulf of Mexico Heidelberg development project. In 2012 , the Company sold U.S. properties or interests in U.S. properties containing 59 MMBOE of proved developed reserves and 22 MMBOE of proved undeveloped reserves. Sales included a portion of the Company working interests in the Rockies Salt Creek enhanced oil recovery project and the Gulf of Mexico Lucius development project, and asset divestitures in South Texas, West Texas, the Gulf of Mexico, the Rockies, and North Louisiana. In 2011 , the Company sold U.S. properties containing 7 MMBOE of proved developed reserves and 22 MMBOE of proved undeveloped reserves. This included a transaction in the Maverick basin and asset divestitures in South Texas and Alaska. Discounted Future Net Cash Flows At December 31, 2013 , the discounted (at 10%) estimated future net cash flows from Anadarko proved reserves was $29.1 billion (measured in accordance with the regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)). This amount was calculated based on the 12-month average beginning-of-month prices for the year, held flat for the life of the reserves, adjusted for any contractual provisions. See Supplemental Information under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. The present value of future net cash flows is not an estimate of the fair value of Anadarko proved reserves. An estimate of fair value would also take into account, among other things, anticipated changes in future prices and costs, the expected recovery of reserves in excess of proved reserves, and a discount factor more representative of the time value of money and the risks inherent in producing oil and natural gas. 70 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Overview Anadarko generates cash needed to fund capital expenditures, debt-service obligations, and dividend payments primarily from operating activities, and enters into debt and equity transactions to maintain its desired capital structure and to finance acquisition opportunities. Liquidity may also be enhanced through asset divestitures and joint ventures that reduce future capital expenditures. In addition, as of January 2014, an effective registration statement is available to Anadarko, covering the resale of up to 40 million WGP common units. These common units were issued to Anadarko in connection with WGP IPO in December 2012. During 2013 , the primary source for funding of capital investments was cash flows from operating activities. In addition, the Company collected the remaining $730 million of the Algeria exceptional profits tax settlement. The Company continuously monitors its liquidity needs, coordinates its capital expenditure program with its expected cash flows and projected debt-repayment schedule, and evaluates available funding alternatives in light of current and expected conditions. At December 31, 2013 , Anadarko scheduled 2014 debt maturities were $775 million . Anadarko $275 million aggregate principal amount of 5.750% Senior Notes due June 2014 and Zero-Coupon Senior Notes due 2036 (Zero Coupons), which can be put to the Company in October 2014 (the next potential put date) for up to the then-accreted value of $756 million , are classified as long-term debt on the Company Consolidated Balance Sheets, as the Company has the ability and intent to refinance these obligations using long-term debt. There are no scheduled debt maturities in 2015 , exclusive of the Zero Coupons. The Company has a variety of funding sources available, including cash on hand, an asset portfolio that provides ongoing cash-flow-generating capacity, opportunities for liquidity enhancement through divestitures and joint-venture arrangements, and the Company $5.0 billion Facility. Management believes that the Company liquidity position, asset portfolio, and continued strong operating and financial performance provide the necessary financial flexibility to fund the Company current and long-term operations. Effects of Tronox Adversary Proceeding on Liquidity During 2013, the Company recorded an $850 million contingent liability related to the Adversary Proceeding. See Note 17 Contingencies Tronox Litigation in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for the nature and status of this litigation and the Company liability accrual. The Company expects the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (Bankruptcy Court) to issue a judgment that will then be subject to appeal. Following a judgment, there are potential short-term and long-term liquidity impacts to the Company. In the short term, following a judgment the Company would be required either to pay the damage award or appeal the judgment. In the appellate process, the Company may be required to post a bond or provide sufficient security within 14 days of the judgment to stay execution of the judgment by the plaintiffs pending the outcome of the appellate process. As the Bankruptcy Court has not yet issued a judgment, the Company is unable to estimate the potential amount of any bond or other security, or whether the Company would be required to provide a bond or other security, given the value of the assets owned by Kerr-McGee. Other short-term impacts could include a settlement and payment of any amounts agreed to with the plaintiffs, although a settlement is not considered probable at this time. In the event the Company is required to provide a bond or payment of any damage award or settlement with the plaintiffs in the short term, the Company expects to be able to access the surety bond market and supplement or support such bonding by (i) using a portion of available cash on hand ($3.7 billion at December 31, 2013 ), (ii) accessing the Company $5.0 billion Facility, (iii) entering into new financing arrangements, or (iv) identifying and monetizing assets in an orderly manner, including those previously identified and closed through February 2014. As final resolution through the appellate process could take several years, it is not possible to predict the Company resources that will be available at that time. As the Company continues to evaluate its liquidity needs, it will consider events that may occur with respect to the Adversary Proceeding. For example, to meet future cash demands, the Company could adjust capital spending or assets could be divested. 71 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Revolving Credit Facility Borrowings under the $5.0 billion Facility bear interest, at the Company election, at (i) the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a margin ranging from 1.25% to 2.50%, based on the Company credit rating, or (ii) the greatest of (a) the JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. prime rate, (b) the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus 0.50%, or (c) one-month LIBOR plus 1%, plus, in each case, an applicable margin ranging from 0.25% to 1.50%. Obligations incurred under the $5.0 billion Facility, as well as obligations Anadarko has to lenders or their affiliates pursuant to certain derivative instruments as discussed in Note 11 Derivative Instruments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K, are guaranteed by certain of the Company wholly owned domestic subsidiaries, and are secured by a perfected first-priority security interest in certain exploration and production assets located in the United States and 65% of the capital stock of certain wholly owned foreign subsidiaries. Financial Covenants The $5.0 billion Facility contains various customary covenants with which Anadarko must comply, including, but not limited to, limitations on incurrence of indebtedness, liens on assets, and asset sales. Anadarko is also required to maintain, at the end of each quarter, (i) a Consolidated Leverage Ratio of no more than 4.5 to 1.0 (relative to Consolidated EBITDAX for the most recent period of four calendar quarters), (ii) a ratio of Current Assets to Current Liabilities of no less than 1.0 to 1.0, and (iii) a Collateral Coverage Ratio of no less than 1.75 to 1.0, in each case, as defined in the $5.0 billion Facility. The Collateral Coverage Ratio is the ratio of an annually redetermined value of pledged assets to outstanding loans under the $5.0 billion Facility. Additionally, to borrow from the $5.0 billion Facility, the Collateral Coverage Ratio must be no less than 1.75 to 1.0 after giving pro forma effect to the requested borrowing. At December 31, 2013 , the Company was in compliance with applicable covenants, and there were no restrictions on its ability to utilize the $5.0 billion Facility. The covenants contained in certain of the Company credit agreements provide for a maximum Anadarko debt-to-capitalization ratio of 67%. The covenants do not specifically restrict the payment of dividends; however, the impact of dividends paid on the Company debt-to-capitalization ratio must be considered to ensure covenant compliance. At December 31, 2013 , Anadarko was in compliance with all financial covenants. Zero-Coupon Notes In a 2006 private offering, Anadarko received $500 million of loan proceeds upon issuing the Zero Coupons. The Zero Coupons mature in October 2036 and have an aggregate principal amount due at maturity of $2.4 billion, reflecting a yield to maturity of 5.24%. The Zero Coupons can be put to the Company in October of each year, which would cause the Company to repay up to the then-accreted value of the outstanding Zero Coupons. The accreted value of the outstanding Zero Coupons was $727 million at December 31, 2013 , and will be $756 million in October 2014 (the next potential put date). The Company considers its cash-flow-generating capacity and access to additional liquidity sufficient to continue to satisfy the Company debt-service and other obligations, including the potential early repayment of the outstanding Zero Coupons. WES Funding Sources Anadarko consolidated subsidiary, WES, uses cash flows from operations to fund ongoing operations (including capital investments in the ordinary course of business), service its debt, and make distributions to its equity holders. As needed, WES supplements cash generated from its operating activities with proceeds from debt or equity issuances or borrowings under its five-year, $800 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility maturing in March 2016 (RCF). Borrowings under the RCF bear interest at (i) LIBOR plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.30% to 1.90%, or (ii) the greatest of (a) the Wells Fargo Bank, National Association prime rate, (b) the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus 0.50%, or (c) one-month LIBOR plus 1%, plus, in each case, an applicable margin ranging from 0.30% to 0.90%. At December 31, 2013 , WES was in compliance with all covenants contained in its RCF and had no outstanding borrowings under its RCF. See Financing Activities below. In February 2014, WES entered into a five-year, $1.2 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility maturing in February 2019 (2014 RCF), which amended and restated the RCF. The 2014 RCF is expandable to a maximum of $1.5 billion. Borrowings under the 2014 RCF bear interest at (i) LIBOR plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.975% to 1.45%, or (ii) the greatest of (a) the Wells Fargo Bank, National Association prime rate, (b) the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus 0.50%, or (c) one-month LIBOR plus 1%, plus, in each case, an applicable margin ranging from zero to 0.45%. During 2013, WES began selling common units under a continuous offering program, which authorized the issuance of up to an aggregate of $125 million of common units. WES completed sales totaling 686 thousand common units during 2013 at an average price per unit of $60.84, generating gross proceeds of $42 million. 72 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Insurance Coverage and Other Indemnities Anadarko maintains property and casualty insurance that includes coverage for physical damage to the Company properties, blowout/control of a well, restoration and redrill, sudden and accidental pollution, third-party liability, workers compensation and employers liability, and other risks. Anadarko insurance coverage includes deductibles that must be met prior to recovery. Additionally, the Company insurance is subject to exclusions and limitations, and there is no assurance that such coverage will adequately protect the Company against liability or loss from all potential consequences and damages. The Company current insurance coverage includes (a) $300 million per occurrence from Oil Insurance Limited (OIL) for physical damage to Anadarko properties on a replacement cost basis, blowout/control of well, redrill, and sudden and accidental pollution; (b) $700 million per occurrence from the commercial markets for the items described in item (a) above, which is in excess of the OIL coverage and which follows the form of OIL coverage with certain exceptions; (c) $400 million from the commercial markets, which scales to Anadarko working interest, for third-party liabilities including sudden and accidental pollution and aviation liability; and (d) $275 million for aircraft liability (in addition to the third-party liability limits described in item (c) above). Anadarko does not carry significant coverage for loss of production income from any of the Company facilities or for any losses that result from the effects of a named windstorm. Anadarko property and casualty insurance policies renew in June of each year. At the next renewal date scheduled for June 2014, the Company may not be able to secure similar coverage for the same costs, if at all. Future insurance coverage costs for the oil and gas industry could increase and may include higher deductibles or retentions. In addition, some forms of insurance may become unavailable in the future or unavailable on terms that the Company considers economically acceptable. The Company service agreements, including drilling contracts, generally indemnify Anadarko for injuries and death to employees of the service provider and subcontractors hired by the service provider as well as for property damage suffered by the service provider and its contractors. Also, these service agreements generally indemnify Anadarko for pollution originating from the equipment of any contractors or subcontractors hired by the service provider. Following is a discussion of significant sources and uses of cash flows for the three-year period ended December 31, 2013 . Forward-looking information related to the Company liquidity and capital resources is discussed in Outlook that follows. Sources of Cash Operating Activities Anadarko cash flows from operating activities in 2013 was $8.9 billion compared to $8.3 billion in 2012 and $2.5 billion in 2011 . Cash flows from operating activities for 2013 increased year over year primarily due to higher sales volumes, higher average natural-gas prices, and the favorable impact of changes in working capital items, partially offset by lower average crude-oil and NGLs prices and a decrease in cash collected in 2013 associated with the Algeria exceptional profits tax receivable. Cash flows from operating activities for 2012 increased year over year primarily due to the $4.0 billion payment to BP related to the Settlement Agreement in 2011, $1.0 billion collected in 2012 associated with the Algeria exceptional profits tax receivable, higher sales volumes, and the favorable impact of changes in working capital items, partially offset by lower average NGLs and natural-gas prices. One of the primary sources of variability in the Company cash flows from operating activities is fluctuation in commodity prices, which Anadarko partially mitigates by entering into commodity derivatives. Sales-volume changes also impact cash flow, but have not been as volatile as commodity prices. Anadarko long-term cash flows from operating activities is dependent on commodity prices, sales volumes, costs required for continued operations, and debt service. Investing Activities Anadarko received pretax sales proceeds related to property divestiture transactions of $567 million in 2013 , $657 million in 2012 , and $555 million in 2011 . 73 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Financing Activities During 2013 , Anadarko consolidated subsidiary, WES, borrowed $710 million under its RCF, primarily to fund the 2013 acquisitions of an interest in certain gas-gathering systems located in the Marcellus shale in north-central Pennsylvania and an intrastate pipeline in southwestern Wyoming, and for other general partnership purposes, including the funding of capital expenditures. During 2013, WES issued approximately 12 million common units to the public, including the continuous offering program discussed in WES Funding Sources . These offerings raised net proceeds of $725 million , which were primarily used to repay outstanding RCF borrowings and for other general partnership purposes, including funding of WES capital expenditures. Also in 2013, WES completed a public offering of $250 million aggregate principal amount of 2.600% Senior Notes due 2018, with net proceeds from the offering used to repay outstanding borrowings under its RCF. During 2012, WES borrowed $374 million under its RCF, primarily to fund the acquisition of certain midstream assets from Anadarko. Also during 2012, WES completed a public offering of $670 million aggregate principal amount of 4.000% Senior Notes due 2022 and issued five million common units to the public, raising net proceeds of $212 million. Proceeds from these public offerings were used to repay outstanding RCF borrowings and for other general partnership purposes, including the funding of capital expenditures. In December 2012, WGP completed its IPO of approximately 20 million common units representing limited partner interests in WGP at a price of $22.00 per common unit, for net proceeds of $411 million. The proceeds were used by WGP to purchase common and general partner units in WES, and were in turn used by WES for general partnership purposes, including the funding of WES capital expenditures. During 2011, Anadarko borrowed $2.5 billion under the $5.0 billion Facility to fund a portion of the $4.0 billion payment to BP associated with the Settlement Agreement (see Deepwater Horizon Settlement Costs below). In 2011, WES borrowed $320 million under its RCF primarily to fund a third-party asset acquisition and $250 million under its RCF to repay the senior unsecured term loan (Term Loan) as discussed in Uses of Cash . Also during 2011, WES issued approximately 10 million common units to the public, raising net proceeds of $328 million, which were used to repay outstanding RCF borrowings and for other general partnership purposes. In addition, during 2011, WES completed a public offering of $500 million aggregate principal amount of 5.375% Senior Notes due 2021, with net proceeds from the offering used to repay amounts then outstanding under its RCF. 74 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Uses of Cash Anadarko invests significant capital to develop, acquire, and explore for oil and natural-gas resources and to expand its midstream infrastructure. The Company also uses cash to fund ongoing operating costs, capital contributions to equity subsidiaries, debt repayments, and distributions to its shareholders. Capital Expenditures The following presents the Company capital expenditures by category: millions 2013 2012 2011 Property acquisitions Exploration $ 327 $ 239 $ 647 Development 324 Exploration 1,970 2,064 1,469 Development 4,865 4,064 3,525 Total oil and gas costs incurred (1) 7,486 6,367 5,641 Less corporate acquisitions and non-cash property exchanges (6 ) (32 ) (17 ) Less asset retirement costs (180 ) (98 ) (148 ) Less geological and geophysical, exploration overhead, delay rentals expenses, and other expenses (430 ) (401 ) (450 ) Total oil and gas capital expenditures 6,870 5,836 5,026 Gathering, processing, and marketing and other (2) 1,653 1,475 1,527 Total capital expenditures (1) $ 8,523 $ 7,311 $ 6,553 _______________________________________________________________________________ (1) Oil and gas costs incurred represent costs related to finding and developing oil and gas reserves. Capital expenditures represent additions to property and equipment excluding corporate acquisitions, property exchanges, and asset retirement costs. Capital expenditures and costs incurred are presented on an accrual basis. Additions to properties and equipment and dry hole costs on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows include certain adjustments that give effect to the timing of actual cash payments in order to provide a cash-basis presentation. (2) Includes WES capital expenditures of $792 million in 2013 , $529 million in 2012 , and $439 million in 2011 . The Company capital spending increased by 17% for the year ended December 31, 2013 , due to development drilling onshore and offshore in the United States and acquisitions of oil and gas development properties and domestic onshore plants and gathering systems. In 2013, Anadarko exchanged certain oil and gas properties in the Wattenberg field with a third party to enhance its core acreage position, in which $106 million of capital was incurred. Also in 2013, Anadarko acquired certain oil and gas properties and related assets in the Moxa area of Wyoming for $310 million , including $306 million reflected in the table above representing the fair value of the oil and gas properties acquired. In 2013, the Company acquired a 33.75% interest in gas-gathering systems located in the Marcellus shale in north-central Pennsylvania for $135 million and an intrastate pipeline in southwestern Wyoming for $28 million . These increases were offset by lower capital spending associated with decreased exploration drilling in West Africa and U.S. onshore and lower capital requirements to Anadarko related to development projects as a result of the carried-interest arrangements discussed below. In 2013, the Company entered into a carried-interest arrangement that requires a third-party partner to fund $860 million of Anadarko capital costs in exchange for a 12.75% working interest in the Heidelberg development, located in the Gulf of Mexico. The third-party funding is expected to cover the substantial majority of Anadarko expected future capital costs through first production, which is expected to occur by mid-2016. At December 31, 2013 , $119 million of the total $860 million obligation had been funded. In 2012, the Company entered into a carried-interest arrangement that requires a third-party partner to fund $556 million of Anadarko capital costs in exchange for a 7.2% working interest in the Lucius development, located in the Gulf of Mexico. The carry obligation is expected to cover the substantial majority of the Company expected future capital costs through first production, which is expected to occur in the second-half of 2014. At December 31, 2013 , $416 million of the $556 million obligation had been funded. 75 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements The Company capital spending increased 12% for the year ended December 31, 2012 , primarily due to increased exploration drilling onshore and offshore in the United States, and in East and West Africa; increased development drilling onshore in the United States; construction costs related to the development of the Lucius project located in the Gulf of Mexico; and higher expenditures for additional capital projects at domestic onshore plants and gathering systems. These increases were partially offset by lower exploration property acquisition costs, primarily onshore in the United States, and 2011 midstream asset acquisitions. In 2011, Anadarko increased its ownership interest in the Wattenberg Plant to 100% by acquiring an additional 93% interest for $576 million. Also in 2011, the Company acquired a third-party natural-gas processing plant and related gathering systems, located in the Rocky Mountains area, for $302 million. Deepwater Horizon Settlement Costs In October 2011, the Company and BP entered into the Settlement Agreement. The Company paid $4.0 billion and transferred its interest in the Macondo well and Lease to BP. Refer to Note 17 Contingencies Deepwater Horizon Events in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information. Pension Contributions During 2013 , the Company made contributions of $123 million to its funded pension plans, $37 million to its unfunded pension plans, and $14 million to its unfunded other postretirement benefit plans. The increase in contributions to the funded pension plans in 2013 resulted from a decrease in the discount rates used for funding purposes. The Company expects to contribute $103 million to its funded pension plans, $19 million to its unfunded pension plans, and $15 million to its unfunded other postretirement benefit plans in 2014 . During 2012 , the Company made contributions of $101 million to its funded pension plans, $6 million to its unfunded pension plans, and $19 million to its unfunded other postretirement benefit plans. The decrease in contributions to the funded pension plans in 2012 resulted from an increase in the discount rates used for funding purposes. Investments During 2013 , the Company made capital contributions of $396 million to equity subsidiaries, which are included in Other net under Investing Activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. These contributions were primarily associated with joint ventures to build the Front Range Pipeline, the Texas Express Pipeline, and two fractionation trains in Mont Belvieu. The Company made capital contributions to equity subsidiaries of $205 million in 2012 and $47 million in 2011 . Debt Retirements and Repayments During 2013 , WES repaid $710 million of borrowings under its RCF with proceeds from debt and equity offerings, as discussed in Sources of Cash. During 2012 , the Company repaid the entire $2.5 billion of borrowings under its $5.0 billion Facility, and retired $131 million of 6.125% Senior Notes that matured in March 2012 and $39 million of 5.000% Senior Notes that matured in October 2012. In addition, WES repaid $374 million of borrowings under its RCF. During 2011 , WES repaid $619 million of borrowings under its RCF and a $250 million Term Loan primarily from proceeds from public debt and equity offerings, as discussed in Sources of Cash . In addition, the Company repaid $285 million principal amount of 6.875% Senior Notes that matured in September 2011. For additional information on the Company debt instruments, such as transactions during the period, years of maturity, and interest rates, see Note 12 Debt and Interest Expense in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Common Stock Dividends and Distributions to Noncontrolling Interest Owners Anadarko paid dividends to its common stockholders of $ 274 million in 2013 , $181 million in 2012 , and $181 million in 2011 . During the third quarter of 2013, Anadarko increased the quarterly dividend paid to its common stockholders from $0.09 per share to $0.18 per share. Anadarko has paid a dividend to its common stockholders quarterly since becoming a public company in 1986. The amount of future dividends paid to Anadarko common stockholders will be determined by the Board of Directors on a quarterly basis and will depend on earnings, financial conditions, capital requirements, the effect a dividend payment would have on the Company compliance with relevant financial covenants, and other factors. 76 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements WES distributed to its unitholders, other than Anadarko, an aggregate of $130 million in 2013 , $100 million in 2012 , and $72 million in 2011 . WES has made quarterly distributions to its unitholders since its IPO in the second quarter of 2008 and has increased its distribution from $0.30 per common unit for the third quarter of 2008 to $0.60 per common unit for the fourth quarter of 2013 (to be paid in February 2014). WGP distributed to its unitholders, other than Anadarko, an aggregate of $12 million during 2013 . WGP declared a cash distribution of $0.23125 per unit for the fourth quarter of 2013 (to be paid in February 2014). Other During 2011, the Company and its partners in the Jubilee project in Ghana purchased the FPSO. The Company cash contribution was $108 million. Outlook There is uncertainty related to the ultimate outcome of the Adversary Proceeding. See Effects of Tronox Adversary Proceeding on Liquidity for more information. The Company is committed to the execution of its worldwide exploration, appraisal, and development programs. The Company plans to allocate approximately 70% of its 2014 capital spending to development activities, 15% to exploration activities, and 15% to gas-gathering and processing activities and other business activities. The Company expects its 2014 capital spending by area to be approximately 60% for the U.S. onshore region and Alaska, 15% for the Gulf of Mexico, 15% for Midstream and other, and 10% for International. Anadarko believes that its cash on hand and expected level of operating cash flows will be sufficient to fund the Company projected operational and capital programs for 2014 and continue to meet its other current obligations. The Company cash on hand is available for use and could be supplemented, as needed, with available borrowing capacity under the $5.0 billion Facility. The Company may also enter into carried-interest arrangements with third parties to fund certain capital expenditures and execute asset divestitures to supplement cash flow. The Company continuously monitors its liquidity needs, coordinates its capital expenditure program with its expected cash flows and projected debt-repayment schedule, and evaluates available funding alternatives in light of current and expected conditions. To reduce commodity-price risk and increase the predictability of 2014 cash flows, Anadarko entered into strategic derivative positions, which cover a portion of its anticipated natural-gas and crude-oil sales volumes for 2014 . For details of derivative positions at December 31, 2013 , see Note 11 Derivative Instruments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. The Company sold a 10% working interest in Rovuma Offshore Area 1 in Mozambique for $2.64 billion in February 2014. Anadarko remains the operator of Rovuma Offshore Area 1 with a working interest of 26.5%. Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements Anadarko may enter into off-balance-sheet arrangements and transactions that can give rise to material off-balance-sheet obligations. The Company material off-balance-sheet arrangements and transactions include operating lease arrangements and undrawn letters of credit. In addition, the Company enters into other contractual agreements in the normal course of business for processing, treating, transportation, and storage of natural gas, crude oil, and NGLs, as well as for other oil and gas activities as discussed below in Obligations and Commitments . Other than the items discussed above, there are no other transactions, arrangements, or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect Anadarko liquidity or availability of or requirements for capital resources. 77 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Obligations and Commitments The following is a summary of the Company obligations at December 31, 2013 : Obligations by Period (1) millions 2014 2015-2016 2017-2018 2019 and beyond Total Total debt Principal current borrowings $ 500 $ $ $ $ 500 Principal long-term borrowings (2)(3) 275 1,750 2,364 10,313 14,702 Principal capital lease obligation 8 8 Investee entities debt (4) 2,853 2,853 Interest on borrowings 823 1,577 1,228 7,064 10,692 Interest on capital lease obligations 1 1 1 7 10 Investee entities interest (4) 37 115 229 3,728 4,109 Operating leases Drilling rig commitments 880 1,574 750 98 3,302 Production platforms 36 54 43 73 206 Other 48 75 41 18 182 Asset retirement obligations 409 277 342 994 2,022 Midstream and marketing activities 825 1,780 1,644 3,071 7,320 Oil and gas activities 1,445 1,413 693 639 4,190 Derivative liabilities (5) 522 186 708 Uncertain tax positions, interest, and penalties (6) 17 3 135 155 Environmental liabilities 18 68 5 35 126 Total $ 5,836 $ 8,873 $ 7,475 $ 28,901 $ 51,085 _______________________________________________________________________________ (1) This table does not include the Tronox-related contingent liability, other litigation-related contingent liabilities, or the Company pension and postretirement benefit obligations. See Note 17 Contingencies Tronox Litigation and Note 22 Pension Plans, Other Postretirement Benefits, and Defined-Contribution Plans in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. (2) The Company $275 million aggregate principal amount of 5.750% Senior Notes due June 2014 is classified as long-term debt on the Company Consolidated Balance Sheet, as the Company has the ability and intent to refinance this obligation using long-term debt. See Note 12 Debt and Interest Expense in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. (3) Includes the fully accreted principal amount of the Zero Coupons of $2.4 billion as coming due after 2018 . While the Zero Coupons do not mature until 2036, the outstanding Zero Coupons can be put to the Company each October at up to the then-accreted value. The Company could be required to repurchase the outstanding Zero Coupons at $756 million in October 2014 (the next potential put date). (4) Anadarko has legal right of setoff and intends to net-settle its obligations under each of the notes payable to the investees with the distributable value of its interest in the corresponding investee. Accordingly, the investments and the obligations are presented net on the Consolidated Balance Sheets in other long-term liabilities other for all periods presented. These notes payable provide for a variable rate of interest, reset quarterly. Therefore, future interest payments presented in the table above are estimated using the forward LIBOR rate curve. Further, the above table does not reflect the preferred return that Anadarko receives on its investment in these entities, which is also LIBOR-based, with a lower margin than the margin on the associated notes payable. See Note 10 Equity-Method Investments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. (5) Represents Anadarko gross derivative liability after taking into account the impacts of netting margin and collateral balances deposited with counterparties. See Note 11 Derivative Instruments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. (6) See Note 19 Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. 78 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Operating Leases Operating lease obligations include approximately $3.1 billion related to eight offshore drilling vessels and $155 million related to certain contracts for U.S. onshore drilling rigs. Anadarko manages its access to rigs to execute its drilling strategy over the next several years. Lease payments associated with the drilling of exploratory wells and development wells, net of amounts billed to partners, will initially be capitalized as a component of oil and gas properties, and either depreciated or impaired in future periods or written off as exploration expense. At December 31, 2013 , the Company had $388 million in various commitments under non-cancelable operating lease agreements for production platforms and equipment, buildings, facilities, compressors, and aircraft. For additional information, see Note 16 Commitments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Asset Retirement Obligations Anadarko is obligated to fund the costs of disposing of long-lived assets upon their abandonment. The majority of Anadarko asset retirement obligations (AROs) relate to the plugging of wells and the related abandonment of oil and gas properties. The Company AROs are recorded at estimated fair value, measured by reference to the expected future cash outflows required to satisfy the retirement obligation discounted at the Company credit-adjusted risk-free interest rate. Revisions to estimated AROs can result from changes in retirement cost estimates, revisions to estimated inflation rates, and changes in the estimated timing of abandonment. Midstream and Marketing Activities Anadarko has entered into various processing, transportation, storage, and purchase agreements to access markets and provide flexibility to sell its natural gas, crude oil, and NGLs in certain areas. Oil and Gas Activities At December 31, 2013 , Anadarko had various long-term contractual commitments pertaining to exploration, development, and production activities that extend beyond 2013 . The Company has work-related commitments for, among other things, drilling wells, obtaining and processing seismic, and fulfilling rig commitments. The preceding table includes long-term drilling and work-related commitments of $4.2 billion , comprised of approximately $3.1 billion related to the United States and $1.1 billion related to international locations. Environmental Liabilities Anadarko is subject to various environmental-remediation and reclamation obligations arising from federal, state, and local laws and regulations. At December 31, 2013 , the Company Consolidated Balance Sheet included a $126 million liability for remediation and reclamation obligations. The Company continually monitors the liability recorded and ongoing remediation and reclamation activities, and believes the amount recorded is appropriate. For additional information on environmental issues, see Risk Factors under Item 1A of this Form 10-K. 79 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP in the United States requires management to make informed judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. Management evaluates its estimates and related assumptions regularly, including those related to proved reserves; the value of properties and equipment; goodwill; intangible assets; asset retirement obligations; litigation liabilities; environmental liabilities; pension assets, liabilities, and costs; income taxes; and fair values. Changes in facts and circumstances or additional information may result in revised estimates, and actual results may differ from these estimates. Management considers the following to be its most critical accounting estimates that involve judgment. The selection and development of these estimates is discussed with the Company Audit Committee. Oil and Gas Activities Anadarko applies the successful efforts method of accounting to account for its oil and gas activities. Under this method, acquisition costs and the costs associated with drilling exploratory wells are capitalized pending the determination of proved oil and gas reserves. Exploration geological and geophysical costs and other costs of carrying properties such as delay rentals are expensed as incurred. Acquisition Costs Acquisition costs of unproved properties are periodically assessed for impairment and are transferred to proved oil and gas properties to the extent the costs are associated with successful exploration activities. Significant undeveloped leases are assessed individually for impairment, based on the Company current exploration plans, and a valuation allowance is provided if impairment is indicated. Significant undeveloped leasehold costs are assessed for impairment at a lease level or resource play (for example, the Greater Natural Buttes area in the Rockies), while leasehold acquisition costs associated with prospective areas that have limited or no previous exploratory drilling are generally assessed for impairment by major prospect area. Unproved oil and gas properties with individually insignificant lease acquisition costs are amortized on a group basis (thereby establishing a valuation allowance) over the average lease terms at rates that provide for full amortization of unsuccessful leases upon lease expiration or abandonment. Costs of expired or abandoned leases are charged against the valuation allowance, while costs of productive leases are transferred to proved oil and gas properties. Costs of maintaining and retaining unproved properties, as well as amortization of individually insignificant leases and impairment of unsuccessful leases, are included in exploration expense in the Consolidated Statement of Income. Certain of the Company unproved property costs are associated with acquired properties to which proved developed producing reserves are also attributed. Generally, economic recovery of unproved reserves in such areas is not yet supported by actual production or conclusive formation tests, but may be confirmed by the Company continuing exploration and development programs. Another portion of the Company unproved property costs is associated with the Land Grant acreage, where the Company owns mineral interests in perpetuity and plans to continue to explore and evaluate the acreage. A change in the Company expected future plans or the operating environment for exploration and development could cause an impairment of the Company unproved property. 80 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Exploratory Costs Under the successful efforts method of accounting, exploratory costs associated with a well discovering hydrocarbons are initially capitalized, or suspended, pending a determination as to whether a commercially sufficient quantity of proved reserves can be attributed to the area as a result of drilling. At the end of each quarter, management reviews the status of all suspended exploratory drilling costs in light of ongoing exploration activities in particular, whether the Company is making sufficient progress in its ongoing exploration and appraisal efforts or, in the case of discoveries requiring government sanctioning, analyzing whether development negotiations are underway and proceeding as planned. If management determines that future appraisal drilling or development activities are unlikely to occur, associated suspended exploratory well costs are expensed. Therefore, at any point in time, the Company may have capitalized costs on its Consolidated Balance Sheets associated with exploratory wells that may be charged to exploration expense in future periods. Proved Reserves Anadarko estimates its proved oil and gas reserves as defined by the SEC and the FASB. This definition includes crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be economically producible in future periods from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions, operating methods, government regulations, etc. (at prices and costs as of the date the estimates are made). Prices include consideration of price changes provided only by contractual arrangements, and do not include adjustments based on expected future conditions. The Company estimates of proved reserves are made using available geological and reservoir data, as well as production performance data. These estimates are reviewed annually by internal reservoir engineers and revised, either upward or downward, as warranted by additional data. Revisions are necessary due to changes in, among other things, reservoir performance, prices, economic conditions, and governmental restrictions, as well as changes in the expected recovery associated with infill drilling. Decreases in prices, for example, may cause a reduction in some proved reserves due to reaching economic limits at an earlier projected date. A material adverse change in the estimated volumes of proved reserves could have a negative impact on DD&A and could result in property impairments. Fair Value The Company estimates fair value for derivatives, long-lived assets for impairment testing, reporting units for goodwill impairment testing when necessary, assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination or exchanged in non-monetary transactions, guarantees, pension plan assets, initial measurements of AROs, and financial instruments that require fair-value disclosure, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and debt. When the Company is required to measure fair value and there is not a market-observable price for the asset or liability or for a similar asset or liability, the Company uses the cost, income, or market valuation approaches depending on the quality of information available to support management assumptions. The cost approach is based on management best estimate of the current asset replacement cost. The income approach is based on management best assumptions regarding expectations of projected cash flows, and discounts the expected cash flows using a commensurate risk-adjusted discount rate. The market approach is based on management best assumptions regarding prices and other relevant information from market transactions involving comparable assets. Such evaluations involve significant judgment and the results are based on expected future events or conditions, such as sales prices, estimates of future oil and gas production or throughput, development and operating costs and the timing thereof, future net cash flows, economic and regulatory climates, and other factors, most of which are often outside of management control. However, assumptions used reflect a market participant view of long-term prices, costs, and other factors, and are consistent with assumptions used in the Company business plans and investment decisions. 81 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Business Combinations Accounting for the acquisition of a business requires the assets and liabilities of the acquired business to be recorded at fair value. Deferred taxes are recorded for any differences between the fair value and the tax basis of acquired assets and liabilities. Any excess of the purchase price over the amounts assigned to the identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Goodwill At December 31, 2013 , the Company had $5.5 billion of goodwill. The Company tests goodwill for impairment annually at October 1, or more frequently as circumstances dictate. The first step in assessing whether an impairment of goodwill is necessary is an optional qualitative assessment to determine the likelihood of whether the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount. If the Company concludes that fair value of the reporting unit more than likely exceeds the related carrying amount, then goodwill is not impaired and further testing is not necessary. If the qualitative assessment is not performed or indicates fair value of the reporting unit may be less than its carrying amount, the Company compares the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to which goodwill is assigned to the carrying amount of the associated net assets, including goodwill, and determines whether impairment is necessary. Because quoted market prices for the Company reporting units are not available, management must apply judgment in determining the estimated fair value of reporting units for purposes of performing goodwill impairment tests, when such tests are necessary. Management uses all available information to make these fair-value estimates, including the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates commensurate with the risks associated with the assets and observable for the oil and gas exploration and production reporting unit, and market multiples of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) for the gathering and processing and transportation reporting units. In estimating the fair value of its oil and gas exploration and production reporting unit, the Company assumes production profiles used in its estimation of reserves that are disclosed in the Company supplemental oil and gas disclosures, market prices based on the forward price curve for oil and gas at the test date (adjusted for location and quality differentials), capital and operating costs consistent with pricing and expected inflation rates, and discount rates that management believes a market participant would use based upon the risks inherent in Anadarko operations. For the Company other gathering and processing, WES gathering and processing, and transportation reporting units, the Company estimates fair value by applying an estimated multiple to projected EBITDA. The Company considered observable transactions in the market and trading multiples for peers in determining an appropriate multiple to apply against the Company projected EBITDA for these reporting units. A lower fair-value estimate in the future for any of these reporting units could result in impairment of goodwill. Factors that could trigger a lower fair-value estimate include sustained price declines, cost increases, regulatory or political environment changes, and other changes in market conditions such as decreased prices in market-based transactions for similar assets, as well as difficulty or potential delays in obtaining drilling permits or other unanticipated events. Environmental Obligations and Other Contingencies Management makes judgments and estimates when it establishes liabilities for environmental remediation, litigation, and other contingent matters. Losses for such matters are charged to expense when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and a reasonable estimate of the liability can be made. If a range of loss can be estimated, but no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other, the minimum amount of the range is accrued. Estimates of litigation-related liabilities are based on the facts and circumstances of the individual case and on information currently available to the Company. The extent of information available varies based on the status of the litigation and the Company evaluation of the claim and legal arguments. In future periods, a number of factors could significantly change the Company estimate of litigation-related liabilities including discovery activities, briefings filed with the relevant court, rulings from the court in the process or at the conclusion of any trial, and similar cases involving other plaintiffs and defendants that may set or change legal precedent. As events unfold throughout the litigation process, the Company evaluates the available information and may consult with third-party legal counsel to determine whether liability accruals should be established or adjusted. 82 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Estimates of environmental liabilities are based on a variety of matters, including, but not limited to, the stage of investigation, the stage of the remedial design, evaluation of existing remediation technologies, and presently enacted laws and regulations. In future periods, a number of factors could significantly change the Company estimate of environmental-remediation costs, such as changes in laws and regulations, changes in the interpretation or administration of laws and regulations, revisions to the remedial design, unanticipated construction problems, identification of additional areas or volumes of contaminated soil and groundwater, and changes in costs of labor, equipment, and technology. Consequently, it is not possible for management to reliably estimate the amount and timing of all future expenditures that could arise related to environmental or other contingent matters and actual costs may vary significantly from the Company estimates. The Company in-house legal counsel and environmental personnel regularly assess contingent liabilities and, in certain circumstances, consult with third-party legal counsel or consultants to assist in the evaluation of the Company liability for these contingencies. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets A long-lived asset other than unproved oil and gas property is evaluated for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying value may be greater than its future net undiscounted cash flows. Impairment, if any, is measured as the excess of an asset carrying amount over its estimated fair value. The Company uses a variety of fair-value measurement techniques when market information for the same or similar assets does not exist. Derivative Instruments All derivative instruments, other than those that satisfy specific exceptions, are recorded at fair value. If market quotes are not available to estimate fair value, management best estimate of fair value is based on the quoted market price of derivatives with similar characteristics or determined through industry-standard valuation techniques. The Company derivative instruments are either exchange-traded or transacted in an over-the-counter market. Valuation is determined by reference to readily available public data for similar instruments. Option fair values are measured using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and verified by comparing a sample to market quotes for similar options. Gains and losses on derivative instruments are recognized currently in earnings. Income Taxes The amount of income taxes recorded by the Company requires interpretations of complex rules and regulations of various tax jurisdictions throughout the world. The Company has recognized deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences, operating losses, and tax-credit carryforwards. The Company routinely assesses the realizability of its deferred tax assets and reduces such assets by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company routinely assesses potential uncertain tax positions and, if required, establishes accruals for such amounts. The accruals for deferred tax assets and liabilities, including deferred state income tax assets and liabilities, are subject to significant judgment by management and are reviewed and adjusted routinely based on changes in facts and circumstances. Although management considers its tax accruals adequate, material changes in these accruals may occur in the future, based on the progress of ongoing tax audits, changes in legislation, and resolution of pending tax matters. Benefit Plan Obligations The Company has contributory and non-contributory defined-benefit pension plans, which include both qualified and supplemental plans. The Company also provides certain health care and life insurance benefits for certain retired employees. Determination of the benefit obligations for the Company defined-benefit pension plans and postretirement benefit plans impacts the recorded amounts for such obligations on the balance sheet and the amount of benefit expense recorded to the income statement. 83 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Accounting for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations involves many assumptions, the most significant of which are the discount rate used to measure the present value of plan benefit obligations, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets (for funded pension plans), the rate of future increases in compensation levels of participating employees, and the future level of health care costs (for postretirement plans). Other assumptions involve demographic factors such as retirement age, mortality, and turnover. The Company evaluates and updates its actuarial assumptions at least annually. The Company amortizes prior service costs (credits) on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of employees expected to receive benefits under each plan. Actuarial gains and losses that exceed 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation and the market-related value of assets are amortized over the average remaining service period of participating employees expected to receive benefits under each plan. Discount rate Accumulated and projected benefit obligations are measured as the present value of future cash payments. The Company discounts those cash payments using a discount rate that reflects the weighted average of market-observed yields for select high-quality (AA-rated) fixed-income securities with cash flows that correspond to the expected amounts and timing of benefit payments. The discount-rate assumption used by the Company represents an estimate of the interest rate at which the pension and other postretirement benefit obligations could effectively be settled on the measurement date. Expected long-term rate of return The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption was determined using the year-end 2013 pension investment balances by asset class and expected long-term asset allocation. The expected return for each asset class reflects capital-market projections formulated using a forward-looking building-block approach, while also taking into account historical return trends and current market conditions. Equity returns generally reflect long-term expectations of real earnings growth, dividend yield, and inflation. Returns on fixed-income securities are generally based on expected inflation, real bond yield, and risk spread (as appropriate), adjusted for the expected effect that changing yields have on the rate of return. Other asset class returns are derived from their relationship to the equity and fixed income markets. Because the assumption reflects the Company expectation of average annualized return over a long time horizon, generally, it is not expected to be significantly revised from year to year, even though actual rates of investment return from year to year often exhibit significant volatility. Rate of compensation increases The Company rate of compensation increases assumption is based on its long-term plans for compensation increases specific to covered employee groups and expected economic conditions. The assumed rate of salary increases includes the effects of merit increases, promotions, and general labor cost inflation within the oil and gas industry. Health care cost trend rate The health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data, the near-term outlook and an assessment of likely long-term trends. 84 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements
