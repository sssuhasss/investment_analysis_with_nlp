Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations OVERVIEW The following discussion and analysis is intended to help you understand us, our operations and our financial performance. It should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes, which are included elsewhere in this report. We are one of the largest branded apparel companies in the world, with a heritage dating back over 130 years. Our brand portfolio consists of nationally and internationally recognized brand names, including Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger, Van Heusen, IZOD, ARROW, Speedo (licensed in perpetuity for North America and the Caribbean from Speedo International, Ltd.), Warner and Olga . In addition, through the end of the third quarter of 2013, we owned and operated businesses under the G.H. Bass & Co . and Bass trademarks. We also license brands from third parties primarily for use on dress shirts and neckwear offered in the United States and Canada. We sold substantially all of the assets of our Bass business on November 4, 2013 and exited our Izod retail business in the third quarter of 2015. Our business strategy is to sell our brands at multiple price points and in multiple channels of distribution and regions, which allows us to provide products to a broad range of consumers, while minimizing competition among our brands and reducing reliance on any one demographic group, merchandise preference, price point, distribution channel or region. We also license our brands to third parties for product categories and in jurisdictions where we believe our partners expertise will benefit the business. We acquired Warnaco on February 13, 2013 and, with it, acquired the global Calvin Klein Jeans and Calvin Klein Underwear businesses and the Core Intimates (Warner and Olga) and Speedo businesses, which operate in North America. The total consideration for the acquisition was $3.137 billion, consisting of $2.180 billion paid in cash, the issuance of approximately 8 million shares of our common stock (valued at $926 million), the issuance of stock awards valued at $40 million (to replace outstanding stock awards made by Warnaco to its employees) and the elimination of a $9 million pre-acquisition liability to Warnaco. We funded the cash portion and related costs of the acquisition, repaid all outstanding borrowings under our previously outstanding senior secured credit facilities and repaid all of Warnaco previously outstanding long-term debt with the net proceeds of (i) an offering during the fourth quarter of 2012 of $700 million of 4 1/2% senior notes due 2022; and (ii) $3.075 billion of term loans borrowed during the first quarter of 2013 under new senior secured credit facilities. These items are more fully described in the section entitled Liquidity and Capital Resources below. On February 1, 2016, we entered into a licensing agreement with G-III Apparel Group, Ltd. ( G-III ) for the design, production and wholesale distribution of Tommy Hilfiger womenswear in the United States and Canada. The first womenswear offerings under the new license are expected to be launched for the 2016 holiday season. Additionally, on February 2, 2016, we announced that we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the 55% of TH Asia Ltd. ( TH Asia ), our joint venture for Tommy Hilfiger in China, that we do not already own. The purchase price for the shares is approximately $172 million, net of cash expected to be acquired of approximately $100 million, subject to adjustment. The closing, which is subject to customary conditions and regulatory approval, is expected to occur late in the first quarter or early in the second quarter of 2016. Our revenue was $8.020 billion in 2015, approximately 45% of which was generated internationally. Our global designer lifestyle brands, Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein , together generated over 75% of our revenue. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Operations Overview We generate net sales from (i) the wholesale distribution to retailers, franchisees, licensees and distributors of dress shirts, neckwear, sportswear, jeanswear, underwear, intimate apparel, swim products, handbags, footwear, accessories and other related products under owned and licensed trademarks, and (ii) the sale through (a) approximately 1,450 Company-operated free-standing retail store locations worldwide under our Calvin Klein , Tommy Hilfiger and Van Heusen trademarks, (b) approximately 1,100 Company-operated concessions/shop-in-shops worldwide under our Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger trademarks, and (c) e-commerce sites in certain countries under our Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger trademarks, of apparel, footwear, accessories and other products, and swimwear and related products in North America through our Speedo e-commerce site. We also operated IZOD retail stores through the end of the third quarter of 2015, at which time we completed the exit from the business, and G.H. Bass & Co . stores through the end of the third quarter of 2013, at which time we sold 30 substantially all of the assets of our Bass business. Additionally, we generate royalty, advertising and other revenue from fees for licensing the use of our trademarks. We recorded pre-tax charges principally in connection with the Warnaco acquisition, integration and related restructuring that totaled $73 million, $146 million and $471 million during 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The amounts incurred in 2013 included noncash charges of approximately $175 million, principally related to valuation adjustments and amortization of short-lived assets. We also recorded pre-tax debt modification and extinguishment charges in 2014 and 2013 that totaled $93 million and $40 million, respectively. We recorded a net gain of $8 million in 2014 resulting from the deconsolidation of certain Calvin Klein subsidiaries in Australia and New Zealand and our previously consolidated Calvin Klein joint venture in India (please see Note 6, Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates and Note 7, Redeemable Non-Controlling Interest in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for further discussion). We have implemented initiatives to rationalize the Heritage Brands business, including the exit from our Izod retail business (completed in the third quarter of 2015) and the discontinuation of several licensed product lines in the dress furnishings business. We recorded pre-tax charges of $10 million in 2015 and $21 million in 2014, including $18 million of noncash impairment charges, in connection with the operation of and exit from our Izod retail business. We recorded pre-tax charges of $17 million in 2015 principally in connection with the discontinuation of several licensed product lines in the dress furnishings business. We recorded pre-tax charges of $3 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 in connection with licensing to G-III the Tommy Hilfiger womenswear wholesale business in the United States and Canada. We expect to incur additional pre-tax charges of approximately $25 million during 2016 in connection with the Warnaco integration and related restructuring, the discontinuation of several licensed product lines in the dress furnishings business and licensing to G-III the Tommy Hilfiger womenswear wholesale business in the United States and Canada. On November 4, 2013, we sold substantially all of the assets of our Bass business and recorded a net pre-tax loss of $20 million during 2013 in connection with the sale. Please see the section entitled Sale of Bass within Liquidity and Capital Resources below for a further discussion. Our Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger businesses each have substantial international components that expose us to significant foreign exchange risk. Amounts recorded in local foreign currencies are translated back to United States dollars using an average exchange rate over the representative period. Our international revenue and earnings are unfavorably impacted during times of a strengthening United States dollar against the currencies in which we generate significant revenue and earnings and favorably impacted during times of a weakening United States dollar against those currencies. Additionally, there is a transaction impact on our financial results because goods are often purchased in United States dollars by foreign subsidiaries. As with translation, during times of a strengthening United States dollar, our results of operations will be negatively impacted by these transactions as the increased local currency value of inventory results in a higher local currency cost of goods when the goods are sold. The United States dollar has strengthened for more than a year against most major foreign currencies, particularly the euro, which is the foreign currency in which we transact the most business. In 2015, approximately 45% of our revenue was subject to foreign currency translation, the majority of which relates to our operations in Europe, resulting in a negative impact on our 2015 results of operations. We currently expect the strength of the United States dollar and resulting unfavorable impact on our revenue and earnings to continue into 2016. Retail comparable store sales discussed below refer to sales for retail stores that have been open for at least 12 months. Sales for retail stores that are closed during the year are excluded from the calculation of retail comparable store sales. Sales for retail stores that are either relocated, materially altered in size or closed for a certain number of consecutive days for renovation are also excluded from the calculation of retail comparable store sales until such stores have been in their new location or in their newly renovated state for at least 12 months. Sales from our e-commerce sites are included within retail comparable store sales for those businesses and regions that have operated the related e-commerce site for at least 12 months. Retail comparable store sales are based on comparable weeks and local currencies. 31 The following table summarizes our income statements in 2015, 2014 and 2013: 2015 2014 2013 (In millions) Net sales $ 7,605 $ 7,849 $ 7,806 Royalty revenue 325 300 291 Advertising and other revenue 90 92 90 Total revenue 8,020 8,241 8,186 Gross profit 4,162 4,327 4,219 % of total revenue 51.9 % 52.5 % 51.5 % Selling, general and administrative expenses 3,418 3,714 3,673 % of total revenue 42.6 % 45.1 % 44.9 % Debt modification and extinguishment costs 93 40 Equity in net income of unconsolidated affiliates 17 10 8 Income before interest and taxes 761 530 513 Interest expense 117 144 192 Interest income 4 5 8 Income before taxes 647 391 329 Income tax expense (benefit) 75 (48 ) 185 Net income 572 439 143 Less: Net loss attributable to redeemable non-controlling interest 0 0 Net income attributable to PVH Corp. $ 572 $ 439 $ 144 Total Revenue Total revenue was $8.020 billion in 2015, $8.241 billion in 2014 and $8.186 billion in 2013. The decrease in revenue of $221 million in 2015 as compared to 2014 was due principally to the effect of the following items: The aggregate reduction of $212 million in revenue attributable to our Tommy Hilfiger North America and Tommy Hilfiger International segments, which included a reduction of approximately $341 million related to the impact of foreign currency translation resulting principally from a weaker euro. Revenue in the Tommy Hilfiger North America segment decreased 1% (including a 2% negative foreign currency impact) due principally to a 5% decrease in retail comparable store sales primarily as a result of the decline in traffic and consumer spending trends in our United States stores located in international tourist locations due to the stronger United States dollar against most major currencies. Revenue in the Tommy Hilfiger International segment decreased 10% (including a 15% negative foreign currency impact). Revenue of the segment would have increased if not for the negative foreign currency impact, principally as a result of 8% retail comparable store sales growth in Europe and a mid-single digit percentage increase in wholesale revenue. The net addition in the aggregate of $64 million of revenue attributable to our Calvin Klein North America and Calvin Klein International segments, which included a reduction of approximately $199 million related to the impact of foreign currency translation. Revenue in the Calvin Klein North America segment increased 5% (including a 3% negative foreign currency impact). The segment retail business experienced solid growth due to square footage expansion in Company-operated stores, including the conversion of IZOD stores to Calvin Klein Accessory and Calvin Klein Underwear stores and a 2% increase in retail comparable store sales despite the decreased traffic and consumer spending trends in our United States stores located in international tourist locations, while the wholesale business experienced modest growth. Revenue in the Calvin Klein International segment decreased 2% (including a 13% negative foreign currency impact). Revenue of the segment would have increased if not for the negative foreign currency impact. This is attributable to the strong performance in Europe, where we experienced growth in most markets, and an increase in Asia, partially due to the benefit of the Chinese New Year, as the first and fourth quarters of fiscal 2015 included the peak wholesale selling seasons before the Chinese New Year, while fiscal 2014 did not include a peak selling season before the holiday. International retail comparable store sales increased 5%. The aggregate reduction of $72 million in revenue attributable to our Heritage Brands Wholesale and Heritage Brands Retail segments, as a 10% increase in comparable store sales in the Van Heusen retail business was more than offset by 32 the revenue decrease attributable to the exit from the Izod retail business and the discontinuation of several licensed product lines in the dress furnishings business. The revenue increase of $55 million in 2014 as compared to 2013 was due principally to the effect of the following items: The aggregate addition of $149 million of revenue attributable to our Tommy Hilfiger North America and Tommy Hilfiger International segments. Tommy Hilfiger North America revenue increased 6%, principally due to high-single digit percentage wholesale growth, retail comparable store sales growth of 2% and square footage expansion in Company-operated stores. Tommy Hilfiger International revenue increased 3%, driven principally by European retail comparable store sales growth of 3%, square footage expansion in Company-operated stores and low-single digit percentage wholesale growth. These favorable impacts were partially offset by a 2% negative impact from foreign currency translation, principally due to the euro weakness experienced in the second half of the year. The aggregate addition of $92 million of revenue attributable to our Calvin Klein North America and Calvin Klein International segments. Calvin Klein North America revenue increased 5% due to the ten additional days of operations in 2014 of the Calvin Klein businesses acquired in the Warnaco acquisition compared to 2013, combined with mid-single digit percentage wholesale growth, a 2% increase in retail comparable store sales and square footage expansion in Company-operated stores. Calvin Klein International revenue increased 1% as the impact of the ten additional days of operations in 2014 of the acquired Calvin Klein businesses compared to 2013 and the absence in 2014 of $30 million of sales returns recorded in 2013 for certain wholesale customers in Asia in connection with our initiative to reduce excess inventory levels was partially offset by a 5% decrease in international retail comparable store sales and a 1% negative impact from foreign currency translation. The decline in international retail comparable store sales was due in large part to a decrease in Asia resulting from the timing of the Chinese New Year, as fiscal 2014 did not include a Chinese New Year, while the holiday fell into both the first and fourth quarters in 2013. Also contributing to the retail comparable store decline was underperformance in Europe in the first half of the year. The net reduction in the aggregate of $186 million in revenue attributable to our Heritage Brands Retail and Heritage Brands Wholesale segments, which included a reduction of $176 million related to the loss of net sales of the exited Bass business, as mid-single digit percentage growth in the wholesale sportswear business was more than offset by poor performance within the dress shirt business and a 5% comparable store sales decline in our retail stores (excluding the Izod retail business in the fourth quarter, which was no longer included in retail comparable store sales as the business was exited in 2015). We currently expect that revenue will increase 1% in 2016 compared to 2015, inclusive of a negative impact of approximately 1% related to foreign currency translation. Revenue for our Calvin Klein business is projected to increase approximately 4% compared to 2015, inclusive of a negative impact of approximately 2% related to foreign currency translation. Revenue for our Tommy Hilfiger business is expected to increase approximately 2% compared to 2015, inclusive of a negative impact of approximately 1% related to foreign currency translation. Revenue for our Heritage Brands business is expected to decrease approximately 7% compared to 2015, principally due to the continued rationalization of the Heritage Brands business, including the loss of revenue from the Izod retail business (from which we completed our exit in the third quarter of 2015) and from several licensed product lines in the dress furnishings business that were discontinued in 2015 or will be discontinued in 2016. Our 2016 guidance assumes that our acquisition of the remaining 55% interest that we do not already own in TH Asia, our joint venture for Tommy Hilfiger in China, will close late in the first quarter or early in the second quarter of 2016. The acquisition is expected to add approximately $100 million of revenue in 2016. Gross Profit Gross profit is calculated as total revenue less cost of goods sold and gross margin is calculated as gross profit divided by total revenue. Included as cost of goods sold are costs associated with the production and procurement of product, such as inbound freight costs, purchasing and receiving costs and inspection costs. Warehousing and distribution expenses are included in selling, general and administrative expenses. All of our royalty, advertising and other revenue is included in gross profit because there is no cost of goods sold associated with such revenue. As a result, our gross profit may not be comparable to that of other entities. 33 The following table shows our revenue mix between net sales and royalty, advertising and other revenue, as well as our gross margin for 2015 , 2014 and 2013 : 2015 2014 2013 Components of revenue: Net sales 94.8 % 95.2 % 95.4 % Royalty, advertising and other revenue 5.2 % 4.8 % 4.6 % Total 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Gross margin 51.9 % 52.5 % 51.5 % Gross profit in 2015 was $4.162 billion, or 51.9% of total revenue, compared to $4.327 billion, or 52.5% of total revenue, in 2014. The 60 basis point decrease in gross margin was principally driven by (i) a decline in gross margin in the Tommy Hilfiger North America segment due to the decline in traffic and consumer spending trends in our United States stores located in international tourist locations, which drove more promotional selling compared to 2014, (ii) the stronger United States dollar, which caused our Calvin Klein International and Tommy Hilfiger International segments, which generally carry higher gross margins than our North American businesses, to be translated to United States dollars at lower average exchange rates, (iii) the stronger United States dollar, which further negatively impacted our international businesses that purchase inventory in United States dollars, particularly the Tommy Hilfiger European business, as the increased local currency value of inventory results in higher cost of goods in local currency when the goods are sold, and (iv) costs incurred principally in connection with the discontinuation of several licensed product lines in the Heritage Brands dress furnishings business. These declines were partially offset by overall gross margin improvements in our Calvin Klein European and Asian businesses as a result of higher average unit retail selling prices, as well as an increase in our royalty, advertising and other revenue as a percentage of total revenue, as there is no cost of goods sold associated with such revenue. Gross profit in 2014 was $4.327 billion, or 52.5% of total revenue, compared to $4.219 billion, or 51.5% of total revenue, in 2013. Of the 100 basis point increase in gross margin, 60 basis points was due to the absence in 2014 of short-lived noncash valuation adjustments recorded in connection with the Warnaco acquisition and integration. The remaining increase was due to growth in our higher-margin Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger businesses. These increases were partially offset by a gross margin decline in the Heritage Brands business resulting from overall increased promotional activity in order to drive traffic and revenue, combined with poor performance in the dress shirt business. We currently expect that gross margin in 2016 will increase as compared to 2015 due to (i) increases in our North American businesses resulting from less promotional selling compared to 2015 and (ii) the addition of TH Asia, which is estimated will carry a significantly higher gross margin than our overall business. We currently expect that these gross margin increases will be partially offset by the unfavorable impact of the stronger United States dollar on our international businesses that purchase inventory in United States dollars, as the increased local currency value of inventory results in higher cost of goods in local currency when the goods are sold. Selling, General and Administrative ( SG&A ) Expenses Our SG&A expenses were as follows: 2015 2014 2013 (In millions) SG&A expenses $ 3,418 $ 3,714 $ 3,673 % of total revenue 42.6 % 45.1 % 44.9 % SG&A expenses in 2015 were $3.418 billion, or 42.6% of total revenue, as compared to $3.714 billion, or 45.1% of total revenue in 2014. The 250 basis point decrease in SG&A expenses as a percentage of total revenue was principally attributable to (i) a 190 basis point decrease due to lower retirement plan expense resulting from actuarial gains in 2015, as compared to actuarial losses in 2014 (please see Note 12, Retirement and Benefit Plans in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for a further discussion), (ii) a 70 basis point reduction due to a decrease as compared to 2014 in Warnaco integration and restructuring costs, and (iii) a decrease attributable to the results of our Calvin Klein International and Tommy Hilfiger International segments, which generally carry higher SG&A percentages of total revenue than our North American businesses, being translated to United States dollars at lower average exchange rates. These decreases were partially 34 offset by (i) the impact of contraction in our lower-expense Heritage Brands business and (ii) an increase in corporate expenses mainly attributable to associate-related benefits. SG&A expenses in 2014 were $3.714 billion, or 45.1% of total revenue, as compared to $3.673 billion, or 44.9% of total revenue in 2013. The 20 basis point increase in SG&A expenses as a percentage of total revenue was due principally to (i) a 230 basis point increase due to higher retirement plan expense resulting from actuarial losses in 2014, as compared to actuarial gains in 2013 (please see Note 12, Retirement and Benefit Plans in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for a further discussion), (ii) a 30 basis point increase due to costs incurred in connection with the exit from our Izod retail business, the majority of which was noncash impairment charges, (iii) a 30 basis point increase due to the absence in 2014 of income recorded in the third quarter of 2013 from the amendment of an unfavorable contract, which resulted in the reduction of a liability recorded at the time of the Tommy Hilfiger acquisition, (iv) faster growth in the higher-expense Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein businesses and (v) continued strategic investments in our acquired businesses, with a focus on enhancing the existing operating infrastructure, increasing investments in our people and elevating the Calvin Klein presentation at retail. These increases were partially offset by (i) a 310 basis point reduction due to a decrease as compared to 2013 in Warnaco acquisition, integration and restructuring costs, (ii) a 20 basis point reduction attributable to the absence in 2014 of the loss recorded in the third quarter of 2013 in connection with the sale of the Bass business and (iii) a 10 basis point reduction due to the net gain recorded in the first quarter of 2014 resulting from the deconsolidation of certain Calvin Klein subsidiaries in Australia and New Zealand and our previously consolidated Calvin Klein joint venture in India. (Please see Note 6, Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates and Note 7, Redeemable Non-Controlling Interest in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for further discussion.) We currently expect that SG&A expenses as a percentage of total revenue in 2016 will increase from 2015 due to the impact of expected faster growth in our Calvin Klein International and Tommy Hilfiger International segments than in our North American segments, as our International segments generally carry higher SG&A percentages of total revenue. Additionally, our expectation of 2016 SG&A expenses does not include the impact of an actuarial gain or loss associated with our retirement plans, while our 2015 SG&A expenses included a $20 million actuarial gain. These increases will be partially offset by lower costs expected to be incurred in 2016 as compared to 2015 in connection with the integration of Warnaco and the related restructuring. Our actual SG&A expenses may be significantly different than our projections because of expenses associated with our retirement plans. Retirement plan expenses recorded throughout the year are calculated using actuarial valuations that incorporate assumptions and estimates about financial market, economic and demographic conditions. Differences between estimated and actual results give rise to gains and losses that are recorded immediately in earnings, generally in the fourth quarter of the year, which can create volatility in our operating results. Other Income In connection with the acquisition of the interests in TH Asia that we do not already own, we expect to record in 2016 a significant noncash gain to write-up our equity investment in the joint venture to fair market value immediately preceding the acquisition closing. The closing is expected to occur late in the first quarter or early in the second quarter of 2016. Debt Modification and Extinguishment Costs We incurred costs totaling $93 million in 2014 in connection with the amendment and restatement of our senior secured credit facilities entered into in 2013 and the related redemption of our 7 3/8% senior notes due 2020. Please see the section entitled Liquidity and Capital Resources below for a further discussion. We incurred costs totaling $40 million in 2013 related to the modification and extinguishment of previously outstanding term loans and the replacement of such term loans with the senior secured credit facilities entered into in 2013 in connection with the Warnaco acquisition. Please see the section entitled Liquidity and Capital Resources below for further discussion. Equity in Net Income of Unconsolidated Affiliates The equity in net income of unconsolidated affiliates during 2015 was $17 million, as compared to $10 million during 2014 and $8 million during 2013. These amounts relate to our share of income from our joint ventures for the Tommy Hilfiger brand in China, India and Brazil, for the Calvin Klein brand in India, for the Tommy Hilfiger , Calvin Klein and Van Heusen brands in Australia and for the Karl Lagerfeld brand. Our investments in these joint ventures are being accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Please see the section entitled Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates within Liquidity and Capital Resources below for a further discussion. The equity in net income of unconsolidated affiliates in 2015 includes a one- 35 time gain of $2 million on our equity investment in Kingdom Holding 1 B.V., the parent company of the Karl Lagerfeld brand, ( Karl Lagerfeld ). Interest Expense, Net Net interest expense decreased to $113 million in 2015 from $139 million in 2014 due to lower average debt balances and the effect of the amendment and restatement of our senior secured credit facilities and the related redemption of our 7 3/8% senior notes due 2020 in the first quarter of 2014. Please see the section entitled Financing Arrangements within Liquidity and Capital Resources below for a further discussion. Net interest expense decreased to $139 million in 2014 from $185 million in 2013 due to lower average debt balances and interest rates as compared to the prior year, combined with the effect of the amendment and restatement of our senior secured credit facilities and the related redemption of our 7 3/8% senior notes due 2020 in the first quarter of 2014. Please see the section entitled Financing Arrangements within Liquidity and Capital Resources below for a further discussion. Net interest expense in 2016 is currently expected to increase to approximately $120 million to $125 million from $113 million in 2015, primarily due to the negative impact of the interest rate swap that commenced on February 17, 2016 to convert a portion of our variable rate debt under our term loans to fixed rate debt, partially offset by a decrease to net interest expense as a result of 2016 debt repayments, which are anticipated to be made at a similar level to 2015, and the full year impact of repayments made in 2015. Income Taxes Income tax expense was as follows: 2015 2014 2013 (In millions) Income tax expense (benefit) $ 75 $ (48 ) $ 185 Income tax expense (benefit) as a % of pre-tax income 11.6 % (12.1 )% 56.4 % The effective income tax rate for 2015 was 11.6% compared with (12.1)% in 2014 and 56.4% in 2013. The volatility in our effective income tax rate in the last three years is due in large part to adjustments to our liabilities for uncertain tax positions. The effective income tax rate for 2015 was lower than the United States statutory rate principally due to the benefit of lower tax rates in certain international jurisdictions where we file tax returns and the benefits primarily related to the favorable resolution of uncertain tax positions and the impact of recently enacted tax law and tax rate changes on deferred taxes, as well as the expiration of the statute of limitations related to other uncertain tax positions. The effective income tax rate in 2014 was a benefit to income principally due to the effects of lower tax rates in international jurisdictions where we file tax returns, and a reduction of $94 million in our estimate for uncertain tax positions, which provided a 24% benefit to our tax rate. This benefit resulted from the favorable resolutions of uncertain tax positions in certain international jurisdictions, as well as the expiration of the statute of limitations related to other uncertain tax positions. The effective income tax rate in 2013 was higher than the United States statutory tax rate principally due to the recognition of $145 million of tax expense related to changes in estimates for uncertain tax positions, which increased the 2013 effective tax rate by 44%. The majority of this expense related to an increase to our previously established liability for an uncertain tax position related to European and United States transfer pricing arrangements. Also contributing to the higher tax rate in 2013 was an expense related to valuation allowances recorded on deferred tax assets from our business in Japan, and also on certain domestic state and local deferred tax assets. Partially offsetting these increases was the impact of Warnaco integration and restructuring expenses in 2013, the majority of which were incurred in the United States, which lowered our domestic taxable income in relation to taxable income in lower tax international jurisdictions. We currently expect our effective income tax rate in 2016 to be lower than the United States statutory rate due principally to the benefit of overall lower tax rates in international jurisdictions where we file tax returns. 36 Our tax rate is affected by many factors, including the mix of international and domestic pre-tax earnings, discrete events arising from specific transactions, and audits by tax authorities or the receipt of new information, any of which can cause us to change our estimate for uncertain tax positions. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash Flow Summary Cash and cash equivalents at January 31, 2016 was $556 million, an increase of $77 million from the amount at February 1, 2015 of $479 million. The change in cash and cash equivalents during 2015 included the impact of $350 million of debt payments and $126 million of stock repurchases. Cash flow in 2016 will be impacted by various factors in addition to those noted below in this Liquidity and Capital Resources section, including the amount of debt repayments and stock repurchases we make in 2016. As of January 31, 2016 , approximately $450 million of cash and cash equivalents was held by international subsidiaries whose undistributed earnings are considered permanently reinvested. Our intent is to continue to reinvest these funds in international operations. If management decides at a later date to repatriate these funds to the United States, we would be required to pay taxes on these amounts based on applicable United States tax rates, net of foreign taxes already paid. Operations Cash provided by operating activities was $900 million in 2015 as compared with $789 million in 2014. The increase in cash provided by operating activities as compared to the prior year was primarily driven by changes in working capital. Capital Expenditures Our capital expenditures in 2015 were $264 million compared to $256 million in 2014. Capital expenditures in 2015 primarily included investments in new stores and store expansions, as well as continued investments in operations and infrastructure, including system improvements. We currently expect capital expenditures for 2016 to be approximately $275 million, as we continue to make the same types of investments. Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates In 2014, we acquired an interest in Karl Lagerfeld for $19 million, which represented a 10% economic interest as of January 31, 2016. In 2013, we formed a joint venture, PVH Brands Australia Pty. Limited ( PVH Australia ), in which we own a 50% economic interest. The joint venture licenses from one of our subsidiaries the rights to distribute and sell certain Calvin Klein brand products in Australia, New Zealand and other island nations in the South Pacific. As part of the transaction, we contributed to PVH Australia on the first day of 2014 our subsidiaries that were operating the Calvin Klein Jeans businesses in Australia and New Zealand. During the first quarter of 2015, we completed a transaction in which the Tommy Hilfiger and Van Heusen trademarks in Australia were licensed for certain product categories to subsidiaries of PVH Australia for use in Australia, New Zealand and, in the case of Tommy Hilfiger , other island nations in the South Pacific. The Tommy Hilfiger trademarks had previously been licensed to a third party and the Van Heusen trademarks had previously been licensed to our joint venture partner in PVH Australia. We made net payments of $21 million (of which $20 million was placed into an escrow account prior to the end of 2014), $7 million and $1 million to PVH Australia during 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, representing our 50% share of the joint venture funding.

The adjustment to the purchase price was finalized during 2015. Acquisition of Warnaco We completed our acquisition of Warnaco on February 13, 2013. We paid $2.180 billion in cash and issued approximately 8 million shares of our common stock, valued at $926 million, as consideration for the acquisition. In addition, we issued replacement stock awards related to employee stock-based compensation grants valued at $40 million and eliminated a $9 million pre-acquisition liability to Warnaco, both of which for accounting purposes are included in the total consideration of approximately $3.137 billion. The value of the replacement stock awards was determined by multiplying the estimated fair value of the Warnaco awards outstanding at the time of the acquisition, reduced by an estimated value of awards to be forfeited, by the proportionate amount of the vesting period that had lapsed as of the acquisition date. We funded the cash portion and related costs of the acquisition, repaid all outstanding borrowings under our previously outstanding senior secured credit facilities and repaid all of Warnaco previously outstanding long-term debt with the net proceeds of (i) an offering during the fourth quarter of 2012 of $700 million of 4 1/2% senior notes due 2022 and (ii) $3.075 billion of term loans borrowed during the first quarter of 2013 under new senior secured credit facilities.

Sale of Bass Business We completed the sale of substantially all of the assets of our Bass business for gross proceeds of $49 million during 2013. We recorded a loss of $16 million during 2013, which represented the excess of the carrying value of the assets over the proceeds received, plus transaction costs. A small number of our Bass stores were excluded from the sale and were deemed to be impaired. We recorded a loss of $1 million during 2013 related to the impaired stores. In addition, we recorded a gain during 2013 of $3 million from writing off certain liabilities as a result of the transaction. We also recognized costs during 2013 related to severance and termination benefits for certain Bass employees, which totaled $2 million. In connection with the sale, we also guaranteed lease payments for substantially all Bass retail stores included in the sale pursuant to the terms of noncancelable leases expiring on various dates through 2022. In certain instances, our guarantee remains in effect when an option is exercised to extend the term of the lease. We recorded an expense of $4 million during 2013 representing the estimated fair value of these guarantee obligations at the time of the sale. As of January 31, 2016, the estimated fair value of these guarantee obligations was $2 million. Sale of Chaps Sportswear Assets As a result of our acquisition of Warnaco, Ralph Lauren Corporation ( RLC ) reacquired on February 14, 2013 the license for Chaps men sportswear that Warnaco held from affiliates of RLC.

We are required to make annual contingent purchase price payments based on a percentage of sales of Tommy Hilfiger products in India in excess of an agreed upon threshold during each of five consecutive 12-month periods (extended to a sixth consecutive 12-month period if the aggregate payments for the five 12-month periods are not at least $15 million, which will be the case). Such payments are subject to a $25 million aggregate maximum and are due within 60 days following each one-year period. We made contingent purchase price payments of $600,000, $600,000 and $400,000 during 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

A significant portion of the sales on which the payments to Mr. Klein are made are wholesale sales by us and our licensees and other partners to retailers. Such contingent purchase price payments totaled $51 million, $51 million and $53 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

Acquisition of TH Asia On February 2, 2016, we announced that we had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the 55% of TH Asia, our joint venture for Tommy Hilfiger in China, that we do not already own. The purchase price for the shares is approximately $172 million, net of cash expected to be acquired of approximately $100 million, subject to adjustment. The closing, which is subject to customary conditions and regulatory approval, is expected to occur late in the first quarter or early in the second quarter of 2016. Acquisition of Treasury Shares Our Board of Directors authorized a $500 million three-year stock repurchase program effective June 3, 2015. Repurchases under the program may be made from time to time over the period through open market purchases, accelerated share repurchase programs, privately negotiated transactions or other methods, as we deem appropriate. Purchases are made based on a variety of factors, such as price, corporate requirements and overall market conditions, applicable legal requirements and limitations, restrictions under our debt arrangements, trading restrictions under our insider trading policy and other relevant factors. The stock repurchase program may be modified, including to increase or decrease the repurchase limitation or extend, suspend, or terminate the program, by us at any time, without prior notice. During 2015, we purchased 1,340,861 shares of our common stock in open market transactions for $126 million under the program. As of January 31, 2016, the repurchased shares were held as treasury stock and $374 million of the authorization remained available for future share repurchases. 2016 stock repurchases are anticipated to be made at a similar level to 2015.

In connection with the Warnaco acquisition, we modified and extinguished the 2011 facilities and repaid all outstanding borrowings thereunder, as discussed in the following section. 2013 Senior Secured Credit Facilities On February 13, 2013, simultaneously with and related to the closing of the Warnaco acquisition, we entered into senior secured credit facilities (the 2013 facilities ), the proceeds of which were used to fund a portion of the acquisition, repay all outstanding borrowings under the 2011 facilities and repay all of Warnaco previously outstanding long-term debt. The 2013 facilities consisted of a $1.700 billion United States dollar-denominated Term Loan A facility (recorded net of an original issue discount of $7 million as of the acquisition date), a $1.375 billion United States dollar-denominated Term Loan B facility (recorded net of an original issue discount of $7 million as of the acquisition date) and senior secured revolving credit facilities in an aggregate principal amount of $750 million (based on the applicable exchange rates on February 13, 2013), consisting of (a) a $475 million United States dollar-denominated revolving credit facility, (b) a $25 million United States dollar-denominated revolving credit facility available in United States dollars or Canadian dollars and (c) a 186 million Euro-denominated revolving credit facility available in euro, pounds sterling, Japanese yen or Swiss francs.

We made payments of $500 million on our term loans under the 2013 facilities during 2013. On March 21, 2014, we amended and restated the 2013 facilities, as discussed in the following section. 41 2014 Senior Secured Credit Facilities On March 21, 2014 (the Restatement Date ), we entered into an amendment (the Amendment ) to the 2013 facilities (as amended by the Amendment, the 2014 facilities ). The Amendment provided for an additional $350 million principal amount of loans under the Term Loan A facility and an additional $250 million principal amount of loans under the Term Loan B facility and extended the maturity of the Term Loan A and the revolving credit facilities from February 13, 2018 to February 13, 2019. The maturity of the Term Loan B facility remains at February 13, 2020. On the Restatement Date, we borrowed the additional principal amounts described above and used the proceeds to redeem all of our outstanding 7 3/8% senior notes, as discussed below in the section entitled 7 3/8% Senior Notes Due 2020.

The issuance of such letters of credit and the making of any swingline loan reduces the amount available under the applicable revolving credit facility. So long as certain conditions are satisfied, we may add one or more term loan facilities or increase the commitments under the revolving credit facilities by an aggregate amount not to exceed the sum of (1) the sum of (x) $1.350 billion plus (y) the aggregate amount of all voluntary prepayments of term loans under the facilities and the revolving credit facilities (to the extent, in the case of voluntary prepayments of loans under the revolving credit facilities, there is an equivalent permanent reduction of the revolving commitments) plus (z) an amount equal to the aggregate revolving commitments of any defaulting lender (to the extent the commitments with respect thereto have been terminated) and (2) an additional unlimited amount as long as the ratio of our senior secured net debt to consolidated adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (in each case calculated as set forth in the documentation relating to the 2014 facilities) would not exceed 3 to 1 after giving pro forma effect to the incurrence of such increase. The lenders under the 2014 facilities are not required to provide commitments with respect to such additional facilities or increased commitments. During 2015 and 2014, we made payments of $350 million and $425 million, respectively, on our term loans under the 2014 facilities. As of January 31, 2016, we had total term loans outstanding of $2.391 billion, net of original issue discounts. The terms of each of Term Loan A and Term Loan B contain a mandatory quarterly repayment schedule. Due to previous voluntary payments, we are not required to make any additional scheduled mandatory payments under Term Loan B prior to maturity. Our obligations under the 2014 facilities are guaranteed by substantially all of our existing and future direct and indirect United States subsidiaries, with certain exceptions. Obligations of the European Borrower under the 2014 facilities are guaranteed by us, substantially all of our existing and future direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries (with certain exceptions) and Tommy Hilfiger Europe B.V., a wholly owned subsidiary of ours. We and our domestic subsidiary guarantors have pledged certain of our assets as security for the obligations under the 2014 facilities. The outstanding borrowings under the 2014 facilities are prepayable at any time without penalty (other than customary breakage costs). The terms of the 2014 facilities require us to repay certain amounts outstanding thereunder with (a) net cash proceeds of the incurrence of certain indebtedness, (b) net cash proceeds of certain asset sales or other dispositions (including as a result of casualty or condemnation) that exceed certain thresholds, to the extent such proceeds are not reinvested or committed to be reinvested in the business in accordance with customary reinvestment provisions, and (c) a percentage of excess cash flow that exceeds the voluntary debt payments we have made during the applicable year, which percentage is based upon our net leverage ratio during the relevant fiscal period. The United States dollar-denominated borrowings under the 2014 facilities bear interest at a rate equal to an applicable margin plus, as determined at our option, either (a) a base rate determined by reference to the greater of (i) the prime rate, (ii) the United States federal funds rate plus 1/2 of 1.00% and (iii) a one-month adjusted Eurocurrency rate plus 1.00% (provided 42 that, with respect to the Term Loan B facility, in no event will the base rate be deemed to be less than 1.75%) or (b) an adjusted Eurocurrency rate, calculated in a manner set forth in the 2014 facilities (provided that, with respect to the Term Loan B facility, in no event will the adjusted Eurocurrency rate be deemed to be less than 0.75%). The Canadian dollar-denominated borrowings under the 2014 facilities bear interest at a rate equal to an applicable margin plus, as determined at our option, either (a) a Canadian prime rate determined by reference to the greater of (i) the rate of interest per annum that Royal Bank of Canada establishes at its main office in Toronto, Ontario as the reference rate of interest in order to determine interest rates for loans in Canadian dollars to its Canadian borrowers and (ii) the sum of (x) the average of the rates per annum for Canadian dollar bankers acceptances having a term of one month that appears on the display referred to as CDOR Page of Reuters Monitor Money Rate Services as of 10:00 a.m. (Toronto time) on the date of determination, as reported by the administrative agent (and if such screen is not available, any successor or similar service as may be selected by the administrative agent), and (y) 0.75%, or (b) an adjusted Eurocurrency rate, calculated in a manner set forth in the Amendment. The borrowings under the 2014 facilities in currencies other than United States dollars or Canadian dollars bear interest at a rate equal to an applicable margin plus an adjusted Eurocurrency rate, calculated in a manner set forth in the Amendment. The current applicable margin with respect to the Term Loan A facility and each revolving credit facility is 1.50% for adjusted Eurocurrency rate loans and 0.50% for base rate loans, respectively. The current applicable margin with respect to the Term Loan B facility is 2.50% for adjusted Eurocurrency rate loans and 1.50% for base rate loans, respectively. After the date of delivery of the compliance certificate and financial statements with respect to each of our fiscal quarters, the applicable margin for borrowings under the Term Loan A facility, the Term Loan B facility and the revolving credit facilities is subject to adjustment based upon our net leverage ratio. The 2014 facilities contain customary events of default, including but not limited to nonpayment; material inaccuracy of representations and warranties; violations of covenants; certain bankruptcies and liquidations; cross-default to material indebtedness; certain material judgments; certain events related to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended; certain events related to certain of the guarantees by us and certain of our subsidiaries, and certain pledges of our assets and those of certain of our subsidiaries, as security for the obligations under the 2014 facilities; and a change in control (as defined in the 2014 facilities). During the second quarter of 2014, we entered into an interest rate cap agreement for an 18-month term commencing on August 18, 2014. The agreement was designed with the intended effect of capping the interest rate on an initial notional amount of $514 million of our variable rate debt obligation under the 2014 facilities, or any replacement facility with similar terms. Such agreement remains outstanding with a notional amount of $744 million as of January 31, 2016. Under the terms of this agreement, the one-month LIBOR that we will pay is capped at a rate of 1.50%. Therefore, the maximum amount of interest that we will pay on the then-outstanding notional amount will be at the 1.50% capped rate, plus the current applicable margin. The agreement expired on February 17, 2016. During the second quarter of 2014, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement for a two-year term commencing on February 17, 2016. The agreement was designed with the intended effect of converting an initial notional amount of $683 million of our variable rate debt obligation under the 2014 facilities, or any replacement facility with similar terms, to fixed rate debt. Under the terms of the agreement for the then-outstanding notional amount, our exposure to fluctuations in the one-month LIBOR is eliminated and we will pay a weighted average fixed rate of 1.924%, plus the current applicable margin. During the second quarter of 2013, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement for a three-year term commencing on August 19, 2013. The agreement was designed with the intended effect of converting an initial notional amount of $1.229 billion of our variable rate debt obligation under our previously outstanding 2013 facilities, or any replacement facility with similar terms, to fixed rate debt. Such agreement remains outstanding with a notional amount of $578 million as of January 31, 2016, and is now converting a portion of our variable rate debt obligation under the 2014 facilities to fixed rate debt. Under the terms of the agreement for the then-outstanding notional amount, our exposure to fluctuations in the one-month LIBOR is eliminated and we will pay a fixed rate of 0.604%, plus the current applicable margin. In addition, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement for a three-year term commencing on June 6, 2011. The agreement was designed with the intended effect of converting an initial notional amount of $632 million of our variable rate debt obligation under our previously outstanding 2011 facilities, or any replacement facility with similar terms, to fixed rate debt. The agreement expired on June 6, 2014. 43 The notional amount of each interest rate swap and cap will be adjusted according to a pre-set schedule during the term of each swap and cap agreement such that, based on our projections for future debt repayments, our outstanding debt under the Term Loan A facility is expected to always equal or exceed the combined notional amount of the then-outstanding interest rate swaps and cap. The 2014 facilities also contain covenants that restrict our ability to finance future operations or capital needs, to take advantage of other business opportunities that may be in our interest or to satisfy our obligations under our other outstanding debt. These covenants restrict our ability to, among other things: incur or guarantee additional debt or extend credit; make restricted payments, including paying dividends or making distributions on, or redeeming or repurchasing, our capital stock or certain debt; make acquisitions and investments; dispose of assets; engage in transactions with affiliates; enter into agreements restricting our subsidiaries ability to pay dividends; create liens on our assets or engage in sale/leaseback transactions; and effect a consolidation or merger, or sell, transfer, or lease all or substantially all of our assets. The 2014 facilities require us to comply with certain financial covenants, including minimum interest coverage and maximum net leverage. A breach of any of these operating or financial covenants would result in a default under the applicable facility. If an event of default occurs and is continuing, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts then outstanding, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable which would result in acceleration of our other debt. If we were unable to repay any such borrowings when due, the lenders could proceed against their collateral, which also secures some of our other indebtedness. 4 1/2% Senior Notes Due 2022 On December 20, 2012, we issued $700 million principal amount of 4 1/2% senior notes due December 15, 2022 in connection with the Warnaco acquisition. We paid $16 million of fees during 2013 in connection with the issuance of these notes, which are amortized over the term of the notes. We may redeem some or all of these notes at any time prior to December 15, 2017 by paying a make whole premium plus any accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, we may redeem some or all of these notes on or after December 15, 2017 at specified redemption prices plus any accrued and unpaid interest. Our ability to pay cash dividends and make other restricted payments is limited, in each case, over specified amounts as defined in the indenture governing the notes. 7 3/4% Debentures Due 2023 We have outstanding $100 million of debentures due November 15, 2023 with a yield to maturity of 7.80%. The debentures accrue interest at the rate of 7 3/4%. Pursuant to the indenture governing the debentures, we must maintain a certain level of stockholders equity in order to pay cash dividends and make other restricted payments, as defined in the indenture governing the debentures. 7 3/8% Senior Notes Due 2020 On May 6, 2010, we issued $600 million principal amount of 7 3/8% senior notes due May 15, 2020. On March 24, 2014, in connection with the amendment and restatement of the 2013 facilities discussed above in the section entitled 2014 Senior Secured Credit Facilities, we redeemed all of our outstanding 7 3/8% senior notes and, pursuant to the indenture under which the notes were issued, paid a make whole premium of $68 million to the holders of the notes. We also recorded costs of $14 million to write-off previously capitalized debt issuance costs associated with these notes. As of January 31, 2016, we were in compliance with all applicable financial and non-financial covenants under our financing arrangements. 44 As of January 31, 2016, our corporate credit was rated Ba1 by Moody with a stable outlook and our issuer credit was rated BB+ by Standard & Poor with a stable outlook. In assessing our credit strength, we believe that both Moody and Standard & Poor considered, among other things, our capital structure and financial policies as well as our consolidated balance sheet, our historical acquisition activity and other financial information, as well as industry and other qualitative factors. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes, as of January 31, 2016 , our contractual cash obligations by future period: Payments Due by Period Description Total Obligations 2016 2017-2018 2019-2020 Thereafter (In millions) Long-term debt (1) $ 3,199 $ 137 $ 385 $ 1,877 $ 800 Interest payments on long-term debt 483 106 188 103 86 Short-term borrowings 26 26 Operating and capital leases (2) 2,260 441 708 503 608 Inventory purchase commitments (3) 996 996 Minimum contractual royalty payments (4) 55 20 21 10 4 Non-qualified supplemental defined benefit plans (5) 14 2 3 2 7 Sponsorship and model payments (6) 19 10 7 2 Total contractual cash obligations $ 7,052 $ 1,738 $ 1,312 $ 2,497 $ 1,505 ______________________ (1) At January 31, 2016 , we had outstanding $1.812 billion under a senior secured Term Loan A facility and $587 million under a senior secured Term Loan B facility, which require mandatory payments through February 13, 2020 (according to the mandatory repayment schedules), $700 million of 4 1/2% senior unsecured notes due December 15, 2022 and $100 million of 7 3/4% debentures due November 15, 2023. (2) Includes retail store, warehouse, showroom, office and equipment operating leases, as well as capital leases. Retail store operating leases generally provide for payment of direct operating costs in addition to rent. The obligation amounts listed include future minimum lease payments and exclude such direct operating costs. Please see Note 16, Leases, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for further information. (3) Represents contractual commitments that are enforceable and legally binding for goods on order and not received or paid for as of January 31, 2016 . Inventory purchase commitments also include fabric commitments with our suppliers, which secure a portion of our material needs for future seasons. Substantially all of these goods are expected to be received and the related payments are expected to be made within six months of our year end. This amount does not include foreign currency exchange forward contracts that we have entered into to manage our exposure to exchange rate changes with respect to certain of these purchases. Please see Note 10, Derivative Financial Instruments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for further information. (4) Our minimum contractual royalty payments arise under numerous license agreements we have with third parties, each of which has different terms. Agreements typically require us to make minimum payments to the licensors of the licensed trademarks based on expected or required minimum levels of sales of licensed products, as well as additional royalty payments based on a percentage of sales when our sales exceed such minimum sales. Certain of our license agreements require that we pay a specified percentage of net sales to the licensor for advertising and promotion of the licensed products, in some cases requiring a minimum amount to be paid. Any advertising payments, with the exception of minimum payments to licensors, are excluded from the minimum contractual royalty payments shown in the table. There is no guarantee that we will exceed the minimum payments under any of these license agreements. However, given our projected sales levels for products covered under these agreements, we currently anticipate that future payments required under our license agreements on an aggregate basis will exceed the contractual minimums shown in the table. (5) We have an unfunded non-qualified supplemental defined benefit plan covering certain retired executives under which the participants will receive a predetermined amount during the 10 years following the attainment of age 65, provided 45 that prior to the termination of employment with us, the participant has been in such plan for at least 10 years and has attained age 55. (6) Represents payment obligations for sponsorships. We have agreements relating to our sponsorship of the Barclays Center, the Brooklyn Nets and certain other professional sports teams and athletes and other similar sponsorships, as well as agreements with models and stylists. Not included in the above table are contingent purchase price payments we are obligated to pay Mr. Calvin Klein based on 1.15% of total worldwide net sales, as defined in the agreement (as amended) governing the Calvin Klein acquisition, of products bearing any of the Calvin Klein brands. Such payments are required to be made with respect to sales made through February 12, 2018. A significant portion of the sales on which the payments to Mr. Klein are made are wholesale sales by us and our licensees and other partners to retailers. Such contingent purchase price payments totaled $51 million, $51 million and $53 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Not included in the above table are contingent purchase price payments we are obligated to pay GVM International Limited into 2016 (extended to 2017 if the aggregate payments made to date are not at least $15 million, which will be the case) based on a percentage of sales of Tommy Hilfiger products in India in excess of an agreed upon threshold. Such payments are subject to a $25 million aggregate maximum and are due within 60 days following each one-year period. We made contingent purchase price payments of approximately $600,000, $600,000 and $400,000 during 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. The estimated fair value of future contingent purchase price payments was $2 million as of January 31, 2016. Not included in the above table are contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plans, or payments to employees and retirees in connection with our unfunded supplemental executive retirement, supplemental pension and postretirement health plans. Contractual cash obligations for these plans cannot be determined due to the number of assumptions required to estimate our future benefit obligations, including return on assets, discount rate and future compensation increases. The liabilities associated with these plans are presented in Note 12, Retirement and Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report. We currently estimate that we will make contributions of approximately $6 million to our pension plans in 2016. Our actual contributions may differ from our planned contributions due to many factors, including changes in tax and other benefit laws, or significant differences between expected and actual pension asset performance or interest rates. Not included in the above table are $242 million of net potential cash obligations associated with uncertain tax positions due to the uncertainty regarding the future cash outflows associated with such obligations. Please see Note 9, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for further information related to uncertain tax positions. Not included in the above table are $18 million of asset retirement obligations related to leased office and retail store locations due to the uncertainty of timing of future cash outflows associated with such obligations. Please see Note 22, Other Comments, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for further information related to asset retirement obligations. Not included in the above table are obligations related to our non-exclusive buying agency agreement with Li & Fung due to uncertainty of the timing and amounts of future cash outflows associated with such obligations. Under the terms of the agreement, we are required to use Li & Fung for at least 54% of our global sourcing needs for Tommy Hilfiger products, or otherwise pay a penalty. The buying agency agreement with Li & Fung is terminable by us upon 12 months prior notice for any reason, and is terminable by either party (i) upon six months prior notice in the event of a material breach by the other party and (ii) immediately upon the occurrence of certain bankruptcy or insolvency events relating to the other party. Not included in the above table are contractual royalty obligations related to our perpetual license agreement with Speedo International Limited. Under the terms of the agreement, our contractual minimum payments each year are $1 million, which is subject to annual increases based on the Consumer Price Index. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have a material current effect, or that are reasonably likely to have a material future effect, on our financial position, changes in financial position, revenue, expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. 46 MARKET RISK Financial instruments held by us as of January 31, 2016 include cash and cash equivalents, short and long-term debt, foreign currency forward exchange contracts and interest rate swap and interest rate cap agreements. Note 11, Fair Value Measurements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report outlines the fair value of our financial instruments as of January 31, 2016 . Cash and cash equivalents held by us are affected by short-term interest rates, which are currently low. Due to the currently low rates of return we are receiving on our cash equivalents, the potential for a significant decrease in short-term interest rates is low and, therefore, a further decrease would not have a material impact on our interest income. However, there is potential for a more significant increase in short-term interest rates, which could have a more material impact on our interest income. Given our balance of cash and cash equivalents at January 31, 2016 , the effect of a 10 basis point change in short-term interest rates on our interest income would be approximately $600,000 annually. Borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities bear interest at a rate equal to an applicable margin plus a variable rate. As such, our credit facilities expose us to market risk for changes in interest rates. We have entered into interest rate swap and interest rate cap agreements for the intended purpose of reducing our exposure to interest rate volatility. As of January 31, 2016 , after taking into account the effect of our interest rate swap and interest rate cap agreements that were in effect at such date, approximately 70% of our long-term debt was at a fixed or capped interest rate, with the remainder at uncapped variable interest rates. Given our debt position at January 31, 2016 , the effect of a 10 basis point change in interest rates on our interest expense would be approximately $1 million annually. Such amount excludes any impact from our United States dollar-denominated Term Loan B facility, which would currently not be impacted by a 10 basis point change in interest rates due to its adjusted Eurocurrency rate floor of 0.75%. Please see Note 8, Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for a further discussion of our credit facilities and interest rate swap and interest rate cap agreements. Our Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger businesses each have substantial international components that expose us to significant foreign exchange risk. Our Heritage Brands business also has international components, but those components are not significant to the business. Changes in exchange rates between the United States dollar and other currencies can impact our financial results in two ways: a translation impact and a transaction impact. The translation impact refers to the impact that changes in exchange rates can have on our published financial results, as our operating results in local foreign currencies are translated into United States dollars using an average exchange rate over the representative period. Accordingly, the impact of a strengthening United States dollar, particularly against the euro, the Brazilian real, the Japanese yen, the Korean won, the British pound sterling, the Canadian dollar, the Mexican peso, the Indian rupee, the Russian ruble and the Chinese yuan renminbi, will have a negative impact on our reported results of operations. We expect reductions in revenue and net income in 2016 due to the foreign exchange translation impact of approximately $100 million and $20 million, respectively, based on current exchange rates. The transaction impact on financial results is common for apparel companies operating outside the United States that purchase goods in United States dollars, as is the case with most of our foreign operations. As with translation, during times of a strengthening United States dollar, our results of operations will be negatively impacted from these transactions as the increased local currency value of inventory results in higher cost of goods in local currency when the goods are sold. We also have exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to certain intercompany loans. We currently use and plan to continue to use foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative instruments to mitigate the cash flow or market value risks associated with these inventory and intercompany transactions, but we are unable to entirely eliminate these risks. We expect a reduction in net income in 2016 due to the foreign exchange transaction impact of approximately $110 million, based on current exchange rates. Included in the calculations of expense and liabilities for our pension plans are various assumptions, including return on assets, discount rates, mortality rates and future compensation increases. Actual results could differ from these assumptions, which would require adjustments to our balance sheet and could result in volatility in our future pension expense. Holding all other assumptions constant, a 0.25% increase or decrease in the assumed discount rate would decrease or increase, respectively, 2016 net pension expense by approximately $29 million. SEASONALITY Our business generally follows a seasonal pattern. Our wholesale businesses tend to generate higher levels of sales in the first and third quarters, while our retail businesses tend to generate higher levels of sales in the fourth quarter. Royalty, advertising and other revenue tends to be earned somewhat evenly throughout the year, although the third quarter has the highest level of royalty revenue due to higher sales by licensees in advance of the holiday selling season. We expect this seasonal pattern will generally continue. 47 RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Recently Adopted Accounting Guidance The FASB issued in November 2015 an update to accounting guidance to simplify the presentation of deferred income taxes. The guidance requires an entity to classify all deferred tax liabilities and assets as noncurrent in the balance sheet. This guidance may be applied either prospectively or retrospectively and early adoption is permitted. We elected to early adopt this guidance during the fourth quarter of 2015 and applied it retrospectively, which resulted in decreases to other current assets of $115 million, accrued expenses of $1 million and other liabilities of $106 million as of February 1, 2015 and an increase to other assets of $8 million as of February 1, 2015. The FASB issued in April 2014 guidance that revises the criteria for reporting discontinued operations. The guidance requires that a disposal of a component of an entity or group of components of an entity be reported as discontinued operations if such disposal represents a strategic shift that has or will have a major effect on an entity operations and financial results. The guidance also requires additional disclosures for both discontinued operations and disposals of significant components of an entity that do not qualify as discontinued operations. This guidance became effective for us in the first quarter of 2015. The adoption did not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements. Accounting Guidance Issued But Not Adopted as of January 31, 2016 The FASB issued in May 2014 guidance that supersedes most of the current revenue recognition requirements. The core principle of the new guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. New disclosures about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers are also required. In August 2015, the FASB approved a one year delay to the required adoption date of the standard, which makes it effective for us no later than the first quarter of 2018, with adoption in 2017 permitted. The new standard is required to be applied retrospectively to each prior reporting period or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard recognized at the date of initial application. We have not yet selected a transition method and are currently evaluating the standard to determine the impact of adoption on our consolidated financial statements. The FASB issued in June 2014 guidance to clarify accounting for stock-based compensation awards by requiring that a performance target that affects vesting and that can be met after the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition. This guidance will be effective for us in the first quarter of 2016. The adoption is not expected to have any impact on our consolidated financial statements. The FASB issued in August 2014 guidance that requires an entity management to evaluate the entity ability to continue as a going concern on an interim and annual basis and requires additional disclosures if conditions give rise to substantial doubt. This guidance will be effective for us in the fiscal year ending January 29, 2017. The adoption is not expected to have any impact on our consolidated financial statements. The FASB issued in April 2015 an update to accounting guidance related to debt issuance costs. The guidance requires debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with the presentation of debt discounts. This guidance will be effective for us in the first quarter of 2016, with early adoption permitted. Retrospective application of the new guidance is required. Had we early adopted this guidance, other current assets would have been lower by $8 million, $8 million and $12 million as of January 31, 2016 , February 1, 2015 and February 2, 2014 , respectively, and other assets would have been lower by $14 million, $20 million and $38 million as of January 31, 2016 , February 1, 2015 and February 2, 2014 , respectively, both with corresponding decreases in debt. The FASB issued in April 2015 an update to accounting guidance related to retirement benefits. This guidance provides a practical expedient which allows a company with fiscal years that do not fall on a calendar month-end to measure defined benefit plan assets and obligations using the month end that is closest to the company fiscal year end. If elected, this guidance should be applied consistently from year to year for all plans. This guidance will be effective for us in the first quarter of 2016. Prospective application is required. We do not anticipate changing our measurement date under this guidance. The FASB issued in July 2015 an update to accounting guidance to simplify the measurement of inventory. Currently, all inventory is measured at the lower of cost or market. The new guidance requires an entity to measure inventory within the 48 scope of the guidance at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. The new guidance does not apply to inventory measured using last-in, first-out or the retail inventory methods. This guidance will be effective for us in the first quarter of 2017, with early adoption permitted. Prospective application is required. We are currently evaluating the standard to determine the impact of the adoption on our consolidated financial statements. The FASB issued in September 2015 an update to accounting guidance to simplify the accounting for business combinations. The guidance requires an acquirer to recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. The updated guidance eliminates the requirement to retrospectively account for these adjustments and restate prior period financial statements. The guidance will be effective for us in the first quarter of 2016. Prospective application is required. The adoption will have an impact on our consolidated financial statements if we are the acquirer in a business combination that includes measurement-period adjustments. The FASB issued in January 2016 an update to accounting guidance for the recognition and measurement of financial instruments. The new guidance requires equity investments that are not accounted for under the equity method of accounting to be measured at fair value with changes recognized in net income and updates certain presentation and disclosure requirements. The guidance will be effective for us in the first quarter of 2018 with limited early application permitted. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. The FASB issued in February 2016 a new accounting standard on leases. The new standard, among other changes, will require lessees to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases. The lease liability will be measured at the present value of the lease payments over the lease term. The right-of-use asset will be measured at the lease liability amount, adjusted for lease prepayments, lease incentives received and the lessee initial direct costs (e.g., commissions). The new standard will be effective for us in the first quarter of 2019 with early application permitted. The adoption will require a modified retrospective approach for leases that exist or are entered into after the beginning of the earliest period presented. We are currently evaluating the standard to determine the impact of the adoption on our consolidated financial statements. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Our consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of significant accounting policies, which require management to make significant estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are outlined in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report. We believe that the following are the more critical judgmental areas in the application of our accounting policies that currently affect our financial position and results of operations: Sales allowances and returns We have arrangements with many of our department and specialty store customers to support their sales of our products. We establish accruals which, based on a review of the individual customer arrangements and the expected performance of our products in their stores, we believe will be required to satisfy our sales allowance obligations. We also establish accruals, which are based on historical data and authorized amounts, that we believe are necessary to provide for sales allowances and inventory returns. It is possible that the accrual estimates could vary from actual results, which would require adjustment to the allowance and returns accruals. Inventories Inventories are comprised principally of finished goods and are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost for principally all wholesale inventories in North America and certain wholesale and retail inventories in Asia and Latin America is determined using the first-in, first-out method. Cost for all other inventories is determined using the weighted average cost method. We review current business trends, inventory agings and discontinued merchandise categories to determine adjustments which we estimate will be needed to liquidate existing clearance inventories and reduce inventories to the lower of cost or market. We believe that all inventory writedowns required at January 31, 2016 have been recorded. If market conditions were to change, it is possible that the required level of inventory reserves would need to be adjusted. Asset impairments During 2015, 2014 and 2013, we determined that the long-lived assets in certain of our retail stores and other locations were not recoverable, which resulted in us recording impairment charges. In order to calculate the impairment charges, we estimated the undiscounted future cash flows and the related fair value of each asset. The undiscounted future cash flows for each asset were estimated using current sales trends and other factors. If different assumptions had been used for future sales trends, the recorded impairment charges could have been significantly higher or lower. Note 11, Fair Value Measurements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report includes a further discussion of the circumstances surrounding the impairments and the assumptions related to the impairment charges. 49 Allowance for doubtful accounts Trade receivables, as presented in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, are net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. An allowance for doubtful accounts is determined through an analysis of the aging of accounts receivable and assessments of collectibility based on historic trends, the financial condition of our customers and an evaluation of economic conditions. Because we cannot predict future changes in economic conditions and in the financial stability of our customers, actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates and could impact our allowance for doubtful accounts. Income taxes Deferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases and are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered. FASB guidance on accounting for income taxes requires that deferred tax assets be evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe a portion will not be realized. We consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets, including our recent earnings experience and expectations of future taxable income by taxing jurisdiction, the carryforward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes and other relevant factors. The actual realization of deferred tax assets may differ significantly from the amounts we have recorded. During the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Accounting for income taxes requires a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the tax position will be fully sustained upon review by taxing authorities, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. For tax positions that are 50 percent or less likely of being sustained upon audit, we do not recognize any portion of that benefit in the financial statements. We consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes. Our actual results could differ materially from our current estimates. Goodwill and other intangible assets Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually, at the beginning of the third quarter of each fiscal year, and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate it is more likely than not that the carrying amount may be impaired. Impairment testing for goodwill is done at a reporting unit level. A reporting unit is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment, called a component. However, two or more components of an operating segment will be aggregated and deemed a single reporting unit if the components have similar economic characteristics. Authoritative accounting guidance allows us to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a more detailed quantitative impairment test for goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets. We may elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to the quantitative test for any reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible assets. Qualitative factors that we consider as part of our assessment include a comparison of the most recent valuation to reporting unit carrying amounts, change in our market capitalization and its implied impact on reporting unit fair value, industry and market conditions, macroeconomic conditions, trends in product costs and financial performance of our businesses. If we perform the quantitative test for any reporting units or indefinite-lived intangible assets, we generally use a discounted cash flow method to estimate fair value. The discounted cash flow method is based on the present value of projected cash flows. Assumptions used in these cash flow projections are generally consistent with our internal forecasts. The estimated cash flows are discounted using a rate that represents the weighted average cost of capital. The weighted average cost of capital is based on a number of variables, including the equity-risk premium and risk-free interest rate. Management believes the assumptions used for the impairment tests are consistent with those that would be utilized by a market participant performing similar analyses and valuations. Adverse changes in future market conditions or weaker operating results compared to our expectations may impact our projected cash flows and estimates of weighted average cost of capital, which could result in a potential impairment charge if we are unable to recover the carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets. For the 2015 annual goodwill impairment test and certain indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment tests, we elected to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceeded directly to the quantitative analysis using a discounted cash flow method to estimate fair value. Under the quantitative goodwill impairment test, the estimated fair value of our reporting units is reconciled to our market capitalization. Our annual goodwill impairment test during 2015 yielded estimated fair values in excess of the carrying amounts for all of our reporting units, with a minimum excess fair value of 17%. No impairment of other indefinite-lived intangible assets resulted from our annual impairment tests. If different assumptions for our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment tests had been applied, significantly different outcomes could have resulted. There can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions 50 used in our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment testing performed as of the beginning of the third quarter of 2015 will prove to be accurate predictions of the future. For example, if general macroeconomic conditions deteriorate or otherwise vary from current assumptions (including changes in the weighted average cost of capital), industry or market conditions deteriorate, business conditions or strategies for a specific reporting unit change from current assumptions, including cost increases or loss of major customers, our businesses do not perform as projected, or there is an extended period of a significant decline in our stock price, this could be an indicator that the excess fair value of our reporting units could be lessened and the chance of an impairment of goodwill could be raised. During the fourth quarter of 2014, we announced our plan to exit the Izod retail business in 2015 (which was completed in the third quarter of 2015). The decision to exit this business was a triggering event that indicated that the amount of goodwill allocated to our Heritage Brands Retail reporting unit could be impaired, prompting the need for us to perform a goodwill impairment test for this reporting unit. As a result of this interim test in 2014, the goodwill allocated to the Heritage Brands Retail reporting unit was determined to be impaired and an impairment charge of $12 million was recorded. Pension benefits Included in the calculations of expense and liabilities for our pension plans are various assumptions, including return on assets, discount rates, mortality rates and future compensation increases. During 2014, we revised the mortality assumptions used to determine the benefit obligations of our pension plans considering future mortality improvements based on recently published actuarial tables. The improvement in life expectancy increased our benefit obligations and future expense as benefit payments are expected to be paid over an extended period of time. Note 12, Retirement and Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report sets forth certain significant rate assumptions used in performing calculations related to our pension plans. Actual results could differ from these assumptions, which would require adjustments to our balance sheet and could result in volatility in our future pension expense. Holding all other assumptions constant, a 1% increase or decrease in the assumed rate of return on assets would decrease or increase, respectively, 2016 net benefit cost by approximately $6 million. Likewise, a 0.25% increase or decrease in the assumed discount rate would decrease or increase, respectively, 2016 net periodic pension expense by approximately $29 million. Actuarial gains and losses are recognized in our operating results in the year in which they occur. These gains and losses are measured at least annually at the end of our fiscal year and, as such, are generally recorded during the fourth quarter of each year. Stock-based compensation Accounting for stock-based compensation requires measurement of compensation cost for all stock-based awards at fair value on the date of grant and recognition of compensation over the service period for awards expected to vest. We use the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model to determine the fair value of our stock options. This model uses assumptions that include the risk-free interest rate, expected volatility, expected dividend yield and expected life of the options. The fair value of restricted stock units and restricted stock is determined based on the quoted price of our common stock on the date of grant. The fair value of our stock options, restricted stock units and restricted stock is recognized as expense over the service period, net of estimated forfeitures. The fair value of contingently issuable performance shares that are not based on market conditions is based on the quoted price of our common stock on the date of grant, reduced for the present value of any dividends expected to be paid on our common stock during the performance cycle, as the contingently issuable performance shares do not accrue dividends prior to the completion of the performance cycle. We record expense for contingently issuable performance shares that are not based on market conditions based on our current expectations of the probable number of shares that will ultimately be issued. The fair value of contingently issuable performance shares that are subject to market conditions is established using a Monte Carlo simulation model. We record expense for the awards that are subject to market conditions ratably over the vesting period, net of estimated forfeitures, regardless of whether the market condition is satisfied. We consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures, including types of awards, employee class and historical experience. The estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment, and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates, such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised. Actual results and future estimates may differ substantially from our current estimates.
