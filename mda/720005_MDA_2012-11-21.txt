ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following Management's Discussion and Analysis ( MD&A ) is intended to help the reader understand the results of our operations and financial condition. The MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements. Where NM is used in various percentage change computations, the computed percentage change has been determined not to be meaningful. Executive overview Results in the investment businesses in which we operate are highly correlated to the general overall strength of economic conditions and, more specifically, to the direction of the U.S. equity markets. Overall market conditions, interest rates, economic, political and regulatory trends, and industry competition are among the factors which could affect us and which are unpredictable and beyond our control. These factors affect the financial decisions made by investors, including their level of participation in the financial markets. They also impact the level of public offerings, trading profits and asset valuations. In turn, these decisions affect our business results. Year ended September 30, 2012 compared with the year ended September 30, 2011 On April 2, 2012, we completed our acquisition of Morgan Keegan from Regions. This acquisition expands both our private client and our capital markets businesses. Morgan Keegan brings to us a strong private client business, one of the industry top fixed income and public finance groups, and a significant equity capital markets division. Headquartered in Memphis with 57 full-service offices in 20 states, Morgan Keegan had approximately 3,100 employees and over 900 financial advisors as of the date of our purchase, 892 of whom have been retained as of September 30, 2012. While an addition of this size is a departure from our focus on organic growth supplemented by individual hires and small acquisitions, it is not a departure from our overall strategy. We have used strategic mergers to grow throughout our history when the timing and pricing were right and, most importantly, when there was a strong cultural fit and clear path for integration. With the addition of Morgan Keegan, we are one of the country largest wealth management and investment banking firms, affording us even greater ability to support our financial advisors and retail and institutional clients. Our fiscal year 2012 results include six months of Morgan Keegan results, and therefore comparisons to prior years are not necessarily meaningful for many of our key financial and operating metrics. Furthermore, integration of both equity and fixed income capital markets began immediately following the Closing Date which precludes the determination of legacy Morgan Keegan results in those areas. We continue to execute our integration plans; our plan is to migrate all the private client financial advisors and client accounts off of the Morgan Keegan platforms and fully integrate those operations onto our RJ&A platform during the second quarter of fiscal year 2013. Despite the somewhat challenging market conditions during the fiscal year, most of our businesses performed relatively well as we accomplished record annual net revenue and net income levels. Our net revenues of $3.8 billion represent a 14% increase compared to the prior year. Excluding net revenues estimated to be attributable to the addition of Morgan Keegan, net revenues increased 2% compared to the prior year. All of our segments realized increased revenues over the prior year with the exception of our Emerging Markets segment. Total client assets under administration increased to $390 billion, a 52% increase as compared to the prior year. Approximately $85 billion of the client assets under administration total are associated with legacy Morgan Keegan branches. Our Private Client Group and Capital Markets segments benefited significantly from the acquisition of Morgan Keegan. Non-interest expenses increased $455 million, or 16%, from the prior year primarily due to the addition of Morgan Keegan. The current year non-interest expenses include $59 million of acquisition and integration related costs we incurred specifically associated with the Morgan Keegan acquisition, while the prior year includes $41 million pertaining to a nonrecurring loss on auction rate securities repurchased. The bank loan loss provision decreased $8 million from the prior year reflecting the overall improvement in the credit markets over that period. Inclusive of the impact of the acquisition of Morgan Keegan, our pre-tax income increased $10 million, or 2%, while our net income increased $18 million, or 6%, as compared to the prior year. After consideration of the acquisition related expenses we incurred and the $2 million of incremental interest expense we incurred as part of the pre-Closing Date execution of our Morgan Keegan purchase financing strategies, we generated adjusted pre-tax income of $533 million (a non-GAAP measure) for the current year. After adjusting the prior year for the effect of the prior year nonrecurring loss on auction rate securities repurchased, we generated adjusted pre-tax income of $503 million (a non-GAAP measure), reflecting an increase in adjusted pre-tax income (a non-GAAP measure) of $30 million, or 6%, as compared to the prior year. 35 Index Our financial results during the year were most significantly impacted by: RJ Bank generated a $67 million, or 39%, increase in pre-tax income over the prior year to a record $240 million. The increase primarily resulted from an increase in net interest revenues resulting from higher average loan balances while maintaining the net interest spread at a level consistent with the prior year, and a lower loan loss provision resulting primarily from improved credit characteristics both in our loan portfolio and in the markets as a whole. Our Private Client Group segment generated net revenues of $2.5 billion, a 13% increase over the prior year. Pre-tax income of $210 million represents a 4% decrease compared to the prior year. The increase in revenues is in large part due to our acquisition of Morgan Keegan and the high levels of retention of the Morgan Keegan financial advisors since the acquisition Closing Date. Client assets under administration of the Private Client Group increased 44% at September 30, 2012 as compared to the prior year, to $368 billion, which is a result of both the assets brought on by Morgan Keegan branches and 18% growth in legacy RJF private client assets. The current year's pre-tax income was negatively impacted by a significant increase in our technology costs resulting from system enhancements to existing platforms and projects which address numerous regulatory requirements. The Capital Markets segment realized a $5 million, or 6%, increase in pre-tax income despite very challenging equity capital markets conditions throughout the year. As a result of our Morgan Keegan acquisition, we realized substantially increased fixed income institutional sales commissions as well an increase in trading profits compared to the prior year. Our acquisition of Morgan Keegan provides us with significantly increased scale in the capital markets industry, primarily as it pertains to fixed income operations and public finance. Weakness in the equity capital markets throughout the year significantly impacted both our institutional equity sales commission levels as well as our securities underwriting revenues. A decrease in current year equity capital markets activity in Canada, which had a particularly strong prior year, also had a significant negative impact on our current year segment results. Our Asset Management segment generated $67 million of pre-tax income, a 2% increase compared to the prior year. Assets under management increased to record levels as of September 30, 2012. Net inflows of client assets, including assets of Morgan Keegan clients, and appreciation in the market values of assets drove the increase. A $15 million, or 247%, increase in the pre-tax income (after consideration of the attribution to noncontrolling interests) generated by our Proprietary Capital segment was the result of positive valuation adjustments of certain of our investments. Our Emerging Markets segment generated a $7 million pre-tax loss in the current year, a $12 million decrease from the prior year segment pre-tax income. Net revenues in this segment decreased by $19 million, or 45%, due to a decrease in investment banking revenues caused in part by the volatility and a reduced level of capital markets activity in the global markets, as well as regulatory changes in certain countries, which had a negative impact on this segments results. We incurred acquisition and integration related costs in the current year associated with the Morgan Keegan acquisition of $59 million. We anticipate incurring additional acquisition and integration costs of approximately $40 million in fiscal year 2013 as we continue to execute our integration plans. Our effective tax rate decreased to 37.3% from the prior year rate of 39.7%, primarily resulting from gains realized in the current year (as compared to losses in the prior year) on our company-owned life insurance investments, which are not subject to tax. During January 2012, RJF application to become a bank holding company and a financial holding company was approved by the Fed and RJ Bank conversion to a national bank was approved by the OCC. These changes became effective February 1, 2012. This status better represents the way RJ Bank has been conducting its business. With regard to regulatory changes that could impact our businesses, based on our review of the Dodd-Frank Act, and because of the nature of our businesses and our business practices, we presently do not expect the legislation to have a significant impact on our operations. However, because many of the regulations will result from further studies and are yet to be adopted by various regulatory agencies, the impact on our businesses remains uncertain. 36 Index Year ended September 30, 2011 compared with the year ended September 30, 2010 Our net revenues improved by $417 million, or 14%, to a record $3.3 billion for the year ended September 30, 2011 as compared to the prior year. Non-interest expenses increased $323 million, or 13%, to $2.9 billion, driven primarily by higher variable compensation costs resulting from the increase in commissions, investment banking revenues, and overall firm profitability and the $41 million loss on ARS repurchased, partially offset by a $47 million, or 58%, decrease in the bank loan loss provision. We generated record net income of $278 million, a $50 million, or 22%, improvement over the prior year period. Excluding the loss on ARS repurchased, net of its associated income tax effect, net income would have been $303 million, a 33% increase over the prior year level (a non-GAAP measure). Our financial results during the year were most significantly impacted by: A $58 million, or 36%, increase in the pre-tax income of our PCG segment. This increase resulted from a combination of favorable factors, including the increased activity levels of our private clients due to an improved level of confidence in the equity markets for the first three quarters of the fiscal year, and our continued realization of the benefits of our active recruiting in recent years as evidenced by record financial advisor productivity. A $61 million, or 54%, increase in the pre-tax income generated by RJ Bank. This increase primarily resulted from a significantly lower loan loss provision related to the improved credit quality of our loan portfolio. A $19 million, or 41%, increase in pre-tax income generated by our Asset Management segment. Assets under management increased steadily during the first three quarters of the fiscal year resulting from both increased valuations in the equity markets and the net inflows of client assets. During the fourth quarter, equity markets declined which impacted year end asset levels. However, net inflows for the year were strong, and even though the 4 th quarter equity market decline led to a flat twelve month equity market, year over year assets under management increased 7%. A $6 million, or 7%, decrease in the pre-tax income of our Capital Markets segment. Investment banking revenues in fiscal year 2011 increased over the prior year; however, results were significantly impacted by decreases in trading profits primarily associated with fixed income securities, decreases in fixed income institutional sales commissions resulting from the unsettled financial markets, especially during the last two quarters of this fiscal year. Further, expenses increased as we made efforts to expand our capital markets business, including the acquisition of Howe Barnes Hoefer and Arnett, Inc. ( Howe Barnes ). Our effective tax rate increased to 39.7% from the prior year rate of 36.9%, primarily resulting from an increase in the average state tax rate component of this blended rate, an increase in certain expenses during the fiscal year which are not deductible for tax purposes, including losses on our company-owned life insurance, and a decrease in the amount of tax credits we realized from our ownership interest in certain low-income housing tax credit partnerships. A pre-tax $41 million loss on ARS repurchased. In April, 2011 we completed our acquisition of Howe Barnes. This acquisition reflects our growth strategy to expand both our capital markets and our private client presence in strategic markets. As of the end of our fiscal year the successful integration of the primary businesses of Howe Barnes into our operations has been completed. In April, 2011 we completed a sale of $250 million of 4.25% senior notes, due April 2016. With our resultant liquidity, we believe we are well positioned to execute our growth strategies in each of our core businesses. In June, 2011 we settled the ARS matter with various regulatory agencies by offering to repurchase certain ARS from our clients, or former clients. As of September 30, 2011, we had purchased $245 million par value ARS from current or former clients as a result of this settlement. Prior to September 30, 2011, $16 million of the repurchased ARS were redeemed at par by their issuer. We believe that even though the $41 million pre-tax loss on auction rate securities repurchased was significant, the resolution of the ARS matter was in the best interest of our clients and the firm. 37 Index Segments The following table presents our consolidated and segment gross revenues and pre-tax income, excluding noncontrolling interests, for the years indicated : Year ended September 30, 2012 2011 2010 (in thousands) Total company Revenues $ 3,897,900 $ 3,399,886 $ 2,979,516 Pre-tax income excluding noncontrolling interests 471,525 461,247 361,908 Private Client Group Revenues 2,475,190 2,185,990 1,903,101 Pre-tax income 210,432 218,811 160,470 Capital Markets Revenues 796,941 664,276 591,949 Pre-tax income 82,805 77,990 84,236 Asset Management Revenues 237,224 226,511 196,817 Pre-tax income 67,241 66,176 46,981 RJ Bank Revenues 345,693 281,992 276,770 Pre-tax income 240,158 172,993 112,009 Emerging Markets Revenues 23,911 43,184 16,639 Pre-tax (loss) income (7,050 ) 4,531 (5,446 ) Securities Lending Revenues 9,480 6,432 8,837 Pre-tax income 4,659 1,488 2,721 Proprietary Capital Revenues 48,875 16,805 17,029 Pre-tax income (loss) 15,232 4,391 1,728 Other Revenues 11,800 10,524 8,056 Pre-tax loss (141,952 ) (85,133 ) (40,791 ) Intersegment eliminations Revenues (51,214 ) (35,828 ) (39,682 ) 38 Index Net interest analysis We have certain assets and liabilities, not only held in our RJ Bank segment but also held in our PCG and Capital Markets segments, which are subject to changes in interest rates; these changes in interest rates have an impact on our overall financial performance. Given the relationship of our interest sensitive assets to liabilities held in each of these segments, an increase in short-term interest rates would result in an overall increase in our net earnings (we currently have more assets than liabilities with a yield that would be affected by a change in short-term interest rates). A gradual increase in short-term interest rates would have the most significant favorable impact on our PCG and RJ Bank segments. The actual amount of any benefit would be dependent upon a variety of factors including, but not limited to, the change in balances, the rapidity and magnitude of the increase in rates, and the interest rates paid on client cash balances.

Net interest income is earned primarily by our PCG and RJ Bank segments, which are discussed separately below. Net interest income in the PCG segment increased $10 million, or 15%, despite the impact of more client assets entering our multi-bank sweep program, which pays a fee in lieu of interest. The increase was primarily the result of an increase in client margin balances, a portion of which resulted from the addition of the balances associated with Morgan Keegan clients. RJ Bank net interest income increased $51 million, or 19%, primarily as a result of an increase in average loans outstanding. Refer to the discussion of the specific components of RJ Bank net interest income in the RJ Bank section of this MD&A. Interest income earned on our available for sale securities portfolio decreased due to significantly lower yields on the portfolio as compared to the prior year. The average balance of the portfolio increased primarily as a result of the ARS we repurchased during the quarter ended September 30, 2011 (refer to the discussion of the prior year ARS settlement in the Other segment section of this Management's Discussion and Analysis) as well as the ARS we acquired in the Morgan Keegan transaction (see Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K). The yield on ARS is significantly lower than the yield on historical available for sale securities. In addition, the yield on the portion of the portfolio that is not invested in ARS decreased substantially. The result is a substantially lower weighted-average yield on available for sale securities as compared to the prior year. Interest expense on our senior notes increased approximately $27 million over the prior year. The increase is primarily comprised of $21 million of interest expense resulting from our March 2012 issuance of $350 million 6.9% senior notes and $250 million 5.625% senior notes; and $6 million of additional interest expense in the current year associated with our April 2011 issuance of $250 million 4.25% senior notes. Both of the March 2012 debt offerings were part of our financing activities associated with funding the Morgan Keegan acquisition which closed on April 2, 2012. Year ended September 30, 2011 compared with the year ended September 30, 2010 Net Interest Analysis Net interest income for the year ended September 30, 2011 increased by $18 million, or 6%, as compared to the prior year. Net interest income is earned primarily by our PCG and RJ Bank segments, which are discussed separately below. In addition to the activity in those segments, our net interest income was negatively impacted during the year ended September 30, 2011 by the $5 million of interest expense associated with our April 2011 issuance of $250 million of 4.25% senior notes. Net interest income in the PCG segment increased $12 million, or 21%, resulting primarily from increased client margin balances and slightly higher interest rates thereon. Interest earned in our Canadian operations increased due to an increase in both interest rates and the balance of segregated assets. RJ Bank's net interest income for the year increased $12 million, or 5%, primarily resulting from an increase in net interest margin inclusive of the $6 million first quarter correction of an accumulated interest income understatement in prior years related to purchased residential mortgage loan pools. Refer to the discussion of the specific components of RJ Bank's net interest income in the RJ Bank section of this MD&A. 40 Index Results of Operations Private Client Group The following table presents consolidated financial information for our PCG segment for the years indicated: Year ended September 30, 2012 % change 2011 % change 2010 ($ in thousands) Revenues: Securities commissions and fees: Equities $ 377,483 36 % $ 276,562 10 % $ 251,820 Fixed income products 79,074 31 % 60,193 (13 )% 68,867 Mutual funds 473,154 3 % 458,555 9 % 419,262 Fee-based accounts 764,688 12 % 685,672 24 % 551,107 Insurance and annuity products 289,614 11 % 261,045 11 % 234,474 New issue sales credits 72,209 (4 )% 75,590 26 % 59,841 Sub-total securities commissions and fees 2,056,222 13 % 1,817,617 15 % 1,585,371 Interest 86,756 14 % 76,237 21 % 63,128 Account and service fees: Client account and service fees 148,503 20 % 123,277 4 % 118,233 Mutual fund and annuity service fees 136,514 24 % 110,281 35 % 81,990 Client transaction fees 21,547 (37 )% 34,162 (9 )% 37,440 Correspondent clearing fees 2,812 (19 )% 3,454 2 % 3,390 Account and service fees all other 219 2 % 215 26 % 170 Sub-total account and service fees 309,595 14 % 271,389 13 % 241,223 Other 22,617 9 % 20,747 55 % 13,379 Total revenues 2,475,190 13 % 2,185,990 15 % 1,903,101 Interest expense 9,063 4 % 8,741 22 % 7,194 Net revenues 2,466,127 13 % 2,177,249 15 % 1,895,907 Non-interest expenses: Sales commissions 1,491,286 12 % 1,332,207 14 % 1,168,055 Admin & incentive compensation and benefit costs 418,871 22 % 343,097 11 % 310,184 Communications and information processing 113,851 62 % 70,369 17 % 59,974 Occupancy and equipment 95,476 24 % 77,099 % 77,349 Business development 65,503 18 % 55,538 13 % 49,126 Clearance and other 70,708 (12 )% 80,468 13 % 71,263 Total non-interest expenses 2,255,695 15 % 1,958,778 13 % 1,735,951 Income before taxes and including noncontrolling interests 210,432 (4 )% 218,471 37 % 159,956 Noncontrolling interests (340 ) (514 ) Pre-tax income excluding noncontrolling interests $ 210,432 (4 )% $ 218,811 36 % $ 160,470 Margin on net revenues 8.5 % 10.0 % 8.5 % 41 Index The following table presents a summary of Private Client Group financial advisors as of the end of the fiscal year indicated: Employees Independent contractors Investment advisor representatives (1) September 30, 2012 total September 30, 2011 total RJ&A 1,335 1,335 1,311 MK & Co.

(2) We acquired MK & Co. during fiscal year 2012. Year ended September 30, 2012 compared with the year ended September 30, 2011 Private Client Group Net revenues increased $289 million, or 13%. PCG pre-tax income decreased $8 million, or 4%, as compared to the prior year. PCG pre-tax margin on net revenues decreased to 8.5% as compared to the prior year 10.0%. The PCG business of the Morgan Keegan broker-dealer operated on its historic Morgan Keegan platform throughout this reporting period. Our plan is to migrate all the financial advisors and client accounts off of the Morgan Keegan platform and fully integrate those operations onto the RJ&A platform during the second quarter of fiscal year 2013. Securities commissions and fees increased $239 million, or 13%. A significant portion of this increase results from our acquisition of Morgan Keegan on April 2, 2012, which brought over 900 financial advisors into PCG, over 95% of whom have been retained as of September 30, 2012. Overall, we have realized an 18.3% increase in the number of PCG financial advisors as of September 30, 2012 as compared to September 30, 2011. Client assets under administration increased $112 billion, or 44%, compared to the prior year end level, to $368 billion, in large part ($66 billion) as a result of the Morgan Keegan acquisition. Equity market conditions in the U.S., while volatile during the fiscal year, were improved as compared to September 30, 2011 levels. We realized a significant increase in commissions and asset-based fees over the prior year levels. Securities commissions and fees arising from our Canadian operations decreased 10% as compared to the prior year. Client account and service fee revenues increased $25 million, or 20% , over the prior year. The portion of these revenues generated from Morgan Keegan clients is $10 million. Of the remaining increase, the primary component is the result of an increase in the fees we receive, in lieu of interest earnings, from our multi-bank sweep program; the fees increased as a result of higher balances in the program. 42 Index Mutual fund and annuity service fees increased $26 million, or 24% , primarily as a result of an increase in mutual fund networking and omnibus fees, education and marketing support fees, and no-transaction fee program revenues, all of which are paid to us by the mutual fund companies whose products we distribute. During the past year, we have been implementing a change in the data sharing arrangements with many mutual fund companies converting from networking to an omnibus arrangement. The fees earned from omnibus arrangements are greater than those under networking arrangements in order to compensate us for the additional reporting requirements performed by the broker-dealer under omnibus arrangements. The largest portion of this conversion occurred midway through the prior fiscal year. Excluding the impact of the revenues generated from Morgan Keegan clients, these revenues increased $23 million, or 21%, as compared to the prior year. The Morgan Keegan client mutual fund positions will be eligible for our omnibus program following conversion to the RJ&A platform. Partially offsetting the increases in revenues described above, client transaction fees decreased $13 million, or 37% , primarily as a result of certain mutual fund relationships converting over the past year to a no-transaction fee program and an April 2012 reduction in transaction fees associated with certain non-managed fee-based accounts. Under the mutual fund no-transaction fee program, we receive increased fees from mutual fund companies which are included within mutual fund and annuity service fee revenue described above, but our clients no longer pay us transaction fees on mutual fund trades within certain of our managed programs. While total segment revenues increased 13% , the portion that we consider to be recurring continues to increase and is approximately 64% of total segment revenues for the year ended September 30, 2012 as compared to 61% for the prior year. Recurring commission and fee revenues include asset based fees, trailing commissions from mutual funds, variable annuities and insurance products, mutual fund service fees, fees earned on funds in our multi-bank sweep program, and interest. Assets in fee-based accounts at September 30, 2012 are $103 billion, an increase of 51% as compared to the $68 billion of assets in fee-based accounts at September 30, 2011. A portion (approximately $10 billion) of the increase in assets in fee-based accounts over the preceding year balances resulted from the addition of the assets in the fee-based accounts of Morgan Keegan. PCG net interest revenues increased $10 million, or 15%, primarily resulting from an increase in client margin balances. There was a decrease in net interest earned on client cash balances as more of these funds are being swept into our multi-bank sweep program, where a fee is earned by PCG instead of interest. A portion of the increase in client margin balances resulted from the addition of the balances associated with Morgan Keegan clients. Non-interest expenses increased $297 million, or 15% , over the prior year. Sales commission expense increased $159 million, or 12% , generally consistent with the increase in commission and fee revenues. Administrative and incentive compensation expenses increased $76 million, or 22% . The increase primarily results from increases in salaries and benefits due to increased support staff and information technology and operations headcount arising from the addition of Morgan Keegan associates. Communications and information processing expense increased $43 million, or 62% , primarily due to increases in information systems costs. Computer software development costs and other information technology related costs, which include consulting expenses, increased over $29 million as compared to the prior year as a result of various information technology enhancements to existing platforms and additional reporting requirements, including regulatory requirements and those under omnibus arrangements (refer to the increase in mutual fund and annuity service fee revenue arising from these arrangements discussed above). Expenses primarily associated with the increase in our number of offices and personnel arising from the Morgan Keegan acquisition resulted in an increase in office related expenses of $8 million. Occupancy and equipment expense increased $18 million, or 24% , primarily due to the increase of approximately 140 branch office locations resulting from the Morgan Keegan acquisition. Business development expense increased $10 million, or 18%, primarily due to increases in travel and related costs, and account transfer fees paid when a new client transfers their accounts from a competitor to us. Partially offsetting the increases described above, clearance and other expense decreased $10 million, or 12% , resulting primarily from favorable impacts on this segment resulting from Morgan Keegan's allocation practices which allocate certain clearance costs to the capital markets operations. 43 Index Year ended September 30, 2011 compared with the year ended September 30, 2010 Private Client Group Pre-tax income in the PCG segment increased $58 million, or 36%, for the year as compared to the prior year. Net revenues increased $281 million, or 15%. PCG's margins were 10% of net revenues compared to 8.5% in the prior year. Securities commissions and fees increased $232 million, or 15%, resulting from a number of favorable factors. Equity market conditions for the first ten months of fiscal year 2011 were improved as compared to the prior year. Asset values increased for most of the year and prior to the decline in the markets commencing in August, 2011, favorably impacting fees arising from client assets in fee-based accounts. Total client assets under administration increased 3% as compared to the prior year end level, to $256 billion. While our number of financial advisors increased only slightly year over year, average financial advisor productivity reached record levels, increasing 15% over the prior year. Average financial advisor productivity increased in both our employee and our independent contractor business models. We are realizing the benefits both from improved market conditions and from the financial advisors that joined us during our very active 2008-2009 recruiting period. Mutual fund and annuity service fees increased $28 million, or 35%, primarily as a result of an increase in mutual fund networking and omnibus fees as well as education and marketing fees, both of which are earned from mutual fund and insurance companies whose products we distribute. During the current year, we have been in the process of changing our data sharing arrangements with many mutual fund companies from networking to an omnibus arrangement. The fees earned from omnibus arrangements are greater than those under networking arrangements in order to compensate us for the additional reporting requirements performed by the broker-dealer under omnibus arrangements. Client transaction fees decreased $3 million, or 9%, primarily as a result of certain mutual fund relationships converting during the current year to a no-transaction fee program. Under this program, we receive increased fees from mutual fund companies which are included within mutual fund and annuity service fee revenue described above, but our clients no longer pay us transaction fees on mutual fund trades within certain of our managed programs. While total segment revenues increased 15%, the portion that we consider to be recurring was consistent with the prior year at 61%. Assets in fee-based accounts at September 30, 2011 increased 11% to $67.5 billion as compared to $60.9 billion in the prior year. Recurring commission and fee revenues include trailing commissions from mutual funds, variable annuities and insurance products, mutual fund service fees and interest. PCG interest revenues increased by $13 million, or 21%, resulting from an increase in client margin balances and a slight increase in the interest rate earned on both customer reserve (segregated assets) balances and client margin balances. Interest earned in our Canadian operations increased due to an increase in both interest rates and customer reserve balances. Other revenues increased by $7 million, or 55%, primarily resulting from a $3 million increase in certain investments held by our Canadian subsidiary and a $2 million increase in foreign currency gains resulting from an increase in cross currency trades executed by our Canadian operation during the year. Sales commission expense increased by $164 million, or 14%, directly related to the 15% increase in commission and fee revenues. Administrative and incentive compensation expenses increased $33 million, or 11%. The increase primarily results from annual increases in salaries and benefits and increases in incentive compensation related to the higher level of profitability. Clearance and other expenses increased $9 million, or 12%, as compared to the prior year. The increase is primarily due to clearance expense which is generally correlated with the increase in securities commissions and fees revenues. 44 Index Results of Operations Capital Markets The following table presents consolidated financial information for our Capital Markets segment for the years indicated: Year ended September 30, 2012 % change 2011 % change 2010 ($ in thousands) Revenues: Institutional sales commissions: Equity $ 222,696 (11 )% $ 250,188 12 % $ 222,481 Fixed income 264,747 111 % 125,770 (15 )% 147,585 Sub-total institutional sales commissions 487,443 30 % 375,958 2 % 370,066 Securities underwriting fees 95,486 (13 )% 110,066 23 % 89,216 Tax credit funds syndication fees 31,693 (12 )% 36,062 141 % 14,941 Mergers & acquisitions fees 81,242 (2 )% 83,131 44 % 57,783 Private placement fees 11,005 467 % 1,940 1 % 1,914 Trading profits 47,115 136 % 19,981 (37 )% 31,654 Interest 21,744 1 % 21,579 19 % 18,191 Other 21,213 36 % 15,559 90 % 8,184 Total revenues 796,941 20 % 664,276 12 % 591,949 Interest expense 16,203 (2 )% 16,612 30 % 12,814 Net revenues 780,738 21 % 647,664 12 % 579,135 Non-interest expenses: Sales commissions 176,344 38 % 127,974 % 128,432 Admin & incentive compensation and benefit costs 372,007 16 % 320,209 22 % 262,791 Communications and information processing 57,003 27 % 44,907 18 % 37,925 Occupancy and equipment 30,295 30 % 23,273 19 % 19,575 Business development 36,593 6 % 34,481 29 % 26,666 Clearance and other 58,365 42 % 41,181 13 % 36,382 Total non-interest expenses 730,607 23 % 592,025 16 % 511,771 Income before taxes and including noncontrolling interests 50,131 (10 )% 55,639 (17 )% 67,364 Noncontrolling interests (32,674 ) (22,351 ) (16,872 ) Pre-tax income excluding noncontrolling interests $ 82,805 6 % $ 77,990 (7 )% $ 84,236 Year ended September 30, 2012 compared with the year ended September 30, 2011 Capital Markets Pre-tax income in the Capital Markets segment increased $5 million, or 6% , as compared to the prior year. Certain of the Capital Markets businesses of the Morgan Keegan broker-dealer we acquired on April 2, 2012 were immediately integrated into RJ&A's operations on the date of acquisition. Other Morgan Keegan Capital Markets businesses are being integrated into RJ&A over time. Morgan Keegan equity capital markets and fixed income operations are included in the current year results, therefore, comparisons of our legacy capital markets operations, especially fixed income operations, to our current operations, are not meaningful. Our plan is to have fully integrated all of the historic Morgan Keegan Capital Markets businesses into RJ&A by the end of the second quarter of our fiscal year 2013. The weakness in the equity capital markets negatively impacted our results. Our fixed income results reflect significant improvement during the third and fourth quarter primarily driven by the acquisition of Morgan Keegan. The combination of our former fixed income operations with Morgan Keegan's fixed income operations results in a combined department that is approximately three times the size of our legacy fixed income business. 45 Index Net revenues increased by $133 million, or 21% , primarily resulting from a $139 million, or 111% , increase in institutional fixed income sales commissions, a $27 million, or 136% , increase in trading profits, and a $9 million increase in private placement fees. These revenue increases were partially offset by a $27 million, or 11% , decrease in institutional equity sales commissions, a $15 million, or 13% , decrease in underwriting fees, and a $4 million, or 12% , decrease in tax credit fund syndication fees. Lingering concerns over the EU debt crisis and the U.S. economy had a negative impact on the capital markets for most of the current fiscal year. Fixed income sales commissions increased over the prior year primarily due to the increased size of our fixed income operations. Despite the increase in underwriting fees arising from the acquired Morgan Keegan fixed income public finance operations of $23 million, our total underwriting fees decreased. Although equity market levels at the end of the current year finished at higher levels than the prior year, the market for public offerings during the year has been erratic. The number of lead and co-managed underwritings during the current year increased in our U.S. operations and decreased significantly in our Canadian operations. The prior year was a particularly strong year for our Canadian equity capital markets operations but market conditions in the industries in which they are concentrated (energy and mining) have slowed significantly since last year. Our tax credit fund syndication subsidiary sold approximately $596 million in tax credit fund equity investments to investors during the year, a decrease compared to the record volume of $616 million sold in the prior year. Trading profits for the current year increased $27 million, or 136% , as compared to the prior year. The year over year increase results in part from the acquisition of Morgan Keegan, as trading profits arise primarily from fixed income products. After our acquisition of Morgan Keegan, we have more fixed income trading professionals then we had prior to the acquisition, providing us a greater platform from which to generate trading profits. To support the increased number of trading professionals, our inventories of fixed income products has also increased. Non-interest expenses increased $139 million, or 23% , over the prior year primarily driven by the addition of the Morgan Keegan fixed income operations. Sales commission expense increased $48 million, or 38% , which is directly correlated to the increase in overall institutional sales commission revenues of 30%, and includes the shift to a higher percentage of fixed income sales. Administrative and incentive compensation and benefit expense increased $52 million, or 16% , primarily driven by the significant increase in personnel resulting from the Morgan Keegan acquisition, a full year of consolidation of RJES which became effective when we acquired a controlling interest in that subsidiary in April, 2011, and to a lesser extent, the annual increase in salary and benefits costs. The increase in clearance and other expense primarily resulted from an increase of approximately $15 million in clearance expenses arising from the larger combined fixed income operations, Morgan Keegan's allocation methodology, and $2 million of expense in the current year arising from the amortization of various intangible assets which arose as a result of the Morgan Keegan acquisition. Noncontrolling interests represent the impact of consolidating certain low-income housing tax credit funds, which also impacts other revenue, interest expense, and other expenses within this segment (see Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for further details) as well as the impact of our consolidation of RJES, and reflects the portion of these consolidated entities which we do not own. Total segment expenses attributable to noncontrolling interest increased by approximately $10 million as compared to the prior year. Year ended September 30, 2011 compared with the year ended September 30, 2010 Capital Markets Pre-tax income in the Capital Markets segment decreased $6 million, or 7%, for the year as compared to the prior year. Net revenues increased by $69 million, or 12%, primarily resulting from a $28 million, or 12%, increase in institutional equity sales commissions, a $25 million, or 44%, increase in merger and acquisition fees, a $21 million, or 23%, increase in underwriting fees, and a $21 million, or 141%, increase in tax credit fund syndication fees, all of which were partially offset by a $22 million, or 15%, decrease in institutional fixed income commissions and a $12 million, or 37% decrease in trading profits. During recent years we have increased the number of capital markets professionals in both our fixed income and our equity capital markets operations. Our increased revenues in the current year reflect the realization of the benefits of those successful efforts in addition to improved equity markets for most of the year. The increase in institutional equity sales commissions as compared to the prior year is due to a number of favorable factors including favorable equity market conditions for the first ten months of the fiscal year. The decrease in fixed income institutional sales commissions resulted primarily from a flat yield curve and the low interest rate environment. 46 Index Both lead and co-managed underwritings in our U.S. and Canadian operations increased during the first nine months of the fiscal year. However, market conditions in the fourth quarter were such that IPO activity was non-existent and secondary offering volumes slowed. Even with little fourth quarter activity, we ended the year with increases over the prior year in lead-managed underwritings arising from both our U.S. and our Canadian operations. The number of co-managed underwritings arising from our Canadian operations increased 32% while co-managed underwritings from our U.S. operations decreased 4%, as compared to the prior year. The increase in merger and acquisition fees resulted primarily from increases in our business services, technology, energy, consumer and retail, and transportation and industrial growth business sectors. The increase in tax credit fund syndication fees resulted from a 66% increase in the volume of tax credit fund equity investments sold to investors, to $616 million from $371 million in the prior year. The decrease in trading profits from the prior year is primarily related to fixed income products, and to a lesser extent, an increase in facilitation losses from our equity market making activities. Trading profits for the first nine months of the year were relatively strong in what was for the most part unsettled fixed income markets caused by issues during that period such as those related to the U.S. debt ceiling. The increased levels of uncertainty in the markets resulting from solvency problems in several European countries during the fourth quarter resulted in us generating a net trading loss during that period. In addition, the facilitation losses increased due to the fourth quarter decline in the equity markets. Other revenues increased $7 million, or 90%, primarily resulting from increases in revenues and the avoidance of certain losses incurred in the prior year, associated with our tax credit fund syndication activities. Non-interest expenses increased $80 million, or 16%. Administrative and incentive compensation expense increased $57 million, or 22%, as a result of a number of factors including the incremental growth in the number of fixed income investment bankers, an increase in equity capital markets investment bankers in part arising from the Howe Barnes acquisition, increases in incentive compensation as a result of the increased revenues of the segment, increased expenses resulting from the consolidation of RJES, and certain one-time expenses incurred during the current year as a result of the Howe Barnes acquisition. Business development expense increased $8 million, or 29%, with increases in both our domestic and Canadian capital markets groups reflecting our efforts to expand these businesses in light of what had been improving market outlooks for the better part of fiscal year 2011. Noncontrolling interests reflect the impact of consolidating certain low-income housing tax credit funds, which impact other revenue, interest expense, and other expenses within this segment (see Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for further details) as well as the impact of RJES, initially consolidated in the June 2011 quarter. Noncontrolling interests reflect the portion of these businesses that we do not own. 47 Index Results of Operations Asset Management The following table presents consolidated financial information for our Asset Management segment for the years indicated: Year ended September 30, 2012 % change 2011 % change 2010 ($ in thousands) Revenues: Investment advisory fees $ 198,369 5 % $ 188,817 21 % $ 156,266 Other 38,855 3 % 37,694 (7 )% 40,551 Total revenues 237,224 5 % 226,511 15 % 196,817 Expenses: Admin & incentive compensation and benefit costs 81,418 6 % 76,594 10 % 69,931 Communications and information processing 16,378 7 % 15,307 (16 )% 18,116 Occupancy and equipment 3,536 (4 )% 3,670 (6 )% 3,904 Business development 7,885 7 % 7,365 18 % 6,254 Investment sub-advisory fees 26,563 (4 )% 27,606 12 % 24,701 Other 33,353 17 % 28,392 10 % 25,840 Total expenses 169,133 6 % 158,934 7 % 148,746 Income before taxes and including noncontrolling interests 68,091 1 % 67,577 41 % 48,071 Noncontrolling interests 850 1,401 1,090 Pre-tax income excluding noncontrolling interests $ 67,241 2 % $ 66,176 41 % $ 46,981 The following table reflects financial assets under management in managed programs that significantly impact segment results at the dates indicated: September 30, 2012 June 30, 2012 September 30, 2011 June 30, 2011 September 30, 2010 (in millions) Assets under management: Eagle Asset Management, Inc. $ 19,986 $ 19,284 $ 16,092 $ 18,745 $ 15,567 Raymond James Consulting Services 9,443 9,041 8,356 9,215 8,458 Unified Managed Accounts 2,855 2,578 1,677 1,653 735 Freedom Accounts & other managed programs 11,884 11,138 9,523 10,678 8,791 Sub-total assets under management 44,168 42,041 35,648 40,291 33,551 Less: Assets managed for affiliated entities (4,185 ) (3,943 ) (3,579 ) (3,668 ) (3,544 ) Sub-total net assets under management 39,983 38,098 32,069 36,623 30,007 Morgan Keegan managed fee-based assets (1) 2,801 2,798 Total assets under management $ 42,784 $ 40,896 $ 32,069 $ 36,623 $ 30,007 (1) All revenues generated since the Closing Date of the acquisition from assets in Morgan Keegan managed fee-based programs are included in the PCG segment. The majority of the revenue for this segment is generated by the investment advisory fees related to asset management services for individual investment portfolios, mutual funds and managed programs. Asset balances are impacted by both the performance of the market and the new sales and redemptions of client accounts/funds. Rising markets positively impact revenues from investment advisory fees as existing accounts increase in value, and individuals and institutions typically commit incremental funds in rising markets. As of September 30, 2012, approximately 82% of investment advisory fees recorded in this segment are earned from assets held in managed programs. Of these revenues, approximately 55% of our investment advisory fees recorded in a quarter are determined based on balances at the beginning of a quarter, approximately 25% are based on balances at the end of the quarter and the remaining 20% are computed based on average assets throughout the quarter. 48 Index The following table reflects assets under management in non-managed programs that significantly impact segment results at the dates indicated: September 30, 2012 June 30, 2012 September 30, 2011 June 30, 2011 September 30, 2010 (in millions) Passport $ 30,054 $ 28,015 $ 24,008 $ 25,830 $ 22,708 Ambassador 17,826 16,620 13,555 14,283 10,479 Other non-managed fee-based assets 3,153 2,500 2,196 2,445 2,023 Sub-total assets under management 51,033 47,135 39,759 42,558 35,210 Morgan Keegan non-managed fee-based assets (1) 6,772 6,339 Total assets under management $ 57,805 $ 53,474 $ 39,759 $ 42,558 $ 35,210 (1) All revenues generated since the Closing Date of the acquisition from assets in Morgan Keegan non-managed fee-based programs are included in the PCG segment. As of September 30, 2012, approximately 18% of investment advisory fees recorded in this segment are earned from assets held in non-managed programs and all such investment advisory fees are determined based on balances at the beginning of the quarter. Subsequent to year end, we announced the execution of a definitive agreement to purchase a substantial minority interest in ClariVest Asset Management, LLC ( ClariVest ), an acquisition which will bolster our platform in the large-cap strategy space. ClariVest, manages more than $3 billion in client assets and currently markets its investment services to corporate and public pension plans, foundations, endowments and Taft-Hartley clients worldwide. We expect to consolidate the financial results of ClariVest as a result of certain protective rights we will have under the operating agreement with ClariVest after the transaction closes. In addition, a put and call agreement to be entered into at closing would provide Eagle with various paths to majority ownership, the timing of which would depend upon the financial results of ClariVest's business and the tenure of existing ClariVest management. We expect to close on this transaction, which is not material to our overall financial condition, around the end of calendar 2012. Year ended September 30, 2012 compared to the year ended September 30, 2011 Asset Management Pre-tax income in the Asset Management segment increased $1 million, or 2% , as compared to the prior year. Investment advisory fee revenue increased by $10 million, or 5% , generated by an increase in assets under management. Total legacy Raymond James assets under management in managed programs were $8.5 billion more at September 30, 2012 than they were as of September 30, 2011, an increase of 24% (fee revenue excludes fees arising from fee-based assets in programs managed by Morgan Keegan as the revenues associated with these activities are reflected in our PCG segment until the PCG integration occurs in fiscal year 2013). Since the prior year, net inflows of client assets into managed programs approximated $3.5 billion while asset values have increased by $5 billion. Despite the decrease in assets under management in non-managed programs experienced during the fourth quarter of the prior year, resulting in lower revenue during our first quarter, assets in non-managed programs steadily increased during the current year. As a result of the manner in which our fee revenues are computed, the increase in assets under management experienced during the most recent September 2012 quarter will have a positive impact on our billings for the first quarter of fiscal 2013. Expenses increased by approximately $10 million, or 6% , resulting from a $5 million, or 6% , increase in administrative and performance based incentive compensation, and a $5 million, or 17% , increase in other expenses. The increase in other expense is primarily due to increases in various corporate overhead allocations to this segment, increases in the costs incurred so that certain funds sponsored by Eagle are available as investment choices on the platforms of other broker-dealers, and an increase in the third party expenses our Raymond James Trust subsidiary has incurred in the performance of certain of its obligations to clients. 49 Index Year ended September 30, 2011 compared to the year ended September 30, 2010 Asset Management Pre-tax income in the Asset Management segment increased $19 million, or 41%, as compared to the prior year. Investment advisory fees increased by $33 million, or 21%, from the prior year, generated by an increase in assets under management. Assets under management in managed programs increased during the fiscal year 2011 by $2.1 billion, comprised of $3.3 billion of new client assets net of a market value decrease of $1.2 billion. Our investment advisory fee revenues for the year benefited from appreciation in the market values of assets in each of the first three quarters of the fiscal year, with the entire decrease in market values occurring during the fourth quarter. Expenses increased by $10 million, or 7%, primarily resulting from a $7 million, or 10%, increase in administrative and incentive compensation, and a $3 million, or 12%, increase in investment sub-advisory fee expenses. Increases in incentive compensation are highly correlated with revenues, portfolio performance and segment profitability. The investment sub-advisory fee expense increase results from the increase in assets held in accounts managed by sub-advisors. Communications and information processing expense decreased $3 million, or 16%, while other expense increased $3 million, or 10%, both of which result from the utilization of a third party transfer agent for the Eagle family of mutual funds during the current year. These outsourced services were performed internally during the prior year. Results of Operations RJ Bank The following table presents consolidated financial information for RJ Bank for the years indicated: Year ended September 30, 2012 % change 2011 % change 2010 ($ in thousands) Revenues: Interest income $ 331,683 17 % $ 284,640 2 % $ 278,326 Interest expense 9,659 (28 )% 13,334 (29 )% 18,761 Net interest income 322,024 19 % 271,306 5 % 259,565 Other income (loss) 14,010 629 % (2,648 ) (70 )% (1,556 ) Net revenues 336,034 25 % 268,658 4 % 258,009 Non-interest expenses: Employee compensation and benefits 18,432 23 % 14,968 30 % 11,488 Communications and information processing 2,835 18 % 2,402 42 % 1,687 Occupancy and equipment 912 8 % 842 (4 )% 873 Provision for loan losses 25,894 (23 )% 33,655 (58 )% 80,413 FDIC insurance premiums 5,435 (39 )% 8,855 (21 )% 11,206 Affiliate deposit account servicing fees 26,852 30 % 20,733 (7 )% 22,245 Other 15,516 9 % 14,210 (21 )% 18,088 Total non-interest expenses 95,876 95,665 (34 )% 146,000 Pre-tax income $ 240,158 39 % $ 172,993 54 % $ 112,009 RJ Bank is a national bank, regulated by the OCC, which provides corporate, residential and consumer loans, as well as FDIC insured deposit accounts, to clients of our broker-dealer subsidiaries and to the general public.

Residential mortgage loans are originated and held for investment or sold in the secondary market. RJ Bank generates revenue principally through the interest income earned on loans and investments, which is offset by the interest expense it pays on client deposits and on its borrowings. 50 Index The tables below present certain credit quality trends for corporate loans and residential/consumer loans: Year ended September 30, 2012 2011 2010 (in thousands) Net loan (charge-offs)/recoveries: C&I loans $ (10,486 ) $ (458 ) $ Commercial real estate ( CRE ) loans (926 ) (13,534 ) (54,053 ) Residential/mortgage loans (12,727 ) (20,757 ) (29,548 ) Consumer loans (75 ) (246 ) Total $ (24,214 ) $ (34,995 ) $ (83,601 ) As of September 30, 2012 2011 2010 (in thousands) Allowance for loan losses: Loans held for sale $ $ 5 $ 23 Loans held for investment: C&I loans 92,409 81,267 60,464 CRE construction loans 739 490 4,473 CRE loans 27,546 30,752 47,771 Residential/mortgage loans 26,138 33,210 34,297 Consumer loans 709 20 56 Total $ 147,541 $ 145,744 $ 147,084 Nonperforming assets: Nonperforming loans: C&I loans $ 19,517 $ 25,685 $ CRE loans 8,404 15,842 67,901 Residential mortgage loans: Residential mortgage loans 78,372 91,682 85,852 Home equity loans/lines 367 114 230 Total nonperforming loans 106,660 133,323 153,983 Other real estate owned: CRE 4,902 7,707 19,486 Residential: First mortgage 3,316 6,852 8,439 Home equity 13 Total other real estate owned 8,218 14,572 27,925 Total nonperforming assets $ 114,878 $ 147,895 $ 181,908 Total loans: Loans held for sale, net (1) $ 160,515 $ 102,236 $ 6,114 Loans held for investment: C&I loans 5,018,831 4,100,939 3,232,723 CRE construction loans 49,474 29,087 65,512 CRE loans 936,450 742,889 937,669 Residential mortgage loans 1,691,986 1,756,486 2,015,331 Consumer loans 352,495 7,438 23,940 Net unearned income and deferred expenses (70,698 ) (45,417 ) (39,276 ) Total loans held for investment 7,978,538 6,591,422 6,235,899 Total loans $ 8,139,053 $ 6,693,658 $ 6,242,013 (1) Net of unearned income and deferred expenses. 51 Index Year ended September 30, 2012 compared to the year ended September 30, 2011 RJ Bank Pre-tax income generated by the RJ Bank segment increased $67 million, or 39% , as compared to the prior year. The improvement in pre-tax income was primarily attributable to an increase of $67 million, or 25% , in net revenues and an $8 million, or 23% , decrease in the provision for loan losses, offset by an $8 million, or 13%, increase in other non-interest expenses. Net revenue was positively impacted by a $51 million increase in net interest income, $6 million less in other-than-temporarily impaired ( OTTI ) losses on our available for sale securities portfolio, and an improvement of $8 million in foreign currency transaction gains on Canadian dollar denominated loans in the corporate loan portfolio. Net interest income increased $57 million over the prior year (excluding the impact of a $6 million correction recorded in the prior year), primarily as a result of a $1.2 billion increase in average interest-earning banking assets. This increase in average interest-earning banking assets was driven by a $1.2 billion increase in average corporate loans. While there were increases in the Small Business Administration ( SBA ) and consumer loan portfolios as well as cash and investments, these were largely offset by a decrease in residential mortgage loans. The yield on interest-earning banking assets of 3.61% was consistent with 3.60% in the prior year. The average loan portfolio yield was 4.20% as compared to 4.25% in the prior year. The loan portfolio yield decreased due to a decline in the yield on the residential mortgage loan portfolio resulting from adjustable rate loans resetting at lower rates, which offset an increase in the corporate loan portfolio yield. Average corporate loans outstanding include the impact of the purchase of $400 million of Canadian loans on February 29, 2012. The net interest margin increased 0.07% from the prior year to 3.50% due to a small increase in the yield on earning assets and a small decrease in the average cost of funds. Corresponding to the increase in interest-earning banking assets, average interest-bearing banking liabilities increased $1.1 billion to $8.1 billion. The provision for loan losses during the year was positively impacted by a reduction in both C&I and CRE nonperforming loans, improved credit characteristics of certain problem loans, and the reduction of the balance of residential mortgage nonperforming loans. In addition, somewhat improved economic conditions relative to the prior year has limited the number of new problem loans. Net loan charge-offs decreased $11 million, or 31%, to $24 million for the current year. Nonperforming loans decreased $27 million, or 20%, compared to September 30, 2011. Corporate nonperforming loans decreased $14 million, or 33%, and residential nonperforming loans decreased $13 million, or 14%. The $8 million increase in non-interest expenses (excluding provision for loan losses) as compared to the prior year was primarily attributable to a $3 million, or 23% increase in compensation and benefits related to staff additions and a $6 million increase in affiliate deposit account servicing fees resulting from increased deposit balances. The unrealized loss on our available for sale securities portfolio at September 30, 2012 was $17 million compared to $46 million as of September 30, 2011. This significant improvement was the result of higher market prices, despite the continued uncertainty in the residential non-agency collateralized mortgage obligation ( CMOs ) market. During the last week of October, 2012, the mid-Atlantic and Northeast regions of the U.S. suffered severe damage from Hurricane Sandy and related storms. We are currently assessing the impact to our loan portfolio, if any. While we are unable to estimate a range of loss associated with the financial impact of this weather related event at this time, once determinable, it could have an adverse impact on our results of operations in fiscal year 2013. Year ended September 30, 2011 compared to the year ended September 30, 2010 RJ Bank Pre-tax income generated by the RJ Bank segment increased $61 million, or 54%, for the year compared to the prior year. The significant improvement in pre-tax income was attributable to a $47 million, or 58%, decrease in the provision for loan losses and an increase of $12 million, or 5%, in net interest income. 52 Index The increase in net interest income was primarily due to an increase of 0.12% in the net interest margin. The net interest margin improvement for the year resulted from an increase in the loan portfolio yield from 3.97% to 4.25% due primarily to an increase in corporate loan yields and a $6 million correction of an accumulated interest income understatement in prior years related to purchased residential mortgage loan pools. Yields on the residential mortgage loan portfolio declined during the year due to adjustable rate loans resetting to lower rates and the payoff of higher yielding loans in the current low interest rate environment. Average interest-earning banking assets increased $44 million, or less than 1%, and totaled $7.8 billion at year end. An increase in average C&I loans and significant increases in cash balances were offset by a decrease in the other loan portfolio segments. Corresponding to the small increase in average interest-earning banking assets, average interest-bearing banking liabilities increased less than 1% to $7 billion at year end. Continued low interest rates led to a $5 million, or 29%, decrease in interest expense. The average cost of funds decreased from 0.27% to 0.19%. However, excluding the impact of excess RJBDP cash balances held during the fourth quarter, the net interest margin would have increased by 0.26% over the prior year. These deposits resulted from higher cash balances in our client accounts due to the market volatility, thus exceeding the RJBDP capacity at outside financial institutions in the program. These deposits were invested in short term liquid investments producing very little interest rate spread. The provision for loan losses of $34 million for the current year was significantly lower than the $80 million in the prior year and net loan charge-offs for the year decreased $49 million, or 58%, from $84 million to $35 million. These declines are a result of an improvement in credit quality within the CRE portfolio, an improvement in the credit characteristics of certain problem corporate loans, and the stabilization of the balance of residential mortgage nonperforming loans. However, unfavorable economic conditions, including high unemployment rates, continued to have a negative impact on the residential mortgage loan portfolio. The amount of nonperforming loans decreased $21 million, or 13%, during the year compared to the prior year. This decrease was due to a reduction of $52 million in nonperforming CRE loans, partially offset by an increase of $26 million in C&I nonperforming loans and an increase of $6 million in nonperforming residential mortgage loans. Other real estate owned decreased $13 million, or 48%, to $15 million at year end due to the net sales of $12 million in CRE properties and $1 million in residential properties. The unrealized loss on our available for sale securities portfolio was $46 million, compared to $51 million as of the prior year end. The unrealized loss was due to continued wide interest rate spreads across market sectors related to the continued uncertainty in the residential non-agency CMO market. Certain securities were determined to be OTTI during the year as RJ Bank does not expect to recover the amortized cost basis of the securities in full, and therefore an OTTI expense of $10 million was reflected in fiscal year 2011 as a component of other loss, compared to a $12 million OTTI charge in the prior fiscal year. 53 Index The following table presents average balance data and interest income and expense data for our banking operations, as well as the related interest yields and rates and interest spread for the years indicated: Year ended September 30, 2012 2011 2010 Average balance Interest inc./exp.

(2) Negotiable Order of Withdrawal ( NOW ) account. (3) The CRE Construction yield for the current fiscal year was positively impacted by a loan payoff with a significant unearned discount. Excluding the recognition of income related to this loan payoff, the yield was 7.03% for the year ended September 30, 2012. (4) During the December 2010 quarter end, RJ Bank reclassified certain average loan balances to more closely align these balances with its assignment of credit risk utilized within the allowance for loan losses evaluation. As a result, the average loan balances, related interest income and the respective yield calculations presented above differ from those initially reported. 55 Index Increases and decreases in interest income and interest expense result from changes in average balances (volume) of interest-earning banking assets and liabilities, as well as changes in average interest rates. The following table shows the effect that these factors had on the interest earned on RJ Bank's interest-earning assets and the interest incurred on its interest-bearing liabilities. The effect of changes in volume is determined by multiplying the change in volume by the previous year's average yield/cost. Similarly, the effect of rate changes is calculated by multiplying the change in average yield/cost by the previous year's volume. Changes applicable to both volume and rate have been allocated proportionately.

Subsequent to year end we ceased our operations in Brazil; this is not expected to have a material impact on our financial results. Year ended September 30, 2012 compared to the year ended September 30, 2011 Emerging Markets Pre-tax income in the Emerging Markets segment decreased $12 million, or 256% , as compared to the prior year. Total revenues decreased approximately $19 million as compared to the prior year. Our revenues in this segment have been negatively impacted by market volatility and the reduced level of capital markets activity globally, which has impacted investment banking revenues, securities commissions, and trading profits as compared to the prior year, a period that was experiencing generally improved global market conditions and numerous public offerings. Regulatory changes, particularly in Argentina, had a major impact on our business. Investment banking revenues have decreased by over $15 million, securities commissions and fees have decreased by $3 million and trading profits have decreased by $1 million. The prior year investment banking revenues included $16 million in fees arising from our Argentine joint venture which acted as an advisor to institutional clients in several significant transactions. In the current year, we recognized $3 million of investment banking revenues associated with certain of those advisory services which had been deferred in the prior year pending the satisfaction of certain conditions. Non-interest expenses decreased by $7 million, primarily resulting from a decrease in compensation related expenses resulting from lower levels of revenues and profitability and from a decrease in clearing expenses that results from reduced trading activity. 57 Index Year ended September 30, 2011 compared to the year ended September 30, 2010 Emerging Markets Pre-tax income in the Emerging Markets segment increased $10 million, or 183%, for the year. Net revenues increased by $27 million, or 162%, resulting from increased investment banking fee revenue of $19 million and increased securities commissions and fees of $6 million. The investment banking fee revenues primarily resulted from our Argentine joint venture, which provided advisory services to institutional clients in several significant transactions during the current year. The increase in securities commissions and fees results in large part from successful recruiting efforts by two of our Latin American joint venture entities during fiscal year 2010. Non-interest expenses increased $14 million, or 63%, primarily resulting from higher compensation expense associated with the increased investment banking activity. Results of Operations Securities Lending The following table presents consolidated financial information of our Securities Lending segment for the years indicated: Year ended September 30, 2012 % change 2011 % change 2010 ($ in thousands) Interest income and expense: Interest income $ 9,110 51 % $ 6,035 (29 )% $ 8,448 Interest expense 1,976 9 % 1,807 (49 )% 3,530 Net interest income 7,134 69 % 4,228 (14 )% 4,918 Other income 370 (7 )% 397 2 % 389 Net revenues 7,504 62 % 4,625 (13 )% 5,307 Non-interest expenses 2,845 (9 )% 3,137 21 % 2,586 Pre-tax income $ 4,659 213 % $ 1,488 (45 )% $ 2,721 Year ended September 30, 2012 compared to the year ended September 30, 2011 Securities Lending Pre-tax income generated by this segment increased by approximately $3 million, or 213% , as compared to the prior year. The increase is due to higher net interest income in both our Box lending activities as well as, but to a much lesser extent, our Matched Book lending activities. In the Box lending activities, we realized a net $3 million increase in net interest as net interest spreads increased significantly, more than offsetting a decrease in average balances outstanding. The increase in net interest spread in Box lending activities resulted from our receiving a premium to the market rate on certain hard to locate securities. In the Matched Book lending activities our net interest was relatively unchanged from the prior year level as higher net interest spreads were offset by a decrease in our average balances outstanding. Year ended September 30, 2011 compared to the year ended September 30, 2010 Securities Lending Pre-tax income generated by this segment decreased by $1 million, or 45%, for the year. Net interest income decreased by $700 thousand, or 14%, resulting primarily from decreases in our Box lending activities, but also including to a lesser extent, decreases in our Matched Book activities. In both our Box lending and Matched Book activities, our net interest spread and our average balances outstanding decreased. 58 Index Results of Operations Proprietary Capital The following table presents consolidated financial information for the Proprietary Capital segment for the years indicated: Year ended September 30, 2012 % change 2011 % change 2010 ($ in thousands) Revenues: Interest $ 3,151 566 % $ 473 (76 )% $ 1,953 Investment advisory fees 1,248 31 % 950 (14 )% 1,100 Other 44,476 189 % 15,382 10 % 13,976 Total revenues 48,875 191 % 16,805 (1 )% 17,029 Non-interest expenses: Compensation expense 2,017 (6 )% 2,151 21 % 1,785 Other expenses 3,704 421 % 711 (65 )% 2,051 Total expenses 5,721 100 % 2,862 (25 )% 3,836 Income before taxes and including noncontrolling interests: 43,154 210 % 13,943 6 % 13,193 Noncontrolling interests 27,922 9,552 11,465 Pre-tax income excluding noncontrolling interests $ 15,232 247 % $ 4,391 154 % $ 1,728 The Proprietary Capital segment results are substantially determined by the valuations within Raymond James Capital Partners, L.P. ( Capital Partners ), Raymond James Employee Investment Funds I and II (the EIF Funds ), and the valuations of our direct merchant banking investments and our investments in private equity funds (the Third Party Private Funds ). As a part of the Morgan Keegan acquisition, we acquired various direct and third party private equity and merchant banking investments, employee investment funds and private equity funds of Morgan Keegan which have a fair value of approximately $132 million at September 30, 2012. In addition to those holdings as of September 30, 2012, our merchant banking investments, at fair value, include a $27 million investment in an event photography business (the Event Photography Company ), a $23 million indirect investment (through Capital Partners) in an allergy immunotherapy testing and treatment supply company (the Allergy Company ), a $12 million investment in a manufacturer of crime investigation and forensic supplies (the Forensic Company ), and a $3 million indirect investment in a company pursuing a new concept in the salon services market. Year ended September 30, 2012 compared to the year ended September 30, 2011 Proprietary Capital Pre-tax income generated by this segment increased by approximately $11 million, or 247% , as compared to the prior year. The increase is due to the positive performance of the investments during the current year. In the current year, total revenues resulted primarily from a valuation increase and dividends received from the Allergy Company totaling approximately $30 million, a valuation increase in the Event Photography Company of approximately $6 million, interest, dividends, distributions received and net valuation increases from other investments totaling $12 million, partially offset by a $4 million valuation decrease of the Forensic Company. The portion of this year revenue attributable to noncontrolling interests is significant as approximately $23 million of the Allergy Company valuation increase and dividends received is attributed to others. In comparison, the prior year results consist of the increase in the net valuation of the Third Party Private Funds of $6 million, the increase in revenue pertaining to the Allergy Company of $8 million (which include both dividends received and a valuation increase), a $4 million increase in the value of the Event Photography Company, and $4 million of valuation increases in the EIF Funds, all of which are partially offset by a $5 million write-down in the value of the Forensic Company investment. 59 Index Year ended September 30, 2011 compared to the year ended September 30, 2010 Proprietary Capital Pre-tax income generated by this segment increased by $3 million, or 154%, for the year as compared to the prior year. In the current year, the results consists of the increase in the net valuation of the Third Party Private Funds of $6 million, the increase in revenue pertaining to the Allergy Company of $8 million (which include both dividends received and a valuation increase), a $4 million increase in the value of the Event Photography Company, and $4 million of valuation increases in the EIF Funds, all of which are partially offset by a $5 million write-down in the value of the Forensic Company investment. In the prior year, the revenue arose primarily from the dividends from and valuation investment increase of the Allergy Company of $12 million and valuation increases in the Third Party Private Funds of $3 million. Total expenses have decreased nearly $1 million in the current year as compared to the prior year. The prior year included nearly $2 million of expenses related to due diligence activities which did not recur in the current year. The portion of this year's revenue attributable to noncontrolling interests decreased by nearly $2 million. The majority of the Allergy Company and the EIF Fund investments are held by others; therefore, a reduction in the portion of our revenues attributable to those investments results in a lower attribution of income to others. The revenues from those investments decreased by $3 million in the current year. Results of Operations Other The following table presents consolidated financial information for the Other segment for the years indicated: Year ended September 30, 2012 % change 2011 % change 2010 ($ in thousands) Revenues: Interest income $ 9,875 22 % $ 8,086 29 % $ 6,269 Other 1,925 (21 )% 2,438 36 % 1,787 Total revenues 11,800 12 % 10,524 31 % 8,056 Interest expense 62,349 99 % 31,374 20 % 26,113 Net revenues (50,549 ) (142 )% (20,850 ) (15 )% (18,057 ) Non-interest expenses: Acquisition related expenses 59,284 NM NM Loss on auction rate securities repurchased NM 41,391 NM Other expense 32,119 40 % 22,892 1 % 22,734 Total non-interest expenses 91,403 42 % 64,283 183 % 22,734 Pre-tax loss $ (141,952 ) (67 )% $ (85,133 ) (109 )% $ (40,791 ) Year ended September 30, 2012 compared to the year ended September 30, 2011 Other Pre-tax loss generated by this segment increased by approximately $57 million, or 67% , as compared to the prior year. Interest income is $2 million higher than the prior year primarily resulting from interest income on ARS which we did not own during most of the comparable prior year period. Interest expense increased $31 million over the prior year. The increase is primarily comprised of: $21 million of interest expense resulting from our March 2012 issuances of $350 million 6.9% senior notes and $250 million 5.625% senior notes and $6 million of additional interest expense in the current year associated with our April 2011 issuance of $250 million 4.25% senior notes, and $2 million of interest expense associated with the Regions Credit Agreement (as defined hereinafter in the Sources of Liquidity section of this Item 7). Both of the March 2012 debt offerings and the Regions Credit Agreement were part of our acquisition financing activities and other transactions associated with the Morgan Keegan acquisition. 60 Index The prior year period included a non-recurring $41 million loss on ARS repurchased. Acquisition related expenses, all associated with our acquisition of Morgan Keegan, include approximately $21 million of net severance related expense, $22 million of expense associated with our integration of Morgan Keegan's operations into our own, $7 million of financial advisory fee expenses, $6 million of transaction bridge financing facility expenses, and $2 million of legal expense. We anticipate incurring approximately $40 million of additional acquisition related expenses during our fiscal year 2013 as we continue to implement our integration plans. Other expenses increased $9 million in the current period primarily related to an increase in incentive compensation expense. Year ended September 30, 2011 compared to the year ended September 30, 2010 Other Pre-tax loss generated by this segment increased by $44 million, or 109%, for the year as compared to the prior year. Total revenues in the current year increased by $2 million, or 31%, as compared to the prior year. The revenue increases result primarily from increases in the value of certain investments, some of which were sold during fiscal year 2011 and resulted in realized gains, and an increase in interest income as a result of increases in parent company cash balances. Interest expense in fiscal year 2011 increased $5 million, or 20%, as compared to the prior year primarily as a result of additional interest expense associated with the April 4, 2011 issuance of $250 million of 4.25% senior notes due April, 2016. The segment includes the loss on auction rate securities repurchased. On June 29, 2011, RJ&A and RJFS finalized settlements with the SEC and other regulatory authorities, concluding investigations by the regulators into RJ&A and RJFS's offer and sale of ARS. Under these settlement agreements we extended an offer to purchase at par, from certain current and former clients, eligible ARS that were purchased through RJ&A or RJFS on or before February 13, 2008, provided the eligible ARS were not transferred away from RJ&A or RJFS prior to January 1, 2006 and those securities were held on February 13, 2008. This offer did not extend to clients whose accounts were owned, managed or advised by or through correspondent broker-dealers or unaffiliated investment advisors or who acted as institutional money managers and did not hold ARS in RJ&A or RJFS accounts. This offer remained open for a period of 75 days from the date which we sent the first offer notice to each respective current or former client and has since expired. No fines were imposed by the SEC under the settlement agreement. A fine in the amount of $1.75 million was imposed by the state regulators. As of September 30, 2011, $245 million of par value ARS were purchased from current or former clients as a result of this settlement; $16 million of the purchased ARS were redeemed at par by their issuer subsequent to the purchase and prior to September 30, 2011 (see Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for additional information on our ARS holdings). Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity is essential to our business. The primary goal of our liquidity management activities is to ensure adequate funding to conduct our business over a range of market environments. Senior management establishes our liquidity and capital policies. These policies include senior management review of short- and long-term cash flow forecasts, review of monthly capital expenditures, the monitoring of the availability of alternative sources of financing, and the daily monitoring of liquidity in our significant subsidiaries. Our decisions on the allocation of capital to our business units consider, among other factors, projected profitability and cash flow, risk and impact on future liquidity needs. Our treasury departments assist in evaluating, monitoring and controlling the impact that our business activities have on our financial condition, liquidity and capital structure as well as maintains our relationships with various lenders. The objectives of these policies are to support the successful execution of our business strategies while ensuring ongoing and sufficient liquidity. Liquidity is provided primarily through our business operations and financing activities. Financing activities could include bank borrowings, repurchase agreement transactions or additional capital raising activities under our universal shelf registration statement. 61 Index Cash provided by operating activities during the year ended September 30, 2012, net of the impact of the acquisition of Morgan Keegan, was $391 million . Operating cash generated by successful operating results over the year resulted in a $410 million increase in cash. The increase in operating cash included $890 million as a result of a decreased amount of assets segregated pursuant to regulations and other segregated assets; the lower required amount is primarily due to lower reserve requirements associated with the increased capacity in our bank sweep program resulting in clients moving cash out of the broker-dealer and therefore reducing our reserve requirement, combined with a decrease in the stock loan balance outstanding. A decrease in trading instruments held provided a $103 million increase in operating cash. A decrease in the stock loaned, net of stock borrowed balances resulted in a $358 million use of operating cash, due to a decrease in stock loan demand. A greater increase in our securities purchased under agreements to resell than in our securities sold under agreements to repurchase used $210 million in operating cash. An increase in loans to financial advisors used operating cash. This increase was primarily the result of the $134 million in outstanding loans to Morgan Keegan financial advisors and certain key Morgan Keegan revenue producers as part of an employee retention program. We used $425 million in operating cash as the balances of brokerage client payables and other accounts payable decreased. All other components of operating activities combined to net a $115 million increase in operating cash. Investing activities resulted in the use of $2.7 billion of cash in the year ended September 30, 2012. Cash was used to fund a $1.4 billion increase in bank loans which included the $400 million purchase of Canadian loans. Cash in the net amount of $1.1 billion was used to acquire Morgan Keegan (see Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for further information on this acquisition). We also invested $83 million in private equity investments, $78 million in additions to fixed assets, and $76 million in available for sale securities (primarily held by RJ Bank), net of maturations, redemptions and repayments within that portfolio. We generated $31 million of cash from the redemption of FHLB stock in excess of investments in FRB stock. Financing activities provided $1.9 billion of cash in the year ended September 30, 2012. The cash provided was largely the result of an equity offering which generated $363 million of proceeds and two debt financing transactions which generated approximately $587 million of net proceeds, and a $128 million borrowing, net of repayments, under a new bank facility. We completed these transactions as part of our financing for the acquisition of Morgan Keegan (see the discussion of the impact of the Morgan Keegan acquisition on our liquidity below). In addition to these transactions driven by the Morgan Keegan acquisition, $860 million of cash was generated from increases in RJ Bank customer deposits. We believe our existing assets, most of which are liquid in nature, together with funds generated from operations and committed and uncommitted financing facilities, should provide adequate funds for continuing operations at current levels of activity. Effective with the February, 2012 approval of RJF becoming a financial holding company, we are required to provide certain disclosures including certain Statistical Disclosures by Bank Holding Companies. One of those disclosures is to provide RJF dividend payout ratio, which is as follows for the periods indicated: For the year ended September 30, 2012 2011 2010 RJF dividend payout ratio (1) 24% 24% 24% (1) Computed as dividends declared per common share during the period as a percentage of diluted earnings per common share. Refer to the RJ Bank section of this MD&A and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for the other required disclosures. 62 Index Sources of Liquidity Approximately $539 million of either cash and cash equivalents or other marketable securities was available as of September 30, 2012 without restrictions. The September 30, 2012 balance of cash and cash equivalents held by either RJF or one of its consolidated subsidiaries is as follow: Cash and cash equivalents: September 30, 2012 (in thousands) RJF $ 259,129 RJ&A (1) 286,754 Morgan Keegan & Company, Inc. 247,568 RJ Bank 934,485 Other 252,084 Total cash and cash equivalents $ 1,980,020 (1) RJF has loaned $446 million to RJ&A as of September 30, 2012, a portion of which RJ&A has invested on behalf of RJF in cash and cash equivalents. In addition to the liquidity on hand described above, we have other various potential sources of liquidity which are described below. Liquidity Available from Subsidiaries Liquidity is principally available to the parent company from RJ&A, MK & Co., and RJ Bank. RJ&A is required to maintain net capital equal to the greater of $1 million or 2% of aggregate debit balances arising from customer transactions. Covenants in RJ&A committed secured financing facilities require its net capital to be a minimum of 10% of aggregate debit balances. At September 30, 2012 , RJ&A exceeded both the minimum regulatory and its financing covenants net capital requirements. At that date, RJ&A had excess net capital of approximately $234 million , of which approximately $34 million is available for dividend while still maintaining its desired net capital ratio of 15% of aggregate debit items. There are also limitations on the amount of dividends that may be declared by a broker-dealer without FINRA approval. MK & Co. is also required to maintain net capital equal to the greater of $1 million or 2% of aggregate debit balances arising from customer transactions. At September 30, 2012 , MK & Co. exceeded the minimum regulatory net capital requirements. At that date, MK & Co. had excess net capital of approximately $261 million , of which approximately $201 million is available for dividend while still maintaining its desired net capital ratio of 15% of aggregate debit items. Limitations on the amount of dividends that may be declared by a broker-dealer without FINRA approval also apply to MK & Co. Effective upon its conversion to a national bank, RJ Bank may pay dividends to the parent company without prior approval by its regulator as long as the dividend does not exceed the sum of RJ Bank current calendar year and the previous two calendar years retained net income, and RJ Bank maintains its targeted capital to risk-weighted assets ratios. During the year ended September 30, 2012 , RJ Bank made $75 million in dividend payments to RJF. RJF made capital contributions of $50 million to RJ Bank during the same period. RJ Bank had approximately $117 million of capital in excess of the amount it would need as of September 30, 2012 to maintain its desired total capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 12%. Liquidity available to us from our subsidiaries, other than RJ&A, MK & Co., and RJ Bank, is relatively insignificant and in certain instances may be subject to regulatory requirements. 63 Index Borrowings and Financing Arrangements The following table presents our domestic financing arrangements with third party lenders (other than the Regions Credit Agreement, hereafter defined) that we generally utilize to finance a portion of our fixed income securities trading instruments held, and the outstanding balances related thereto, as of September 30, 2012 : Committed secured (1) Uncommitted secured (1)(2) Uncommitted unsecured (1)(2) Total Financing Amount Outstanding balance Financing Amount Outstanding balance Financing Amount Outstanding balance Financing Amount Outstanding balance ($ in thousands) RJ&A $ 335,000 $ 75,000 $ 2,150,000 $ 131,761 $ 375,000 $ $ 2,860,000 $ 206,761 MK & Co. 40,000 40,000 RJF 100,000 100,000 Total $ 335,000 $ 75,000 $ 2,150,000 $ 131,761 $ 515,000 $ $ 3,000,000 $ 206,761 Total number of agreements 3 7 8 18 (1) Our ability to borrow is dependent upon compliance with the conditions in the various committed loan agreements and collateral eligibility requirements. (2) Lenders are under no contractual obligation to lend to us under uncommitted credit facilities. The committed domestic financing arrangements are in the form of either tri-party repurchase agreements or a secured line of credit. The uncommitted domestic financing arrangements are in the form of secured lines of credit, secured bilateral or tri-party repurchase agreements, or unsecured lines of credit. We maintain three unsecured settlement lines of credit available to our Argentine joint venture in the aggregate amount of $13 million. Of the aggregate amount, one settlement line for $9 million is guaranteed by RJF. There were no borrowings outstanding on any of these lines of credit as of September 30, 2012 . RJ Bank has $965 million in immediate credit available from the FHLB on September 30, 2012 and total available credit of 30% of total assets, with the pledge of additional collateral to the FHLB. RJ Bank is eligible to participate in the Fed discount-window program; however, RJ Bank does not view borrowings from the Fed as a primary means of funding. The credit available in this program is subject to periodic review and may be terminated or reduced at the discretion of the Fed. From time to time we purchase short-term securities under agreements to resell ( Reverse Repurchase Agreements ) and sell securities under agreements to repurchase ( Repurchase Agreements ). We account for each of these types of transactions as collateralized financings with the outstanding balances on the Repurchase Agreements included in securities sold under agreements to repurchase. At September 30, 2012 , collateralized financings outstanding in the amount of $348 million are included in securities sold under agreements to repurchase on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. Of this total, outstanding balances on the committed and uncommitted Repurchase Agreements (which are reflected in the table of domestic financing arrangements above) were $75 million and $132 million , respectively, as of September 30, 2012 . Such financings are generally collateralized by non-customer, RJ&A or MK & Co. owned securities. The required market value of the collateral associated with the committed secured facilities ranges from 102% to 133% of the amount financed. 64 Index The average daily balance outstanding during the five most recent successive quarters, the maximum month-end balance outstanding during the quarter and the period end balances for Repurchase Agreements and Reverse Repurchase Agreements of RJF are as follows: Repurchase transactions Reverse repurchase transactions For the quarter ended: Average daily balance outstanding Maximum month-end balance outstanding during the quarter End of period balance outstanding Average daily balance outstanding Maximum month-end balance outstanding during the quarter End of period balance outstanding (in thousands) September 30, 2012 $ 346,654 $ 349,495 $ 348,036 $ 600,959 $ 588,740 $ 565,016 June 30, 2012 411,238 506,618 506,618 660,983 748,569 706,713 March 31, 2012 180,875 176,335 137,026 410,578 413,527 340,158 December 31, 2011 184,925 244,961 184,061 433,170 468,848 400,455 September 30, 2011 145,574 290,686 188,745 425,248 446,314 398,247 At September 30, 2012, in addition to the financing arrangements described above, we had corporate debt of $1.3 billion . The balance is comprised of $350 million outstanding on our 6.90% senior notes due 2042, $249 million outstanding on our 5.625% senior notes due 2024, $300 million outstanding on our 8.60% senior notes due August 2019, $250 million outstanding on our 4.25% senior notes due April 2016, $128 million of outstanding borrowings on the Regions Credit Agreement (see discussion below), $49 million outstanding on a mortgage loan for our home-office complex, and $3 million outstanding on term loan financing provided to RJES. On April 2, 2012, certain non-broker-dealer subsidiaries of RJF (the Borrowers ) entered into a credit agreement (the Regions Credit Agreement ) with Regions Bank (the Lender ) which provided for a $200 million loan made by the Lender to the Borrowers. The proceeds from the loan were disbursed to us for working capital and general corporate purposes. The borrowings are secured by, subject to certain exceptions, all the personal property of the Borrowers including (i) all present and future ARS owned by the Borrowers (the Pledged ARS ), (ii) all equity interests issued by the Borrowers, and (iii) all present and future equity interests and debt securities owned by the Borrowers. The loan matures on April 2, 2015 . Primarily as a result of redemptions during the last six months of the year by certain issuers of Pledged ARS and distributions received from certain private equity investments and the resultant repayments to the Lender, the outstanding principal balance on the Regions Credit Agreement as of September 30, 2012 was $128 million . On November 14, 2012, the outstanding balance on the Regions Credit Agreement was repaid, and on that same date, one of the Borrowers (the Borrower ) entered into a new Revolving Credit Agreement (the New Regions Credit Agreement ) with the Lender. The New Regions Credit Agreement provides for a revolving line of credit to be made available by the Lender to the Borrower and is subject to a guarantee in favor of the Lender provided by RJF. The proceeds from any borrowings under the line will be used for working capital and general corporate purposes. The obligations under the New Regions Credit Agreement are secured by, subject to certain exceptions, all of the Pledged ARS. The amount of any borrowing under the New Regions Credit Agreement cannot exceed 70% of the value of the Pledged ARS. The maximum amount available under the New Regions Credit Agreement was $97.7 million as of November 16, 2012. The New Regions Credit Agreement expires on April 2, 2015. Our current senior long-term debt ratings are: Rating Agency Rating Outlook S&P BBB Negative Moody Investor Service ( Moody ) Baa2 Stable In January 2012, in response to our announcement regarding RJF entering into a definitive stock purchase agreement to acquire Morgan Keegan (see further discussion in Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K), both S&P and Moody placed RJF on review for possible downgrade. The S&P rating and outlook reflected above are as presented in their March, 2012 report which concluded no change in the rating, removed us from credit watch with negative implications, but assigned a less favorable outlook of negative, a change from stable, which had been reflected in their previous report. S & P less favorable outlook is based upon their concern about certain risks associated with our integration of Morgan Keegan. The Moody rating and outlook reflected above are from their April, 2012 report, which concluded no change in the rating and an improved outlook to stable from ratings under review for possible downgrade. 65 Index We believe our current long-term debt ratings depend upon a number of factors including industry dynamics, operating and economic environment, operating results, operating margins, earnings trends and volatility, balance sheet composition, liquidity and liquidity management, our capital structure, our overall risk management, business diversification and our market share, the success of our integration of Morgan Keegan, and competitive position in the markets in which we operate. Deteriorations in any of these factors could impact our credit ratings. Any rating downgrades could increase our costs in the event we were to pursue obtaining additional financing. Should our credit rating be downgraded prior to a public debt offering it is probable that we would have to offer a higher rate of interest to bond holders. A downgrade to below investment grade may make a public debt offering difficult to execute on terms we would consider to be favorable. The Regions Credit Agreement included, and the New Regions Credit Agreement includes, as an event of default, the failure of RJF as a guarantor of the repayment of the loan, to maintain an investment grade rating on its unsecured senior debt. Otherwise, none of our credit agreements contain a condition or event of default related to our credit ratings. A downgrade below investment grade could also result in the termination of certain derivative contracts and the counterparties to the derivative instruments could request immediate payment or demand immediate and ongoing overnight collateralization on our derivative instruments in liability positions (see Note 18 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for additional information). A credit downgrade could create a reputational issue and could also result in certain counterparties limiting their business with us, result in negative comments by analysts and potentially impact investor perception of us, and resultantly impact our stock price and/or our clients perception of us. Other sources of liquidity We own life insurance policies which are utilized to fund certain non-qualified deferred compensation plans and other employee benefit plans. The policies which we could readily borrow against have a cash surrender value of approximately $143 million as of September 30, 2012 and we are able to borrow up to 90%, or $128 million of the September 30, 2012 total, without restriction. There are no borrowings outstanding against any of these policies as of September 30, 2012. On May 24, 2012 we filed a universal shelf registration statement with the SEC to be in a position to access the capital markets if and when necessary or perceived by us to be opportune. In August 2009, we sold $300 million in aggregate principal amount of 8.60% senior notes due in August 2019, through a registered underwritten public offering. In April 2011, we sold $250 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.25% senior notes due April 2016, through a registered underwritten public offering. In February 2012, we sold 11,075,000 shares of our common stock generating net proceeds of $363 million. In March 2012, we sold $350 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.90% senior notes due in March 2042 and $250 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.625% senior notes due April 2024, through registered underwritten public offerings. See the contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies section below for information regarding our commitments. Impact of the Morgan Keegan acquisition transactions on our liquidity As more fully described in Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K, on January 11, 2012, RJF entered into the SPA to acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of Morgan Keegan from Regions. In anticipation of the closing of this transaction during February and March 2012, we sold shares of our common stock and senior notes, which combined generated approximately $950 million in net proceeds. On April 2, 2012, we completed the purchase transaction. Under the terms of the SPA, Regions received $1.211 billion in cash from RJF on April 2, 2012 in exchange for 100% of the Morgan Keegan shares. Subsequent to the completion of this purchase transaction on April 2, 2012, Morgan Keegan paid a $250 million dividend to RJF. On April 2, 2012, RJF received $200 million in proceeds from borrowings on the Regions Credit Agreement; the outstanding balance has subsequently been reduced to $128 million as of September 30, 2012 primarily as a result of redemptions of Pledged ARS and distributions received from certain private equity investments. In addition to these April 2, 2012 transactions, during the month of April, 2012 we made cash retention payments of approximately $136 million to certain key Morgan Keegan financial advisors. In August 2012, we received $23 million from Regions as a result of the determination of the final Closing Date tangible book value of Morgan Keegan. We have incurred acquisition and integration charges associated with this purchase, a significant portion of which was incurred and paid during the last six months of the year ended September 30, 2012 with the remaining portion, estimated to be approximately $40 million, to be incurred and paid during fiscal year 2013. In addition to customary indemnity for breaches of representations and warranties and covenants, the SPA also provides that Regions will indemnify RJF for losses incurred in connection with any litigation or similar matter related to pre-closing actions. As a result of these indemnifications, we do not anticipate the resolution of any pre-Closing Date Morgan Keegan litigation matters to negatively impact our liquidity (see Note 3 and Note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, and Part I Item 3 - Legal Proceedings, in this Form 10-K for further information regarding the indemnifications and the nature of the pre-Closing Date matters). 66 Index Statement of financial condition analysis The assets on our statement of financial condition consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents (a large portion of which is segregated for the benefit of customers), receivables including bank loans, financial instruments held for either trading purposes or as investments, and other assets. A significant portion of our assets are liquid in nature, providing us with flexibility in financing our business. Total assets of $21.2 billion at September 30, 2012 are approximately $3.2 billion , or 18% , greater than our total assets as of September 30, 2011 . The increase in total assets results primarily from our April 2, 2012 acquisition of Morgan Keegan, in which we acquired gross assets of approximately $3.1 billion (see Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for further information regarding this acquisition). In addition to the increase in assets resulting from the Morgan Keegan acquisition, which impacts most of the asset balances reflected on our consolidated statements of financial condition, we have had a significant increase in net bank loans receivable since September 30, 2011 due to $1.4 billion in growth of RJ Bank net loan portfolio during the year that included a $400 million purchase of Canadian loans. As of September 30, 2012 , our liabilities of $17.5 billion were $2.4 billion , or 16% greater than our liabilities as of September 30, 2011 . The increase in liabilities is primarily due to the Morgan Keegan acquisition in which we assumed $1.9 billion of liabilities as of the Closing Date, and two March 2012 debt financing transactions totaling approximately $600 million which were components of our Morgan Keegan acquisition financing strategy. Contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies We have contractual obligations to make future payments in connection with debt, non-cancelable lease agreements, partnership and limited liability company investments, commitments to extend credit, underwriting commitments and a naming rights agreement. The following table sets forth these contractual obligations by fiscal year: Fiscal year Total 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 Thereafter (in thousands) Corporate debt (1) $ 1,329,093 $ 6,517 $ 3,860 $ 132,342 $ 253,970 $ 4,578 $ 927,826 Interest on debt (1) 1,104,470 74,833 74,638 74,638 74,637 64,012 741,712 Loans payable of consolidated variable interest entities (2) 81,713 18,775 19,061 17,949 13,331 8,240 4,357 Operating leases 409,618 75,289 66,630 60,470 53,557 42,283 111,389 Investments - private equity partnerships 56,432 56,432 Certificates of deposit (3) 318,879 56,382 40,909 70,117 63,340 88,131 Commitments to extend credit - RJ Bank (4) 2,526,840 2,526,840 RJ Bank loans purchased, not yet settled 46,510 46,510 Commitments to real estate entities 3,122 3,122 Commitment to purchase real estate in Pasco County, Florida (5) 3,500 3,500 Underwriting commitments 9,156 9,156 Naming rights for Raymond James stadium 13,018 3,835 3,988 4,148 1,047 Loans and commitments to financial advisors 25,599 19,423 3,559 944 1,294 100 279 Total $ 5,927,950 $ 2,900,614 $ 212,645 $ 360,608 $ 461,176 $ 207,344 $ 1,785,563 (1) See Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for additional information.

As of September 30, 2012 , we have invested approximately $39 million. The use of this capital is subject to availability of funds. These activities may be impacted by regulations resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act. However, since the regulations have yet to be adopted, any impact is uncertain. Our Board of Directors has also approved up to $200 million in short-term special situations and bridge investments, primarily related to investment banking transactions. As of September 30, 2012 , we did not have any such investments. We are authorized by the Board of Directors to repurchase our common stock for general corporate purposes. There is no formal stock repurchase plan at this time. From time to time our Board of Directors has authorized specific dollar amounts for repurchases at the discretion of our Board's Securities Repurchase Committee. As of September 30, 2012 the unused portion of the current authorization was $41 million. We are the lessor in a leveraged commercial aircraft transaction with Continental Airlines, Inc., now known as United Continental ( Continental ). Our ability to realize our expected return is dependent upon this airline's ability to fulfill its lease obligation. In the event that this airline defaults on its lease commitment and the Trustee for the debt holders is unable to re-lease or sell the plane with adequate terms, we would suffer a loss of some or all of our investment. The net value of our leveraged lease with Continental is approximately $10 million as of September 30, 2012 and is included in other assets on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. This lease expires in 2014. In the normal course of business, certain subsidiaries of ours act as general partner and may be contingently liable for activities of various limited partnerships. These partnerships engage primarily in real estate activities. In our opinion, such liabilities, if any, for the obligations of the partnerships will not in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position. Regulatory RJ&A, MK & Co., RJFS, Eagle Fund Distributors, Inc. and Raymond James (USA) Ltd. all had net capital in excess of minimum requirements as of September 30, 2012 . RJ Ltd. was not in Early Warning Level 1 or Level 2 as of or during the year ended September 30, 2012 . During January 2012, RJF application to become a bank holding company and a financial holding company was approved by the Fed, and RJ Bank conversion to a national bank was approved by the OCC. These changes became effective February 1, 2012. We converted to a bank holding company in order to provide RJ Bank the ability to maintain a portfolio with a greater percentage of its assets invested in corporate loans than were otherwise permissible under the thrift regulations RJ Bank was previously subject to. As a thrift, RJ Bank was required to make qualifying investments annually in order to meet the point in time QTL test. As a national bank, RJ Bank will not have to make such qualifying investments in order to maintain regulatory compliance. We currently invest in selected private equity and merchant banking investments (see the Proprietary Capital section of MD&A). As a financial holding company, the magnitude of such investments will be subject to certain limitations. At our current investment levels, we do not anticipate having to make any otherwise unplanned divestitures of these investments in order to comply with regulatory limits; however, the amount of future investments may be limited in order to maintain compliance within regulatory specified levels. As a result of our conversion, we are now subject to additional regulatory reporting requirements which add to our administrative workload and costs. The maintenance of certain risk-based regulatory capital levels could impact various capital allocation decisions impacting one or more of our businesses. However, due to our strong capital position, we do not anticipate these capital requirements will have any negative impact on our future business activities. 68 Index RJ Bank is subject to various regulatory and capital requirements administered by bank regulators. See the Item 1 Business, Regulation section in this Form 10-K, for a discussion of the regulatory environment in which RJ Bank operates. Under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, RJ Bank met the requirements to be categorized as well capitalized as of September 30, 2012 . One of RJ Bank's U.S. subsidiaries is an agreement corporation and is subject to regulation by the Fed. As of September 30, 2012 , this RJ Bank subsidiary met the capital adequacy guideline requirements. The Dodd-Frank Act has the potential to impact certain of our current business operations, including, but not limited to, its impact on RJ Bank which is discussed in the Item 1 Business, Regulation section in this Form 10-K. Because of the nature of our business and our business practices, we do not expect the Dodd-Frank Act to have a significant impact on our operations as a whole. However, because many of the implementing regulations will result from further studies by various regulatory agencies, the specific impact on each of our businesses is uncertain. See Note 25 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for further information on regulatory and capital requirements. Critical accounting estimates The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. For a description of our accounting policies, see Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. We believe that of our significant accounting estimates, those described below involve a high degree of judgment and complexity. These estimates and assumptions affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses reported in the consolidated financial statements. Due to their nature, estimates involve judgment based upon available information. Actual results or amounts could differ from estimates and the difference could have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. Therefore, understanding these critical accounting estimates is important in understanding the reported results of our operations and our financial position. Valuation of financial instruments, investments and other assets The use of fair value to measure financial instruments, with related gains or losses recognized in our Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income, is fundamental to our financial statements and our risk management processes. Trading instruments and available for sale securities are reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value. Unrealized gains and losses related to these financial instruments are reflected in our net income or our other comprehensive income, depending on the underlying purpose of the instrument. We measure the fair value of our financial instruments in accordance with GAAP, which defines fair value, establishes a framework that we use to measure fair value and provides for certain disclosures we provide about our fair value measurements included in our financial statements. Refer to Notes 5 and 6 in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for these disclosures. Fair value is defined by GAAP as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between willing market participants on the measurement date. We determine the fair values of our financial instruments and any other assets and liabilities required by GAAP to be recognized at fair value in the financial statements as of the close of business of each financial statement reporting period. These fair value determination processes also apply to any of our impairment tests or assessments performed for nonfinancial instruments such as goodwill, identifiable intangible assets, certain real estate owned and other long-lived assets. In determining fair value in accordance with GAAP, we use various valuation approaches, including market and/or income approaches. Fair value is a market-based measure considered from the perspective of a market participant. As such, even when assumptions of market participants are not readily available, our own assumptions reflect those that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. GAAP provides for the following three levels to be used to classify our fair value measurements: Level 1-Financial instruments included in Level 1 are highly liquid instruments with quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. These include equity securities traded in active markets and certain U. S. Treasury securities, other governmental obligations, or publicly traded corporate debt securities. 69 Index Level 2-Financial instruments reported in Level 2 include those that have pricing inputs that are other than quoted prices in active markets, but which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date (i.e., prices for similar instruments). Instruments that are generally included in this category are equity securities that are not actively traded, corporate obligations infrequently traded, certain government and municipal obligations, interest rate swaps, certain asset-backed securities ( ABS ), certain CMO's, certain MBS, and our derivative instruments. Level 3-Financial instruments reported in Level 3 have little, if any, market activity and are measured using our best estimate of fair value, where the inputs into the determination of fair value are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable. These valuations require significant judgment or estimation. Instruments in this category generally include: equity securities with unobservable inputs such as those investments made in our proprietary capital segment, certain non-agency CMOs, certain non-agency ABS, pools of interest-only SBA loan strips ( I/O Strips ) and certain municipal and corporate obligations which include ARS. GAAP requires that we maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when performing our fair value measurements. The availability of observable inputs can vary from instrument to instrument and in certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, an instrument's level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement of an instrument requires judgment and consideration of factors specific to the instrument. Valuation techniques The fair value for certain of our financial instruments is derived using pricing models and other valuation techniques that involve significant management judgment. The price transparency of financial instruments is a key determinant of the degree of judgment involved in determining the fair value of our financial instruments. Financial instruments for which actively quoted prices or pricing parameters are available will generally have a higher degree of price transparency than financial instruments that are thinly traded or not quoted. In accordance with GAAP, the criteria used to determine whether the market for a financial instrument is active or inactive is based on the particular asset or liability. For equity securities, our definition of actively traded is based on average daily volume and other market trading statistics. We have determined the market for certain other types of financial instruments, including certain CMOs, ABS, certain collateralized debt obligations and ARS, to be volatile, uncertain or inactive as of both September 30, 2012 and 2011 . As a result, the valuation of these financial instruments included significant management judgment in determining the relevance and reliability of market information available. We considered the inactivity of the market to be evidenced by several factors, including a continued decreased price transparency caused by decreased volume of trades relative to historical levels, stale transaction prices and transaction prices that varied significantly either over time or among market makers. The specific valuation techniques utilized for the categorization of financial instruments presented in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition are described below. Trading instruments and trading instruments sold but not yet purchased Trading securities Trading securities are comprised primarily of the financial instruments held by our broker-dealer subsidiaries (see Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for more information). When available, we use quoted prices in active markets to determine the fair value of these securities. Such instruments are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Examples include exchange traded equity securities and liquid government debt securities. When instruments are traded in secondary markets and quoted market prices do not exist for such securities, we utilize valuation techniques, including matrix pricing, to estimate fair value. Matrix pricing generally utilizes spread-based models periodically re-calibrated to observable inputs such as market trades, or to dealer price bids in similar securities in order to derive the fair value of the instruments. Valuation techniques may also rely on other observable inputs such as yield curves, interest rates and expected principal repayments, and default probabilities. Instruments valued using these inputs are typically classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. We utilize prices from independent services to corroborate our estimate of fair value. Depending upon the type of security, the pricing service may provide a listed price, a matrix price, or use other methods including broker-dealer price quotations. 70 Index Positions in illiquid securities that do not have readily determinable fair values require significant judgment or estimation. For these securities, which include ARS, we use pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques. Assumptions utilized by these techniques include estimates of future delinquencies, loss severities, defaults and prepayments. Securities valued using these techniques are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. For certain CMOs, where there has been limited activity or less transparency around significant inputs to the valuation, such as assumptions regarding performance of the underlying mortgages, these securities are currently classified as Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. I/O Strip securities do not trade in an active market with readily observable prices. Accordingly, we use valuation techniques that consider a number of factors including: (a) the original cost of the pooled underlying SBA loans from which the I/O Strip securities were created, and any changes from the original to the hypothetical cost of buying similar loans under current market conditions; (b) seasoning of the underlying SBA loans in the pool that back the I/O strip securities; (c) the type and nature of the pooled SBA loans backing the I/O Strip securities; (d) actual and assumed prepayment rates on the underlying pools of SBA loans; and (e) market data for past trades in comparable I/O Strip securities. Prices from independent sources are used to corroborate our estimates of fair value. Our I/O Strip securities are recorded in other securities within our trading instruments on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. These fair value measurements use significant unobservable inputs and accordingly, we classify them as Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Derivatives In our pre-Morgan Keegan acquisition fixed income business, we entered into interest rate swaps and futures contracts either as part of our fixed income business to facilitate customer transactions, to hedge a portion of our trading inventory, or to a limited extent, for our own account. We have continued to conduct this business in a substantially similar fashion subsequent to the Closing Date of the Morgan Keegan acquisition. See Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for more information. Fair values for the interest rate derivative contracts arising from our legacy operations are obtained from internal pricing models that consider current market trading levels and the contractual prices for the underlying financial instruments, as well as time value, yield curve and other volatility factors underlying the positions. Since our model inputs can be observed in a liquid market and the models do not require significant judgment, such derivative contracts are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. We utilize values obtained from third party counterparty derivatives dealers to corroborate the output of our internal pricing models. The fair value of any cash collateral exchanged as part of the interest rate swap contract is netted, by counterparty, against the fair value of the derivative instrument. Morgan Keegan facilitates derivative transactions through non-broker-dealer subsidiaries, either Morgan Keegan Financial Products, LLC or Morgan Keegan Capital Services, LLC (collectively referred to as the Morgan Keegan swaps subsidiaries or MKSS ). The only difference between the MKSS entities is that they utilize different third party financial institutions to facilitate the offsetting transaction. MKSS enters into derivative transactions (primarily interest rate swaps) with customers of MK & Co. For every derivative transaction MKSS enters into with a customer, it enters into an offsetting transaction with terms that mirror the customer transaction, with a credit support provider who is a third party financial institution. We record the value of each derivative position held at fair value, as either an asset or an offsetting liability, presented as derivative instruments associated with offsetting matched book positions , as applicable, on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. Fair value is determined using an internal model which includes inputs from independent pricing sources to project future cash flows under each underlying derivative contract. The cash flows are discounted to determine the present value. Since any changes in fair value are completely offset by an opposite change in the offsetting transaction position, there is no net impact on our Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income from changes in the fair value of these derivative instruments. A Canadian subsidiary of RJ Bank commenced operations during the year ended September 30, 2012 as a result of a purchase of substantially all of a foreign bank Canadian corporate loan portfolio. RJ Bank enters into three month forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the risk related to their investment in this Canadian subsidiary. These derivatives are recorded at fair value on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition, the majority of which are designated as net investment hedges. 71 Index Available for sale securities Available for sale securities are comprised primarily of MBS, CMOs or other mortgage-related debt securities held predominately by RJ Bank (the RJ Bank AFS Securities ) and ARS held by a non-broker-dealer subsidiary of RJF (collectively referred to as the RJF AFS Securities ). Debt and equity securities classified as available for sale are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of deferred taxes, recorded through other comprehensive income and thereafter presented in shareholders' equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income ( AOCI ) unless the loss is considered to be other-than-temporary, in which case the related credit loss portion is recognized as a loss in other revenue. Realized gains and losses on sales of such securities are recognized using the specific identification method and reflected in other revenue in the period they are sold. The fair value of agency and senior non-agency securities included within the RJ Bank AFS Securities is determined by obtaining third party pricing service bid quotations from two independent pricing services. Third party pricing service bid quotations are based on either current market data, or for any securities traded in markets where the trading activity has slowed significantly such as the CMO market, the most recently available market data. The third party pricing services provide comparable price evaluations utilizing available market data for similar securities. The market data the third party pricing services utilize for these price evaluations includes observable data comprised of benchmark yields, reported trades, broker-dealer quotes, issuer spreads, two-sided markets, benchmark securities, bids, offers, reference data including market research publications, and loan performance experience. In order to validate that the pricing information used by the primary third party pricing service is observable, we request, on a quarterly basis, some of the key market data available for a sample of senior securities and compare this data to that which we observed in our independent accumulation of market information. Securities valued using these valuation techniques are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. For senior non-agency securities within the RJ Bank AFS Securities where a significant difference exists between the primary third party pricing service bid quotation and the secondary third party pricing service, we utilize a discounted cash flow analysis to determine which third party price quote is most representative of fair value under the current market conditions. The fair values for all senior non-agency securities at September 30, 2012 were based on the respective primary third party pricing service bid quotation. Securities measured using these valuation techniques are generally classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. ARS are long-term variable rate securities tied to short-term interest rates that were intended to be reset through a Dutch auction process, which generally occurs every seven to 35 days. Holders of ARS were previously able to liquidate their holdings to prospective buyers by participating in the auctions. During 2008, the Dutch auction process failed and holders were no longer able to liquidate their holdings through the auction process. The fair value of the ARS holdings is estimated based on internal pricing models. The pricing model takes into consideration the characteristics of the underlying securities, as well as multiple inputs including the issuer and its credit quality, data from any recent trades, the expected timing of redemptions and an estimated yield premium that a market participant would require over otherwise comparable securities to compensate for the illiquidity of the ARS. These inputs require significant management judgment and, accordingly, these securities are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. For any RJF ARS Securities in an unrealized loss position at the reporting period end, we make an assessment whether these securities are impaired on an other-than-temporary basis. In order to evaluate our risk exposure and any potential impairment of these securities, on at least a quarterly basis, we review the characteristics of each security owned such as collateral type, delinquency and foreclosure levels, credit enhancement, projected loan losses, collateral coverage and presence of U.S. government or government agency guarantees. The following factors are considered to determine whether an impairment is other-than-temporary: our intention to sell the security, our assessment of whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before the recovery of its amortized cost basis, and whether the evidence indicating that we will recover the amortized cost basis of a security in full outweighs evidence to the contrary. Evidence considered in this assessment includes the reasons for the impairment, the severity and duration of the impairment, changes in value subsequent to period end, recent events specific to the issuer or industry, forecasted performance of the security, and any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency. Securities on which there is an unrealized loss that is deemed to be other-than-temporary are written-down to fair value with the credit loss portion of the write-down recorded as a realized loss in other revenue and the non-credit portion of the write-down recorded net of deferred taxes in other comprehensive income and are thereafter presented in equity as a component of AOCI. The credit loss portion of the write-down is the difference between the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis of the security. The previous amortized cost basis of the security less the other-than-temporary impairment recognized in earnings establishes the new cost basis for the security. 72 Index We estimate the portion of loss attributable to credit using a discounted cash flow model. For RJ Bank AFS Securities, our discounted cash flow model utilizes relevant assumptions such as prepayment rate, default rate, and loss severity on a loan level basis. These assumptions are subject to change depending on a number of factors such as economic conditions, changes in home prices, and delinquency and foreclosure statistics, among others. Events that may trigger material declines in fair values or additional credit losses for these securities in the future would include, but are not limited to, deterioration of credit metrics, significantly higher levels of default and severity of loss on the underlying collateral, deteriorating credit enhancement and loss coverage ratios, or further illiquidity. Private equity investments Private equity investments, held primarily by our Proprietary Capital segment, consist of various direct and third party private equity and merchant banking investments. The valuation of these investments requires significant management judgment due to the absence of quoted market prices, inherent lack of liquidity and long-term nature of these assets. As a result, these values cannot be determined with precision and the calculated fair value estimates may not be realizable in a current sale or immediate settlement of the instrument. Direct private equity investments are valued initially at the transaction price until significant transactions or developments indicate that a change in the carrying values of these investments is appropriate. The carrying values of these investments are adjusted based on financial performance, investment-specific events, financing and sales transactions with third parties and discounted cash flow models incorporating changes in market outlook. Investments in funds structured as limited partnerships are generally valued based on the financial statements of the partnerships. Investments valued using these valuation techniques are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Other investments Other investments consist primarily of marketable securities we hold that are associated with an MK & Co. deferred compensation program, Canadian government bonds, term deposits with Canadian financial institutions, or investments in other securities arising from the operations of RJ Ltd, and certain investments in limited partnerships (or funds) for which in a number of instances, one of our affiliates serves as the managing member or general partner (see Note 11 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for information regarding such funds). Certain MK & Co. employees participate in deferred compensation plans. The balances are invested in certain marketable securities that are held by MK & Co. until the vesting date, typically five years from the date of the deferral. We use quoted prices in active markets to determine the fair value of these investments. Such instruments are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. The Canadian government bonds are measured at fair value with any changes recognized in our Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income for the period. The fair value is based upon recent external market transactions. The Canadian financial institution term deposits are recorded at cost, which approximates market value. These investments are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Level 3 assets and liabilities As of September 30, 2012 , 13% of our total assets and 4% of our total liabilities are instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis categorized as Level 3 amount to $581 million as of September 30, 2012 and represent 22% of our assets measured at fair value. Our private equity investments comprise $337 million , or 58% , and our ARS positions comprise $234 million , or 40% , of the Level 3 assets as of September 30, 2012 . Level 3 assets represent 15.8% of total equity as of September 30, 2012 . Financial instruments which are liabilities categorized as Level 3 amount to $98 thousand as of September 30, 2012 and represent less than 1% of liabilities measured at fair value. See Notes 5, 6 and 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for additional information on our financial instruments. 73 Index Goodwill Goodwill involves the application of significant management judgment. Of our total goodwill of $300 million , $228 million arose from our current year acquisition of Morgan Keegan (see Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for further information regarding the Morgan Keegan acquisition), $33 million arose from our acquisition of Goepel McDermid, Inc. (now RJ Ltd.) which occurred during fiscal year 2001, $30 million arose from our acquisition of Roney & Co. (now part of RJ&A) which occurred during fiscal year 1999, $7 million arose from our increased share of ownership in RJES which occurred in April 2011, and $2 million arose from our acquisition of Howe Barnes which also occurred in April 2011. This goodwill was allocated to reporting units; $173 million is included in the PCG segment and $127 million is included in the Capital Markets segment. We perform goodwill testing on an annual basis or when an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. We performed our annual goodwill impairment testing as of December 31, 2011 . We elected to perform a qualitative assessment for each reporting unit that includes an allocation of goodwill to determine whether it is more likely than not that the carrying value of such reporting unit including the recorded goodwill is in excess of the fair value of the reporting unit. In any instance in which we were unable to qualitatively conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit's carrying value including goodwill, a quantitative analysis of the fair value of the reporting unit was performed. Based upon the outcome of our qualitative assessment, we determined that no quantitative analysis of the fair value of any reporting unit as of December 31, 2011 was required, with the exception of our RJES reporting unit. For the RJES reporting unit, an income approach valuation model was updated as of December 31, 2011 to assess the fair value of the reporting unit to compare to the carrying value of the reporting unit including the recorded goodwill. Based upon the outcome of all the qualitative assessments and quantitative analyses performed, we concluded that none of the goodwill allocated to any of our reporting units was impaired as of December 31, 2011 . No events have occurred since December 31, 2011 that would cause us to update the annual impairment testing we performed as of that date. Loss provisions Loss provisions arising from legal proceedings We recognize liabilities for contingencies when there is an exposure that, when fully analyzed, indicates it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. The estimated range of possible loss is based upon currently available information and is subject to significant judgment, a variety of assumptions, and uncertainties. When a range of possible loss can be estimated, we accrue the most likely amount of possible loss within that range; if the most likely amount within that range is not determinable, we accrue a minimum based on the range of possible loss. No liability is recognized for those matters which, in management's judgment, the determination of a reasonable estimate of loss is not possible. We record liabilities related to legal proceedings in trade and other payables within our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. The determination of whether a loss is probable, and if so the possible loss amount, requires significant judgment. We consider many factors including, but not limited to: the amount of the claim; the amount of the loss in the client's account; the basis and validity of the claim; the possibility of wrongdoing on the part of one of our employees; previous results in similar cases; and legal precedents and case law. Each legal proceeding is reviewed with counsel in each accounting period and the liability is adjusted as we consider appropriate. Any change in the liability amount is recorded in the consolidated financial statements and is recognized as either a charge or a credit to net income in that period. The actual costs of resolving legal proceedings may be substantially higher or lower than the recorded liability amounts for those matters. We expense our cost of defense related to such matters in the period they are incurred. Loss provisions arising from operations of our Broker-Dealers We offer loans to financial advisors and certain key revenue producers, primarily for recruiting and retention purposes. These loans are generally repaid over a five to eight year period with interest recognized as earned. There is no fee income associated with these loans. We assess future recoverability of these loans through analysis of individual financial advisor production or other performance standards. In the event that the financial advisor is no longer affiliated with us, any unpaid balance of such loan becomes immediately due and payable to us. In determining the allowance for doubtful accounts from former employees or independent contractors, management considers a number of factors including; any amounts due at termination, the reasons for the terminated relationship, the former financial advisor's overall financial position, and our historical collection experience. When the review of these factors indicates that further collection activity is highly unlikely, the outstanding balances of such loans are written off and the corresponding allowance is reduced. 74 Index We also record reserves or allowances for doubtful accounts related to client receivables. Client receivables at our broker-dealer subsidiaries are generally collateralized by securities owned by the brokerage clients. Therefore, when a receivable is considered to be impaired, the amount of the impairment is generally measured based on the fair value of the securities acting as collateral, which is measured based on current prices from independent sources such as listed market prices or broker-dealer price quotations. Loan loss provisions arising from operations of RJ Bank RJ Bank provides an allowance for loan losses which reflects our continuing evaluation of the probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio. Refer to Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this form 10-K for discussion of RJ Bank's policies regarding the allowance for loan losses, and refer to Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for quantitative information regarding the allowance balances as of September 30, 2012 . The current year's provision for loan losses includes $4 million resulting from the impact of our internal corporate loan classification changes as a result of the banking regulators' annual Shared National Credit ( SNC ) examination. The impact of the SNC exam results from differences in judgment applicable to a limited number of the credits reviewed in the annual exam. We incorporate all regulatory trends observed during each annual SNC exam into our internal ratings methodology. The limited number of loans with ratings differences, the lengthy period between SNC exams, and the lack of a consistent pattern of credit characteristics leading to the loan ratings differences from year to year will cause the results of any year's exam to be unpredictable and result in some changes from our internal ratings. Based on these factors, however, we do not believe the SNC exam results to be indicative of current policies resulting in inaccurate loan classifications that need to be changed, rather, are differences in judgment and are not indicative of future trends in the subsequent year. We do not always incorporate loan classification upgrades that result from the SNC exam. Thus, based on this policy, the results of the annual SNC exam on our portfolio may result in an increase to our provision for loan losses for the respective period these results become known. Given the relatively high percentage of SNC loans in our total corporate loan portfolio and the probability that regulators are likely to have a different view on some loans in our portfolio, the impact from each annual SNC exam may be material to any fiscal year's provision for loan losses should the credit ratings changes resulting from such exam be numerous, significant (meaning more than a one notch classification change), or associated with considerably large loans in our portfolio. The 2012 SNC exam included a review of 279 corporate loans in our portfolio, which had an outstanding portfolio balance of approximately $5 billion at the time of the review, representing approximately 84% of the total held for investment corporate portfolio at such time. The 2012 exam resulted in loan classification downgrades for seven loans in our portfolio. The outstanding balances associated with these loans approximated $123 million. Each of these loans were performing and the results indicated a one notch lower loan classification was required than that reflected in our own internal classifications. The exam results also included one loan classification upgrade from our internal ratings, which had an outstanding balance totaling approximately $700 thousand. The SNC exam results reflected downgrades representing less than 3% of our total corporate loans covered by the review. The prior year's provision for loan losses included $2 million resulting from the impact of the respective period's annual SNC exam. This prior year exam included a review of 244 corporate loans having an outstanding balance of approximately $4 billion at the time of the review, which was approximately 86% of the held for investment corporate loan portfolio. There were five loan classification downgrades totaling $73 million, all of which were performing loans, and two upgrades totaling $4 million. These downgrades represented less than 2% of the total corporate loans reviewed by the bank regulators, all of which were a one notch change to our internal loan classifications. At September 30, 2012 , the amortized cost of all RJ Bank loans was $8 billion and an allowance for loan losses of $148 million was recorded against that balance. The total allowance for loan losses is equal to 1.81% of the amortized cost of the loan portfolio. The condition of the real estate and credit markets continues to influence the complexity and uncertainty involved in estimating the losses inherent in RJ Bank loan portfolio. If our underlying assumptions and judgments prove to be inaccurate, the allowance for loan losses could be insufficient to cover actual losses. In such an event, any losses would result in a decrease in our net income as well as a decrease in the level of regulatory capital at RJ Bank. 75 Index Income taxes The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year. We utilize the asset and liability method to provide income taxes on all transactions recorded in the consolidated financial statements. This method requires that income taxes reflect the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities for book and tax purposes. Accordingly, a deferred tax asset or liability for each temporary difference is determined based on the tax rates that we expect to be in effect when the underlying items of income and expense are realized. Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity. See Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for further information on our uncertain tax positions. Effects of recently issued accounting standards, and accounting standards not yet adopted In April 2011, FASB issued new guidance regarding the evaluation of certain terms in repurchase agreements which impact the determination of whether a repurchase arrangement should be accounted for as a secured borrowing or a sale. The new guidance removes from the assessment of effective control the criterion requiring the transferor to have the ability to repurchase or redeem the financial assets on substantially agreed terms, even in the event of default by the transferee. We adopted this guidance as of January 2, 2012. There was no significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. In May 2011, the FASB issued new guidance amending the existing pronouncement related to fair value measurement. This new guidance primarily expands the existing disclosure requirements for fair value. Specifically, the new guidance mandates the following additional disclosures: 1) the amount of any transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, 2) a quantitative disclosure of the unobservable inputs and assumptions used in the measurement of Level 3 instruments, 3) a qualitative discussion of the sensitivity of the fair value to changes in unobservable inputs and any inter-relationships between those inputs that magnify or mitigate the effect on the measurement of Level 3 instruments and 4) the level within the fair value hierarchy of items that are not measured at fair value in the statement of financial condition but whose fair value must be disclosed. This new guidance was effective for us in our period ending March 31, 2012. Our adoption of this guidance resulted in additional disclosure but did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. See these disclosures included in Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. In June 2011, the FASB issued new guidance amending the existing pronouncement regarding the presentation of comprehensive income. This new guidance reduces the alternatives for the presentation of the components of other comprehensive income. Specifically, it eliminates the alternative of presenting them as part of the Statement of Changes in Shareholders Equity. This new guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning December 15, 2011; however, early adoption is permitted. In December 2011, the FASB indefinitely deferred the effective date for certain provisions within this new guidance, specifically, those provisions which require the presentation of reclassification adjustments out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component in both the statement in which net income is presented and the statement in which other comprehensive income is presented. We currently present the components of other comprehensive income within our Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income and, therefore, the adoption of this new guidance does not impact us. In September 2011, the FASB issued new guidance amending the existing pronouncement regarding the annual evaluation of goodwill for potential impairment. This new guidance adds a new optional step to the prior guidance. This new step is an optional qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount before applying the two-step goodwill impairment test. If one concludes, based on qualitative factors, that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then performing the two-step impairment test is not required. We adopted this new guidance for our goodwill testing as of December 31, 2011. See the discussion within Note 13 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements within this Form 10-K for the outcome of our application of this new guidance in fiscal year 2012. 76 Index In December 2011, the FASB issued new guidance amending the existing pronouncement by requiring additional disclosures regarding the nature of an entity rights of setoff and related arrangements associated with its financial instruments and derivative instruments. Specifically, this new guidance will require additional information about financial instruments and derivative instruments that are either; 1) offset or 2) subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement, irrespective of whether they are currently offset. The additional disclosure is intended to provide greater transparency on the effect or potential effect of netting arrangements on an entity financial position, including the effect or potential effect of rights of setoff associated with certain financial instruments and derivative instruments within the scope of this amendment. This new guidance is first effective for our financial report covering the quarter ended December 31, 2013. We are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this new guidance will have on our presentation of assets and liabilities within our consolidated statements of financial condition. Off-Balance Sheet arrangements Information concerning our off-balance sheet arrangements is included in Note 26 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. Such information is hereby incorporated by reference. Effects of inflation Our assets are primarily liquid in nature and are not significantly affected by inflation. However, the rate of inflation affects our expenses, including employee compensation, communications and occupancy, which may not be readily recoverable through charges for services we provide to our clients.
