References in the following discussion to we , us , our , the Company , Ulta and similar references mean Ulta Salon, Cosmetics & Fragrance, Inc. unless otherwise expressly stated or the context otherwise requires. Overview We were founded in 1990 as a beauty retailer at a time when prestige, mass and salon products were sold through distinct channels department stores for prestige products, drug stores and mass merchandisers for mass products, and salons and authorized retail outlets for professional hair care products. After extensive research, we recognized an opportunity to better satisfy how women want to shop for beauty products. We developed a unique retail approach by combining one-stop shopping, a compelling value proposition, convenient locations and an uplifting specialty retail experience. We believe our strategy provides us with the competitive advantages that have contributed to our strong financial performance. 30 Table of Contents We are currently the largest beauty retailer that provides one-stop shopping for prestige, mass and salon products and salon services in the United States. We focus on providing affordable indulgence to our customers by combining unmatched product breadth, value and convenience with the distinctive environment and experience of a specialty retailer. Key aspects of our business include our ability to offer our customers a broad selection of over 20,000 beauty products across the categories of cosmetics, fragrance, haircare, skincare, bath and body products and salon styling tools, as well as salon styling tools. We focus on delivering a compelling value proposition to our customers across all of our product categories. Our stores are predominately located in convenient, high-traffic locations such as power centers. The continued growth of our business and any future increases in net sales, net income and cash flows is dependent on our ability to execute our growth strategy, including accelerating store growth, introducing new products, services and brands, enhancing our loyalty program, broadening our marketing reach, increasing our digital focus including Ulta.com and improving our operating margin. We believe that the expanding U.S. beauty products and salon services industry, the shift in distribution of prestige beauty products from department stores to specialty retail stores, coupled with Ulta competitive strengths, positions us to capture additional market share in the industry through successful execution of our growth strategy. Comparable store sales is a key metric that is monitored closely within the retail industry. Our comparable store sales have fluctuated in the past and we expect them to continue to fluctuate in the future. A variety of factors affect our comparable store sales, including general U.S. economic conditions, changes in merchandise strategy or mix, and timing and effectiveness of our marketing activities, among others. We do not expect our 8.8% fiscal 2012 comparable store sales increase to continue into the future. Our long-term annual comparable store sales increase target is 4% to 6%, including the impact of e-commerce sales starting in 2013. Over the long-term, our growth strategy is to increase total net sales through increases in our comparable store sales and by opening new stores. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales is expected to increase as a result of our ability to expand merchandise margin and leverage our supply chain infrastructure and fixed store costs with comparable store sales increases and operating efficiencies. We plan to continue to improve our operating results by leveraging our fixed costs and decreasing our selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of our net sales. Global economic conditions Economic conditions in the U.S. continue to be uneven. Fiscal stress in Europe and economic uncertainty in the U.S. related to deficit issues, potential tax increases and federal spending cuts have resulted in significant fluctuations in the financial markets. While the U.S. credit markets have stabilized and credit availability has improved compared to the recent recessionary period, economic growth is expected to continue to be weak. Consumer spending habits are affected by levels of unemployment, unsettled financial markets, weakness in housing and real estate, higher interest rates, fuel and energy costs, and consumer perception of economic conditions, among others. Sudden negative changes in one or more of the factors that affect consumer spending could adversely affect consumer spending levels which could lead to reduced consumer demand for our merchandise and adversely affect our sales levels and financial performance. Basis of presentation The Company has determined its operating segments on the same basis that it uses to internally evaluate performance. We have combined our three operating segments: retail stores, salon services and e-commerce, into one reportable segment because they have a similar class of consumer, economic characteristics, nature of products and distribution methods. Net sales include store and e-commerce merchandise sales as well as salon service revenue. We recognize merchandise revenue at the point of sale in our retail stores and the time of shipment in the case of Internet sales. Merchandise sales are recorded net of estimated returns. Salon service revenue is recognized at the time the service is provided. Gift card sales revenue is deferred until the customer redeems the gift card. Company coupons and other incentives are recorded as a reduction of net sales. Comparable store sales reflect sales for stores beginning on the first day of the 14th month of operation. Therefore, a store is included in our comparable store base on the first day of the period after one year of 31 Table of Contents operations plus the initial one month grand opening period. Non-comparable store sales include sales from new stores that have not yet completed their 13th month of operation and stores that were closed for part or all of the period in either year as a result of remodel activity. Remodeled stores are included in comparable store sales unless the store was closed for a portion of the current or prior period. E-commerce merchandise sales are excluded from comparable store sales. Starting in the first quarter of 2013, comparable store sales will be reported including the Company e-commerce business. There may be variations in the way in which some of our competitors and other retailers calculate comparable or same store sales. Measuring comparable store sales allows us to evaluate the performance of our store base as well as several other aspects of our overall strategy. Several factors could positively or negatively impact our comparable store sales results: the general national, regional and local economic conditions and corresponding impact on customer spending levels; the introduction of new products or brands; the location of new stores in existing store markets; competition; our ability to respond on a timely basis to changes in consumer preferences; the effectiveness of our various marketing activities; and the number of new stores opened and the impact on the average age of all of our comparable stores. Cost of sales includes: the cost of merchandise sold, including all vendor allowances, which are treated as a reduction of merchandise costs; warehousing and distribution costs including labor and related benefits, freight, rent, depreciation and amortization, real estate taxes, utilities, and insurance; store occupancy costs including rent, depreciation and amortization, real estate taxes, utilities, repairs and maintenance, insurance, licenses, and cleaning expenses; salon payroll and benefits; customer loyalty program expense; and shrink and inventory valuation reserves. Our cost of sales may be negatively impacted as we open an increasing number of stores. Changes in our merchandise mix may also have an impact on cost of sales. This presentation of items included in cost of sales may not be comparable to the way in which our competitors or other retailers compute their cost of sales. Selling, general and administrative expenses include: payroll, bonus and benefit costs for retail and corporate employees; advertising and marketing costs; occupancy costs related to our corporate office facilities; stock-based compensation expense; depreciation and amortization for all assets except those related to our retail and warehouse operations, which is included in cost of sales; and legal, finance, information systems and other corporate overhead costs. This presentation of items in selling, general and administrative expenses may not be comparable to the way in which our competitors or other retailers compute their selling, general and administrative expenses. 32 Table of Contents Pre-opening expense includes non-capital expenditures during the period prior to store opening for new, remodeled and relocated stores including rent during the construction period for new and relocated stores, store set-up labor, management and employee training, and grand opening advertising. Interest expense includes interest costs and unused facility fees associated with our credit facility, which is structured as an asset based lending instrument. Our credit facility interest is based on a variable interest rate structure which can result in increased cost in periods of rising interest rates. Income tax expense reflects the federal statutory tax rate and the weighted average state statutory tax rate for the states in which we operate stores. Results of operations Our fiscal years are the 52 or 53 week periods ending on the Saturday closest to January 31. The Company fiscal years ended February 2, 2013, January 28, 2012 and January 29, 2011 were 53, 52 and 52 week years, respectively, and are hereafter referred to as fiscal 2012, fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010. As of February 2, 2013, we operated 550 stores across 45 states. The following tables present the components of our results of operations for the periods indicated: Fiscal year ended (Dollars in thousands) February 2, 2013 January 28, 2012 January 29, 2011 Net sales $ 2,220,256 $ 1,776,151 $ 1,454,838 Cost of sales 1,436,582 1,159,311 970,753 Gross profit 783,674 616,840 484,085 Selling, general and administrative expenses 488,880 410,658 358,106 Pre-opening expenses 14,816 9,987 7,095 Operating income 279,978 196,195 118,884 Interest expense 185 587 755 Income before income taxes 279,793 195,608 118,129 Income tax expense 107,244 75,344 47,099 Net income $ 172,549 $ 120,264 $ 71,030 Other operating data: Number of stores end of period 550 449 389 Comparable store sales increase 8.8 % 10.9 % 11.0 % Fiscal year ended (Percentage of net sales) February 2, 2013 January 28, 2012 January 29, 2011 Net sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales 64.7 % 65.3 % 66.7 % Gross profit 35.3 % 34.7 % 33.3 % Selling, general and administrative expenses 22.0 % 23.1 % 24.6 % Pre-opening expenses 0.7 % 0.6 % 0.5 % Operating income 12.6 % 11.0 % 8.2 % Interest expense 0.0 % 0.0 % 0.1 % Income before income taxes 12.6 % 11.0 % 8.1 % Income tax expense 4.8 % 4.2 % 3.2 % Net income 7.8 % 6.8 % 4.9 % 33 Table of Contents Fiscal year 2012 versus fiscal year 2011 Net sales Net sales increased $444.1 million, or 25.0%, to $2,220.3 million in fiscal 2012 compared to $1,776.2 million in fiscal 2011. Salon service sales increased $22.9 million, or 23.2% to $121.4 million compared to $98.5 million in fiscal 2011. The sales increases are due to the opening of 101 net new stores in 2012 and a 8.8% increase in comparable store sales which was primarily due to a 6.5% increase in store traffic. Non-comparable stores, which include stores opened in fiscal 2012 as well as stores opened in fiscal 2011 which have not yet turned comparable, contributed $291.0 million of the net sales increase while comparable stores contributed $153.1 million of the total net sales increase. We attribute the increase in comparable store sales to our successful marketing and merchandise strategies. Gross profit Gross profit increased $166.9 million, or 27.0%, to $783.7 million in fiscal 2012, compared to $616.8 million, in fiscal 2011. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased 60 basis points to 35.3% in fiscal 2012 compared to 34.7% in fiscal 2011. The increase in gross profit margin in fiscal 2012 was primarily driven by: 50 basis points of leverage in fixed store costs attributed to the impact of significantly higher sales levels in fiscal 2012; and 30 basis points improvement in merchandise margins driven by our marketing and merchandising strategies. Selling, general and administrative expenses Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased $78.2 million, or 19.0%, to $488.9 million in fiscal 2012 compared to $410.7 million in fiscal 2011. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses decreased 110 basis points to 22.0% in fiscal 2012 compared to 23.1% in fiscal 2011. The leverage in SG&A expense was primarily driven by: 70 basis points in corporate overhead leverage attributed to higher sales volume; and 40 basis points improvement in variable store and marketing expense leverage attributed to cost efficiencies and higher sales volume. Pre-opening expenses Pre-opening expenses increased $4.8 million, or 48.4%, to $14.8 million in fiscal 2012 compared to $10.0 million in fiscal 2011. During fiscal 2012, we opened 102 new stores, remodeled 21 stores and relocated 3 stores. During fiscal 2011, we opened 61 new stores and remodeled 17 stores and relocated 2 stores. Interest expense Interest expense was $0.2 million in fiscal 2012 and $0.6 million in fiscal 2011. Interest expense for both periods represents various fees related to the credit facility. We did not utilize our credit facility during fiscal 2012 or 2011. Income tax expense Income tax expense of $107.2 million in fiscal 2012 represents an effective tax rate of 38.3%, compared to fiscal 2011 tax expense of $75.3 million and an effective tax rate of 38.5%. The lower tax rate in fiscal 2012 is primarily due to a decrease in state taxes and less non-deductible executive compensation compared to fiscal 2011. Net income Net income increased $52.2 million, or 43.5%, to $172.5 million in fiscal 2012 compared to $120.3 million in fiscal 2011. The increase in net income was primarily due to an increase in gross profit of $166.9 million, which was offset by a $78.2 million increase in SG&A expenses and a $31.9 million increase in income tax expense. 34 Table of Contents Fiscal year 2011 versus fiscal year 2010 Net sales Net sales increased $321.4 million, or 22.1%, to $1,776.2 million in fiscal 2011 compared to $1,454.8 million in fiscal 2010. Salon service sales increased $12.1 million, or 14.0% to $98.5 million compared to $86.4 million in fiscal 2010. The sales increases were due to the opening of 60 net new stores in 2011 and a 10.9% increase in comparable store sales which was primarily due to a 10.1% increase in store traffic. Non-comparable stores, which include stores opened in fiscal 2011 as well as stores opened in fiscal 2010 which have not yet turned comparable, contributed $168.4 million of the net sales increase while comparable stores contributed $153.0 million of the total net sales increase. We attribute the increase in comparable store sales to our successful marketing and merchandise strategies. Gross profit Gross profit increased $132.7 million, or 27.4%, to $616.8 million in fiscal 2011, compared to $484.1 million, in fiscal 2010. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased 140 basis points to 34.7% in fiscal 2011 compared to 33.3% in fiscal 2010. The increase in gross profit margin in fiscal 2011 was primarily driven by: 80 basis points of leverage in fixed store costs attributed to the impact of significantly higher sales levels in fiscal 2011; and 70 basis points improvement in merchandise margin due primarily to improved promotional pricing and a shift in category mix towards higher margin product compared with fiscal 2010. Selling, general and administrative expenses Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased $52.6 million, or 14.7%, to $410.7 million in fiscal 2011 compared to $358.1 million in fiscal 2010. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses decreased 150 basis points to 23.1% in fiscal 2011 compared to 24.6% in fiscal 2010. The leverage in SG&A expense was primarily driven by: 70 basis points improvement in variable store and marketing expense leverage attributed to cost efficiencies and higher sales volume; and 60 basis points in corporate overhead leverage, excluding the fiscal 2010 non-recurring compensation charge, attributed to higher sales volume. Pre-opening expenses Pre-opening expenses increased $2.9 million, or 40.8%, to $10.0 million in fiscal 2011 compared to $7.1 million in fiscal 2010. During fiscal 2011, we opened 61 new stores, remodeled 17 stores and relocated 2 stores. During fiscal 2010, we opened 47 new stores and remodeled 13 stores and relocated 5 stores. Interest expense Interest expense was $0.6 million in fiscal 2011 and $0.8 million in fiscal 2010. Interest expense for both periods represents various fees related to the credit facility. We did not utilize our credit facility during fiscal 2011 or 2010. Income tax expense Income tax expense of $75.3 million in fiscal 2011 represents an effective tax rate of 38.5%, compared to fiscal 2010 tax expense of $47.1 million and an effective tax rate of 39.9%. The lower tax rate in fiscal 2011 is primarily due to a decrease in non-deductible compensation expense and increases in certain federal and state tax deductions and credits compared to fiscal 2010. Net income Net income increased $49.3 million, or 69.3%, to $120.3 million in fiscal 2011 compared to $71.0 million in fiscal 2010. The increase in net income was primarily due to an increase in gross profit of $132.7 million, which was offset by a $52.6 million increase in SG&A expenses and a $28.2 million increase in income tax expense. 35 Table of Contents Liquidity and capital resources Our primary cash needs are for capital expenditures for new, relocated and remodeled stores, increased merchandise inventories related to store expansion, supply chain improvements and for continued improvement in our information technology systems. Our primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand and cash flows from operations, including changes in working capital, and borrowings under our credit facility. The most significant component of our working capital is merchandise inventories reduced by related accounts payable and accrued expenses. Our working capital position benefits from the fact that we generally collect cash from sales to customers the same day, or within several days of the related sale, while we typically have up to 30 days to pay our vendors. Our working capital needs are greatest from August through November each year as a result of our inventory build-up during this period for the approaching holiday season. This is also the time of year when we are at maximum investment levels in our new store class and may not have collected all of the landlord allowances due to us as part of our lease agreements. Based on past performance and current expectations, we believe that cash on hand, cash generated from operations and borrowings under the credit facility will satisfy the Company working capital needs, capital expenditure needs, commitments, and other liquidity requirements through at least the next 12 months. The following table presents a summary of our cash flows for fiscal years 2012, 2011 and 2010: Fiscal year ended (In thousands) February 2, 2013 January 28, 2012 January 29, 2011 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 239,001 $ 220,887 $ 176,543 Net cash used in investing activities (188,578 ) (128,636 ) (97,115 ) Net cash provided by financing activities 16,314 50,302 27,740 Net increase in cash and cash equivalents $ 66,737 $ 142,553 $ 107,168 Operating activities Operating activities consist of net income adjusted for certain non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization, non-cash stock-based compensation, realized gains or losses on disposal of property and equipment, and the effect of working capital changes. Merchandise inventories were $361.1 million at February 2, 2013, compared to $244.6 million at January 28, 2012, representing an increase of $116.5 million. Average inventory per store increased 20.5% compared to prior year. The increase in inventory is due to the addition of 101 net new stores opened since January 28, 2012 and incremental inventory related to the recently added prestige brand boutiques as well as strategic inventory investments to improve in-stock levels. We had a current tax liability of $10.1 million at the end of fiscal 2012 compared to $4.0 million at the end of fiscal 2011. The increase in taxes payable is primarily due to an increase in taxable income. Deferred rent liabilities were $208.0 million at February 2, 2013, an increase of $44.5 million compared to the prior year end. Deferred rent includes deferred construction allowances, future rental increases and rent holidays which are all recognized on a straight-line basis over their respective lease term. The increase is primarily due to the addition of 101 net new stores opened since January 28, 2012. The $53.4 million cash flow benefit from income taxes is attributed to Federal income tax deductions due to accelerated bonus depreciation on fixed assets and tax deductible stock option exercises. Investing activities We have historically used cash primarily for new and remodeled stores as well as investments in information technology systems. Investment activities primarily related to capital expenditures were $188.6 million in fiscal 36 Table of Contents 2012, compared to $128.6 million and $97.1 million in fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively. Capital expenditures increased in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 due to the increase in our 2012 new store program. During fiscal 2012 we opened 102 new stores, remodeled 21 stores and relocated 3 stores, compared to 61 new stores, 17 remodels and 2 relocations during fiscal 2011 and 47 new stores, 13 remodels and 5 relocations during fiscal 2010. Financing activities Financing activities in fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010 consist principally of capital stock transactions and the related income tax effects and a dividend payment. Common stock repurchased in fiscal 2012 and 2011 represents the fair value of common shares repurchased from plan participants in connection with shares withheld to satisfy minimum statutory tax obligations upon the vesting of restricted stock. We had no borrowings outstanding under our credit facility at the end of fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010. The zero outstanding borrowings position is due to a combination of factors including strong sales growth, overall performance of management initiatives including expense control as well as inventory and other working capital reductions. We may require borrowings under the facility from time to time in future periods to support our new store program and seasonal inventory needs. Dividend On March 8, 2012, we announced that our Board of Directors had declared a $1.00 per share special cash dividend to shareholders of record as of the close of business on March 20, 2012. The special cash dividend totaling $62.5 million was paid on May 15, 2012. Our Board of Directors may determine future dividends after giving consideration to our levels of profit and cash flow, capital requirements, current and future liquidity, restrictions included as part of our credit facility as well as financial and other conditions existing at the time. Credit facility On October 19, 2011, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement (the Loan Agreement) with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent and a Lender thereunder, Wells Fargo Capital Finance LLC as a Lender, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC as a Lender, JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. as a Lender and PNC Bank, National Association, as a Lender. The Loan Agreement amended and restated the Loan and Security Agreement, dated as of August 31, 2010, by and among the lenders. The Loan Agreement extends the maturity of the Company credit facility to October 2016, provides maximum revolving loans equal to the lesser of $200,000 or a percentage of eligible owned inventory, contains a $10,000 subfacility for letters of credit and allows the Company to increase the revolving facility by an additional $50,000, subject to consent by each lender and other conditions. The Loan Agreement contains a requirement to maintain a minimum amount of excess borrowing availability at all times. Substantially all of the Company assets are pledged as collateral for outstanding borrowings under the facility. Outstanding borrowings will bear interest at the prime rate or Libor plus 1.50% and the unused line fee is 0.225%. On September 5, 2012, we entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement (the Amendment) with the lender group. The Amendment updated certain administrative terms and conditions and provides us greater flexibility to take certain corporate actions. There were no changes to the revolving loan amounts available, interest rates, covenants or maturity date under terms of the Loan Agreement. As of February 2, 2013 and January 28, 2012, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under its credit facility and the Company was in compliance with all terms and covenants of the agreement. Seasonality Our business is subject to seasonal fluctuation. Significant portions of our net sales and profits are realized during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year due to the holiday selling season. To a lesser extent, our business is also affected by Mothers Day as well as the Back to School season and Valentine Day. Any decrease in sales 37 Table of Contents during these higher sales volume periods could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or operating results for the entire fiscal year. Our quarterly results of operations have varied in the past and are likely to do so again in the future. As such, we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations should not be relied upon as an indication of our future performance. Impact of inflation and changing prices Although we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations to date, a high rate of inflation in the future may have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain current levels of gross margin and selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales if the selling prices of our products do not increase with these increased costs. In addition, inflation could materially increase the interest rates on our debt. Off-balance sheet arrangements Our off-balance sheet arrangements consist of operating lease obligations and letters of credit. We do not have any non-cancelable purchase commitments as of February 2, 2013. Contractual obligations We lease retail stores, warehouses, corporate offices and certain equipment under operating leases with various expiration dates through fiscal 2027. Our store leases generally have initial lease terms of 10 years and include renewal options under substantially the same terms and conditions as the original leases. In addition to future minimum lease payments, most of our lease agreements include escalating rent provisions which we recognize straight-line over the term of the lease, including any lease renewal periods deemed to be probable. For certain locations, we receive cash tenant allowances and we report these amounts as deferred rent, which is amortized on a straight-line basis as a reduction of rent expense over the term of the lease, including any lease renewal periods deemed to be probable. While a number of our store leases include contingent rentals, contingent rent amounts are insignificant. The following table summarizes our contractual arrangements and the timing and effect that such commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods. The table below excludes variable expenses related to contingent rent, common area maintenance, insurance and real estate taxes. The table below includes obligations for executed agreements for which we do not yet have the right to control the use of the property as of February 2, 2013: (In thousands) Total Less Than 1 Year 1 to 3 Years 3 to 5 Years After 5 Years Operating lease obligations(1) $ 1,208,527 $ 155,542 $ 313,609 $ 278,565 $ 460,811 (1) Variable operating lease obligations related to common area maintenance, insurance and real estate taxes are not included in the table above. Total expenses related to common area maintenance, insurance and real estate taxes for fiscal 2012 were $30.5 million. Critical accounting policies and estimates Management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements required the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of our assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Management bases estimates on historical experience and other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances and evaluates these estimates on an on-going basis. Actual results may differ from these estimates. A discussion of our more significant estimates follows. Management has discussed the development, selection, and disclosure of these estimates and assumptions with the audit committee of the board of directors. 38 Table of Contents Inventory valuation Merchandise inventories are carried at the lower of average cost or market value. Cost is determined using the weighted-average cost method and includes costs incurred to purchase and distribute goods as well as related vendor allowances including co-op advertising, markdowns, and volume discounts. We record valuation adjustments to our inventories if the cost of a specific product on hand exceeds the amount we expect to realize from the ultimate sale or disposal of the inventory. These estimates are based on management judgment regarding future demand, age of inventory, and analysis of historical experience. If actual demand or market conditions are different than those projected by management, future merchandise margin rates may be unfavorably or favorably affected by adjustments to these estimates. Inventories are adjusted for the results of periodic physical inventory counts at each of our locations. We record a shrink reserve representing management estimate of inventory losses by location that have occurred since the date of the last physical count. This estimate is based on management analysis of historical results and operating trends. Adjustments to earnings resulting from revisions to management estimates of the lower of cost or market and shrink reserves have been insignificant during fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010. Impairment of long-lived tangible assets We review long-lived tangible assets whenever events or circumstances indicate these assets might not be recoverable based on undiscounted future cash flows. Assets are reviewed at the store level, which is the lowest level for which cash flows can be identified. Significant estimates are used in determining future operating results of each store over its remaining lease term. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. We have not recorded an impairment charge in any of the periods presented in the accompanying financial statements. Share-based compensation We account for share-based compensation in accordance with the Accounting Standards Codification TM (ASC) rules for stock compensation. Share-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date, based on the fair value of the award, and is recognized on a straight-line method over the requisite service period for awards expected to vest. We estimate the grant date fair value of stock options using a Black-Scholes valuation model. The expected volatility is based on volatilities of our stock and a peer group of publicly-traded companies. The risk free interest rate is based on the United States Treasury yield curve in effect on the date of grant for the respective expected life of the option. The expected life represents the time the options granted are expected to be outstanding. We have limited historical data related to exercise behavior since our initial public offering on October 30, 2007. As a result, we have elected to use the shortcut approach to determine the expected life in accordance with the SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin on share-based payments.

See Note 9 to our financial statements, Share-based awards, for disclosure related to our stock compensation expense and related valuation model assumptions.
