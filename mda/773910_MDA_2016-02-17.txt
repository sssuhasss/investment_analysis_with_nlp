Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read together with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements , which are included in this Form 10-K in Item 8, and the information set forth in Risk Factors under Item 1A. Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms Anadarko and Company refer to Anadarko Petroleum Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries. Index Page Mission and Strategy 50 Outlook 51 Overview 53 Financial Results 55 Liquidity and Capital Resources 69 Critical Accounting Estimates 77 Recent Accounting Developments 80 MISSION AND STRATEGY Anadarko mission is to deliver a competitive and sustainable rate of return to shareholders by developing, acquiring, and exploring for oil and natural-gas resources vital to the world health and welfare. Anadarko employs the following strategy to achieve this mission: explore in high-potential, proven basins identify and commercialize resources employ a global business development approach ensure financial discipline and flexibility Exploring in high-potential, proven basins worldwide provides the Company with growth opportunities. Anadarko exploration success has created value by increasing future resource potential while providing the flexibility to mitigate risk by monetizing discoveries. Developing a portfolio of primarily unconventional resources provides the Company a stable base of capital-efficient and predictable development opportunities that, in turn, position the Company for consistent growth at competitive rates. Anadarko global business development approach transfers core skills across the globe to assist in the discovery and development of world-class resources that are accretive to the Company performance. These resources help form an optimized global portfolio where both surface and subsurface risks are actively managed. A strong balance sheet is essential for the development of the Company assets, and Anadarko is committed to disciplined investment in its businesses to efficiently manage commodity-price cycles. Maintaining financial discipline enables the Company to capitalize on the opportunities afforded by its global portfolio while allowing the Company to pursue new strategic growth opportunities. 50 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements OUTLOOK During 2015, the oil and natural-gas industry experienced a significant decrease in commodity prices driven by a global supply/demand imbalance for oil and an oversupply of natural gas in the United States. The decline in commodity prices and global economic conditions have continued into 2016 and low commodity prices may exist for an extended period. The Company revenues, operating results, cash flows from operations, capital spending, and future growth rates are highly dependent on the global commodity-price markets, which affect the value the Company receives from its sales of oil, natural-gas, and natural-gas liquids (NGLs) production. The Company strategy in 2015 was to preserve and build value by focusing a greater percentage of its capital investment on longer-dated projects while driving cost savings and efficiencies through every aspect of its business. During 2015, the Company closed $2.0 billion of monetizations and was successful in lowering its capital expenditures by 36% and its operating expenses by 13% compared to 2014 while maintaining relatively flat production year over year. The Company plans to continue its disciplined and focused approach in 2016 by emphasizing value over growth, enhancing operational efficiencies, reducing capital expenses, and managing its diverse asset portfolio. Management has recommended to the Board of Directors (Board) a 2016 capital budget of approximately $2.8 billion, which excludes the capital budget of Western Gas Partners, LP (WES), a publicly traded consolidated subsidiary. The $2.8 billion budget is nearly 50% lower than the Company capital investments in 2015 and almost 70% lower than 2014. The Company will continue to evaluate the oil and natural-gas price environments and may adjust its capital spending plans to maintain the appropriate liquidity and financial flexibility. Anadarko expects that its capital expenditures will be aligned with its cash flows from operations and targeted asset monetizations. Liquidity As of December 31, 2015, Anadarko had $939 million of cash on hand plus $4.75 billion of borrowing capacity under its revolving credit facilities ($5.0 billion capacity, less $250 million of outstanding commercial paper notes). Substantially all of Anadarko cash balances at December 31, 2015, were domiciled in the United States and were available to support its worldwide operations. In addition, future excess cash flows generated from the Company international assets are available to support both its U.S. operations and corporate needs without incurring incremental U.S. income tax. In December 2015, Anadarko extended the maturity of its $3.0 billion five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility (Five-Year Facility) to January 2021, and in January 2016, Anadarko replaced its $2.0 billion 364-day senior unsecured revolving credit facility (364-Day Facility) with a new $2.0 billion 364-day senior unsecured revolving credit facility that will mature in January 2017. The extension and renewal included no changes to covenants or pricing, and the original bank-group fully participated. Anadarko $1.750 billion 5.950% Senior Notes, scheduled to mature in September 2016, were classified as long-term debt on the Company Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2015, as Anadarko intends to refinance these obligations prior to or at maturity with new long-term debt issuances or by using the Five-Year Facility. As of December 31, 2015, Anadarko long-term debt was rated BBB with a stable outlook by both Standard and Poor (S&P) and Fitch Ratings (Fitch), and its commercial paper program was rated A-2 by S&P and F2 by Fitch. Anadarko long-term debt was rated Baa2 with a stable outlook and its commercial paper program was rated P2 by Moody Investors Service (Moody s) until December 16, 2015, when Moody announced that it had placed both ratings under review for downgrade along with the ratings of 28 other U.S. exploration and production companies and their related subsidiaries. In February 2016, S&P affirmed Anadarko BBB rating and changed the outlook from stable to negative. As of the time of filing this Form 10-K, neither Fitch nor Moody had announced any change to Anadarko credit ratings; however, the Company cannot be assured that its credit ratings will not be downgraded. Any downgrade in Anadarko credit ratings could negatively impact its cost of capital, and a downgrade to a level that is below investment grade could also adversely affect the Company ability to effectively execute aspects of its strategy or to raise debt in the public debt markets. 51 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements In the event of a downgrade in Anadarko credit rating to a level that is below investment grade, the Company may be required to post collateral in the form of letters of credit or cash as financial assurance of its performance under certain contractual arrangements such as pipeline transportation contracts and oil and gas sales contracts. At December 31, 2015, there were no letters of credit or cash provided as assurance of the Company performance under these types of contractual arrangements with respect to credit-risk-related contingent features. If Anadarko credit ratings had been downgraded to a level below investment grade as of December 31, 2015 , the collateral required to be posted under these arrangements would have been $460 million . Additionally, certain of these arrangements contain financial assurances language that may, under certain circumstances, permit the counterparties to request additional collateral. For additional information, see Risk Factors in Item 1A of this Form 10-K. Furthermore, in the event of a downgrade in Anadarko credit rating to a level that is below investment grade, the credit thresholds with Anadarko derivative counterparties may be reduced or, in certain cases, eliminated, which may require the Company to post additional collateral in the form of letters of credit or cash. The aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features for which a net liability position existed on December 31, 2015, was $1.3 billion, net of collateral. As of December 31, 2015, $58 million was posted as cash collateral with Anadarko derivative counterparties. For additional information, see Note 9 Derivative Instruments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Anadarko believes that its cash on hand, anticipated operating cash flows, and proceeds from expected asset monetizations will be sufficient to fund the Company projected 2016 operational and capital programs. In response to the current commodity-price environment, the Board decreased the quarterly dividend from $0.27 per share to $0.05 per share in February 2016. On an annualized basis, the dividend decrease will have the effect of providing approximately $450 million of additional cash available to enhance the Company operations and financial flexibility. Anadarko also expects to receive an $881 million tax refund in 2016 related to the income tax benefit associated with the Company 2015 tax net operating loss carryback. Further, Anadarko enters into strategic derivative positions to reduce commodity-price risk and increase the predictability of cash flows. At December 31, 2015, derivative positions covered approximately 26% of Anadarko anticipated oil sales volumes, 3% of its anticipated NGLs sales volumes, and 2% of its anticipated natural-gas sales volumes for 2016. These instruments had a fair value of $273 million as of December 31, 2015. See Note 9 Derivative Instruments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Anadarko believes that the actions taken to enhance the Company liquidity position coupled with its asset portfolio and operating and financial performance provide the necessary financial flexibility to fund the Company current and long-term operations. Potential for Future Impairments During 2015, the Company recognized significant impairments of proved oil and gas and midstream properties and impairments of unproved oil and gas properties, primarily as a result of lower forecasted commodity prices and changes to the Company drilling plans. At December 31, 2015, the Company estimate of undiscounted future cash flows attributable to a certain depletion group with a net book value of approximately $2.2 billion indicated that the carrying amount was expected to be recovered; however, this depletion group may be at risk for impairment if the estimates of future cash flows decline. The Company estimates that, if this depletion group becomes impaired in a future period, the Company could recognize non-cash impairments in that period in excess of $800 million. It is also reasonably possible that prolonged low or further declines in commodity prices, further changes to the Company drilling plans in response to lower prices, or increases in drilling or operating costs could result in other additional impairments. Anadarko had approximately $5.4 billion of goodwill at December 31, 2015, allocated to the following reporting units: $4.9 billion to oil and gas exploration and production, $383 million to WES gathering and processing, $5 million to WES transportation, and $62 million to other gathering and processing. Goodwill is tested annually in October, and at interim periods when necessary. Although commodity prices declined during the year, as of December 31, 2015, the estimated fair value of the oil and gas reporting unit exceeded the carrying value by more than 15%, without consideration for any control premium, and the other reporting units were not at risk of impairment. However, it is reasonably possible that prolonged low or further declines in commodity prices, decreases in proved reserves, changes in exploration or development plans, significant property impairments, increases in operating or drilling costs, significant changes in regulations, or other negative changes to the economic environment in which Anadarko operates could result in a further reduction in the fair value of the reporting units and increase the potential for a future impairment of goodwill. 52 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Proved Reserves Proved reserves are estimated based on the average beginning-of-month prices during the 12-month period for the respective year. The average prices used to compute proved reserves at December 31, 2015, were $50.28 per barrel (Bbl) for oil, $2.59 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) for gas, and $19.47 per Bbl for NGLs. Prices for oil, natural gas, and NGLs can fluctuate widely. For example, New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) West Texas Intermediate oil prices have been volatile and ranged from a high of $107.26 per barrel in June 2014 to a low of $26.21 per Bbl in February 2016. Also, NYMEX Henry Hub natural-gas prices have been volatile and ranged from a high of $6.15 per MMBtu in February 2014 to a low of $1.76 per MMBtu in December 2015. If commodity prices remain below the average prices used to estimate 2015 proved reserves, the Company would expect additional negative price-related reserves revisions in 2016, which could be significant. OVERVIEW Significant 2015 operating and financial activities include the following: Total Company Anadarko sales volumes averaged 836 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (MBOE/d), which was relatively flat compared to 2014 and includes a 37 MBOE/d decrease related to divestitures. The Company overall sales-volume product mix increased to 53% liquids in 2015 compared to 49% in 2014 . Anadarko higher-margin liquids sales volumes were 447 thousand barrels per day (MBbls/d), representing a 9% increase over 2014 . This increase included a 14 MBbls/d decrease in sales volumes related to divestitures, including certain enhanced oil recovery (EOR) assets in the Rocky Mountains Region (Rockies) in 2015 and the Company Chinese subsidiary in 2014. The Company closed several asset monetizations, totaling $1.4 billion , including the divestiture of certain coalbed methane properties and related midstream assets in the Rockies, certain EOR assets in the Rockies, and certain oil and gas properties and related midstream assets in East Texas. Anadarko paid $5.2 billion related to a settlement agreement resolving all claims asserted in the Tronox Adversary Proceeding. See Note 15 Contingencies Tronox Litigation in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. After previously finding that Anadarko, as a nonoperating investor in the Macondo well, was not culpable with respect to the Deepwater Horizon events, the Louisiana District Court found Anadarko liable for civil penalties under the Clean Water Act as a working-interest owner in the Macondo well and entered a judgment of $159.5 million in December 2015. See Note 15 Contingencies Deepwater Horizon Events in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. U.S. Onshore The Rockies sales volumes averaged 367 MBOE/d, representing a 2% , or 6 MBOE/d, increase over 2014 , primarily from a 32%, or 54 MBOE/d, sales volume increase in the Wattenberg field, partially offset by lower sales volumes due to the April 2015 sale of certain EOR assets and the September 2015 sale of certain coalbed methane properties. The Southern and Appalachia Region sales volumes averaged 284 MBOE/d, representing a 5% decrease from 2014 , primarily due to lower natural-gas sales volumes in the Marcellus shale due to voluntary curtailments and third-party infrastructure downtime, and the sale of certain U.S. onshore oil and gas properties and related midstream assets in East Texas, partially offset by higher sales volumes in the Eagleford shale. 53 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Gulf of Mexico Gulf of Mexico sales volumes averaged 85 MBOE/d, representing a 2% increase over 2014 , primarily due to the commencement of oil production from the Lucius development in January 2015, partially offset by a natural-gas production decline at Independence Hub (IHUB). The Company participated in the successful drilling of the nonoperated Yeti exploration well (37.5% working interest) in Walker Ridge Block 160, with the well successfully sidetracked to test the down-dip limits of the field. Anadarko Heidelberg development project was completed and achieved first oil in January 2016. International International sales volumes averaged 91 MBOE/d, which was relatively flat compared to 2014 . The Kronos-1 deepwater prospect offshore Colombia encountered 130 to 230 net feet of natural-gas pay in the upper objective and encountered non-commercial hydrocarbons in a deeper objective. The Tweneboa/Enyenra/Ntomme (TEN) project in Ghana was more than 80% complete at year end 2015 , with first oil expected in the third quarter of 2016. Anadarko wrote off suspended exploratory costs in Brazil where the Company does not expect to have substantive exploration and development activities for the foreseeable future given the current oil-price environment and other considerations. Financial Anadarko net loss attributable to common stockholders for 2015 totaled $ 6.7 billion , including impairments of $5.1 billion primarily related to certain U.S. onshore and Gulf of Mexico properties, impairments of exploration assets of $1.9 billion primarily associated with impairments of unproved properties and the write-off of suspended exploratory well costs in Brazil, and losses on divestitures of $1.0 billion. The Company net cash used in operating activities was $1.9 billion in 2015 , which included the $5.2 billion Tronox settlement payment. The Company ended 2015 with $939 million of cash on hand. The Company initiated a commercial paper program, which allows the issuance of a maximum of $3.0 billion of unsecured commercial paper notes. In December 2015, Anadarko extended the maturity of its Five-Year Facility to January 2021, and in January 2016, Anadarko replaced its 364-Day Facility with a new $2.0 billion 364-day senior unsecured revolving credit facility that will mature in January 2017. WES, a publicly traded consolidated subsidiary, completed a public offering of $500 million aggregate principal amount of 3.950% Senior Notes due 2025. Anadarko issued 9.2 million 7.50% tangible equity units (TEUs) at a stated amount of $50.00 per unit and raised net proceeds of $445 million. Anadarko completed a public secondary offering of 2.3 million common units in Western Gas Equity Partners, LP (WGP), a publicly traded consolidated subsidiary that owns partnership interests in WES, and raised net proceeds of $130 million. 54 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements FINANCIAL RESULTS millions except per-share amounts 2015 2014 2013 Oil and condensate, natural-gas, and NGLs sales $ 8,260 $ 15,169 $ 13,828 Gathering, processing, and marketing sales 1,226 1,206 1,039 Gains (losses) on divestitures and other, net (788 ) 2,095 (286 ) Revenues and other 8,698 18,470 14,581 Costs and expenses 17,507 13,067 11,248 Other (income) expense 880 5,349 1,227 Income tax expense (benefit) (2,877 ) 1,617 1,165 Net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders $ (6,692 ) $ (1,750 ) $ 801 Net income (loss) per common share attributable to common stockholders diluted $ (13.18 ) $ (3.47 ) $ 1.58 Average number of common shares outstanding diluted 508 506 505 The following discussion pertains to Anadarko results of operations, financial condition, and changes in financial condition.

Sales volumes in the Rockies increased by 11 MBbls/d primarily in the Wattenberg field due to continued horizontal drilling, partially offset by lower sales volumes due to the sale of certain EOR assets in April 2015. Sales volumes in the Southern and Appalachia Region increased by 10 MBbls/d primarily in the Eagleford shale as a result of continued horizontal drilling and in the Delaware basin due to wells brought online as a result of additional infrastructure and continued drilling. Sales volumes in the Gulf of Mexico increased by 8 MBbls/d primarily from the Lucius development achieving first oil in January 2015, partially offset by a natural production decline at Marco Polo. International sales volumes decreased by 4 MBbls/d primarily due to the timing of liftings in Algeria and the sale of the Company Chinese subsidiary in August 2014, partially offset by higher sales volumes due to the timing of liftings in Ghana. 2014 vs. 2013 Anadarko oil and condensate sales volumes increased by 44 MBbls/d. Sales volumes in the Rockies increased by 33 MBbls/d primarily in the Wattenberg field due to increased horizontal drilling. Sales volumes in the Southern and Appalachia Region increased by 15 MBbls/d, primarily as a result of increased horizontal drilling and 2013 infrastructure expansion in the Eagleford shale and increased horizontal drilling in the Delaware basin. International sales volumes decreased by 1 MBbls/d primarily due to lower sales volumes in China as a result of maintenance downtime and the sale of the Company Chinese subsidiary and the timing of liftings in Ghana, partially offset by higher sales volumes in Algeria from additional facilities and wells brought online at El Merk. Sales volumes in the Gulf of Mexico decreased by 1 MBbls/d primarily due to natural production declines. Oil and Condensate Prices 2015 vs. 2014 Anadarko average oil price received decreased primarily as a result of global oversupply. 2014 vs. 2013 Anadarko average oil price received decreased as a result of a global oversupply and reduced oil demand resulting from continued economic weakness particularly in late 2014. 57 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Natural-Gas Sales Volumes, Average Prices, and Revenues 2015 Inc/(Dec) vs. 2014 2014 Inc/(Dec) vs. 2013 2013 United States Sales volumes Bcf 852 (10 )% 945 (2 )% 968 MMcf/d 2,334 (10 ) 2,589 (2 ) 2,652 Price per Mcf $ 2.36 (42 ) $ 4.07 16 $ 3.50 Natural-gas sales revenues (millions) $ 2,007 (48 ) $ 3,849 14 $ 3,388 _______________________________________________________________________________ Bcf billion cubic feet MMcf/d million cubic feet per day Mcf thousand cubic feet Natural-Gas Sales Volumes 2015 vs. 2014 The Company natural-gas sales volumes decreased by 255 MMcf/d. Sales volumes in the Southern and Appalachia Region decreased by 145 MMcf/d primarily due to voluntary curtailments and third-party infrastructure downtime in the Marcellus shale and the July 2015 sale of certain U.S. onshore properties and related midstream assets in East Texas. These decreases were partially offset by higher sales volumes as a result of continued horizontal drilling in the Eagleford shale. Sales volumes in the Rockies decreased by 66 MMcf/d primarily due to voluntary curtailments at Greater Natural Buttes, a natural production decline at Powder River basin, and the September 2015 sale of certain coalbed methane properties, partially offset by higher sales volumes in the Wattenberg field as a result of continued horizontal drilling. Sales volumes in the Gulf of Mexico decreased by 44 MMcf/d primarily due to a natural production decline at IHUB, partially offset by the Lucius development achieving first production in January 2015. 2014 vs. 2013 The Company natural-gas sales volumes decreased by 63 MMcf/d. Sales volumes in the Rockies decreased by 90 MMcf/d primarily due to the January 2014 sale of the Company Pinedale/Jonah assets and natural production declines in the Powder River basin and Greater Natural Buttes. These decreases were partially offset by higher sales volumes in the Wattenberg field due to increased horizontal drilling. Sales volumes in the Gulf of Mexico decreased by 67 MMcf/d primarily due to a natural production decline at IHUB. Sales volumes in the Southern and Appalachia Region increased by 94 MMcf/d primarily due to infrastructure expansions that allowed the Company to bring wells online in the Marcellus and Eagleford shales as well as continued horizontal drilling in the liquids-rich East Texas/North Louisiana horizontal development. Natural-Gas Prices 2015 vs. 2014 The average natural-gas price Anadarko received decreased primarily due to strong year-over-year production growth in the northeast United States and slightly lower weather-driven residential and commercial demand mainly in the first half of 2015. 2014 vs. 2013 The average natural-gas price Anadarko received increased primarily due to low industry natural-gas storage levels as a result of colder than average winter temperatures and the associated high residential heating demand in early 2014. In addition, natural-gas prices increased as a result of higher industrial natural-gas demand, reduced natural-gas imports from Canada, and continued strength in exports to Mexico. 58 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Natural-Gas Liquids Sales Volumes, Average Prices, and Revenues 2015 Inc/(Dec) vs. 2014 2014 Inc/(Dec) vs. 2013 2013 United States Sales volumes MMBbls 45 6 % 43 28 % 33 MBbls/d 124 6 116 28 91 Price per barrel $ 17.03 (52 ) $ 35.48 (7 ) $ 37.97 International Sales volumes MMBbls 2 91 % 1 NM MBbls/d 6 91 3 NM Price per barrel $ 29.85 (47 ) $ 56.16 NM $ Total Sales volumes MMBbls 47 8 % 44 31 % 33 MBbls/d 130 8 119 31 91 Price per barrel $ 17.61 (51 ) $ 36.01 (5 ) $ 37.97 Natural-gas liquids sales revenues (millions) $ 833 (47 ) $ 1,572 25 $ 1,262 _________________________________________________________________________ NM not meaningful NGLs Sales Volumes NGLs sales represent revenues from the sale of products derived from the processing of Anadarko natural-gas production. 2015 vs. 2014 The Company NGLs sales volumes increased by 11 MBbls/d. Sales volumes in the Rockies increased by 6 MBbls/d primarily in the Wattenberg field due to continued horizontal drilling and the Lancaster plant coming online in April 2014, partially offset by ethane rejection. International sales volumes increased by 3 MBbls/d as volumes increased in Algeria since the commencement of sales at the Company El Merk facility during 2014. 2014 vs. 2013 The Company NGLs sales volumes increased by 28 MBbls/d. Sales volumes in the Rockies increased by 16 MBbls/d primarily in the Wattenberg field due to increased horizontal drilling and the Lancaster plant coming online in April 2014. Sales volumes in the Southern and Appalachia Region increased by 10 MBbls/d primarily as a result of increased horizontal drilling and 2013 infrastructure expansion in the Eagleford shale. International sales volumes increased by 3 MBbls/d due to the commencement of sales at the Company El Merk facility in Algeria in 2014. NGLs Prices 2015 vs. 2014 Anadarko average NGLs price received decreased primarily due to decreased propane prices as a result of lower seasonal demand, higher NGLs production levels, and a related decline in oil prices. 2014 vs. 2013 Anadarko average NGLs price received decreased primarily due to lower prices for butanes and natural gasoline resulting from higher industry production levels and a related decline in oil prices. 59 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Gathering, Processing, and Marketing millions except percentages 2015 Inc/(Dec) vs. 2014 2014 Inc/(Dec) vs. 2013 2013 Gathering, processing, and marketing sales $ 1,226 2 % $ 1,206 16 % $ 1,039 Gathering, processing, and marketing expense 1,054 2 1,030 19 869 Total gathering, processing, and marketing, net $ 172 (2 ) $ 176 4 $ 170 Gathering and processing sales includes revenue from the sale of NGLs and remaining residue gas extracted from natural gas purchased from third parties and processed by Anadarko as well as fee revenue earned by providing gathering, processing, compression, and treating services to third parties.

As a result, items that ordinarily increase or decrease the tax rate will have the opposite effect. The decrease from the 35% U.S. federal statutory rate for the year ended December 31, 2015 , was primarily attributable to the following: tax impact from foreign operations non-deductible Algerian exceptional profits tax for Algerian income tax purposes net changes in uncertain tax positions dispositions of non-deductible goodwill The increase from the 35% U.S. federal statutory rate for the year ended December 31, 2014 , was primarily attributable to the following: net changes in uncertain tax positions related to the settlement agreement associated with the Tronox Adversary Proceeding net changes in other uncertain tax positions non-deductible Algerian exceptional profits tax for Algerian income tax purposes tax impact from foreign operations The increase from the 35% U.S. federal statutory rate for the year ended December 31, 2013 , was primarily attributable to the following: tax impact from foreign operations non-deductible Algerian exceptional profits tax for Algerian income tax purposes deferred tax adjustments For additional information on income tax rates, see Note 12 Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K.

The Company continuously monitors its liquidity needs, coordinates its capital expenditure program with its expected cash flows and projected debt-repayment schedule, and evaluates available funding alternatives in light of current and expected conditions. The Company has a variety of funding sources available, including cash on hand, an asset portfolio that provides ongoing cash-flow-generating capacity, opportunities for liquidity enhancement through divestitures and joint-venture arrangements that reduce future capital expenditures, and the Company credit facilities and commercial paper program. In addition, an effective registration statement is available to Anadarko covering the sale of WGP common units owned by the Company. Operating Activities One of the primary sources of variability in the Company cash flows from operating activities is the fluctuation in commodity prices, the impact of which Anadarko partially mitigates by entering into commodity derivatives. Sales volume changes also impact cash flow, but historically have not been as volatile as commodity prices. Anadarko cash flows from operating activities are also impacted by the costs related to continued operations and debt service. Anadarko cash flow used in operating activities in 2015 was $1.9 billion , compared to cash flows provided by operating activities of $8.5 billion in 2014 and $8.9 billion in 2013 . The decrease in 2015 was primarily due to the $5.2 billion Tronox settlement payment, decreased sales revenues primarily resulting from lower commodity prices, and a net decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses. Cash flows from operating activities for 2014 decreased due to $730 million of cash received in 2013 associated with the Algeria exceptional profits tax settlement, a $520 million income tax payment in 2014 associated with the Company divestiture of a 10% working interest in Offshore Area 1 in Mozambique, lower average oil and NGLs prices, lower natural-gas volumes, higher operating expenses, and the unfavorable impact of changes in working capital items. These decreases were substantially offset by higher average natural-gas prices, higher sales volumes for oil and NGLs, and net cash received in settlement of commodity derivative instruments. Tronox Settlement Payment In April 2014, Anadarko and Kerr-McGee entered into a settlement agreement to resolve all claims asserted in the Tronox Adversary Proceeding for $5.15 billion. In addition, the Company agreed to pay interest on that amount from April 3, 2014, through payment of the settlement, with an annual interest rate of 1.5% for the first 180 days and 1.5% plus the one-month LIBOR thereafter. In January 2015, the Company paid $5.2 billion after the settlement agreement became effective using cash on hand and borrowings. See Note 15 Contingencies Tronox Litigation in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Pension and Other Postretirement Contributions Contributions to the pension and other postretirement plans were $58 million in 2015, $136 million in 2014, and $174 million in 2013. The Company expects to contribute $46 million in 2016 to its pension and other postretirement plans. 69 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Investing Activities Capital Expenditures The following presents the Company capital expenditures: millions 2015 2014 2013 Cash Flows from Investing Activities Additions to properties and equipment and dry holes $ 6,067 $ 9,508 $ 7,721 Adjustments for capital expenditures Changes in capital accruals (226 ) (237 ) 246 Corporate acquisitions 475 Other 47 (15 ) 81 Total capital expenditures (1) $ 5,888 $ 9,256 $ 8,523 _______________________________________________________________________________ (1) Includes WES capital expenditures of $525 million in 2015 , $696 million in 2014 , and $792 million in 2013 . During 2015 , cash from operations and property divestitures were the primary sources for funding capital investments. The Company capital expenditures decreased by 36% for the year ended December 31, 2015 , primarily due to reduced development and exploration activity, which resulted in decreased development costs of $2.1 billion primarily in the Rockies and the Southern and Appalachia Region; lower exploration costs of $710 million primarily in the Southern and Appalachia Region and the Gulf of Mexico; and lower gathering, processing, and other costs of $498 million primarily due to lower expenditures for plants and gathering in the Rockies. Development acquisitions in 2014 included a spar lease buyout of $110 million in the Gulf of Mexico. These decreases were partially offset by the 2015 acquisition of certain oil and gas properties in the Delaware basin for $79 million. The Company capital expenditures increased by 9% for the year ended December 31, 2014, due to increased development costs primarily in the Wattenberg field of $663 million and in the Eagleford shale of $546 million and a spar lease buyout of $110 million in the Gulf of Mexico. The increase in the Eagleford shale was primarily due to the 2013 development drilling being funded by a third party as a result of a carried-interest agreement that was fully funded in June 2013. These 2014 increases were partially offset by 2013 acquisitions of certain oil and gas properties and related assets in the Moxa area of Wyoming for $310 million, primarily representing the fair value of the oil and gas properties acquired, and the acquisition of a 33.75% interest in gas-gathering systems located in the Marcellus shale in north-central Pennsylvania from a third party by WES for $135 million. Carried-Interest Arrangements In 2014, the Company entered into a carried-interest arrangement that requires a third party to fund $442 million of Anadarko capital costs in exchange for a 34% working interest in the Eaglebine development, located in Southeast Texas. The third-party funding is expected to cover Anadarko future capital costs in the development through 2020. At December 31, 2015 , $111 million of the $442 million carry obligation had been funded. In 2013, the Company entered into a carried-interest arrangement that requires a third party to fund $860 million of Anadarko capital costs in exchange for a 12.75% working interest in the Heidelberg development, located in the Gulf of Mexico. At December 31, 2015 , $793 million of the $860 million carry obligation had been funded. Acquisitions of Businesses In November 2014, WES acquired Nuevo Midstream, LLC (Nuevo), which owns and operates gathering and processing assets located in the Delaware basin in West Texas, for $1.557 billion, including $30 million of cash acquired. Following the acquisition, WES changed the name of Nuevo to Delaware Basin Midstream, LLC. See Note 3 Acquisitions, Divestitures, and Assets Held for Sale in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Divestitures Anadarko received pretax sales proceeds related to property divestiture transactions of $1.4 billion in 2015 , $5.0 billion in 2014 , and $567 million in 2013 .

In 2014, net proceeds from the 3.450% Senior Notes and 4.500% Senior Notes were used for general corporate purposes and net proceeds from the WES 2.600% Senior Notes and WES 5.450% Senior Notes were used to repay WES RCF borrowings and for general partnership purposes. In 2013, net proceeds from the WES 2.600% Senior Notes were used to repay WES RCF borrowings. Revolving Credit Facilities In June 2014, Anadarko entered into a $3.0 billion five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility ( Five -Year Facility) and a $2.0 billion 364-day senior unsecured revolving credit facility ( 364 -Day Facility). In January 2015, upon satisfaction of certain conditions, including the payment of the settlement related to the Tronox Adversary Proceeding, these facilities replaced the Company $5.0 billion Facility. In December 2015, the Company amended the Five-Year Facility to extend the maturity date to January 2021, and in January 2016, the Company replaced the 364-Day Facility with a new $2.0 billion 364-day senior unsecured revolving facility on identical terms that will mature in January 2017. The following summarizes the Company debt activity related to revolving credit facilities: millions 2015 2014 2013 Description Borrowings $ 1,800 $ $ 364-Day Facility 1,500 $5.0 billion Facility 400 1,160 710 WES RCF Repayments (1,800 ) 364-Day Facility (1,500 ) $5.0 billion Facility (610 ) (650 ) (710 ) WES RCF Anadarko Credit Facilities During 2015 , borrowings under the 364-Day Facility were primarily used to repay $1.5 billion of borrowings entered into in January 2015 under its $5.0 billion Facility, which were used for partial payment of the settlement related to the Tronox Adversary Proceeding and for general corporate purposes. At December 31, 2015 , the Company had no outstanding borrowings under the Five-Year Facility or the 364-Day Facility and was in compliance with all covenants therein. WES RCF During 2015, WES borrowings were primarily used for general partnership purposes, including the funding of capital expenditures. At December 31, 2015 , WES was in compliance with all covenants contained in its RCF, had outstanding borrowings under its RCF of $300 million at an interest rate of 1.73% , had outstanding letters of credit of $6 million , and had available borrowing capacity of $894 million . 71 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements During 2014, WES borrowings were primarily used to partially fund its acquisitions of DBM and Anadarko interests in Texas Express Pipeline LLC, Texas Express Gathering LLC, and Front Range Pipeline LLC and for other general partnership purposes, including the funding of capital expenditures. During 2013, WES borrowings were primarily used to fund the 2013 acquisitions of an interest in certain gas-gathering systems located in the Marcellus shale in north-central Pennsylvania and an intrastate pipeline in southwestern Wyoming, and for other general partnership purposes, including the funding of capital expenditures. For additional information on the Company revolving credit facilities, such as years of maturity, interest rates, and covenants, see Note 11 Debt and Interest Expense in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Commercial Paper Program In January 2015, the Company initiated a commercial paper program, which allows a maximum of $3.0 billion of unsecured commercial paper notes and is supported by the Company Five-Year Facility. The maturities of the commercial paper notes vary, but may not exceed 397 days. The commercial paper notes are sold under customary terms in the commercial paper market and are issued either at a discounted price to their principal face value or will bear interest at varying interest rates on a fixed or floating basis. Such discounted price or interest amounts are dependent on market conditions and the ratings assigned to the commercial paper program by credit rating agencies at the time of issuance of the commercial paper notes. During 2015, the Company had net borrowings of $250 million, which remained outstanding at December 31, 2015 , at a weighted-average interest rate of 0.98%. During 2015 , maximum outstanding borrowings under the commercial paper program were $1.4 billion and the average borrowings outstanding were $773 million with a weighted-average interest rate of 0.57%. See Note 11 Debt and Interest Expense in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information. Debt Maturities At December 31, 2015 , Anadarko scheduled debt maturities during 2016 consisted of $1.750 billion 5.950% Senior Notes scheduled to mature in September, $250 million of borrowings under the commercial paper program, and $33 million related to the senior amortizing notes associated with the TEUs. Anadarko Zero-Coupon Senior Notes due 2036 (Zero Coupons) can be put to the Company in October of each year, in whole or in part, for the then-accreted value, which will be $839 million at the next put date in October 2016. The Company classified the 5.950% Senior Notes, the Zero Coupons, and the outstanding commercial paper notes as long-term debt on the Company Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2015, as Anadarko intends to refinance these obligations prior to or at maturity with new long-term debt issuances or by using the Five-Year Facility. Anadarko may from time to time seek to retire or purchase its outstanding debt through cash purchases and/or exchanges for other debt or equity securities in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, or otherwise. Such repurchases or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, the Company liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions, and other factors. The amounts involved may be material. At December 31, 2015, Anadarko scheduled 2017 debt maturities were $2.0 billion. For additional information on the Company debt instruments, such as transactions during the period, years of maturity, and interest rates, see Note 11 Debt and Interest Expense in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Tangible Equity Units During 2015, Anadarko issued 9.2 million TEUs at a stated amount of $50.00 per TEU and raised net proceeds of $445 million. Each TEU is comprised of a prepaid equity purchase contract for WGP common units, subject to Anadarko right to elect to issue and deliver shares of Anadarko common stock in lieu of WGP common units, and a senior amortizing note due in June 2018, which bears interest at the rate of 1.50% per year. For additional information, see Note 10 Tangible Equity Units in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. During 2015, Anadarko repaid $16 million of senior amortizing notes associated with the TEUs. 72 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Derivative Instruments The Company derivative instruments are subject to individually negotiated credit provisions that may require the Company or the counterparties to provide collateral of cash or letters of credit depending on the derivative portfolio valuation versus negotiated credit thresholds. These credit thresholds may also require full or partial collateralization or immediate settlement of the Company obligations if certain credit-risk-related provisions are triggered such as if the Company credit rating from major credit rating agencies declines to a level that is below investment grade. Derivative settlements and collateralization are classified as cash flows from operating activities unless the derivatives contain an other-than-insignificant financing element, in which case the settlements and collateralization are classified as cash flows from financing activities. As of December 31, 2015, the Company provided cash collateral of $58 million on its interest-rate derivatives with an other-than-insignificant financing element. For additional information, see Note 9 Derivative Instruments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Common Stock Dividends Anadarko paid dividends to its common stockholders of $ 553 million in 2015 , $505 million in 2014 , and $274 million in 2013 . The Company increased the quarterly dividend paid to common stockholders from $0.09 per share to $0.18 per share during the third quarter of 2013 and from $0.18 per share to $0.27 per share during the second quarter of 2014. In response to the current commodity-price environment, the Company decreased the quarterly dividend to $0.05 per share in February 2016. Anadarko has paid a dividend to its common stockholders quarterly since becoming a public company in 1986. The amount of future dividends paid to Anadarko common stockholders is determined by the Board on a quarterly basis and is based on earnings, financial conditions, capital requirements, the effect a dividend payment would have on the Company compliance with relevant financial covenants, and other factors deemed relevant by the Board. Equity Transactions Anadarko sold 2.3 million WGP common units to the public and raised net proceeds of $130 million in 2015, and sold approximately 6 million WGP common units to the public and raised net proceeds of $335 million in 2014. The proceeds for both periods were used for general corporate purposes. During 2015 , WES issued 874 thousand common units to the public under its continuous offering program, which allows the issuance of up to an aggregate of $500 million of WES common units, and raised net proceeds of $57 million . The remaining amount available under this program was $442 million of WES common units at December 31, 2015 . During 2014, WES issued approximately 10 million common units to the public and raised net proceeds of $ 691 million . The proceeds were used to partially fund a portion of its DBM acquisition. WES used all the capacity to issue units under the $125 million continuous offering program as of the end of the third quarter of 2014. During 2013, WES issued approximately 12 million common units to the public, including the $125 million continuous offering program. These offerings raised net proceeds of $ 725 million , which were primarily used to repay outstanding RCF borrowings and for other general partnership purposes, including funding of WES capital expenditures. Distributions to Noncontrolling Interest Owners WES distributed to its unitholders other than Anadarko and WGP an aggregate of $231 million in 2015 , $175 million in 2014 , and $130 million in 2013 . WES has made quarterly distributions to its unitholders since its initial public offering (IPO) in the second quarter of 2008 and has increased its distribution from $0.30 per common unit for the third quarter of 2008 to $0.80 per common unit for the fourth quarter of 2015 (paid in February 2016 ). WGP distributed to its unitholders other than Anadarko an aggregate of $37 million during 2015 , $24 million in 2014 , and $12 million in 2013 . WGP has made quarterly distributions to its unitholders since its IPO in December 2012 and has increased its distribution from $0.17875 per common unit for the first quarter of 2013 to $0.40375 per unit for the fourth quarter of 2015 (to be paid in February 2016 ). 73 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Insurance Coverage and Other Indemnities Anadarko maintains property and casualty insurance that includes coverage for physical damage to the Company properties, blowout/control of a well, restoration and redrill, sudden and accidental pollution, third-party liability, workers compensation and employers liability, and other risks. Anadarko insurance coverage includes deductibles that must be met prior to recovery. Additionally, the Company insurance is subject to exclusions and limitations, and there is no assurance that such coverage will adequately protect the Company against liability or loss from all potential consequences and damages. The Company current insurance coverage includes (a) $400 million per occurrence from Oil Insurance Limited (OIL) for physical damage to Anadarko properties on a replacement cost basis, blowout/control of well, restoration and redrill, and sudden and accidental pollution; (b) $700 million per occurrence from the commercial markets for the items described in item (a) above, which is in excess of the OIL coverage and which follows the form of OIL coverage with certain exceptions; (c) $400 million from the commercial markets, which scales to Anadarko working interest, for third-party liabilities, including sudden and accidental pollution and aviation liability; and (d) $275 million for aircraft liability (in addition to the third-party liability limits described in item (c) above). Anadarko does not carry significant coverage for loss of production income from any of the Company facilities or for any losses that result from the effects of a named windstorm. The Company service agreements, including drilling contracts, generally indemnify Anadarko for injuries and death to employees of the service provider and subcontractors hired by the service provider as well as for property damage suffered by the service provider and its contractors. Also, these service agreements generally indemnify Anadarko for pollution originating from the equipment of any contractors or subcontractors hired by the service provider. Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements Anadarko may enter into off-balance-sheet arrangements and transactions that can give rise to material off-balance-sheet obligations. The Company material off-balance-sheet arrangements and transactions include operating lease arrangements and undrawn letters of credit. In addition, the Company enters into other contractual agreements in the normal course of business for processing, treating, transportation, and storage of oil, natural gas, and NGLs as well as for other oil and gas activities as discussed below in Obligations . Other than the items discussed above, there are no other transactions, arrangements, or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect Anadarko liquidity or availability of or requirements for capital resources. 74 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Obligations The following is a summary of the Company obligations at December 31, 2015 : Obligations by Period (1) millions 2016 2017-2018 2019-2020 2021 and beyond Total Total debt Principal total borrowings at face value (2) $ 2,033 $ 2,516 $ 1,200 $ 11,563 $ 17,312 Principal capital lease obligation 1 19 20 Investee entities debt (3) 2,853 2,853 Interest on borrowings 932 1,500 1,161 7,460 11,053 Interest on capital lease obligations 2 3 4 13 22 Investee entities interest (3) 50 144 173 2,351 2,718 Operating leases Drilling rig commitments 739 834 215 1,788 Production platforms 21 43 50 23 137 Other 46 79 49 18 192 Oil and gas activities 741 886 276 314 2,217 Asset retirement obligations 309 128 304 1,318 2,059 Midstream and marketing activities 1,114 2,137 1,996 2,612 7,859 Derivative liabilities (4) 54 419 513 500 1,486 Uncertain tax positions, interest, and penalties (5) 418 65 1,307 1,790 Environmental liabilities 24 25 32 64 145 Other 116 116 Total $ 6,483 $ 8,895 $ 5,974 $ 30,415 $ 51,767 _______________________________________________________________________________ (1) This table does not include litigation-related contingent liabilities or the Company pension and postretirement benefit obligations. See Note 15 Contingencies and Note 16 Pension Plans, Other Postretirement Benefits, and Defined-Contribution Plans in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. (2) Includes the fully accreted principal amount of the Zero Coupons of approximately $2.4 billion as coming due after 2020 . While the Zero Coupons do not mature until 2036, the outstanding Zero Coupons can be put to the Company each October, in whole or in part, for the then-accreted value. The Company could be required to repurchase the outstanding Zero Coupons at $839 million in October 2016 (the next potential put date). (3) Anadarko has legal right of setoff and intends to net-settle its obligations under each of the notes payable to the investees with the distributable value of its interest in the corresponding investee. Accordingly, the investments and the obligations are presented net on the Company Consolidated Balance Sheets in other long-term liabilities other for all periods presented. These notes payable provide for a variable rate of interest, reset quarterly. Therefore, future interest payments presented in the table above are estimated using the forward LIBOR rate curve. Further, the above table does not reflect the preferred return that Anadarko receives on its investment in these entities, which is also LIBOR-based, but with a lower margin than the margin on the associated notes payable. See Note 8 Equity-Method Investments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. (4) Represents Anadarko gross derivative liability after taking into account the impacts of netting margin and collateral balances deposited with counterparties. See Note 9 Derivative Instruments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. (5) See Note 12 Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. 75 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Operating Leases Operating lease obligations include approximately $1.7 billion related to five offshore drilling vessels and $98 million related to certain contracts for U.S. onshore drilling rigs. Anadarko manages its access to rigs to support the execution of its drilling strategy over the next several years. Lease payments associated with the drilling of exploratory wells and development wells, net of amounts billed to partners, will initially be capitalized as a component of oil and gas properties, and either depreciated or impaired in future periods or written off as exploration expense. At December 31, 2015 , the Company had $329 million in various commitments under non-cancelable operating lease agreements for production platforms and equipment, buildings, facilities, compressors, and aircraft. For additional information, see Note 14 Commitments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Oil and Gas Activities At December 31, 2015 , Anadarko had various long-term contractual commitments pertaining to exploration, development, and production activities that extend beyond 2015 . The Company has work-related commitments for, among other things, drilling wells, obtaining and processing seismic data, and fulfilling rig commitments. The preceding table includes long-term drilling and work-related commitments of $2.2 billion , comprised of approximately $1.5 billion related to the United States and $728 million related to international locations. Asset Retirement Obligations Anadarko is obligated to fund the costs of disposing of long-lived assets upon their abandonment. The majority of Anadarko asset retirement obligations (AROs) relate to the plugging of wells and the related abandonment of oil and gas properties. The Company AROs are recorded at estimated fair value, measured by reference to the expected future cash outflows required to satisfy the retirement obligation discounted at the Company credit-adjusted risk-free interest rate. Revisions to estimated AROs can result from changes in retirement cost estimates, revisions to estimated inflation rates, and changes in the estimated timing of abandonment. Midstream and Marketing Activities Anadarko has entered into various processing, transportation, storage, and purchase agreements to access markets and provide flexibility to sell its oil, natural gas, and NGLs in certain areas. Environmental Liabilities Anadarko is subject to various environmental-remediation and reclamation obligations arising from federal, state, tribal, and local laws and regulations. At December 31, 2015 , the Company Consolidated Balance Sheet included a $145 million liability for remediation and reclamation obligations. The Company continually monitors the liability recorded and ongoing remediation and reclamation activities, and believes the amount recorded is appropriate. For additional information on environmental issues, see Risk Factors under Item 1A of this Form 10-K. 76 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP) requires management to make informed judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for discussion of the Company significant accounting policies. Changes in facts and circumstances or additional information may result in revised estimates, and actual results may differ from these estimates. Management considers the following to be its most critical accounting estimates that involve judgment. The selection, development, and disclosure of these estimates is discussed with the Company Audit Committee. Proved Reserves Anadarko estimates its proved oil and gas reserves according to the definition of proved reserves provided by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Financial Accounting Standards Board. This definition includes oil, natural gas, and NGLs that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be economically producible in future periods from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions, operating methods, government regulations, etc. (at prices and costs as of the date the estimates are made). Prices include consideration of price changes provided only by contractual arrangements, and do not include adjustments based on expected future conditions. For reserves information, see Oil and Gas Properties and Activities Proved Reserves under Items 1 and 2 of this Form 10-K and the Supplemental Information on Oil and Gas Exploration and Production Activities under Item 8 of this Form 10-K. The Company estimates of proved reserves are made using available geological and reservoir data as well as production performance data. These estimates are reviewed annually by internal reservoir engineers and revised, either upward or downward, as warranted by additional data. Revisions are necessary due to changes in, among other things, development plans, reservoir performance, prices, economic conditions, and governmental restrictions as well as changes in the expected recovery associated with infill drilling. Decreases in prices, for example, may cause a reduction in some proved reserves due to reaching economic limits at an earlier projected date. The quantities of estimated proved oil and gas reserves are a significant component of DD&A. A material adverse change in the estimated volumes of proved reserves could have a negative impact on DD&A and could result in property impairments. If the estimates of proved reserves used in the unit-of-production calculations had been lower by five percent across all properties, DD&A in 2015 would have increased by approximately $223 million. Exploratory Costs Under the successful efforts method of accounting, exploratory costs associated with a well discovering hydrocarbons are initially capitalized, or suspended, pending a determination as to whether a commercially sufficient quantity of proved reserves can be attributed to the area as a result of drilling. At the end of each quarter, management reviews the status of all suspended exploratory drilling costs in light of ongoing exploration activities, in particular, whether the Company is making sufficient progress in its ongoing exploration and appraisal efforts or, in the case of discoveries requiring government sanctioning, analyzing whether development negotiations are underway and proceeding as planned. If management determines that future appraisal drilling or development activities are unlikely to occur, associated suspended exploratory well costs are expensed. Therefore, at any point in time, the Company may have capitalized costs on its Consolidated Balance Sheets associated with exploratory wells that may be charged to exploration expense in future periods. See Note 6 Suspended Exploratory Well Costs in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information. 77 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Fair Value The Company estimates fair value of long-lived assets for impairment testing, reporting units for goodwill impairment testing when necessary, assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination or exchanged in non-monetary transactions, pension plan assets, and initial measurements of AROs. When the Company is required to measure fair value and there is not a market-observable price for the asset or liability or for a similar asset or liability, the Company uses the cost, income, or market valuation approaches depending on the quality of information available to support management assumptions. The cost approach is based on management best estimate of the current asset replacement cost. The income approach is based on management best assumptions regarding expectations of projected cash flows, and discounts the expected cash flows using a commensurate risk-adjusted discount rate. The market approach is based on management best assumptions regarding prices and other relevant information from market transactions involving comparable assets. Such evaluations involve significant judgment and the results are based on expected future events or conditions such as sales prices, estimates of future oil and gas production or throughput, development and operating costs and the timing thereof, future net cash flows, economic and regulatory climates, and other factors, most of which are often outside of management control. However, assumptions used reflect a market participant view of long-term prices, costs, and other factors, and are consistent with assumptions used in the Company business plans and investment decisions. Property Impairments When circumstances indicate that proved oil and gas properties may be impaired, the expected undiscounted future net cash flows of the asset group are compared to the carrying amount of the asset. If the expected undiscounted future net cash flows, based on the Company estimate of future oil and natural-gas prices, operating costs, anticipated production from proved reserves and other relevant data, are lower than the carrying amount, the carrying amount is reduced to fair value. Fair value estimates require significant judgment and oil and natural-gas prices are a significant component of the fair-value estimate. Prices have exhibited significant volatility in the past, and the Company expects that volatility to continue in the future. A long-lived asset other than an unproved oil and gas property is evaluated for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying value may be greater than its undiscounted future net cash flows. Impairment, if any, is measured as the excess of an asset carrying amount over its estimated fair value. The Company uses a variety of fair-value measurement techniques as discussed above when market information for the same or similar assets does not exist. Goodwill Impairments The Company tests goodwill for impairment annually in October (or more frequently as circumstances dictate). The Company first assesses whether an impairment of goodwill is indicated through a qualitative assessment to determine the likelihood of whether the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the Company concludes it is more likely than not that fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the related carrying amount, then goodwill is not impaired and further testing is not necessary. If the qualitative assessment indicates fair value of the reporting unit may be less than its carrying amount, the Company compares the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to which goodwill is assigned to the carrying amount of the associated net assets, including goodwill, and determines whether impairment is necessary. When evaluating whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the Company assesses relevant events and circumstances, including the following: significant changes in the stock price of Anadarko, WES, and WGP changes in commodity prices changes in cost factors such as costs of drilling; production costs; and gathering, processing, and other transportation costs impairments recognized by the Company acquisitions and disposals of assets 78 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements changes to the Company reserves, including changes due to fluctuations in commodity prices and updates to the Company plans or forecasts changes in trading multiples for midstream peers Because quoted market prices for the Company reporting units are not available, management applies judgment in determining the estimated fair value of reporting units for purposes of performing goodwill impairment tests, when such tests are necessary. Management uses information available to make these fair-value estimates, including the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates commensurate with the risks associated with the assets and observable for the oil and gas exploration and production reporting unit, control premiums and market multiples of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) for the gathering and processing and transportation reporting units. In estimating the fair value of its oil and gas exploration and production reporting unit, the Company assumes production profiles used in its estimation of reserves that are disclosed in the Company supplemental oil and gas disclosures, market prices based on the forward price curve for oil and gas at the test date (adjusted for location and quality differentials), capital and operating costs consistent with pricing and expected inflation rates, and discount rates that management believes a market participant would use based upon the risks inherent in Anadarko operations. Management also includes control premium assumptions based on observable market information regarding how a market participant would value the oil and gas exploration and production reporting unit as a whole rather than as individual properties that are part of an oil and gas portfolio. The Company estimates fair value for the WES gathering and processing, WES transportation, and other gathering and processing reporting units by applying an estimated multiple to projected EBITDA. The Company considered observable transactions in the market and trading multiples for peers in determining an appropriate multiple to apply against the Company projected EBITDA for these reporting units. A lower fair-value estimate in the future for any of these reporting units could result in impairment of goodwill. Factors that could trigger a lower fair-value estimate include prolonged low or further declines in commodity prices, decreases in proved reserves, changes in exploration or development plans, significant property impairments, increases in operating or drilling costs, significant changes in regulations, or other negative changes to the economic environment in which Anadarko operates. Environmental Obligations and Other Contingencies Management makes judgments and estimates when it establishes liabilities for environmental remediation, litigation, and other contingent matters. Estimates of litigation-related liabilities are based on the facts and circumstances of the individual case and on information currently available to the Company. The extent of information available varies based on the status of the litigation and the Company evaluation of the claim and legal arguments. In future periods, a number of factors could significantly change the Company estimate of litigation-related liabilities including discovery activities; briefings filed with the relevant court; rulings from the court made pre-trial, during trial, or at the conclusion of any trial; and similar cases involving other plaintiffs and defendants that may set or change legal precedent. As events unfold throughout the litigation process, the Company evaluates the available information and may consult with third-party legal counsel to determine whether liability accruals should be established or adjusted. Estimates of environmental liabilities are based on a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, the stage of investigation, the stage of the remedial design, evaluation of existing remediation technologies, and presently enacted laws and regulations. In future periods, a number of factors could significantly change the Company estimate of environmental-remediation costs such as changes in laws and regulations, changes in the interpretation or administration of laws and regulations, revisions to the remedial design, unanticipated construction problems, identification of additional areas or volumes of contaminated soil and groundwater, and changes in costs of labor, equipment, and technology. Consequently, it is not possible for management to reliably estimate the amount and timing of all future expenditures that could arise related to environmental or other contingent matters and actual costs may vary significantly from the Company estimates. The Company in-house legal counsel and environmental personnel regularly assess contingent liabilities and, in certain circumstances, consult with third-party legal counsel or consultants to assist in the evaluation of the Company liability for these contingencies. 79 Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements Income Taxes The amount of income taxes recorded by the Company requires interpretations of complex rules and regulations of various tax jurisdictions throughout the world. The Company has recognized deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences, operating losses, and tax-credit carryforwards. The Company routinely assesses the realizability of its deferred tax assets by analyzing the reversal periods of available net operating loss carryforwards and credit carryforwards, temporary differences in tax assets and liabilities, the availability of tax planning strategies, and estimates of future taxable income and other factors. Estimates of future taxable income are based on assumptions of oil and gas reserves and selling prices that are consistent with the Company internal business forecasts. If the Company concludes that it is more likely than not that some of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, the tax asset is reduced by a valuation allowance. The Company routinely assesses potential uncertain tax positions and, if required, establishes accruals for such amounts. The accruals for deferred tax assets and liabilities, including deferred state income tax assets and liabilities, are subject to significant judgment by management and are reviewed and adjusted routinely based on changes in facts and circumstances. Although management considers its tax accruals adequate, material changes in these accruals may occur in the future, based on the progress of ongoing tax audits, changes in legislation, and resolution of pending tax matters.
