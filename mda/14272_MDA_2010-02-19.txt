Item 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. Executive Summary Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (which may be referred to as Bristol-Myers Squibb, BMS, the Company, we, our or us) is a global biopharmaceutical company, consisting of global pharmaceutical/biotechnology and international consumer medicines businesses, whose mission is to discover, develop and deliver innovative medicines that help patients prevail over serious diseases. We license, manufacture, market, distribute and sell products on a global basis. In February 2009, Mead Johnson Nutrition Company (Mead Johnson) completed an initial public offering (IPO) of its Class A common stock. Post IPO, we held an 83.1% interest in Mead Johnson. On December 23, 2009, we completed an exchange offer of our previously held 170 million shares of Mead Johnson for 269 million outstanding shares of our stock. Mead Johnson financial results, previously reported as a separate segment, have been reported as discontinued operations for all years presented. We continued to execute our string-of-pearls strategy in 2009 with the acquisition of Medarex, Inc. (Medarex) in September 2009, and through the various collaboration agreements entered into during the year. The divestiture of Mead Johnson and continued execution of the string-of-pearls strategy has allowed us to become a more focused biopharmaceutical company. We are meeting our productivity transformation initiative (PTI) objectives and have implemented a culture of continuous improvement. 2009 Financial Highlights The following table is a summary of operating activity: Year Ended December 31, Dollars in Millions, except per share data 2009 2008 Net Sales $ 18,808 $ 17,715 BioPharmaceutical Segment Results 4,492 3,538 Net Earnings from Continuing Operations Attributable to BMS 3,239 2,697 Net Earnings from Discontinued Operations Attributable to BMS 7,373 2,550 Net Earnings Attributable to BMS 10,612 5,247 Diluted Earnings Per Share from Continuing Operations Attributable to BMS 1.63 1.35 Non-GAAP Diluted Earnings Per Share from Continuing Operations Attributable to BMS 1.85 1.49 Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities 9,883 8,453 Net Sales Net sales increased 6%, or 8% excluding an unfavorable foreign exchange impact. U.S. net sales increased 12% to $11.9 billion in 2009. International net sales decreased 3%, or increased 3% excluding an unfavorable foreign exchange impact, to $6.9 billion. Sales growth in 2009 was led by continued increases in PLAVIX* (clopidogrel bisulfate) of 10%, and ABILIFY* (aripiprazole) of 20%. The virology portfolio continued to demonstrate strong sales growth in 2009, led by BARACLUDE (entecavir) of 36%, the SUSTIVA (efavirenz) Franchise of 11% and REYATAZ (atazanavir sulfate) of 8%. Worldwide growth of ORENCIA (abatacept) of 37% and SPRYCEL (dasatinib) of 36%. ERBITUX (cetuximab) net sales were down 9%. ONGLYZA (saxagliptin), a DPP-IV inhibitor, has been submitted to regulatory authorities in more than 50 countries, approved in 36 and, beginning in the third quarter of 2009, launched in six countries - the United States (U.S.), Canada, Mexico, Germany, the United Kingdom (UK) and Denmark. Net sales were $24 million in 2009. 35 Table of Contents BioPharmaceutical Segment Results The increase in BioPharmaceutical segment results is attributed to: Increased net sales of various key products noted above. More favorable gross margin percentage attributed to favorable foreign exchange, higher average selling prices, a more favorable product mix and realized efficiencies from PTI. More efficient and reduced spending within marketing, selling and administrative. Partially offset by increased investments within our research and development pipeline. Net Earnings from Continuing Operations Attributable to Bristol-Myers Squibb Company The increase is attributed to: Improved segment results. Partially offset by unfavorable impact of specified items in 2009 the prior year includes a gain on sale of ImClone Systems Incorporated (ImClone) shares. Additional taxes on higher income levels; however, the effective tax rate was reduced by 170 basis points to 21.1%. Net Earnings from Discontinued Operations Attributable to Bristol-Myers Squibb Company In 2009, we completed the split-off of Mead Johnson resulting in an after-tax gain of approximately $7.2 billion. The results of the Mead Johnson business and related gain are included in discontinued operations for all years presented. In addition to the results of Mead Johnson, the 2008 results include a $2.0 billion after-tax gain on the divestiture of ConvaTec, a $43 million after-tax loss on the divestiture of Medical Imaging and their operating results prior to the divestitures. Diluted Earnings Per Share from Continuing Operations Diluted earnings per share (EPS) from continuing operations increased 21% during 2009 due to the improved operating results driven by the activities discussed above. The EPS impact of the 269 million share reduction resulting from the Mead Johnson split-off was minimal due to the relatively short period that the lower share count was outstanding. Our non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP earnings from continuing operations and related EPS information, are adjusted to exclude certain costs, expenses, gains and losses and other specified items. Our non-GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations increased 24% during 2009 after adjusting for specified items of $428 million in 2009 and $278 million in 2008. For a detailed listing of all specified items and further information and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures, see Specified Items and Non-GAAP Financial Measures below. Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities Sources of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities included $4.1 billion generated from operating activities; net proceeds from Mead Johnson issuance of various notes and draw down from their credit facility of $1.7 billion, which were used to repay intercompany loans prior to the split-off; net proceeds of $782 million from the Mead Johnson IPO, and proceeds of $456 million from the sale of various mature businesses and trademarks. These sources were more than adequate to fund dividend payments of $2.5 billion, Medarex business acquisition of $2.3 billion and capital expenditures of $730 million. Business Environment We conduct our business primarily within the pharmaceutical/biotechnology industry, which is highly competitive and subject to numerous government regulations. Many competitive factors may significantly affect sales of our products, including product efficacy, safety, price and cost-effectiveness; marketing effectiveness; product labeling; quality control and quality assurance of our manufacturing operations; and research and development of new products. To successfully compete for business in the healthcare industry, we must demonstrate that our products offer medical benefits as well as cost advantages. Currently, most of our new product introductions compete with other products already on the market in the same therapeutic category, in addition to potential competition of new products that competitors may introduce in the future. We manufacture branded products, which are priced higher than generic products. Generic competition is one of our leading challenges globally. In the pharmaceutical/biotechnology industry, the majority of an innovative product commercial value is usually realized during the period that the product has market exclusivity. When a product loses exclusivity, it is no longer protected by a patent and is subject to new competing products in the form of generic brands. Upon exclusivity loss, we can lose a major portion of that product sales in a short period of time. Currently, generic versions of biological products cannot be approved under U.S. law. 36 Table of Contents However, the law could change in the future. Even in the absence of new legislation, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is taking steps toward allowing generic versions of certain biologics. Competitors seeking approval of biological products must file their own safety and efficacy data and address the challenges of biologics manufacturing, which involve more complex processes which are more costly than those of traditional pharmaceutical operations. Both in the U.S. and internationally, the healthcare industry is subject to various government-imposed regulations authorizing prices or price controls that have and will continue to have an impact on our net sales. In the U.S., Congress and some state legislatures have considered a number of proposals and have enacted laws that could result in major changes in the current healthcare system, either nationally or at the state level. Driven in part by budget concerns, Medicaid access and reimbursement restrictions have been implemented in some states and proposed in many others. In addition, the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act provides outpatient prescription drug coverage to senior citizens in the U.S. This legislation has had a modest favorable impact on us as a result of an increase in the number of seniors with drug coverage. At the same time, there continues to be a potential negative impact on the U.S. biopharmaceuticals business that could result from pricing pressures or controls. In many markets outside the U.S., we operate in environments of government-mandated, cost-containment programs, or under other regulatory bodies or groups that can exert downward pressure on pricing. Pricing freedom is limited in the UK, for instance, by the operation of a profit control plan and in Germany by the operation of a reference price system. Companies also face significant delays in market access for new products as more than two years can elapse after drug approval before new medicines become available in some countries. The growth of Managed Care Organizations (MCOs) in the U.S. has played a large role in the competition that surrounds the healthcare industry. MCOs seek to reduce healthcare expenditures for participants by making volume purchases and entering into long-term contracts to negotiate discounts with various pharmaceutical providers. Because of the market potential created by the large pool of participants, marketing prescription drugs to MCOs has become an important part of our strategy. Companies compete for inclusion in MCO formularies and we generally have been successful in having our major products included. We believe that developments in the managed care industry, including continued consolidation, have had and will continue to have a generally downward pressure on prices. Pharmaceutical/biotechnology production processes are complex, highly regulated and vary widely from product to product. Shifting or adding manufacturing capacity can be a lengthy process requiring significant capital expenditures and regulatory approvals. Biologics manufacturing involves more complex processes than those of traditional pharmaceutical operations. As biologics become a larger percentage of our product portfolio, we will continue to make arrangements with third-party manufacturers and to make substantial investments to increase our internal capacity to produce biologics on a commercial scale. One such investment is a new, state-of-the-art manufacturing facility for the production of biologics in Devens, Massachusetts, the construction of which was substantially completed in 2009. We expect to submit the site for regulatory approval in 2011. We have maintained a competitive position in the market and strive to uphold this position, which is dependent on our success in discovering, developing and delivering innovative, cost-effective products to help patients prevail over serious diseases. We are the subject of a number of significant pending lawsuits, claims, proceedings and investigations. It is not possible at this time to reasonably assess the final outcomes of these investigations or litigations. For additional discussion of legal matters, see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 24. Legal Proceedings and Contingencies. Strategy We continue to execute our multi-year strategy which has allowed us to transform into a next-generation biopharmaceutical company. The strategy encompasses all aspects and all geographies of the business and has yielded and will continue to yield substantial cost savings and cost avoidance which increases our financial flexibility to take advantage of attractive market opportunities that may arise. With the completion of the Mead Johnson split-off as well as the prior year dispositions of the ConvaTec and Medical Imaging businesses, we are now operating within our core biopharmaceutical business focus. In 2009, we completed the sale of our mature brands businesses and related manufacturing facilities in the Asia-Pacific region, China, Pakistan, Egypt and Australia. We are also reducing the number of facilities in our global manufacturing network. We are also allocating resources to continue our string-of-pearls strategy and enable strategic transactions, which could range from collaboration and license agreements to the acquisition of companies. In September 2009, we completed our acquisition of Medarex and entered into or restructured collaboration agreements with various companies during 2009, including Alder Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Alder), Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (Otsuka), ZymoGenetics, Inc. (ZymoGenetics), and Eli Lilly and Company (Lilly) in January 2010. 37 Table of Contents Managing costs is another part of our overall strategy. We have implemented all PTI initiatives resulting in the incurrence of $1.3 billion in costs. We are on target to create a total of $2.5 billion in annual productivity savings and cost avoidance by 2012 of which approximately 90% is expected to be realized by the end of 2010. Subsequent to the PTI, we have further implemented a strategic process designed to achieve a culture of continuous improvement to enhance efficiency, effectiveness and competitiveness and to continue to improve our cost base. We will continue to focus on the development of our biopharmaceuticals business and will maintain growth by investing in research and development as well as in key growth products, including specialty and biologic medicines and cardiovascular and metabolic drugs. ONGLYZA has been submitted to regulatory authorities in more than 50 countries, approved in 36 and, beginning in the third quarter of 2009, launched in six countries the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Germany, the UK and Denmark. We have refined our focus on emerging markets which represent significant opportunities for growth. We have identified five emerging markets on which to focus Brazil, Russia, India, China and Turkey. The emerging public health interests of these countries best align with our strategy as well as our current portfolio and pipeline. Product and Pipeline Developments Belatacept In September 2009, we announced that the FDA has accepted, for filing and review, our submission of a biologic license application for belatacept, which is under development for use in kidney transplantation. The Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) goal for FDA action is May 1, 2010. In January 2010, the FDA announced that its Cardiovascular and Renal Drugs Advisory Committee plans to meet on March 1, 2010 to provide advice regarding this application. In May 2009, belatacept, an investigational co-stimulation blocker being studied for use in solid organ transplantation, was the subject of nine company-sponsored clinical presentations (including the first Phase III data) at the American Transplant Congress. The data suggest that belatacept may represent a promising therapeutic option for kidney transplant patients. Dapagliflozin In October 2009, we announced results from a 24-week Phase III clinical study, which demonstrated that the investigational drug dapagliflozin, added to metformin, provided significant mean reductions in the primary endpoint, glycosylated hemoglobin level (HbA1c) and in the secondary endpoint, fasting plasma glucose in patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with metformin alone, as compared to placebo plus metformin. The study also showed that individuals receiving dapagliflozin had statistically greater mean reduction in body weight compared to individuals taking placebo. In June 2009, at the American Diabetes Association Annual Scientific Sessions, a 12-week study of dapagliflozin was presented which demonstrated improved glycemic control in inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes patients who were treated with high doses of insulin and common oral anti-diabetic medicines. In March 2009, the Company and AstraZeneca PLC (AstraZeneca) published findings from a 12-week, Phase IIb dose-ranging study that dapagliflozin produced clinically meaningful reductions across all key glycemic measures studied in treatment-naive type 2 diabetes patients, compared to placebo. The study findings also showed that patients receiving dapagliflozin experienced greater reductions in body weight compared to patients on placebo. Apixaban In December 2009, the Company and Pfizer Inc. (Pfizer) announced plans to submit a regulatory filing in the first half of 2010 for apixaban in Europe. The companies plan to file for regulatory approval of apixaban for the prevention of venous thromboembolism after orthopedic surgery. The application will be supported by ADVANCE-2 and ADVANCE-3, two clinical trials that evaluated apixaban versus the European dosing regimen of enoxaparin for prevention of VTE in patients undergoing orthopedic surgery. Apixaban is a novel, oral, highly-selective Factor Xa inhibitor, a new class of agents being studied for the potential to prevent and treat blood clots in the veins and arteries. In July 2009, the results of the apixaban ADVANCE-2 study were presented at a late-breaking clinical trial session at the Congress of the International Society of Thrombosis and Hemostasis. The study results demonstrated that apixaban was superior to the European regimen of enoxaparin (standard of care) for reducing the risk of venous thromboembolism in patients undergoing total knee replacement surgery and showed lower observed bleeding rates compared to enoxaparin. The study also showed that the overall safety profile for apixaban was similar to enoxaparin. In March 2009, the Company and Pfizer initiated a Phase III program for the treatment of Acute Coronary Syndrome. 38 Table of Contents Ipilimumab In May 2009, the Company and Medarex announced, at the American Society of Clinical Oncology annual meeting, that updated survival results from follow-up extensions of three Phase II studies show a two-year survival ranging from 30% to 42% in patients with advanced metastatic melanoma (Stage III or IV). NTC-801 In March 2009, we announced a global collaboration with Nissan Chemical Industries, Ltd. and Teijin Pharma Limited (Nissan) for the development and commercialization of NTC-801, a selective inhibitor of the acetylcholine-activated potassium ion channel, currently in Phase I development in Japan, for the maintenance of normal sinus rhythm in patients with atrial fibrillation. PEG-Interferon Lambda In November 2009, at the 60 th Annual Meeting of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases, the Company and ZymoGenetics presented final Phase Ib results for PEG-Interferon lambda in hepatitis C. Antiviral activity was seen at all dose levels tested and the results support moving to dose-ranging Phase II studies in treatment-na ve hepatitis C patients. In January 2009, we announced a global collaboration with ZymoGenetics on our PEG-Interferon lambda, a novel type 3 interferon currently in Phase Ib development for the treatment of hepatitis C. In April 2009, the Company and ZymoGenetics announced positive 4-week results of PEG-Interferon lambda with ribavirin for the treatment of hepatitis C from an ongoing Phase Ib clinical trial. XL184 In October 2009, the Company and Exelixis, Inc. (Exelixis) reported new Phase II data for the developmental compound XL184 in patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the most common and aggressive form of brain cancer. XL184 showed promising activity in GBM patients receiving a daily dose of 125 milligrams of the compound. In May 2009, the Company and Exelixis reported, at the American Society of Clinical Oncology annual meeting, encouraging data from an ongoing Phase II trial of XL184 in patients with previously-treated GBM. ABILIFY* In November 2009, the Company and Otsuka announced that the FDA approved ABILIFY* for the treatment of irritability associated with autistic disorder in pediatric patients (ages 6 to 17 years). In November 2009, the Company and Otsuka following discussions with the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP), withdrew the marketing authorization application in the EU for a new indication for ABILIFY* in the treatment of major depressive episodes, as an adjunctive therapy, in patients who have had an inadequate response to previous treatment with antidepressants. ERBITUX* In September 2009, at the European Cancer Organisation and European Society of Medical Oncology Multidisciplinary Congress, data was presented on two Phase III ERBITUX* studies in first-line metastatic colorectal cancer patients. A retrospective analysis of the Phase III CRYSTAL study demonstrated that ERBITUX*, when added to a FOLFIRI chemotherapy regimen, was shown to increase progression-free survival (PFS) median overall survival in first-line metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients compared to those receiving FOLFIRI alone. In a subset of patients with mCRC who have tumors without K-ras mutations (commonly referred to as wild-type K-ras ), median overall survival was increased to 23.5 months in patients who received ERBITUX* plus FOLFIRI compared to 20 months for those taking FOLFIRI alone. Another Phase III study of ERBITUX* plus chemotherapy (primarily capecitabine plus oxaliplatin) in first-line mCRC, known as COIN, was conducted in the UK by the Medical Research Council. The COIN study did not meet its primary endpoint of overall survival. In July 2009, the Company and Lilly announced that the FDA had approved revisions to the U.S. prescribing information for ERBITUX* concerning the treatment of patients with an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-expressing mCRC. The labeling revisions include a modification which states that ERBITUX* is not recommended for patients whose tumors had K-ras mutations in codon 12 or 13. An estimated 40% of patients with mCRC have tumors with such K-ras mutations while approximately 60% of patients with mCRC have tumors without K-ras mutations. In March 2009, the Company and Lilly announced that the companies received a complete response letter from the FDA for the first-line squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for ERBITUX*. In its complete response letter the FDA requested an additional pharmacokinetic study to confirm the comparability of ERBITUX* used in 39 Table of Contents the first-line head and neck submission as compared to the ERBITUX* currently marketed in the United States. As previously announced, the Company and Lilly recently withdrew the advanced non-small cell lung cancer sBLA for ERBITUX* because of the same matter. In both cases, the companies continue to work with the FDA to confirm pharmacokinetic comparability. IXEMPRA In March 2009, we withdrew our marketing authorization application for IXEMPRA (ixabepilone), which was submitted to the European Medicines Agency in September 2007. ALD518 In November 2009, the Company and Alder entered into a global agreement for the development and commercialization of ALD518, a novel biologic that has completed Phase IIa development for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. ALD518 is a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting IL-6. PLAVIX* In November 2009, the U.S. PLAVIX* label was updated with new warnings on the use of PRILOSEC* (omeprazole) and certain other drugs that could interfere with PLAVIX* by reducing its effectiveness. The label was also updated to include warnings about the variability of response attributed to CYP 2C19 genetic polymorphisms. The company and sanofi are currently in discussions with the FDA regarding possible additional changes to the U.S. PLAVIX* label. In August 2009, the OASIS study group presented initial results of the CURRENT-OASIS 7 clinical trial at the European Society of Cardiology congress in Barcelona. The large-scale, global study provided information about an intensified dose-regimen of PLAVIX* in acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients managed by an early invasive strategy with an intent for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The study showed no added benefit on the composite primary end-point (cardiovascular death, heart attack or stroke at 30 days) with the higher dose in the entire ACS study population. For clinically relevant subgroups pre-specified for preliminary analysis, such as the PCI group (70% of the trial population), potentially medically relevant differences in patient outcomes were observed. In those subgroups, analysis showed an improvement in outcome for PCI patients taking the higher PLAVIX* dose regimen (600 mg loading/150 mg for days 2-7/75 mg for days 8-30) over the standard dose regimen (300 mg loading/75 mg for days 2-30), as shown by a 15% reduction of the same composite end-point of cardiovascular death, heart attack and stroke. There was a statistically significant increase in the primary safety endpoint of major bleeding with the high-dose compared to the standard-dose PLAVIX* regimen in both the overall trial population and the PCI population. In March 2009, the Company and sanofi-aventis (sanofi) announced new findings from their Active A trial. The investigational study on PLAVIX* provided results that demonstrated that, for patients with atrial fibrillation who were at increased risk for stroke and could not take an oral anticoagulant, taking PLAVIX* in addition to aspirin significantly reduced major vascular events by 11% over aspirin alone. The greatest benefit was in reduction of stroke by 28%, which is the primary goal of physicians treating patients with atrial fibrillation. Compared to aspirin alone, taking PLAVIX* in addition to aspirin significantly and as expected increased the rate of major bleeding. ONGLYZA In December 2009, the Company and AstraZeneca submitted an application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for a fixed dose combination of ONGLYZA plus metformin HCl extended-release tablets. The FDA is currently reviewing the submission. In October 2009, the Company and AstraZeneca announced that the European Commission has granted marketing authorization for ONGLYZA, a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor, in all 27 countries of the European Union to treat type 2 diabetes in adults with either metformin, a sulfonylurea or a thiazolidinedione, when any of these other agents alone, with diet and exercise, does not provide adequate glycemic control. In October 2009, the Company and AstraZeneca announced results of the 18-week Phase IIIb study in adults with type 2 diabetes with inadequate glycemic control on metformin therapy alone found that the addition of ONGLYZA 5mg per day to metformin treatment achieved the primary objective of demonstrating non-inferiority compared to the addition of JANUVIA*(sitagliptin) 100mg per day to metformin treatment in reducing HbA1c from baseline. In July 2009, the Company and AstraZeneca announced that the FDA approved ONGLYZA. ONGLYZA is indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve blood sugar (glycemic) control in adults for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. ONGLYZA once daily can be used in combination with commonly prescribed oral anti-diabetic medications, metformin, sulfonylureas or thiazolidinediones, or as a monotherapy to significantly reduce glycosylated hemoglobin levels. 40 Table of Contents In June 2009, at the American Diabetes Association Annual Scientific Sessions, interim analysis (at 102 weeks) of a 42-month long-term Phase III extension study was presented which showed that when ONGLYZA was added to metformin in patients with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes, the profile of adverse events was consistent with that seen at 24 weeks, and the treatment regimen produced long-term glycemic improvement. ORENCIA In January 2010, the European Commission approved ORENCIA in combination with methotrexate for the treatment of moderate to severe active polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis in pediatric patients six years of age and older who have had an insufficient response to other disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs, including at least one TNF inhibitor. In October 2009, we announced that new clinical data support continued development of a subcutaneous administration of ORENCIA for patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis. The subcutaneous program utilizes a new formulation of ORENCIA, which has been specifically designed for subcutaneous administration. These data, from a 4-month open-label trial involving 100 patients, were presented at the American College of Rheumatology Annual Scientific Meeting. The study showed that weekly administration of a 125 mg subcutaneous dose of ORENCIA resulted in minimal, transient immunogenicity prior to month 4 after repeat dosing. The immunogenicity was similar whether ORENCIA was administered in combination with methotrexate, a common treatment for rheumatoid arthritis, or as a monotherapy. At month four, patients had no antibody response to subcutaneous ORENCIA. In October 2009, we announced two-year results of a study that supports use of ORENCIA for methotrexate-na ve patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis of less than or equal to two years duration. The data from the AGREE study, which compared patients treated with ORENCIA plus methotrexate versus patients treated with methotrexate alone, show that patients taking ORENCIA in combination with methotrexate achieved sustained low disease activity scores at 24 months. The data also showed that ORENCIA plus methotrexate can inhibit radiographic progression of rheumatoid arthritis and improve physical function in addition to relieving pain, swelling and fatigue. The safety profile for the open-label period was similar to the double-blind period of the study. In August 2009, we announced that clinical data added to the labeling for ORENCIA support use of ORENCIA for patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis of less than or equal to two years duration. The efficacy and safety data further support use of ORENCIA in new-to-biologic patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis. In June 2009, we announced, at the Annual European Congress of Rheumatology (EULAR), the results of two studies that demonstrated the consistent safety and effectiveness over five and seven years of treatment in rheumatoid arthritis patients who have had an inadequate response to methotrexate. SPRYCEL In December 2009, at the 51 st Annual Meeting of the American Society of Hematology, Phase II data on SPRYCEL was presented which suggested that SPRYCEL could provide chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients with a more rapid, improved response than the currently-available first-line treatment, imatinib. Results from a Phase III head-to-head trial (called DASISION) of SPRYCEL and imatinib mesylate in first-line treatment of CML are expected to be announced in the first half of 2010. In May 2009, at the American Society of Clinical Oncology annual meeting, we presented interim results from two Phase II SPRYCEL studies, which demonstrate that SPRYCEL may have potential as a treatment for a castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). A Phase III study of SPRYCEL in CRPC is currently ongoing. In May 2009, we announced that the FDA has granted full approval for SPRYCEL for the treatment of adults in all phases of CML (chronic, accelerated, or myeloid or lymphoid blast phase) with resistance or intolerance to prior therapy including GLEEVEC* (imatinib mesylate). REYATAZ In November 2009, we announced a U.S. labeling update for REYATAZ. The label for the medicine now includes long-term data from the CASTLE Study, which showed that a once-daily regimen of REYATAZ and ritonavir as part of combination therapy in previously untreated adult patients infected with HIV-1 led to an enduring virologic response through 96 weeks of treatment. BARACLUDE In October 2009, at the 60 th Annual Meeting of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases, we announced 48-week data for BARACLUDE in chronic hepatitis B patients with evidence of decompensated cirrhosis. In the patient population studied, BARACLUDE demonstrated greater viral suppression compared to adefovir. 41 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Our results of continuing operations exclude the results related to the Mead Johnson business prior to its split-off in December 2009, the ConvaTec business prior to its divestiture in August 2008, and the Medical Imaging business prior to its divestiture in January 2008. These businesses have been segregated from continuing operations and included in discontinued operations for all years presented, see Discontinued Operations below.

In 2008, PLAVIX* and ABILIFY* represented 46% and 16% of total U.S. net sales and contributed 53% and 23% of total growth in U.S. net sales, respectively. International net sales decrease in 2009 and increase in 2008 were impacted by the fluctuating value of the U.S. dollar against many foreign currencies when compared to the previous periods. Excluding foreign exchange, international net sales increased 3% in 2009 due to growth in various key products, including BARACLUDE, the HIV portfolio, SPRYCEL, ABILIFY* and ORENCIA, which more than offset decreases in PLAVIX* net sales stemming from increased generic competition. Our reported international net sales do not include copromotion sales reported by our alliance partner, sanofi for PLAVIX* and AVAPRO*/AVALIDE*, which decreased in 2009 due to generic competition. Net sales of mature brands and businesses that were divested during 2007 through 2009 represented approximately 1% of total net sales. Further detail on both domestic and international key product net sales are discussed below. In general, our business is not seasonal. For information on U.S. pharmaceutical prescriber demand, reference is made to the table within Estimated End-User Demand below, which sets forth a comparison of changes in net sales to the estimated total prescription growth (for both retail and mail order customers) for certain of our key pharmaceutical and new products. The U.S. and non-U.S. net sales are categorized based upon the location of the customer. We recognize revenue net of various sales adjustments to arrive at net sales as reported on the consolidated statements of earnings. These adjustments are referred to as gross-to-net sales adjustments and are further described in Critical Accounting Policies below. 42 Table of Contents The reconciliation of our gross sales to net sales by each significant category of gross-to-net sales adjustments were as follows: Year Ended December 31, Dollars in Millions 2009 2008 2007 Gross Sales $ 20,555 $ 19,370 $ 17,097 Gross-to-Net Sales Adjustments Prime Vendor Charge-Backs (513 ) (487 ) (504 ) Cash Discounts (253 ) (235 ) (191 ) Managed Healthcare Rebates and Other Contract Discounts (439 ) (360 ) (319 ) Medicaid Rebates (229 ) (205 ) (169 ) Sales Returns (101 ) (163 ) (87 ) Other Adjustments (212 ) (205 ) (210 ) Total Gross-to-Net Sales Adjustments (1,747 ) (1,655 ) (1,480 ) Net Sales $ 18,808 $ 17,715 $ 15,617 The gross-to-net sales adjustments are primarily a function of gross sales and activity is typically correlated with current sales trends as is managed healthcare rebates and other contract discounts, Medicaid rebates, cash discounts and other adjustments. Managed healthcare rebates and other contract discounts and Medicaid rebates are also affected by changes in sales mix and contractual and legislative discount rates. In 2009, gross-to-net sales adjustments increased by 6%. Managed healthcare rebates and other contract discounts increased by 22% primarily due to higher PLAVIX* Medicare sales and an increase in contractual discount rates. Sales returns decreased by 38% primarily due to lower provisions for PRAVACHOL and ZERIT, partially offset by increased provisions for SPRYCEL and mature brands driven by higher than anticipated sales returns. In 2008, the increase in the gross-to-net sales adjustments is attributed to increased provisions for PRAVACHOL, driven by higher sales returns than previously estimated and for ZERIT due to loss of exclusivity. The activities and ending balances of each significant category of gross-to-net sales reserve adjustments were as follows: Dollars in Millions Prime Vendor Charge-Backs Cash Discounts Managed HealthCare Rebates and Other Contract Discounts Medicaid Rebates Sales Returns Other Adjustments Women, Infants and Children (WIC) Rebates Total Balance at January 1, 2008 $ 70 $ 24 $ 134 $ 125 $ 178 $ 128 $ 198 $ 857 Provision related to sales made in current period 487 234 370 213 71 208 1,583 Provision related to sales made in prior periods 1 (10 ) (8 ) 92 (3 ) 72 Returns and payments (487 ) (226 ) (345 ) (197 ) (125 ) (206 ) (1,586 ) Impact of foreign currency translation (1 ) 2 (5 ) (5 ) (9 ) Discontinued operations (25 ) (1 ) 3 (2 ) (7 ) (3 ) (35 ) Balance at December 31, 2008 $ 45 $ 31 $ 154 $ 133 $ 209 $ 115 $ 195 $ 882 Provision related to sales made in current period 509 252 438 279 91 222 1,791 Provision related to sales made in prior periods 4 1 1 (50 ) 10 (10 ) (44 ) Returns and payments (513 ) (253 ) (395 ) (196 ) (111 ) (208 ) (1,676 ) Impact of foreign currency translation (2 ) 1 2 1 Discontinued operations (3 ) (3 ) (30 ) (33 ) (195 ) (264 ) Balance at December 31, 2009 $ 42 $ 26 $ 199 $ 166 $ 169 $ 88 $ $ 690 In 2009, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services policy group approved our revised calculations for determining the Medicaid rebates for the three year period 2002 to 2004. The impact of the revised calculation was a net overpayment of Medicaid rebates of $60 million. The 2008 increase in sales returns is primarily attributed to increased provisions for PRAVACHOL, driven by higher retail sales returns than previously assumed, and the loss of exclusivity for ZERIT. 43 Table of Contents Net sales of key products represent 81% of total net sales in 2009, 77% in 2008 and 71% in 2007. The following table details U.S. and international net sales by key products, the percentage change from the prior period and the foreign exchange impact when compared to the prior period.

Estimated total U.S. prescription demand increased 4% in 2009 and 19% in 2008. International net sales decreased in 2009 and 2008 due to the launch of alternative salt forms of clopidogrel and/or generic clopidogrel bisulfate in over half of the EU countries since August 2008, with additional launches expected through 2010. Given the wide-spread launch of alternative salt forms and generics, we expect continued erosion of sales in the EU which will impact both our international net sales and our equity in net income of affiliates. See Item 8. Financial Statements Note 24. Legal Proceedings and Contingencies PLAVIX* Litigation, for further discussion on PLAVIX* exclusivity litigation in both the U.S. and EU. AVAPRO*/AVALIDE * (known in the EU as APROVEL*/KARVEA*) - an angiotensin II receptor blocker for the treatment of hypertension and diabetic nephropathy that is also part of the sanofi alliance U.S. net sales decreased in 2009 primarily due to a 9% decrease in estimated total U.S. prescription demand partially offset by higher average net selling prices. International net sales increased primarily due to higher average net selling prices partially offset by an unfavorable foreign exchange impact. In 2008, worldwide net sales increased primarily due to higher average net selling prices which more than offset decline in overall demand. Estimated total U.S. prescription demand decreased approximately 7%. REYATAZ - a protease inhibitor for the treatment of HIV U.S. net sales increased primarily due to higher estimated total U.S. prescription demand of 8% in 2009 and 14% in 2008, and higher average net selling prices. In 2009 and 2008, international net sales increased primarily due to higher demand across most markets with Europe being the key driver due to the June 2008 approval for first-line treatment. SUSTIVA Franchise - a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor for the treatment of HIV, which includes SUSTIVA, an antiretroviral drug, and bulk efavirenz, which is also included in the combination therapy, ATRIPLA* (efavirenz 600mg/emtricitabine 200 mg/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg), a product sold through a joint venture with Gilead. In 2009 and 2008, U.S. net sales increased primarily due to higher demand as well as higher average net selling prices. Estimated total U.S. prescription demand increased 10% in 2009 and 14% in 2008. In 2009 and 2008, international net sales increased despite an unfavorable foreign exchange impact in 2009 primarily due to continued demand generated from the launch of ATRIPLA* in Canada and the EU in the fourth quarter of 2007. BARACLUDE - an oral antiviral agent for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B Worldwide net sales in 2009 and 2008 increased primarily due to continued strong growth in international markets. There continues to be increased awareness and acceptance of its long-term efficacy, safety and resistance data as evidenced by the American Association for the Study of Liver Disease treatment guidelines that recommended BARACLUDE as a first line treatment option. ERBITUX* - a monoclonal antibody designed to exclusively target and block the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor, which is expressed on the surface of certain cancer cells in multiple tumor types as well as normal cells and is currently indicated for use against colorectal cancer and head and neck cancer. ERBITUX* is part of our strategic alliance with Lilly. Sold by us almost exclusively in the U.S., the net sales in 2009 decreased primarily due to study results released in 2008 regarding the impact of the K-ras gene expression on the effectiveness in patients with colorectal cancer. Sales increase in 2008 is attributable to increased demand for a 2008 indication for usage in the treatment of head and neck cancer. SPRYCEL - an oral inhibitor of multiple tyrosine kinases, for the treatment of adults with chronic, accelerated, or myeloid or lymphoid blast phase chronic myeloid leukemia with resistance or intolerance to prior therapy, including GLEEVEC*, which is part of our strategic alliance with Otsuka. Worldwide net sales increased primarily due to higher demand in previously launched markets, growth attributed to recently launched markets as well as higher U.S. average net selling prices. 45 Table of Contents IXEMPRA - a microtubule inhibitor for the treatment of patients with metastatic or locally advanced breast cancer and is part of our strategic alliance with Otsuka The net sales increase in 2008 reflects the launch of the product in the U.S. in October 2007. ABILIFY* - an antipsychotic agent for the treatment of schizophrenia, bipolar mania disorder and major depressive disorder and is part of our strategic alliance with Otsuka U.S. net sales increased primarily due to increased overall demand, new indications for certain patients with bipolar 1 disorder and major depressive disorder, and higher average net selling prices. The 2009 increase was partially offset by $49 million of amortization of the $400 million extension payment made to Otsuka in April 2009. Estimated total U.S. prescription demand increased 26% in 2009 and 23% in 2008. In 2009 and 2008, international net sales increased due to increased prescription demand, which was aided by a new bipolar indication in the second quarter of 2008 in the EU offset by an unfavorable foreign exchange impact in 2009. ORENCIA - a fusion protein indicated for adult patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis who have had an inadequate response to one or more currently available treatments, such as methotrexate or anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy In 2009, worldwide net sales increased primarily due to increased demand. In 2008, the U.S. net sales increase was primarily due to continued demand growth. The international net sales increase reflected the May 2007 product launch in Europe. ONGLYZA - once-daily oral tablet for the treatment of type 2 diabetes ONGLYZA has been submitted to regulatory authorities in more than 50 countries, approved in 36 and, beginning in the third quarter of 2009, launched in six countries the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Germany, the UK and Denmark. The estimated U.S. prescription change data provided throughout this report includes information only from the retail and mail order channels and does not reflect information from other channels such as hospitals, home healthcare, clinics, federal facilities including VA hospitals, and long-term care, among others. In the first quarter of 2009, we changed our service provider for U.S. prescription data to Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. (WK), a supplier of market research audit data for the pharmaceutical industry, for external reporting purposes and internal demand for most products. Prior to 2009, we used prescription data based on the Next-Generation Prescription Service Version 2.0 of the National Prescription Audit provided by IMS Health (IMS). We continuously seek to improve the quality of our estimates of prescription change amounts and ultimate patient/consumer demand by reviewing estimate calculation methodologies, processes, and analyzing internal and third-party data. We expect to continue to review and refine our methodologies and processes for calculation of these estimates and will continue to review and analyze our own and third parties data used in such calculations. The estimated prescription data is based on the Source Prescription Audit provided by the above suppliers and is a product of their respective recordkeeping and projection processes. As such, the data is subject to the inherent limitations of estimates based on sampling and may include a margin of error. We calculated the estimated total U.S. prescription change on a weighted-average basis to reflect the fact that mail order prescriptions include a greater volume of product supplied, compared to retail prescriptions. Mail order prescriptions typically reflect a 90-day prescription whereas retail prescriptions typically reflect a 30-day prescription. The calculation is derived by multiplying mail order prescription data by a factor that approximates three and adding to this the retail prescriptions. We believe that a calculation of estimated total U.S. prescription change based on this weighted-average approach provides a superior estimate of total prescription demand, with respect to retail and mail order channels. We use this methodology for our internal demand reporting. 46 Table of Contents Estimated End-User Demand The following tables set forth for each of our key products sold in the U.S. for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007: (i) total U.S. net sales for the year; (ii) change in reported U.S. net sales for the year; (iii) estimated total U.S. prescription change for the retail and mail order channels calculated by us based on third-party data on a weighted-average basis, and (iv) months of inventory on hand in the wholesale distribution channel.

The months on hand relates only to SUSTIVA. (b) ERBITUX*, IXEMPRA and ORENCIA are parenterally administered products and do not have prescription-level data as physicians do not write prescriptions for these products. (c) IXEMPRA was launched in the U.S. in October 2007. (d) ONGLYZA was launched in the U.S. in August 2009. Month on hand ratio of 3.7 is estimated by dividing the estimated amount of the product in the U.S. wholesaler distribution channel by the estimated amount of out-movement of the product from the U.S. wholesaler distribution channel over a period of 31 days. ** Change in excess of 200% Pursuant to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Consent Order described below under SEC Consent Order , we monitor the level of inventory on hand in the U.S. wholesaler distribution channel and outside of the U.S. in the direct customer distribution channel. We are obligated to disclose products with levels of inventory in excess of one month on hand or expected demand, subject to a de minimis exception. We disclosed U.S. products that had estimated levels of inventory in the distribution channel in excess of one month on hand at December 31, 2009, and international products that had estimated levels of inventory in the distribution channel in excess of one month on hand at September 30, 2009. The following products met those criteria: At December 31, 2009, ONGLYZA, a type 2 diabetes product, had approximately 3.7 months of inventory on hand. The inventory level on hand was due to the product launch in August 2009. At September 30, 2009, DAFALGAN, an analgesic product sold principally in Europe, had approximately 1.1 months of inventory on hand at direct customers compared to approximately 1.1 months of inventory on hand at December 31, 2008. The level of inventory on hand was primarily due to the ordering patterns of private pharmacists in France. At September 30, 2009, FERVEX, a cold and flu product had approximately 1.7 months of inventory on hand at direct customers compared to approximately 1.4 months of inventory on hand at December 31, 2008. The increased level of inventory on hand was primarily due to the ordering patterns of private pharmacists in France and the initial stocking of a new distributor in Russia. In the U.S., for all products sold exclusively through wholesalers or through distributors, we determined our months on hand estimates using information with respect to inventory levels of product on hand and the amount of out-movement of products provided by our three largest wholesalers, which account for approximately 90% of total gross sales of U.S. products, and provided by our distributors. Factors that may influence our estimates include generic competition, seasonality of products, wholesaler purchases in light of increases in wholesaler list prices, new product launches, new warehouse openings by wholesalers and new customer stockings by wholesalers. In addition, these estimates are calculated using third-party data, which may be impacted by their recordkeeping processes. For products in the U.S. that are not sold exclusively through wholesalers or distributors and for our businesses outside of the U.S., we have significantly more direct customers. Limited information on direct customer product level inventory and corresponding out-movement information and the reliability of third-party demand information, where available, varies widely. In cases where 47 Table of Contents direct customer product level inventory, ultimate patient/consumer demand or out-movement data does not exist or is otherwise not available, we have developed a variety of other methodologies to calculate estimates of such data, including using such factors as historical sales made to direct customers and third-party market research data related to prescription trends and end-user demand. Accordingly, we rely on a variety of methods to estimate direct customer product level inventory and to calculate months on hand for these business units. Factors that may affect our estimates include generic competition, seasonality of products, direct customer purchases in light of price increases, new product or product presentation launches, new warehouse openings by direct customers, new customer stockings by direct customers and expected direct customer purchases for governmental bidding situations. As such, all of the information required to estimate months on hand in the direct customer distribution channel for non-U.S. business for the year ended December 31, 2009 is not available prior to the filing of this annual report on Form 10-K. We will disclose any product with levels of inventory in excess of one month on hand or expected demand, subject to a de minimis exception, in the next quarterly report on Form 10-Q. Geographic Areas In general, our products are available in most countries in the world. The largest markets are in the U.S., France, Japan, Spain, Canada, Italy, Germany, China and Mexico. Our net sales by geographic areas, based on the location of the customer, were as follows: Net Sales % Change % of Total Net Sales Dollars in Millions 2009 2008 2007 2009 vs. 2008 2008 vs. 2007 2009 2008 2007 United States $ 11,909 $ 10,611 $ 8,992 12 % 18 % 63 % 60 % 58 % Europe, Middle East and Africa 4,206 4,370 3,914 (4 )% 12 % 22 % 25 % 25 % Other Western Hemisphere 1,300 1,329 1,390 (2 )% (4 )% 7 % 7 % 9 % Pacific 1,393 1,405 1,321 (1 )% 6 % 8 % 8 % 8 % Total $ 18,808 $ 17,715 $ 15,617 6 % 13 % 100 % 100 % 100 % Net sales in the U.S. increased in 2009 and 2008 primarily due to items previously discussed in Net Sales above. Net sales in Europe, Middle East and Africa decreased in 2009 primarily due to a 7% unfavorable foreign exchange impact, decreased net sales of certain mature brands due to divestitures and increased generic competition for PLAVIX*, partially offset by sales growth in major European markets for the HIV portfolio, BARACLUDE, ABILIFY*, SPRYCEL and ORENCIA. In 2008, net sales increased primarily due to sales growth in major European markets for SPRYCEL, ABILIFY* and the HIV hepatitis portfolio and a 6% favorable foreign exchange impact. Net sales in the Other Western Hemisphere countries decreased in 2009 primarily due to a 9% unfavorable foreign exchange impact, partially offset by increased net sales of PLAVIX*, AVAPRO*/AVALIDE*, ORENCIA and SPRYCEL. In 2008, net sales were essentially flat with a minimum foreign exchange impact. Net sales in the Pacific region decreased in 2009 primarily due to decreased net sales of certain mature brands due to divestitures, partially offset by increased net sales of BARACLUDE and SPRYCEL and 1% favorable foreign exchange impact. In 2008, net sales increased primarily due to sales growth of BARACLUDE in China, Japan and Korea and a 6% favorable foreign exchange impact. No single country outside the U.S. contributed more than 10% of our total net sales in 2009, 2008 or 2007. The combined net sales in emerging markets which includes Brazil, Russia, India, China and Turkey approximated 4% of our total net sales in 2009 and 2008 and 3% in 2007. 48 Table of Contents Expenses Expenses % Change % of Net Sales Dollars in Millions 2009 2008 2007 2009 vs. 2008 2008 vs. 2007 2009 2008 2007 Cost of products sold $ 5,140 $ 5,316 $ 4,919 (3 )% 8 % 27.3 % 30.0 % 31.5 % Marketing, selling and administrative 3,946 4,140 3,941 (5 )% 5 % 21.0 % 23.4 % 25.2 % Advertising and product promotion 1,136 1,181 1,097 (4 )% 8 % 6.0 % 6.7 % 7.0 % Research and development 3,647 3,512 3,160 4 % 11 % 19.4 % 19.8 % 20.2 % Acquired in-process research and development 32 230 (100 )% (86 )% 0.2 % 1.5 % Provision for restructuring 136 215 180 (37 )% 19 % 0.7 % 1.2 % 1.2 % Litigation expense 132 33 14 ** 136 % 0.7 % 0.2 % 0.1 % Equity in net income of affiliates (550 ) (617 ) (524 ) (11 )% 18 % (2.9 )% (3.5 )% (3.4 )% Gain on sale of ImClone shares (895 ) (100 )% (5.1 )% Other (income)/expense (381 ) 22 77 ** (71 )% (2.0 )% 0.1 % 0.5 % Total Expenses $ 13,206 $ 12,939 $ 13,094 2 % (1 )% 70.2 % 73.0 % 83.8 % ** Change is in excess of 200%. Cost of products sold Cost of products sold consist of material costs, internal labor and overhead of our owned manufacturing sites, third-party processing costs, other supply chain costs and changes in foreign currency forward contracts that offset manufacturing related assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. Essentially all of these costs are managed primarily through our global manufacturing organization, referred to as Technical Operations. In addition, discovery royalties attributed to licensed products in connection with alliances as well as the amortization of milestone payments that occur on or after regulatory approval are also included. Costs as a percentage of net sales can vary between periods as a result of product mix, inflation and costs attributed to the rationalization of manufacturing sites resulting in accelerated depreciation, impairment charges and other stranded costs. In addition, changes in foreign currency may also provide volatility given a high percentage of total costs are denominated in foreign currencies. The improvement in cost of products sold as a percentage of net sales in 2009 was driven by favorable foreign exchange, higher U.S. average net selling prices, a more favorable product mix and realized manufacturing efficiencies from PTI offset by higher manufacturing costs attributed to inflation. The 2009 costs include manufacturing rationalization charges of $123 million primarily related to the implementation of PTI compared to $249 million of rationalization charges recognized in 2008. The improvement in costs of products sold as a percentage of net sales in 2008 was primarily attributed to a more favorable product sales mix, higher U.S. average net selling prices, and realized manufacturing savings from PTI. These factors were partially offset by higher manufacturing costs attributed to inflation. The 2008 costs include manufacturing rationalization charges of $249 million primarily related to the implementation of PTI compared to $179 million of rationalization charges recognized in 2007. Marketing, selling and administrative Marketing, selling and administrative expenses consist of employee salary and benefit costs, third-party professional and marketing fees, outsourcing fees, shipping and handling costs and other expenses that are not attributed to product manufacturing costs or research and development expenses. Most of these expenses are managed through regional commercialization functions or global functions such as finance, law, information technology and human resources. The decrease in 2009 resulted from a favorable 2% foreign exchange impact and efficiencies gained from PTI. The increase in 2008 was primarily related to $109 million of process standardization costs incurred as part of PTI, higher average net selling expenses in support of key products and an unfavorable 2% foreign exchange impact. Advertising and product promotion Advertising and product promotion expenses consist of related media, sample and direct to consumer programs. The decrease in 2009 is attributed to reduced spending on promotion of products nearing patent expirations and a favorable 2% foreign exchange impact, partially offset by increased spending for the ONGLYZA launch and pipeline products. The increase in 2008 was primarily related to increased promotions for new indications of ABILIFY* in the U.S., increased promotion for ORENCIA and an unfavorable foreign exchange impact. 49 Table of Contents Research and development Research and development expenses consist of internal salary and benefit costs, third-party grants and fees paid to clinical research organizations, supplies and facility costs. These expenses also include third-party licensing fees that are typically paid upfront as well as when regulatory or other contractual milestones are met. Certain expenses are shared with alliance partners based upon contractual agreements. Approximately 85% of these expenses are managed by our global research and development organization. Historically, approximately 75% of the total spend was attributed to development activities with the remainder attributed to preclinical and research activities. These expenses can vary between periods for a number of reasons, including the timing of upfront licensing and milestone payments. The increase in 2009 was attributed to additional spending to support our maturing pipeline and compounds obtained from our string-of-pearls strategy, offset by a favorable 1% foreign exchange impact. The increase in 2008 was primarily related to increased upfront licensing and milestone payments, increased spending for pipeline compounds, and an unfavorable foreign exchange impact. The 2008 increase was partially offset by sharing of codevelopment costs with alliance partners AstraZeneca and Pfizer. Upfront licensing and milestone payments expensed to research and development were $347 million in 2009 primarily attributed to ZymoGenetics, Alder and Nissan; $348 million in 2008 primarily attributed to Exelixis, PDL BioPharma, Inc. and KAI Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; and $162 million in 2007 primarily attributed to Exelixis, Pfizer, Adnexus Therapeutics, Inc. (Adnexus) and Isis Pharmaceuticals. The 2009 acquisition of Medarex resulted in $40 million of additional spend. Acquired in-process research and development The charges related to the acquisition of Kosan Biosciences, Inc. (Kosan) in 2008 and the acquisition of Adnexus in 2007. In-process research and development (IPRD) projects acquired in a business combination after January 1, 2009 are capitalized initially and considered indefinite-lived assets. Provision for restructuring The changes in provision for restructuring were primarily attributable to the timing of the worldwide implementation of PTI. Litigation expense The 2009 expense was primarily due to a $125 million securities litigation settlement. For further information, see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 24. Legal Proceedings and Contingencies. Equity in net income of affiliates Equity in net income of affiliates was primarily related to our international partnership with sanofi and varies based on international PLAVIX* net sales included within this partnership. The decrease in 2009 is attributed to the impact of an alternative salt form of clopidogrel and generic clopidogrel competition on international PLAVIX* net sales commencing in 2009. This unfavorable trend in earnings is expected to continue in future periods as such generic products have been launched in over half of the EU countries since August 2008, with additional launches expected in future years. For additional information, see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 2. Alliances and Collaborations. Gain on sale of ImClone shares The gain on sale of ImClone shares in 2008 was attributed to our receipt of approximately $1.0 billion in cash for the tendering of our investment in ImClone. See Item 8. Financial Statements Note 2. Alliances and Collaborations for further detail. 50 Table of Contents Other (income)/expense Other (income)/expense include: Year Ended December 31, Dollars in Millions 2009 2008 2007 Interest expense $ 184 $ 310 $ 422 Interest income (54 ) (130 ) (241 ) Gain on debt buyback and termination of interest rate swap agreements (7 ) (57 ) ARS impairment 305 275 Foreign exchange transaction losses/(gains) 2 (78 ) 11 Gain on sale of product lines, businesses and assets (360 ) (159 ) (282 ) Medarex acquisition (10 ) Net royalty income and amortization of upfront licensing and milestone payments received from alliance partners (148 ) (141 ) (104 ) Pension settlements/curtailments 43 8 6 Other (31 ) (36 ) (10 ) Other (income)/expense $ (381 ) $ 22 $ 77 Interest expense decreased primarily due to lower interest rates and amortization resulting from the termination of interest rate swaps during 2009 and 2008. Interest income decreased primarily due to lower interest rates in 2009 and 2008 partially offset by higher cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances. Auction rate securities (ARS) impairment charges recognized in 2008 and 2007 were due to the severity and the duration of the decline in value, the future prospects of the issuers and our ability and intent to hold the securities to recover their value. The value of ARS at December 31, 2009 was $88 million. Any future declines in fair value will be considered other than temporary and therefore recognized in our results of operations. The impact of foreign exchange was mainly due to the sudden and dramatic strengthening of the U.S. dollar in the second half of 2008. This generated significant gains on foreign currency dominated transactions recognized during 2008. To a lesser extent, earnings were impacted in all periods by foreign exchange hedges that were discontinued or did not qualify as cash flow hedges. See Item 8. Financial Statements Note 22. Financial Instruments. Gain on sale of product lines, businesses and assets was primarily related to the sale of mature brands, including businesses within Indonesia and Australia in 2009; a business in Egypt in 2008; and the sale of BUFFERIN* and EXCEDRIN* brands in Japan, Asia (excluding China) and certain Oceanic countries in 2007. Net royalty and alliance partners activity includes income earned from the sanofi partnership and amortization of certain upfront licensing and milestone payments related to our alliances. Pension settlements / curtailments were primarily attributed to amendments which will eliminate the crediting of future benefits related to service for U.S. pension plan participants effective January 1, 2010. These amendments resulted in a curtailment charge of $25 million during 2009. The remainder of the charges resulted from the high level of lump sum payments in certain plans which exceeded the threshold (sum of plan interest costs and service costs) that require settlement accounting, resulting in an acceleration of a portion of previously deferred actuarial losses. Although most of this activity was driven by PTI and certain divestitures, additional charges may be recognized in the future, particularly with the U.S. pension plans due to a lower threshold resulting from the elimination of service costs. See Item 8. Financial Statements Note 19. Pension, Postretirement and Postemployment Liabilities for further detail. Other includes gains and losses on the sale of property, plant and equipment, and ConvaTec and Medical Imaging net transitional service fees. 51 Table of Contents Specified Items During 2009, 2008 and 2007, the following specified items affected the comparability of results of the periods presented herein.

This information is intended to enhance an investor overall understanding of our past financial performance and prospects for the future. For example, non-GAAP earnings and EPS information is an indication of our baseline performance before items that are considered by us to not be reflective of our ongoing results. In addition, this information is among the primary indicators we use as a basis for evaluating performance, allocating resources, setting incentive compensation targets, and planning and forecasting of future periods. This information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net earnings or diluted EPS prepared in accordance with GAAP. Among the items in GAAP measures but excluded for purposes of determining adjusted earnings and other adjusted measures are: charges related to implementation of the PTI; gains or losses from the purchase or sale of businesses, product lines or investments; discontinued operations; restructuring and other exit costs; accelerated depreciation charges; asset impairments; charges and recoveries relating to significant legal proceedings; upfront licensing and milestone payments for in-licensing of products that have not achieved regulatory approval that are immediately expensed; IPRD charges prior to 2009; special initiative funding to the Bristol-Myers Squibb Foundation; and significant tax events. For a detailed listing of items that are excluded from the non-GAAP earnings from continuing operations, see Specified Items above. Similar charges or gains for some of these items have been recognized in prior periods and it is reasonably possible that they will reoccur in future periods. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP follows: Year Ended December 31, 2009 Year Ended December 31, 2008 Dollars in Millions, except per share data GAAP Specified Items Non-GAAP GAAP Specified Items Non-GAAP Net Earnings from Continuing Operations Attributable to BMS $ 3,239 $ 428 $ 3,667 $ 2,697 $ 278 $ 2,975 Contingently convertible debt interest expense and dividends and undistributed earnings attributable to unvested shares (17 ) (17 ) 3 3 Net Earnings from Continuing Operations Attributable to BMS used for Diluted EPS Calculation $ 3,222 $ 428 $ 3,650 $ 2,700 $ 278 $ 2,978 Average Common Shares Outstanding Diluted 1,978 1,978 1,999 1,999 Diluted EPS from Continuing Operations Attributable to BMS $ 1.63 $ 0.22 $ 1.85 $ 1.35 $ 0.14 $ 1.49 Segment Results Segment results are consistent with the financial information regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker for purpose of evaluating performance, allocating resources, setting compensation targets, and planning and forecasting future periods. Segment results exclude the impact of specified items which are significant and not indicative of current operating performance or ongoing results. The following table reconciles our segment results to earnings from continuing operations before income taxes. Segment Results % Change % of Net Sales Dollars in Millions 2009 2008 2007 2009 vs. 2008 2008 vs. 2007 2009 2008 2007 BioPharmaceuticals $ 4,492 $ 3,538 $ 2,234 27 % 58 % 24 % 20 % 14 % Specified items (633 ) (223 ) (836 ) Noncontrolling interest 1,743 1,461 1,125 19 % 30 % Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes $ 5,602 $ 4,776 $ 2,523 17 % 89 % Earnings increased primarily due to increased net sales of various key products in 2009 and 2008; more favorable gross margins due to price increases, product mix and realized efficiencies from previous PTI initiatives and more efficient spending within marketing, selling and administrative expense, partially offset by increased investments within our research and development pipeline. The improved gross margin rate and efficiencies mentioned above resulted in an increase in segment results expressed as a percentage of net sales during the past two years. 54 Table of Contents Income Taxes The effective income tax rate on earnings from continuing operations before income taxes was 21.1% in 2009, compared with 22.8% in 2008 and 18.7% in 2007. The effective income tax rate is lower than the U.S. statutory rate of 35% due to our decision to permanently reinvest the earnings for certain of our manufacturing operations in Ireland, Puerto Rico and Switzerland offshore and the U.S. Federal research and development tax credit. For additional information, see Critical Accounting Policies below and Item 8. Financial Statements Note 10. Income Taxes. The decrease in the 2009 effective tax rate from 2008 was primarily due to the unfavorable 2008 tax impact related to IPRD and ARS impairment charges and to a lesser extent, a higher benefit in 2009 related to certain contingent matters. The increase in the 2008 effective tax rate from 2007 was primarily due to higher pre-tax income in the U.S., including the gain on the sale of ImClone shares, and earnings mix in high tax jurisdictions in 2008. Partially offsetting these factors were lower nondeductible charges in 2008 for IPRD and lower ARS impairment charges with little or no tax benefit. The tax rate in 2008 was favorably impacted by a benefit of $91 million of tax related to the final settlement of the 2002-2003 audit with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The 2007 tax rate was unfavorably impacted by the impairment on our investment in certain ARS with little tax benefit and the nondeductible write-off of IPRD related to the acquisition of Adnexus, partially offset by a tax benefit of $105 million in the first quarter of 2007 due to the favorable resolution of certain tax matters with the IRS related to the deductibility of litigation settlement expenses and U.S foreign tax credits claimed. Discontinued Operations On December 23, 2009, we completed a split-off of our remaining interest in Mead Johnson by means of an exchange offer to BMS shareholders. In August 2008, we completed the divestiture of our ConvaTec business to Cidron Healthcare Limited, an affiliate of Nordic Capital Fund VII and Avista Capital Partners L.P. (Avista). In January 2008, we completed the divestiture of Bristol-Myers Squibb Medical Imaging (Medical Imaging) to Avista. See Item 8. Financial Statements Note 7. Discontinued Operations. Noncontrolling Interest Noncontrolling interest is primarily related to our partnerships with sanofi for the territory covering the Americas related to PLAVIX* net sales. See Item 8. Financial Statements Note 2. Alliances and Collaborations. The increase in noncontrolling interest corresponds to increased net sales of PLAVIX* in the U.S. Net earnings from discontinued operations attributable to noncontrolling interest primarily relates to the 16.9% of Mead Johnson owned by the public prior to the split-off. A summary of noncontrolling interest is as follows: Year Ended December 31, Dollars in Millions 2009 2008 2007 sanofi partnerships $ 1,717 $ 1,444 $ 1,106 Other 26 17 19 Noncontrolling interest pre-tax 1,743 1,461 1,125 Income taxes (562 ) (472 ) (369 ) Net earnings from continuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interest net of taxes 1,181 989 756 Net earnings from discontinued operations attributable to noncontrolling interest net of taxes 69 7 7 Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest net of taxes $ 1,250 $ 996 $ 763 55 Table of Contents Financial Position, Liquidity and Capital Resources We maintain a significant level of working capital, which was approximately $7.6 billion at December 31, 2009 and $8.0 billion at December 31, 2008. In 2010 and future periods, we expect cash generated by our U.S. operations, together with existing cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and borrowings from the capital markets, to be sufficient to cover cash needs for working capital, capital expenditures, strategic alliances and acquisitions, milestone payments and dividends paid in the U.S. Cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, the conversion of other working capital items and borrowings are expected to fund near-term operations outside the U.S. We believe that based on our current levels of cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and other financial assets and expected operating cash flows, the current downturn in global economic activity will not have a material impact on our liquidity, cash flow, financial flexibility or our ability to fund our operations, including the dividend. We have a $2.0 billion five year revolving credit facility from a syndicate of lenders maturing in December 2011, which is extendable with the consent of the lenders. The facility contains customary terms and conditions, including a financial covenant whereby the ratio of consolidated net debt to consolidated capital cannot exceed 50% at the end of each quarter. We have been in compliance with this covenant since the inception of the facility. There were no borrowings outstanding under the facility at December 31, 2009 and 2008. Net cash position at December 31 was as follows: Dollars in Millions 2009 2008 Cash and cash equivalents $ 7,683 $ 7,976 Marketable securities current (a) 831 289 Marketable securities non-current (b) 1,369 188 Total 9,883 8,453 Short-term borrowings, including current portion of long-term debt 231 154 Long-term debt 6,130 6,585 Total debt 6,361 6,739 Net cash position $ 3,522 $ 1,714 (a) Includes $109 million of Floating Rate Securities (FRS) securities at December 31, 2008. (b) Includes $179 million and $188 million of ARS and FRS securities at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Beginning with the second quarter of 2009, we diversified our investment portfolio and acquired non-current marketable securities, including purchases of corporate debt securities. These investments are subject to changes in fair value as a result of interest rate fluctuations and other market factors, which may impact our results of operations. Our investment policy places limits on these investments and the amount and time to maturity of investments with any institution. The policy also requires that investments are only made with highly rated corporate and financial institutions. See Item 8. Financial Statements Note 12. Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities. As an additional source of liquidity, we sell trade accounts receivables, principally from non-U.S. governments and hospital customers, to third parties. The receivables are sold on a nonrecourse basis and approximated $660 million and $350 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. Our sales agreements do not allow for recourse in the event of uncollectibility and we do not retain interest to the underlying asset once sold. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held outside the U.S. was approximately $5.3 billion at December 31, 2009 which is either utilized to fund non-U.S. operations or repatriated back to the U.S. where taxes have been previously provided. Cash repatriations are subject to restrictions in certain jurisdictions and may be subject to withholding and other taxes. Credit Ratings Moody Investors Service (Moody s) long-term and short-term credit ratings are currently A2 and Prime-1, respectively. Moody revised our long-term credit outlook from negative to stable in August 2009. Standard & Poor (S&P) long-term and short-term credit ratings are currently A+ and A-1, respectively. S&P long-term credit rating remains on stable outlook. Fitch Ratings (Fitch) long-term and short-term credit ratings are currently A+ and F1, respectively. Fitch long-term credit rating remains on stable outlook. Our credit ratings are considered investment grade. These ratings designate for long-term securities, that we have a low default risk but are somewhat susceptible to adverse effects of changes in circumstances and economic conditions and for short-term obligations has the strongest capacity for timely repayment. 56 Table of Contents Cash Flows The following is a discussion of cash flow activities at December 31: Dollars in Millions 2009 2008 2007 Cash flow provided by/(used in): Operating activities $ 4,065 $ 3,707 $ 3,153 Investing activities (4,380 ) 5,079 (202 ) Financing activities (17 ) (2,582 ) (3,213 ) Operating Activities Cash flows from operating activities represent the cash receipts and cash disbursements related to all of our activities other than investing activities and financing activities. Operating cash flow is derived by adjusting net earnings for: Noncontrolling interest; Non-cash operating items such as depreciation and amortization, impairment charges and stock-based compensation charges; Gains and losses attributed to investing and financing activities such as gains and losses on the sale of product lines and businesses; and Changes in operating assets and liabilities which reflect timing differences between the receipt and payment of cash associated with transactions and when they are recognized in results of operations. The net impact of the changes in operating assets and liabilities aggregated to a net cash inflow of $42 million during 2009, a cash inflow of $117 million during 2008 and a cash outflow of $7 million in 2007. These items included the impact of changes in receivables, inventories, deferred income, accounts payable, income taxes receivable/payable and other operating assets and liabilities which are discussed in more detail below. We continue to maximize our operating cash flows with our working capital initiative designed to continue to improve working capital items that are most directly affected by changes in sales volume, such as receivables, inventories and accounts payable. Those improvements are being driven by several actions including additional factoring of non-US trade receivables, revised contractual payment terms with customers and vendors, enhanced collection processes and various supply chain initiatives designed to optimize inventory levels. Progress in this area is monitored each period and is a component of our annual incentive plan. The following summarizes certain working capital components expressed as a percentage of trailing twelve months net sales.

Net cash used in financing activities was $3.2 billion in 2007 including: Dividend payments ($2.2 billion); Repayment of the floating rate bank facility ($1.3 billion); and Proceeds from the exercise of stock options ($333 million). Dividends declared per common share were $1.25 for 2009, $1.24 for 2008 and $1.15 for 2007. In December 2009, we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.32 per common share and expect to pay a dividend for the full year of 2010 of $1.28 per share. Dividend decisions are made on a quarterly basis by our Board of Directors. 59 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations Payments due by period for our contractual obligations at December 31, 2009 were as follows: Obligations Expiring by Period Dollars in Millions Total 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Later Years Short-term borrowings $ 231 $ 231 $ $ $ $ $ Long-term debt (a) 5,622 650 4,972 Interest on long-term debt (b) 6,522 195 246 283 291 279 5,228 Operating leases 614 120 100 95 83 71 145 Purchase obligations 2,490 577 405 409 415 277 407 Uncertain tax positions (c) 81 81 Other long-term liabilities 391 71 38 35 27 220 Total (d) $ 15,951 $ 1,204 $ 822 $ 825 $ 1,474 $ 654 $ 10,972 (a) The current portion of long-term debt obligations is included in short-term borrowings and all balances approximate the outstanding nominal long-term debt values. (b) Includes estimated future interest payments on our short-term and long-term debt securities. Also includes accrued interest payable recognized on our consolidated balance sheets, which consists primarily of the accrual of interest on short-term and long-term debt as well as the accrual of periodic cash settlements of derivatives, netted by counterparty. (c) Due to the uncertainty related to the timing of the reversal of uncertain tax positions, only the short-term uncertain tax benefits have been provided in the table above. See Item 8. Financial Statements Note 10. Income Taxes for further detail. (d) The table above excludes future contributions by us to our pensions, postretirement and postemployment benefit plans. Required contributions are contingent upon numerous factors including minimum regulatory funding requirements and the funded status of each plan. Due to the uncertainty of such future obligations, they are excluded from the table. Contributions for both U.S. and international plans are expected to be up to $430 million in 2010. See Item 8. Financial Statements Note 19. Pension, Postretirement and Postemployment Liabilities for further detail. In addition to the above, we are committed to approximately $5.0 billion (in the aggregate) of potential future research and development milestone payments to third parties as part of in-licensing and development programs. Early stage milestones, defined as milestones achieved through Phase III clinical trials, comprises $1.0 billion of the total committed amount. Late stage milestones, defined as milestones achieved post Phase III clinical trials, comprises $4.0 billion of the total committed amount. Payments under these agreements generally are due and payable only upon achievement of certain developmental and regulatory milestones, for which the specific timing cannot be predicted. Because the achievement of these milestones is neither probable nor reasonably estimable, such contingencies have not been recognized. In addition to certain royalty obligations that are calculated as a percentage of net sales, some of these agreements also provide for sales-based milestones that aggregate to approximately $1.6 billion that we would be obligated to pay to alliance partners upon achievement of certain sales levels. For a discussion of contractual obligations, see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 19. Pension, Postretirement and Postemployment Liabilities, Note 21. Short-Term Borrowings and Long-Term Debt, Note 22. Financial Instruments and Note 23. Leases. SEC Consent Order As previously disclosed, on August 4, 2004, we entered into a final settlement with the SEC, concluding an investigation concerning certain wholesaler inventory and accounting matters. The settlement was reached through a Consent, a copy of which was attached as Exhibit 10 to our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2004. Under the terms of the Consent, we agreed, subject to certain defined exceptions, to limit sales of all products sold to our direct customers (including wholesalers, distributors, hospitals, retail outlets, pharmacies and government purchasers) based on expected demand or on amounts that do not exceed approximately one month of inventory on hand, without making a timely public disclosure of any change in practice. We also agreed in the Consent to certain measures that we have implemented including: (a) establishing a formal review and certification process of our annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC; (b) establishing a business risk and disclosure group; (c) retaining an outside consultant to comprehensively study and help re-engineer our accounting and financial reporting processes; (d) publicly disclosing any sales incentives offered to direct customers for the purpose of inducing them to purchase products in excess of expected demand; and (e) ensuring that our budget process gives appropriate weight to inputs that comes from the bottom to the top, and not just from the top to the bottom, and adequately documenting that process. We have established a company-wide policy to limit our sales to direct customers for the purpose of complying with the Consent. This policy includes the adoption of various procedures to monitor and limit sales to direct customers in accordance with the terms of the Consent. These procedures include a governance process to escalate to appropriate management levels potential questions or concerns regarding compliance with the policy and timely resolution of such questions or concerns. In addition, compliance with the policy is monitored on a regular basis. 60 Table of Contents We maintain Inventory Management Agreements (IMAs) with our U.S. pharmaceutical wholesalers, which account for nearly 100% of total gross sales of U.S. biopharmaceuticals products. Under the current terms of the IMAs, our three largest wholesaler customers provide us with weekly information with respect to months on hand product-level inventories and the amount of out-movement of products. These three wholesalers currently account for approximately 90% of total gross sales of U.S. BioPharmaceuticals products. The inventory information received from these wholesalers, together with our internal information, is used to estimate months on hand product level inventories at these wholesalers. We estimate months on hand product inventory levels for our U.S. BioPharmaceuticals business wholesaler customers other than the three largest wholesalers by extrapolating from the months on hand calculated for the three largest wholesalers. In contrast, for our biopharmaceuticals business outside of the U.S., we have significantly more direct customers, limited information on direct customer product level inventory and corresponding out-movement information and the reliability of third-party demand information, where available, varies widely. Accordingly, we rely on a variety of methods to estimate months on hand product level inventories for these business units. We believe the above-described procedures provide a reasonable basis to ensure compliance with the Consent. Recently Issued Accounting Standards The following new accounting standards are discussed in Item 8. Financial Statements Note 1. Accounting Policies Recently Issued Accounting Standards : ASU No. 2009-13, Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements, a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force, an amendment to ASC 605.25 (formerly Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 08-01, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables ) was issued in October 2009 and is effective for reporting periods beginning on or after June 15, 2010. ASU No. 2009-16, Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assets, an amendment to ASC 860.10 (formerly SFAS No. 166, Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assets, an amendment of FASB Statement No. 140 issued in June 2009) was codified and issued as an ASU in December 2009 and was adopted by us on January 1, 2010. ASU No. 2009-17, Improvements to Financial Reporting by Enterprises involved with Variable Interest Entities, an amendment to ASC 810.10 (formerly SFAS No. 167, Amending FASB interpretation No. 46(R) issued in June 2009) was codified and issued as an ASU in December 2009 and was adopted by us on January 1, 2010. ASC 105 (formerly Statement of Financial Standards (SFAS) No. 168, The Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ) was issued in July 2009 and was effective and adopted by us on September 15, 2009.

ASC 805 (formerly SFAS No. 141(R), Business Combinations ) was adopted by us on January 1, 2009. ASC 808-10, Collaborative Arrangements (formerly EITF Issue No. 07-1, Accounting for Collaborative Arrangements Related to the Development and Commercialization of Intellectual Property) was effective January 1, 2009 and was applied retroactively. Critical Accounting Policies We prepare our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, including disclosure of contingent assets and contingent liabilities, at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Our critical accounting policies are those that are both most important to our financial condition and results of operations and require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments on the part of management in their application, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Because of the uncertainty of factors surrounding the estimates or judgments used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements, actual results may vary from these estimates. These accounting policies were discussed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. 61 Table of Contents Revenue Recognition Our accounting policy for revenue recognition has a substantial impact on reported results and relies on certain estimates that require difficult, subjective and complex judgments on the part of management. We recognize revenue when title and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership have transferred to the customer, which generally occurs on the date of shipment (net of the gross-to-net sales adjustments discussed below, all of which involve significant estimates and judgments). For discussions on revenue recognition, see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 1. Accounting Policies Revenue Recognition and Sales Rebate and Return Accruals. Gross-to-Net Sales Adjustments We have the following significant categories of gross-to-net sales adjustments: prime vendor charge-backs, managed healthcare rebates and other contractual discounts, Medicaid rebates, cash discounts, sales returns and other adjustments, all of which involve significant estimates and judgments and require us to use information from external sources. See Net Sales above for a reconciliation of our gross sales to net sales by each significant category of gross-to-net sales adjustment. Prime vendor charge-backs Our U.S. businesses participate in prime vendor programs with government entities, the most significant of which are the U.S. Department of Defense and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, and other parties whereby pricing on products is extended below wholesaler list price to participating entities. These entities purchase products through wholesalers at the lower prime vendor price and the wholesalers then charge us the difference between their acquisition cost and the lower prime vendor price. We account for prime vendor charge-backs by reducing accounts receivable in an amount equal to our estimate of charge-back claims attributable to a sale. We determine our estimate of the prime vendor charge-backs primarily based on historical experience regarding prime vendor charge-backs and current contract prices under the prime vendor programs. We consider prime vendor payments, levels of inventory in the distribution channel, and our claim processing time lag and adjust the reduction to accounts receivable periodically throughout each quarter to reflect actual experience. Cash discounts In the U.S. and certain other countries, we offer cash discounts, approximating 2% of the sales price, as an incentive for prompt payment. We account for cash discounts by reducing accounts receivable by the full amount of the discounts. We consider payment performance and adjust the accrual to reflect actual experience. Managed healthcare rebates and other contract discounts We offer rebates and discounts to managed healthcare organizations in the U.S. which manage prescription drug programs and Medicare Advantage prescription drug plans covering the Medicare Part D drug benefit in addition to their commercial plans, as well as globally to other contract counterparties such as hospitals and group purchasing organizations. In addition, we accrue rebates under U.S. Department of Defense TRICARE Retail Pharmacy Refund Program. We account for managed healthcare rebates and other contract discounts by establishing an accrual in an amount equal to our estimate of managed healthcare rebates and other contractual discounts attributable to a sale. We determine our estimate of the managed healthcare rebates and other contractual discounts accrual primarily based on historical experience regarding these rebates and discounts and current contract prices. We consider the sales performance of products subject to managed healthcare rebates and other contract discounts and levels of inventory in the distribution channel and adjust the accrual periodically throughout each quarter to reflect actual experience. Medicaid rebates Our U.S. businesses participate in state government-managed Medicaid programs as well as certain other qualifying Federal and state government programs whereby discounts and rebates are provided to participating state and local government entities. Discounts and rebates provided through these latter programs are included in our Medicaid rebate accrual and are considered Medicaid rebates for the purposes of this discussion. We account for Medicaid rebates by establishing an accrual in an amount equal to our estimate of Medicaid rebate claims attributable to a sale. We determine our estimate of the Medicaid rebates accrual primarily based on historical experience regarding Medicaid rebates, as well as any expansion on a prospective basis of our participation in the non-mandatory aspects of the qualifying Federal and state government programs, legal interpretations of applicable laws related to Medicaid and qualifying Federal and state government programs, and any new information regarding changes in the Medicaid programs regulations and guidelines that would impact the amount of the rebates. We consider outstanding Medicaid claims, Medicaid payments, and levels of inventory in the distribution channel and adjust the accrual periodically throughout each quarter to reflect actual experience. 62 Table of Contents Sales returns We account for sales returns by establishing an accrual in an amount equal to our estimate of sales recognized for which the related products are expected to be returned. For returns of established products, we determine our estimate of the sales return accrual primarily based on historical experience regarding sales returns, but also consider other factors that could impact sales returns. These factors include levels of inventory in the distribution channel, estimated shelf life, product recalls, product discontinuances, price changes of competitive products, introductions of generic products and introductions of competitive new products. We consider all of these factors and adjust the accrual periodically throughout each quarter to reflect actual experience. In the event of a product recall or product discontinuance, we consider the reasons for and impact of such actions and adjust the sales return accrual as appropriate, taking into account historical experience, estimated levels of inventory in the distribution channel and, for product discontinuances, estimates of continuing demand. Sales returns accruals from new products are estimated and primarily based on the historical sales returns experience of similar products, such as those within the same line of product or those within the same or similar therapeutic category. In limited circumstances, where the new product is not an extension of an existing line of product or where we have no historical experience with products in a similar therapeutic category, such that we cannot reliably estimate expected returns of the new product, we defer recognition of revenue until the right of return no longer exists or until we have developed sufficient historical experience to estimate sales returns. We also consider the shelf life of new products and determine whether an adjustment to the sales return accrual is appropriate. The shelf life in connection with new products tends to be shorter than the shelf life for more established products because we may still be developing an optimal manufacturing process for the new product that would lengthen its shelf life. In addition, higher launch quantities may have been manufactured in advance of the launch date to ensure sufficient supply exists to satisfy market demand. In those cases, we assess the reduced shelf life, together with estimated levels of inventory in the distribution channel and projected demand, and determine whether an adjustment to the sales return accrual is appropriate. Other adjustments In addition to the gross-to-net sales adjustments described above, we make other gross-to-net sales adjustments. For example, we offer sales discounts, most significantly in non-U.S. businesses, and also offer consumer coupons and rebates in our U.S. business. In addition, in a number of countries outside the U.S., including certain major European countries, we provide rebates to government entities. We generally account for these other gross-to-net sales adjustments by establishing an accrual in an amount equal to our estimate of the adjustments attributable to a sale. We generally determine our estimates of the accruals for these other gross-to-net sales adjustments primarily based on historical experience, performance on commitments to government entities and other relevant factors, including estimated levels of inventory in the distribution channel, and adjust the accruals periodically throughout each quarter to reflect actual experience. Use of information from external sources We use information from external sources to estimate gross-to-net sales adjustments. Our estimate of inventory at the wholesalers are based on the projected prescription demand-based sales for our products and historical inventory experience, as well as our analysis of third-party information, including written and oral information obtained from certain wholesalers with respect to their inventory levels and sell-through to customers and third-party market research data, and our internal information. The inventory information received from wholesalers is a product of their recordkeeping process and excludes inventory held by intermediaries to whom they sell, such as retailers and hospitals. Effective January 1, 2009, we changed our service provider for U.S. prescription data to WK, a supplier of market research audit data to the pharmaceutical industry, to project the prescription demand-based sales for many U.S. biopharmaceutical products. Prior to 2009, we used prescription data based on the Next-Generation Prescription Service Version 2.0 of the National Prescription Audit provided by IMS. We have also continued the practice of combining retail and mail prescription volume on a retail-equivalent basis. We use this methodology for internal demand forecasts. We also use information from external sources to identify prescription trends, patient demand and average selling prices. Our estimates are subject to inherent limitations of estimates that rely on third-party information, as certain third-party information was itself in the form of estimates, and reflect other limitations including lags between the date as of which third-party information is generated and the date on which we receive third-party information. 63 Table of Contents Retirement Benefits Our pension plans and postretirement benefit plans are accounted for using actuarial valuations. Our key assumptions used in calculating the cost of pension benefits are the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. In consultation with our actuaries, we evaluate and select these key assumptions and others used in calculating the cost of pension benefits, such as salary growth, retirement, turnover, healthcare trends and mortality rates, based on expectations or actual experience, as appropriate, and determine such assumptions during each remeasurement date including December 31 of each year to calculate liability information as of that date and pension expense for the following year. Depending on the assumptions used, the pension expense could vary within a range of outcomes and have a material effect on reported earnings, projected benefit obligations and future cash funding. Actual results in any given year may differ from those estimated because of economic and other factors. In determining the discount rate, we use the yield on high quality corporate bonds that coincides with the cash flows of the plans estimated payouts. The Citigroup Pension Discount curve is used in determining the discount rate for the U.S. plans. The U.S. plans pension expense for 2009 was determined using a 7.25% weighted-average discount rate. The present value of benefit obligations at December 31, 2009 for the U.S. plans was determined using a 5.75% discount rate. If the discount rate used in determining the U.S. plans pension expense for 2009 had been reduced by 1.00%, such expense would have increased by approximately $40 million. If the assumed discount rate used in determining the projected benefit obligation at December 31, 2009 had been reduced by 1.00%, the projected benefit obligation would have increased by approximately $600 million. In determining the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, we estimate returns for individual asset classes with input from external advisors. We also consider long-term historical returns including actual performance compared to benchmarks for similar investments. The U.S. plans pension expense for 2009 was determined using an 8.75% expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. If the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets used in determining the U.S. plans pension expense for 2009 had been reduced by 1%, such expense would have increased by $40 million. For a more detailed discussion on retirement benefits, see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 19. Pension, Postretirement and Postemployment Liabilities. Business Combinations The consolidated financial statements reflect an acquired business after the completion of an acquisition. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recognized at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values. Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recognized as goodwill. When determining the fair value of intangible assets, including IPRD, we typically use the income method. This method starts with a forecast of all of the expected future net cash flows. These cash flows are then adjusted to present value by applying an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk factors associated with the cash flow streams. Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the income method or other methods include: the amount and timing of projected future cash flows; the amount and timing of projected costs to develop the IPRD into commercially viable products; the discount rate selected to measure the risks inherent in the future cash flows; the assessment of the asset life cycle and the competitive trends impacting the asset, including consideration of any technical, legal, regulatory, or economic barriers to entry, as well as expected changes in standards of practice for indications addressed by the asset. As of January 1, 2009, acquired IPRD projects are initially capitalized and considered indefinite-lived assets subject to annual impairment reviews or more often upon the occurrence of certain events. For those compounds that reach commercialization, the assets are amortized over the expected useful lives. Prior to January 1, 2009, amounts allocated to acquired IPRD were expensed at the date of acquisition. Determining the useful life of an intangible asset is based upon the period over which it is expected to contribute to future cash flows. All pertinent matters associated with the asset and the environment for which it operates are considered, including, legal, regulatory or contractual provisions as well as the effects of any obsolescence, demand, competition, and other economic factors. 64 Table of Contents Medarex, Inc. Acquisition On September 1, 2009, we acquired the remaining outstanding shares of Medarex not already owned by us for approximately $2.3 billion providing us with full rights to ipilimumab and increasing our biologics development pipeline, see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 5. Medarex, Inc. Acquisition. Medarex is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of fully human antibody-based therapeutic products to address major unmet healthcare needs in the areas of oncology, inflammation, autoimmune disorders and infectious diseases. Approximately $1.9 billion of the purchase price was allocated to the estimated fair value of identifiable intangible assets including IPRD projects of approximately $1.5 billion and developed technology of $435 million. For those compounds that reach commercialization, the assets are amortized over the expected useful lives. The fair value of IPRD included approximately $1.0 billion that was assigned to ipilimumab which is a fully human antibody currently in Phase III development for the treatment of metastatic melanoma. There is also an ongoing ipilimumab Phase II study in lung cancer as well as Phase III studies in adjuvant melanoma and hormone-refractory prostate cancer. The overall development effort is estimated to be in the range of 50% to 70% complete. The projected cost to complete these development efforts range from $250 million to $400 million as of the acquisition date. The fair value of ipilimumab was determined from a market participant view considering the preexisting terms of the collaboration arrangement with BMS, including cost and profit sharing splits. The project unit of account was a global view. Significant delays in obtaining marketing approval for ipilimumab or the inability to bring ipilimumab to market could result in such IPRD to be partially or fully impaired. The remaining IPRD was assigned to four other projects that were in Phase II development and 13 other projects at various stages of development that were generated from Medarex technology and are being developed through licensing partners that may generate milestone payments and royalties upon commercialization. Significant judgment was applied in developing the projected cash flows, including the relative timing and probability of the assumed regulatory approvals. The projected cash flows assumed initial positive cash flows to commence shortly after the receipt of expected regulatory approvals, subject to trial results among other things, which, if approved, could potentially be as early as 2011 or 2012. The projected cash flows were discounted at 12%. Actual cash flows attributed to the project are likely to be different than assumed. Ultimate realization of the IPRD project will depend upon successful regulatory approvals, if received, and market factors of a typical biopharmaceutical product. Developed technology was attributed to three separate license arrangements that have received regulatory approval and technology platforms that produce high affinity, fully human antibodies for use in a broad range of therapeutic areas, including immunology and oncology. The fair value for the license arrangements was $315 million which was determined based on the present value of projected royalty streams beginning in 2010 through 2023. The fair value of the technology platforms was $120 million which was determined based upon the expected annual number of antibodies achieving an early candidate nomination status. Developed technology will be amortized over the expected useful lives of 13 years for license arrangements and 10 years for the technology platforms. Impairment Goodwill Goodwill is tested at least annually for impairment using a two-step process. The first step is to identify a potential impairment, and the second step measures the amount of the impairment loss, if any. Goodwill is considered impaired if the carrying amount of a reporting unit goodwill exceeds its estimated fair value. Based upon our most recent annual impairment test completed during the first quarter of 2009, the fair value of goodwill is substantially in excess of the related carrying value. For discussion on goodwill, acquired in-process research and development and other intangible assets, see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 1. Accounting Policies Goodwill, Acquired In-Process Research and Development and Other Intangible Assets. Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets, including IPRD Indefinite-lived intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently, if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. We consider various factors including the stage of development, current legal and regulatory environment and the competitive landscape. Considering the industry success rate of bringing developmental compounds to market, IPRD impairment charges may occur in future periods. 65 Table of Contents Fixed Assets We periodically evaluate whether current facts or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our depreciable assets to be held and used may not be recoverable. If such circumstances are determined to exist, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by the long-lived asset, or the appropriate grouping of assets, is compared to the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists. If an asset is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured based on the difference between the asset fair value and its carrying value. An estimate of the asset fair value is based on quoted market prices in active markets, if available. If quoted market prices are not available, the estimate of fair value is based on various valuation techniques, including a discounted value of estimated future cash flows. We report an asset to be disposed of at the lower of its carrying value or its estimated net realizable value. The estimates of future cash flows are based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections requiring judgment. Changes in key assumptions about our businesses and their prospects, or changes in market conditions, could result in impairment charges. Impairment charges of long-lived assets were $3 million in 2009, $63 million in 2008 and $104 million in 2007. For discussion on impairment of long-lived assets, see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 1. Accounting Policies Impairment of Long-Lived Assets. Marketable Securities and Investments in Other Companies Our marketable securities are classified as available for sale and therefore reported at fair value with changes in fair value reported as accumulated other comprehensive income. Declines in fair value considered other than temporary are charged to earnings. Fair value is determined based on observable market quotes or valuation models using assessments of counterparty credit worthiness, credit default risk or underlying security and overall capital market liquidity. When determining if a security is other-than-temporarily impaired we typically consider the severity and duration of the decline, future prospects of the issuer and our ability and intent to hold the security to recovery. Declines in fair value determined to be credit related are charged to earnings. An average cost method is used in determining realized gains and losses on the sale of available for sale securities. Realized gains and losses are included in other (income)/expense. For level 3 investments, including FRS and ARS, we utilize valuation models including those that are based on expected cash flow streams and collateral values, including assessments of counterparty credit quality, default risk underlying the security, discount rates and overall capital market liquidity. The valuation is subject to uncertainties that are difficult to predict and utilize a considerable amount of judgment and estimation. Factors that may impact our valuation include changes to credit ratings of the securities as well as to the underlying assets supporting those securities, rates of default of the underlying assets, underlying collateral value, discount rates, counterparty risk and ongoing strength and quality of market credit and liquidity. For discussions on current and non-current marketable securities, FRS and ARS, see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 11. Fair Value Measurement and Note 12. Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities. We account for 50% or less owned companies over which we have the ability to exercise significant influence using the equity method of accounting. Our share of net income or losses of equity investments is included in equity in net income of affiliates in the consolidated statements of earnings. For investments whose fair market value falls below its carrying value we assess if the decline is other than temporary and consider our intent and ability to hold investments, the market price and market price fluctuations of the investment publicly traded shares and inability of the investee to sustain an earnings capacity. Impairment losses are recognized in other (income)/expense when a decline in market value is deemed to be other than temporary. For discussions on marketable securities and investments in other companies, see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 1. Accounting Policies Marketable Securities and Investments in Other Companies and Note 2. Alliances and Collaborations. Restructuring Restructuring charges were recognized as a result of our actions to streamline operations and rationalize manufacturing facilities. Significant judgment is used when estimating the impact of restructuring plans, including future termination benefits and other exit costs to be incurred when the actions take place. Actual results could vary from these estimates. For detailed discussions on restructuring, see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 1. Accounting Policies Restructuring and Note 4. Restructuring. 66 Table of Contents Contingencies In the normal course of business, we are subject to contingencies, such as legal proceedings and claims arising out of our business, that cover a wide range of matters, including, among others, government investigations, shareholder lawsuits, product and environmental liability, and tax matters. We recognize accruals for such contingencies when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. These estimates are subject to uncertainties that are difficult to predict and, as such, actual results could vary from these estimates. For discussions on contingencies, see Item 8. Financial Statements Note 1. Accounting Policies Contingencies, Note 10. Income Taxes and Note 24. Legal Proceedings and Contingencies. Income Taxes Valuation allowances are recognized to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. The assessment of whether or not a valuation allowance is required often requires significant judgment including the long-range forecast of future taxable income and the evaluation of tax planning initiatives. These judgments are subject to change. Adjustments to the deferred tax valuation allowances are made to earnings in the period when such assessments are made. Our net deferred tax assets were $2.2 billion and $2.8 billion at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, net of valuation allowances of $1.8 billion in both years. We recognized deferred tax assets at December 31, 2009 related to a U.S. Federal net operating loss carryforward of $253 million, a U.S. Federal foreign tax credit carryforward of $278 million and a U.S. Federal research and development tax credit carryforward of $266 million. The net operating loss carryforward was acquired as a result of the acquisitions of Medarex, Kosan and Adnexus and is subject to limitations under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. The net operating loss carryforward expires in varying amounts beginning in 2020 and the expiration of the foreign tax credit and research and development tax credit carryforwards expire in varying amounts beginning in 2014. The realization of these carryforwards is dependent on generating sufficient domestic-sourced taxable income prior to their expiration. Although realization is not assured, we believe it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized. Prior to the Mead Johnson split-off the following transactions occurred: (i) an internal spin-off of Mead Johnson shares while still owned by us; (ii) conversion of Mead Johnson Class B shares to Class A shares; and; (iii) conversion by Mead Johnson & Company to a limited liability company. These transactions as well as the split-off of Mead Johnson through the exchange offer should qualify as tax-exempt transactions under the Internal Revenue Code based upon a private letter ruling received from the Internal Revenue Service related to the conversion of Mead Johnson Class B shares to Class A shares, and outside legal opinions. We have relied upon certain assumptions, representations and covenants by Mead Johnson regarding the future conduct of its business and other matters which could effect the tax treatment of the exchange. For example, the current tax law generally creates a presumption that the exchange would be taxable to us, if Mead Johnson or its shareholders were to engage in transactions that result in a 50% or greater change in its stock ownership during a four year period beginning two years before the exchange offer, unless it is established that the exchange offer were not part of a plan or series of related transactions to effect such a change in ownership. If the internal spin-off or exchange offer were determined not to qualify as a tax exempt transaction, we could be subject to tax as if the exchange was a taxable sale by us at market value. In addition, we had a negative basis or excess loss account (ELA) in our investment in stock of Mead Johnson prior to these transactions. We received an opinion from outside legal counsel to the effect that it is more likely than not that we eliminated the ELA as part of these transactions and do not have taxable income with respect to the ELA. The tax law in this area is complex and it is possible that even if the internal spin-off and the exchange offer is tax exempt under the Internal Revenue Code, the IRS could assert that we have additional taxable income for the period with respect to the ELA. We could be exposed to additional taxes if this were to occur. Based upon our understanding of the Internal Revenue Code and opinion from outside legal counsel, a tax reserve of $244 million was established reducing the gain on disposal of Mead Johnson included in discontinued operations. We agreed to certain tax related indemnities with Mead Johnson as set forth in the tax sharing agreement. For example, Mead Johnson has agreed to indemnify us for potential tax effects resulting from the breach of certain representations discussed above as well as certain transactions related to the acquisition of Mead Johnson stock or assets. We have agreed to indemnify Mead Johnson for certain taxes related to its business prior to the completion of the IPO and created as part of the restructuring to facilitate the IPO. We established liabilities for possible assessments by tax authorities resulting from known tax exposures including, but not limited to, transfer pricing matters, tax credits and deductibility of certain expenses. Such liabilities represent a reasonable provision for taxes ultimately expected to be paid and may need to be adjusted over time as more information becomes known. 67 Table of Contents For discussions on income taxes, see Item 8.

Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements This annual report on Form 10-K (including documents incorporated by reference) and other written and oral statements we make from time to time contain certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. You can identify these forward-looking statements by the fact they use words such as should , expect , anticipate , estimate , target , may , project , guidance , intend , plan , believe and other words and terms of similar meaning and expression in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance. One can also identify forward-looking statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. Such forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and involve inherent risks and uncertainties, including factors that could delay, divert or change any of them, and could cause actual outcomes to differ materially from current expectations. These statements are likely to relate to, among other things, our goals, plans and projections regarding our financial position, results of operations, cash flows, market position, product development, product approvals, sales efforts, expenses, performance or results of current and anticipated products and the outcome of contingencies such as legal proceedings and financial results, which are based on current expectations that involve inherent risks and uncertainties, including internal or external factors that could delay, divert or change any of them in the next several years. We have included important factors in the cautionary statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, particularly under Item 1A. Risk Factors, that we believe could cause actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statement. Although we believe we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions, no assurance can be given that any goal or plan set forth in forward-looking statements can be achieved and readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such statements, which speak only as of the date made. We undertake no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. 68 Table of Contents
