ITEM 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations This management discussion and analysis provides a review of the results of operations, financial condition and liquidity and capital resources of Visa Inc. and its subsidiaries ( Visa, we, our and the Company ) on a historical basis and outlines the factors that have affected recent earnings, as well as those factors that may affect future earnings. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Item 8 of this report. Overview Visa is a global payments technology company that connects consumers, businesses, financial institutions and governments in more than 200 countries and territories to fast, secure and reliable electronic payments. We provide our financial institution clients with a global payments infrastructure and support services for the delivery of Visa-branded payment products, including credit, debit and prepaid. We facilitate global commerce through the transfer of value and information among financial institutions, merchants, consumers, businesses and government entities. Each of these constituencies has played a key role in the ongoing worldwide migration from paper-based to electronic forms of payment, and we believe that this transformation continues to yield significant growth opportunities, particularly outside the United States. We continue to explore additional opportunities to enhance our competitive position by expanding the scope of payment solutions we provide. Overall economic conditions. Our business is affected by overall economic conditions and consumer spending. Our business performance during fiscal 2014 reflects the impacts of a modest global economic recovery. Financial highlights. During fiscal 2014, we recorded net income of $5.4 billion or $8.62 diluted earnings per share, an increase of 9% and 14% over the prior year, respectively. For fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, we recorded adjusted net income and diluted earnings per share as follows: Fiscal Year ended September 30, % Change (1) 2014 2013 2012 2014 vs. 2013 2013 vs. 2012 (in millions, except percentages) Net income, as adjusted (2) $ 5,721 $ 4,980 $ 4,203 15 % 18 % Diluted earnings per share, as adjusted (2) $ 9.07 $ 7.59 $ 6.20 19 % 23 % (1) Figures in the tables may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. (2) Adjusted net income and diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2014 and 2012 exclude the impact of several significant items that we believe are not indicative of our operating performance, as they are either non-recurring, have no cash impact or are related to amounts covered by the retrospective responsibility plan. For a full reconciliation of our adjusted financial results, see tables in Adjusted financial results below. There were no comparable adjustments recorded during fiscal 2013. We recorded net operating revenues of $12.7 billion for fiscal 2014, an increase of 8% over the prior year driven by continued growth in our underlying business drivers: nominal payments volume; processed transactions; and cross-border volume. The general strengthening of the U.S. dollar during the year resulted in a two percentage point decline in total operating revenue growth. Total operating expenses for fiscal 2014 were $5.0 billion, and included $450 million of litigation provision related to the interchange multidistrict litigation. Excluding this provision, adjusted operating expenses remained flat at $4.6 billion over prior year operating expenses, primarily due to a reduction in professional fees and personnel expenses, offset by continued investments in infrastructure, technology and network processing to support our global growth initiatives. Adjusted financial results. Our financial results for fiscal 2014 and 2012 reflect the impact of several significant items that we believe are not indicative of our operating performance in the prior or future years, as they are either non-recurring, have no cash impact or are related to amounts covered by the retrospective responsibility plan. As such, we believe the presentation of adjusted financial results excluding the following amounts provides a clearer understanding of our operating performance for the periods presented. 31 Table of Contents The following tables present our adjusted financial results for fiscal 2014 and 2012. There were no comparable adjustments recorded during fiscal 2013.

(2) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Operating margin and diluted earnings per share figures are calculated based on unrounded numbers, not the rounded numbers presented. (3) During fiscal 2014 and 2012, we recorded litigation provisions of $450 million and $4.1 billion , respectively, and related tax benefits, associated with the interchange multidistrict litigation. The tax impact is determined by applying applicable federal and state tax rates to the litigation provision. Monetary liabilities from settlements of, or judgments in, the covered litigation will be paid from the litigation escrow account. See Note 3 Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Note 20 Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements. (4) During fiscal 2012, we reversed all previously recorded tax reserves and accrued interest associated with uncertainties related to the deductibility of covered litigation expense recorded in fiscal 2007 through fiscal 2011. This resulted in a non-recurring increase in net income for fiscal 2012 by $326 million. Additionally, our reported financial results benefited from a non-recurring, non-cash adjustment of $208 million related to the remeasurement of our net deferred tax liabilities attributable to changes in the California state apportionment rules. See Note 19 Income Taxes to our consolidated financial statements. Interchange multidistrict litigation. On October 19, 2012, Visa, MasterCard, various U.S. financial institution defendants and the class plaintiffs signed a settlement agreement to resolve the class plaintiffs' claims in the interchange multidistrict litigation. On December 10, 2012, Visa paid approximately $4.0 billion from the litigation escrow account into a settlement fund established pursuant to the definitive class settlement agreement. On January 14, 2014, the court entered the final judgment order approving the settlement with the class plaintiffs, which is subject to the adjudication of any appeals. Certain merchants in the proposed settlement classes, however, have objected to the settlement and a number of merchants have filed opt-out claims. Takedown payments of approximately $1.1 billion related to the opt-out merchants were received on January 27, 2014, and deposited into the litigation escrow account. The deposit into the litigation escrow account and a related increase in accrued 32 Table of Contents litigation to address opt-out claims were recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2014. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, we deposited $450 million of operating cash into the litigation escrow account and recorded an additional accrual of $450 million associated with the opt-out claims, resulting in an accrued litigation balance related to covered litigation of $1.4 billion at September 30, 2014 . See Note 3 Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Note 20 Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements. Reduction in as-converted shares. During fiscal 2014 , total as-converted class A common stock was reduced by 22 million shares, at an average price of $209.15 per share, using $4.6 billion of operating cash on hand. Of the $4.6 billion , $4.1 billion was used to repurchase class A common stock in the open market. In addition, we deposited $450 million of operating cash into the litigation escrow account previously established under the retrospective responsibility plan. The deposit has the same economic effect on earnings per share as repurchasing our class A common stock, because it reduces the class B conversion rate and consequently the as-converted class A common stock share count. See Note 3 Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Note 14 Stockholders' Equity to our consolidated financial statements. The stock repurchases and litigation escrow deposit discussed above reduced the funds from the $5.0 billion share repurchase program authorized by our board of directors in October 2013 . As of September 30, 2014 , the program had remaining authorized funds of $682 million . All share repurchase programs authorized prior to October 2013 have been completed. In October 2014 , our board of directors authorized an additional $5.0 billion share repurchase program. See Note 14 Stockholders' Equity to our consolidated financial statements. Nominal payments volume and transaction counts. Payments volume is the primary driver for our service revenues, and the number of processed transactions is the primary driver for our data processing revenues. Nominal payments volume growth in the United States gained momentum over the prior year, with sustained double-digit growth in consumer credit, elevated growth in consumer debit, which had been negatively impacted by the Dodd-Frank Act beginning April 1, 2012, and double-digit growth in commercial products. Nominal international payments volume growth was negatively impacted by the overall strengthening of the U.S. dollar. On a constant-dollar basis, which excludes the impact of exchange rate movements, our international payments volume growth rate for the 12 months ended June 30, 2014 is 15% compared to 14% for the prior year comparable period. Continued double-digit growth in the number of processed transactions accelerated modestly over the prior year, reflecting the ongoing worldwide shift to electronic currency. 33 Table of Contents The following tables present nominal payments volume.

Therefore, service revenues reported for the twelve months ended September 30, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , were based on nominal payments volume reported by our financial institution clients for the twelve months ended June 30, 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively. (3) Includes prepaid volume. (4) Includes large, middle and small business credit and debit, as well as prepaid volume. (5) Total nominal volume is the sum of total nominal payments volume and cash volume. Total nominal payments volume is the total monetary value of transactions for goods and services that are purchased on Visa-branded cards and payment products. Cash volume generally consists of cash access transactions, balance access transactions, balance transfers and convenience checks. Total nominal volume is provided by our financial institution clients, subject to review by Visa. From time to time, previously submitted volume information may be updated. Prior period updates are not material. (6) Growth on a constant-dollar basis excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations against the U.S. dollar. The table below provides the number of transactions processed by our VisaNet system, and billable transactions processed by CyberSource's network during the fiscal periods presented.

Results of Operations Operating Revenues Our operating revenues are primarily generated from payments volume on Visa-branded cards and payment products for purchased goods and services, as well as the number of transactions processed on our network. We do not earn revenues from, or bear credit risk with respect to, interest or fees paid by account holders on Visa-branded cards or payment products. Our issuing clients have the responsibility for issuing cards and other payment products, and determining the interest rates and fees paid by account holders. We generally do not earn revenues from the fees that merchants are charged for acceptance by the acquirers, including the merchant discount rate. Our acquiring clients are generally responsible for soliciting merchants, and establishing and earning these fees. The following sets forth the components of our operating revenues: Service revenues consist mainly of revenues earned for providing financial institution clients with support services for the delivery of Visa-branded payment products and solutions. Current quarter service revenues are primarily assessed using a calculation of current pricing applied to the prior quarter's payments volume. Service revenues also include assessments designed to support ongoing acceptance and volume growth initiatives, which are recognized in the same period the related volume is transacted. Data processing revenues are earned for authorization, clearing, settlement, network access and other maintenance and support services that facilitate transaction and information processing among our clients globally and with Visa Europe. Data processing revenues are also earned for transactions processed by CyberSource's online payment gateway platform . Data processing revenues are recognized in the same period the related transactions occur or services are rendered. International transaction revenues are earned for cross-border transaction processing and currency conversion activities. Cross-border transactions arise when the country of origin of the issuer is different from that of the merchant. International transaction revenues are primarily generated by cross-border payments and cash volume. 35 Table of Contents Other revenues consist mainly of license fees for use of the Visa brand, revenues earned from Visa Europe in connection with the Visa Europe Framework Agreement, fees from account holder services, licensing and certification, and other activities related to our acquired entities. Other revenues also include optional service or product enhancements, such as extended account holder protection and concierge services. Client incentives consist of long-term contracts with financial institution clients and other business partners for various programs designed to build payments volume, increase Visa-branded card and product acceptance and win merchant routing transactions over our network. These incentives are primarily accounted for as reductions to operating revenues. Operating Expenses Personnel includes salaries, employee benefits, incentive compensation, share-based compensation and contractor expense. Network and processing mainly represents expenses for the operation of our processing network, including maintenance, equipment rental and fees for other data processing services. Marketing includes expenses associated with advertising and marketing campaigns, sponsorships and other related promotions of the Visa brand. Professional fees mainly consist of fees for consulting, legal and other professional services. Depreciation and amortization includes depreciation expense for property and equipment, as well as amortization of purchased and internally developed software. Also included in this amount is amortization of finite-lived intangible assets primarily obtained through acquisitions. General and administrative mainly consists of facilities costs, travel activities, foreign exchange gains and losses and other corporate expenses in support of our business. Litigation provision is an estimate of litigation expense and is based on management's understanding of our litigation profile, the specifics of the cases, advice of counsel to the extent appropriate and management's best estimate of incurred loss as of the balance sheet date. Non-operating Income Non-operating income mainly includes income, gains and losses earned on investments, accrued interest and penalties related to reserves for uncertain tax positions and the change in the fair value of the Visa Europe put option. Visa Inc. Fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012 Operating Revenues The following table sets forth our operating revenues earned in the United States, internationally and from Visa Europe. Revenues earned from Visa Europe are a result of our contractual arrangement with Visa Europe, as governed by the Framework Agreement that provides for trademark and technology licenses and bilateral services. See Note 2 Visa Europe to our consolidated financial statements.

Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. 36 Table of Contents The increase in operating revenues mainly reflects continued growth in our underlying business drivers: nominal payments volume; processed transactions; and cross-border volume. These benefits were partially offset by increases in client incentives. Overall revenue growth decreased in fiscal 2014 compared to prior year due to the negative impact of lower foreign currency exchange volatility on international transaction revenues and the general strengthening of the U.S. dollar in fiscal 2014, combined with the absence of pricing modifications that benefited fiscal 2013. Our operating revenues, primarily service revenues and international transaction revenues, are impacted by the overall strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar as payments volume and related revenues denominated in local currencies are converted to U.S. dollars. The effect of exchange rate movements in fiscal 2014, as partially mitigated by our hedging program, resulted in an overall decline of about two percentage points in total operating revenue growth compared to fiscal 2013. While we expect our hedging program to continue to mitigate this risk during fiscal 2015 , a general strengthening of the U.S. dollar is expected to reduce total operating revenue growth by about two percentage points for fiscal 2015, net of offsetting hedges. See Note 12 Derivative Financial Instruments to our consolidated financial statements. The following table sets forth the components of our total operating revenues. Fiscal Year ended September 30, $ Change % Change (1) 2014 2013 2012 2014 vs. 2013 2013 vs. 2012 2014 vs. 2013 2013 vs. 2012 (in millions, except percentages) Service revenues $ 5,797 $ 5,352 $ 4,872 $ 445 $ 480 8 % 10 % Data processing revenues 5,167 4,642 3,975 525 667 11 % 17 % International transaction revenues 3,560 3,389 3,025 171 364 5 % 12 % Other revenues 770 716 704 54 12 7 % 2 % Client incentives (2,592 ) (2,321 ) (2,155 ) (271 ) (166 ) 12 % 8 % Total operating revenues $ 12,702 $ 11,778 $ 10,421 $ 924 $ 1,357 8 % 13 % (1) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. Service revenues increased in fiscal 2014 and 2013 primarily due to 9% and 8% growth in nominal payments volume, respectively. Data processing revenues increased in fiscal 2014 and 2013 due to overall growth in processed transactions of 11% and 10% , respectively. Fiscal 2013 also benefited from the full-year impact of pricing modifications that became effective in the third quarter of fiscal 2012 as part of our strategy to mitigate the impacts from the Dodd-Frank Act. International transaction revenues increased in fiscal 2014 and 2013 primarily reflecting 8% and 10% growth in nominal cross-border payments volume, respectively. The fiscal 2014 growth in international transaction revenues was slower than the growth in nominal cross-border payments volume for the comparable period mainly due to lower volatility in a broad range of currencies. Other revenues increased in fiscal 2014 and 2013 due to an increase in license fees as well as increases in optional service or product enhancements. Client incentives increased in fiscal 2014 and 2013 , reflecting incentives incurred on long-term client contracts that were initiated or renewed during fiscal 2014 and 2013, as well as overall growth in global payments volume. The amount of client incentives we record in future periods will vary based on changes in performance expectations, actual client performance, amendments to existing contracts or the execution of new contracts. We expect incentives as a percentage of gross revenues to be in the range of 17.5% to 18.5% for the full 2015 fiscal year. 37 Table of Contents Operating Expenses The following table sets forth the components of our total operating expenses. Fiscal Year ended September 30, $ Change % Change (1) 2014 2013 2012 2014 vs. 2013 2013 vs. 2012 2014 vs. 2013 2013 vs. 2012 (in millions, except percentages) Personnel $ 1,875 $ 1,932 $ 1,726 $ (57 ) $ 206 (3 )% 12 % Marketing 900 876 873 24 3 3 % % Network and processing 507 468 414 39 54 8 % 13 % Professional fees 328 412 385 (84 ) 27 (20 )% 7 % Depreciation and amortization 435 397 333 38 64 10 % 19 % General and administrative 507 451 451 56 12 % % Litigation provision 453 3 4,100 450 (4,097 ) NM NM Total operating expenses (2) $ 5,005 $ 4,539 $ 8,282 $ 466 $ (3,743 ) 10 % (45 )% (1) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. (2) Excluding the litigation provisions of $450 million recorded in fiscal 2014 and $4.1 billion recorded in fiscal 2012 associated with litigation covered by the retrospective responsibility plan, operating expenses for fiscal 2014 and 2012 were $4.6 billion and $4.2 billion, respectively. On an adjusted basis, the percentage change of fiscal 2014 over fiscal 2013 is flat and fiscal 2013 over fiscal 2012 is an increase of 8%. Personnel decreased in fiscal 2014 mainly due to lower incentive compensation and severance charges, reductions in our net periodic pension cost and the absence of one-time share-based compensation expenses previously recognized in fiscal 2013 . These decreases were partially offset by a continued increase in headcount throughout the organization reflecting our strategy to invest for future growth. The increase in fiscal 2013 is primarily due to increases in headcount and higher severance charges as a result of organizational restructuring that aligns with our strategic priorities. Marketing increased in fiscal 2014 mainly due to elevated spend supporting the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics and the 2014 FIFA World Cup campaigns, combined with increased spend in the second half of the year to support our growth strategies and new product initiatives, such as Visa Checkout. Marketing in fiscal 2013 remained relatively flat compared to fiscal 2012 reflecting strategies to promote our products in each of those years and spend on specific campaigns, such as the 2013 FIFA Confederation Cup and preparation for the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics in fiscal 2013 and the 2012 London Summer Olympics in fiscal 2012 . Network and processing in fiscal 2014 and 2013 increased mainly due to continued technology and processing network investments to support growth. Professional fees decreased in fiscal 2014 mainly due to the absence of certain project costs incurred in fiscal 2013 as part of our effort to align resources with our strategic priorities. Depreciation and amortization increased in fiscal 2014 and 2013 , primarily due to additional depreciation from our ongoing investments in technology assets and infrastructure to support our digital solutions and core business initiatives. General and administrative increased in fiscal 2014 mainly due to facilities costs and other corporate expenses in support of our business growth and the disposal of obsolete technology assets, partially offset by a decrease in travel activities. General and administrative remained flat in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 . Litigation provision in fiscal 2014 and 2012 reflects $450 million and $4.1 billion accruals, respectively, related to the covered litigation. See Note 3 Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Note 20 Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements. 38 Table of Contents Non-operating Income Non-operating income in fiscal 2014 of $27 million increased from $18 million in fiscal 2013 primarily due to the absence of a $15 million other-than-temporary impairment loss recognized during fiscal 2013. See Note 4 Fair Value Measurements and Investments to our consolidated financial statements. The decrease in fiscal 2013 from $68 million in fiscal 2012 was primarily due to the reversal in fiscal 2012 of previously accrued interest expense associated with tax reserves for uncertainties related to the deductibility of covered litigation expense. See Note 19 Income Taxes and Note 20 Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements. Effective Income Tax Rate The effective income tax rate of 30% in fiscal 2014 differs from the effective income tax rate of 31% in fiscal 2013 mainly due to: a $264 million tax benefit related to a deduction for U.S. domestic production activities, of which $191 million related to prior fiscal years, as a result of the completion of a study in the second quarter of fiscal 2014; and the absence of the following in fiscal 2014: a tax benefit recognized in fiscal 2013 as a result of new guidance issued by the state of California regarding apportionment rules for years prior to fiscal 2012; and certain foreign tax credit benefits related to prior years recognized in fiscal 2013. The effective income tax rate of 31% in fiscal 2013 differs from the effective income tax rate of 3% in fiscal 2012 mainly due to: the aforementioned tax benefit recognized in fiscal 2013 as a result of new guidance issued by the state of California regarding apportionment rules for years prior to fiscal 2012; certain foreign tax credit benefits related to prior years recognized in fiscal 2013, as mentioned above; and the absence of the following in fiscal 2013: the fiscal 2012 reversal of previously recorded tax reserves associated with uncertainties related to the deductibility of covered litigation expense; a fiscal 2012 one-time, non-cash benefit from the remeasurement of existing net deferred tax liabilities due to the changes in California apportionment rules adopted in that year; and the effect of applying the aforementioned fiscal 2012 tax benefits to a fiscal 2012 pre-tax income that was reduced by the $4.1 billion covered litigation provision. Adjusted effective income tax rate for fiscal 2012 . Our financial results for fiscal 2012 reflected the impact of several significant items that we believe are not indicative of our operating performance in that or future years, as they were either non-recurring, had no cash impact or were related to amounts covered by the retrospective responsibility plan. As such, we have presented our fiscal 2012 adjusted effective income tax rate in the table below, which we believe provides a clearer understanding of our operating performance for the fiscal year. Our adjusted effective income tax rate for fiscal 2012 excludes: the reversal of previously recorded tax reserves and accrued interest associated with uncertainties related to the deductibility of covered litigation expense; additional covered litigation provision recorded; and a one-time, non-cash benefit from the remeasurement of existing net deferred tax liabilities attributable to changes in the California state apportionment rules. Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2012 Income Before Income Taxes Income Tax Provision Effective Income Tax Rate (in millions, except for percentages) As reported $ 2,207 $ 65 3 % Reversal of tax reserves (43 ) 283 Litigation provision 4,098 1,505 Remeasurement of net deferred tax liabilities 208 Adjusted $ 6,262 $ 2,061 33 % 39 Table of Contents We expect our effective tax rate for the full 2015 fiscal year to be in the low 30s. Liquidity and Capital Resources Management of Our Liquidity We regularly evaluate cash requirements for current operations, commitments, development activities and capital expenditures, and we may elect to raise additional funds for these purposes in the future through the issuance of either debt or equity. Our treasury policies provide management with the guidelines and authority to manage liquidity risk in a manner consistent with our corporate objectives. The objectives of our treasury policies are to: provide adequate liquidity to cover operating expenditures and liquidity contingency scenarios; ensure timely completion of payments settlement activities; ensure payments on required litigation settlements; make planned capital investments in our business; pay dividends and repurchase our shares at the discretion of our board of directors; and optimize income earned by investing excess cash in securities that enable us to meet our working capital and liquidity needs. Based on our current cash flow budgets and forecasts of our short-term and long-term liquidity needs, we believe that our projected sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our projected liquidity needs for more than the next 12 months. We will continue to assess our liquidity position and potential sources of supplemental liquidity in view of our operating performance, current economic and capital market conditions, and other relevant circumstances. Cash Flow Data The following table summarizes our cash flow activity for the fiscal years presented: 2014 2013 2012 (in millions) Total cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 7,205 $ 3,022 $ 5,009 Investing activities (941 ) (1,164 ) (2,414 ) Financing activities (6,478 ) (1,746 ) (2,655 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (1 ) 7 (Decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents $ (215 ) $ 112 $ (53 ) Operating activities. Reported cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2014 and 2013 was significantly impacted by cash flows related to the interchange multidistrict litigation, including: the return of $1.1 billion in takedown payments in fiscal 2014 and related increase of $368 million in income taxes paid; and payments of $4.4 billion made in fiscal 2013 from the litigation escrow account and a related decrease of $1.5 billion in overall income taxes paid. The cash inflows and outflows related to the litigation escrow account are also reflected as offsetting cash flows within financing activities for their respective years as they are covered by the retrospective responsibility plan. Absent the above impacts, cash provided by operating activities increased in both fiscal 2014 and 2013 to approximately $6.5 billion and $5.9 billion, respectively, reflecting growth in total operating revenues in both years. See Note 3 Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Note 20 Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements. We believe that cash flow generated from operating activities will be more than sufficient to meet our ongoing operational needs. Investing activities. Cash used in investing activities was lower during fiscal 2014 compared to the prior year, reflecting a decrease in purchases of available-for-sale investment securities, offset by a decrease in proceeds received from maturities and sales of available-for-sale investment securities. We also used cash on hand to acquire a business in which we previously held a minority interest ownership. Cash used in investing activities was 40 Table of Contents lower during fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012, reflecting a decrease in purchases of available-for-sale investment securities, combined with greater proceeds received from maturities and sales of available-for-sale investment securities. See Note 4 Fair Value Measurements and Investments to our consolidated financial statements. Financing activities. Reported financing activities reflect significant cash flows in connection with the interchange multidistrict litigation that offset the impacts discussed above under operating activities as they are covered by the retrospective responsibility plan. Additionally, reported financing activities include deposits into the litigation escrow account of $450 million and $1.7 billion in fiscal 2014 and 2012, respectively. Absent all of the above impacts, which are related to the interchange litigation, cash used in financing activities was $5.0 billion, $6.1 billion and $940 million in fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The decrease in fiscal 2014 and increase in fiscal 2013 are primarily due to changes in cash used to repurchase shares of our class A common stock in the open market. See Note 3 Retrospective Responsibility Plan , Note 14 Stockholders' Equity and Note 20 Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements. Sources of Liquidity Our primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash flow from our operations, our investment portfolio and access to various equity and borrowing arrangements. Funds from operations are maintained in cash and cash equivalents and short-term or long-term available-for-sale investment securities based upon our funding requirements, access to liquidity from these holdings, and the return that these holdings provide. We believe that cash flow generated from operations, in conjunction with access to our other sources of liquidity, will be more than sufficient to meet our ongoing operational needs. Cash and cash equivalents and short-term and long-term available-for-sale investment securities held by our foreign subsidiaries totaled $5.5 billion at September 30, 2014 . If it were necessary to repatriate these funds for use in the United States, we would be required to pay U.S. taxes on the amount of undistributed earnings in those subsidiaries. It is our intent to indefinitely reinvest the majority of these funds outside of the United States. As such, we have not accrued U.S. income tax provision in our financial results related to approximately $5.0 billion of undistributed earnings included in these funds. The amount of income taxes that would have resulted had such earnings been repatriated is not practicably determinable. Available-for-sale investment securities. Our investment portfolio is designed to invest excess cash in securities which enables us to meet our working capital and liquidity needs. Our investment portfolio primarily consists of debt securities issued by the U.S. Treasury or U.S. government-sponsored agencies. The majority of these investments, $3.0 billion , are classified as non-current as they have stated maturities of more than one year from the balance sheet date. However, these investments are generally available to meet short-term liquidity needs. Factors that may impact the liquidity of our investment portfolio include, but are not limited to, changes to credit ratings of the securities, uncertainty related to regulatory developments, actions by central banks and other monetary authorities, and the ongoing strength and quality of credit markets. We will continue to review our portfolio in light of evolving market and economic conditions. However, if current market conditions deteriorate, the liquidity of our investment portfolio may be impacted and we could determine that some of our investments are impaired, which could adversely impact our financial results. We have policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution or type of investment. See Item 1A Risk Factors included elsewhere in this report. Commercial paper program . We maintain a commercial paper program to support our working capital requirements and for other general corporate purposes. Under the program, we are authorized to issue up to $3.0 billion in outstanding notes, with maturities up to 397 days from the date of issuance. We had no outstanding obligations under the program at September 30, 2014 . See Note 9 Debt to our consolidated financial statements. Credit facility. On January 29, 2014 , we entered into an unsecured $3.0 billion revolving credit facility. The credit facility, which expires on January 28, 2015 , replaced our previous $3.0 billion credit facility, which terminated on January 29, 2014 . The new credit facility contains covenants and events of default customary for facilities of this type. There were no borrowings under either facility and we were in compliance with all related covenants during the year ended September 30, 2014 . See Note 9 Debt to our consolidated financial statements. Universal shelf registration statement. In July 2012, we filed a registration statement with the SEC using a shelf registration process. As permitted by the registration statement, we may, from time to time, sell shares of debt or equity securities in one or more transactions. This registration statement expires in July 2015. 41 Table of Contents Litigation escrow account. Pursuant to the terms of the retrospective responsibility plan, we maintain a litigation escrow account from which monetary liabilities from settlements of, or judgments in, the covered litigation will be payable. When we fund the litigation escrow account, the shares of class B common stock held by our stockholders are subject to dilution through an adjustment to the conversion rate of the shares of class B common stock to shares of class A common stock. See Note 3 Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Note 20 Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements. The balance in this account at September 30, 2014 , was $1.5 billion and is reflected as restricted cash in our consolidated balance sheet. As these funds are restricted for the sole purpose of making payments related to the covered litigation matters, as described below under Uses of Liquidity , we do not rely on them for other operational needs. Credit Ratings At September 30, 2014 , our credit ratings by Standard and Poor and Moody were as follows: Standard and Poor Moody Debt type Rating Outlook Rating Outlook Short-term unsecured debt A-1 Stable P-1 Stable Long-term unsecured debt A+ Stable A1 Stable Various factors affect our credit ratings, including changes in our operating performance, the economic environment, conditions in the electronic payment industry, our financial position and changes in our business strategy. We do not currently foresee any reasonable circumstances under which our credit ratings would be significantly downgraded. If a downgrade were to occur, it could adversely impact, among other things, our future borrowing costs and access to capital markets. Uses of Liquidity Payments settlement. Payments settlement due from and to our financial institution clients can represent a substantial daily liquidity requirement. U.S. dollar settlements are typically settled within the same day and do not result in a net receivable or payable balance, while settlement currencies other than the U.S. dollar generally remain outstanding for one to two business days, which is consistent with industry practice for such transactions. During fiscal 2014 , we were not required to fund settlement-related working capital. Our average daily net settlement position was a payable of $261 million. Covered litigation. We are parties to legal and regulatory proceedings with respect to a variety of matters, including certain litigation that we refer to as the covered litigation. As noted above, monetary liabilities from settlements of, or judgments in, the covered litigation are payable from the litigation escrow account. During fiscal 2013 , we made $4.4 billion in covered litigation payments that were funded from the litigation escrow account, of which, $4.0 billion was paid into a settlement fund established pursuant to the definitive class settlement agreement in the interchange multidistrict litigation. On January 14, 2014, the court entered the final judgment order approving the settlement with the class plaintiffs, which is subject to the adjudication of any appeals. Certain merchants in the settlement classes, however, have objected to the settlement and a number of merchants have filed opt-out claims. Takedown payments of approximately $1.1 billion related to the opt-out merchants was received in January 2014, and deposited into the litigation escrow account. Receipt of the takedown payments increases our current taxable income by approximately $1.1 billion, and income tax payable by about $368 million, which was fully paid by the end of fiscal 2014. At September 30, 2014 , the litigation escrow account had an available balance of $1.5 billion . See Note 3 Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Note 20 Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements. Other litigation. Judgments in and settlements of litigation, other than the covered litigation, could give rise to future liquidity needs. Reduction in as-converted shares. During fiscal 2014 , total as-converted class A common stock was reduced by 22 million shares, at an average price of $209.15 per share, using $4.6 billion of operating cash on hand. Of the $4.6 billion , $4.1 billion was used to repurchase class A common stock in the open market. In addition, we deposited $450 million of operating cash into the litigation escrow account previously established under the retrospective responsibility plan. The deposit has the same economic effect on earnings per share as repurchasing our class A common stock, because it reduces the class B conversion rate and consequently the as-converted class A common stock share count. See Note 3 Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Note 14 Stockholders' Equity to our consolidated financial statements. 42 Table of Contents The stock repurchases and litigation escrow deposit discussed above reduced the funds from the $5.0 billion share repurchase program authorized by our board of directors in October 2013 . As of September 30, 2014 , the program had remaining authorized funds of $682 million . All share repurchase programs authorized prior to October 2013 have been completed. In October 2014 , our board of directors authorized an additional $5.0 billion share repurchase program. See Note 14 Stockholders' Equity to our consolidated financial statements. Dividends . During fiscal 2014 , we paid $1.0 billion in dividends. In October 2014 , our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend in the aggregate amount of $0.48 per share of class A common stock (determined in the case of class B and class C common stock on an as-converted basis). We expect to pay approximately $297 million in connection with this dividend on December 2, 2014 . See Note 14 Stockholders' Equity to our consolidated financial statements. We expect to continue paying quarterly dividends in cash, subject to approval by the board of directors. Classes of B and C common stock will share ratably on an as-converted basis in such future dividends. Visa Europe put option. We have granted Visa Europe a perpetual put option which, if exercised, will require us to purchase all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Visa Europe from its members. Visa Europe may exercise the put option at any time. The put option provides a formula for determining the purchase price of the Visa Europe shares, which subject to certain adjustments, applies Visa Inc.'s forward price-to-earnings multiple, or the "P/E ratio" (as defined in the option agreement) at the time the option is exercised to Visa Europe's adjusted sustainable income for the forward 12-month period, or the "adjusted sustainable income" (as defined in the option agreement). The calculation of Visa Europe's adjusted sustainable income under the terms of the put option agreement includes potentially material adjustments for cost synergies and other negotiated items. Upon exercise, the key inputs to this formula, including Visa Europe's adjusted sustainable income, will be the result of negotiation between us and Visa Europe. The put option provides an arbitration mechanism in the event that the two parties are unable to agree on the ultimate purchase price. The fair value of the put option represents the value of Visa Europe's option, which, under certain conditions, could obligate us to purchase its member equity interest for an amount above fair value. At September 30, 2014 , we determined the fair value of the put option liability to be approximately $145 million . While this amount represents the fair value of the put option at September 30, 2014 , it does not represent the actual purchase price that we may be required to pay if the option is exercised. The purchase price we could be obligated to pay 285 days after exercise will represent a substantial financial obligation. Given current economic conditions, the purchase price under the terms of the put option would likely be in excess of $10 billion. We may need to obtain third-party financing, either by borrowing funds or undertaking a subsequent equity offering in order to fund this payment. The amount of that potential obligation could vary dramatically based on, among other things, Visa Europe's adjusted sustainable income and our P/E ratio, in each case, as negotiated at the time the put option is exercised. Given the perpetual nature of the put option and the various economic conditions which could be present at the time of exercise, our ultimate obligation in the event of exercise cannot be reliably estimated. The following table calculates our total obligation assuming, for illustrative purposes only, a range of P/E ratios for Visa Inc. and assuming that Visa Europe demonstrates $500 million of adjusted sustainable income at the date of exercise. The $500 million of assumed adjusted sustainable income provided below is for illustrative purposes only. This does not represent an estimate of the amount of adjusted sustainable income Visa Europe would have been able to demonstrate at September 30, 2014 , or will be able to demonstrate at any point in time in the future. Should Visa Europe elect to exercise its option, we believe it is likely that it will implement changes in its business operations to move to a for-profit model in order to maximize its adjusted sustainable income and, as a result, to increase the purchase price. The table also provides the amount of increase or decrease in the payout, assuming the same range of estimated P/E ratios, for each $100 million of adjusted sustainable income above or below the assumed $500 million demonstrated at the time of exercise. At September 30, 2014 , our estimated long-term P/E ratio was 16.9 x and the long-term P/E differential, the difference between this ratio and the estimated ratio applicable to Visa Europe, was 1.9 x. At September 30, 2014 , the spot P/E ratio was 20.6 x and the spot P/E differential, the difference between this ratio and the estimated spot ratio applicable to Visa Europe, was 2.0 x. These ratios are for reference purposes only and are not necessarily indicative of the ratio or differential that could be applicable if the put option were exercised at any point in the future. 43 Table of Contents Visa Inc Forward Price-to-Earnings Ratio Payout Assuming Adjusted Sustainable Income of $500 million (1) Increase/Decrease in Payout for Each $100 million of Adjusted Sustainable Income Above/Below $500 million (in millions) (in millions) 25 $12,500 $2,500 20 $10,000 $2,000 15 $7,500 $1,500 (1) Given current economic conditions, the purchase price under the terms of the put option would likely be in excess of $10 billion. Pension and other postretirement benefits. We sponsor various qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension plans that generally provide benefits based on years of service, age and eligible compensation. We also sponsor a postretirement benefit plan that provides postretirement medical benefits for retirees and dependents upon meeting minimum age and service requirements. Our policy with respect to our qualified pension plan is to contribute annually not less than the minimum required under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. Our non-qualified pension and other postretirement benefit plans are funded on a current basis. We typically fund our qualified pension plan in September of each year. In fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, we made contributions to our pension and other postretirement plans of $14 million , $4 million , and $88 million , respectively. The lower contributions in fiscal 2014 and 2013 , as compared to fiscal 2012, were driven by a higher-than-expected rate of return on our plan assets and an increase in the discount rate. In fiscal 2015 , given current projections and assumptions, we anticipate funding our defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement plan by approximately $10 million . The actual contribution amount will vary depending upon the funded status of the pension plan, movements in the discount rate, performance of the plan assets, and related tax consequences. See Note 10 Pension, Postretirement and Other Benefits to our consolidated financial statements. Capital expenditures. Our capital expenditures increased during fiscal 2014 due to investments in technology, infrastructure and growth initiatives. We expect to continue investing in technology assets and payments system infrastructure to support our digital solutions and core business initiatives. Acquisitions. During fiscal 2014 , we acquired a business in which we previously held a minority interest using $134 million of cash on hand. This amount primarily reflects the purchase price of $170 million less cash received. The acquisition extends our processing capabilities internationally. There were no material acquisitions during fiscal 2013 and 2012. Fair Value Measurements Financial Instruments The assessment of fair value of our financial instruments is based on a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Observable inputs are obtained from independent sources and can be validated by a third party, whereas unobservable inputs reflect assumptions regarding what a third party would use in pricing an asset or liability. As of September 30, 2014 , our financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis included approximately $7.3 billion of assets and $151 million of liabilities. Of these instruments, $152 million had significant unobservable inputs, including the Visa Europe put option liability of $145 million , and $7 million of auction rate securities. See Note 4 Fair Value Measurements and Investments to our consolidated financial statements. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Our off-balance sheet arrangements are primarily comprised of guarantees and indemnifications. Visa has no off-balance sheet debt, other than lease and purchase order commitments, as discussed below and reflected in our contractual obligations table. Indemnifications We indemnify our financial institution clients for settlement losses suffered due to the failure of any other client to fund its settlement obligations in accordance with our operating regulations. The amount of the indemnification is limited to the amount of unsettled Visa payment transactions at any point in time. We maintain global credit settlement risk policies and procedures to manage settlement risk, which may require clients to post collateral if 44 Table of Contents certain credit standards are not met. See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 11 Settlement Guarantee Management to our consolidated financial statements. In the ordinary course of business, we enter into contractual arrangements with financial institutions and other clients under which we may agree to indemnify the client for certain types of losses incurred relating to the services we provide or otherwise relating to our performance under the applicable agreement. Contractual Obligations Our contractual commitments will have an impact on our future liquidity. The contractual obligations identified in the table below include both on- and off-balance sheet transactions that represent a material, expected or contractually committed future obligation as of September 30, 2014. We believe that we will be able to fund these obligations through cash generated from our operations and available credit facilities. Payments Due by Period Less than 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More than 5 Years Total (in millions) Purchase orders (1) $ 832 $ 165 $ 41 $ $ 1,038 Leases (2) 76 97 62 118 353 Client incentives (3) 3,444 4,613 2,875 1,487 12,419 Marketing and sponsorship (4) 83 125 120 130 458 Dividends (5) 297 297 Total (6,7,8) $ 4,732 $ 5,000 $ 3,098 $ 1,735 $ 14,565 (1) Represents agreements to purchase goods and services that specify significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased and fixed, minimum or variable price provisions, and the approximate timing of the transaction. (2) Includes operating leases for premises, equipment and software licenses, which range in terms from one to eighteen years. (3) Represents future cash payments for long-term contracts with financial institution clients and other business partners for various programs designed to build payments volume, increase Visa-branded card and product acceptance and win merchant routing transactions over our network. These agreements, which range in terms from one to fifteen years, can provide card issuance and/or conversion support, volume/growth targets and marketing and program support based on specific performance requirements. Payments under these agreements will generally be offset by revenues earned from higher corresponding payments and transaction volumes. These payment amounts are estimates and will change based on client performance, amendments to existing contracts or execution of new contracts. Related amounts disclosed in Note 17 Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements represent the associated expected reduction of revenue related to these agreements that we estimate we will record. (4) Visa is a party to contractual sponsorship agreements ranging from approximately two to sixteen years. These contracts are designed to increase Visa brand recognition, drive Visa-branded product usage, and differentiate Visa against competition. Over the life of these contracts, Visa is required to make payments in exchange for certain advertising and promotional rights. In connection with these contractual commitments, Visa has an obligation to spend certain minimum amounts for advertising and marketing promotion over the life of the contract. For obligations where the individual years of spend are not specified in the contract, we have estimated the timing of when these amounts will be spent. (5) Includes expected dividend amount of $297 million as dividends were declared in October 2014 and will be paid on December 2, 2014 to all holders of record of Visa's common stock as of November 14, 2014 . (6) We have liabilities for uncertain tax positions of $855 million . At September 30, 2014, we had also accrued $39 million of interest and $5 million of penalties associated with our uncertain tax positions. We cannot determine the range of cash payments that will be made and the timing of the cash settlements, if any, associated with our uncertain tax positions. Therefore, no amounts related to these obligations have been included in the table. (7) Visa granted a perpetual put option to Visa Europe, which if exercised, will require us to purchase all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Visa Europe from its members. Due to the perpetual nature of the instrument and the various economic conditions, which could exist when the put is exercised, the ultimate amount and timing of Visa's obligation, if any, cannot be reliably estimated. Therefore, no amounts related to this obligation have been included in the table. However, given the current economic conditions and circumstances under which Visa Europe could exercise its option, the purchase price under the terms of the put option would 45 Table of Contents likely be in excess of $10 billion. The fair value of the Visa Europe put option itself totaling $145 million at September 30, 2014 has also been excluded from this table as it does not represent the amount, or an estimate of the amount, of Visa's obligation in the event of exercise. See the Liquidity and Capital Resources and Critical Accounting Estimates sections of this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 2 Visa Europe to our consolidated financial statements. (8) We evaluate the need to make contributions to our pension plan after considering the funded status of the pension plan, movements in the discount rate, performance of the plan assets and related tax consequences. Expected contributions to our pension plan have not been included in the table as such amounts are dependent upon the considerations discussed above, and may result in a wide range of amounts. See Note 10 Pension, Postretirement and Other Benefits to our consolidated financial statements and the Liquidity and Capital Resources ection of this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Critical Accounting Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America which require us to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. See Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements. We have established policies and control procedures which seek to ensure that estimates and assumptions are appropriately governed and applied consistently from period to period. However, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material. We believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to fully understand and evaluate our reported financial results, as they require our most subjective or complex management judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. Revenue Recognition Client Incentives Critical estimates. We enter into incentive agreements with financial institution clients and other business partners for various programs designed to build payments volume, increase Visa-branded card and product acceptance and win merchant routing transactions over our network. These incentives are primarily accounted for as reductions to operating revenues; however, if a separate identifiable benefit at fair value can be established, they are accounted for as operating expenses. We generally capitalize advance incentive payments under these agreements if select criteria are met. The capitalization criteria include the existence of future economic benefits to Visa, the existence of legally enforceable recoverability language (e.g., early termination clauses), management's ability and intent to enforce the recoverability language and the ability to generate future earnings from the agreement in excess of amounts deferred. Capitalized amounts are amortized over the shorter of the period of contractual recoverability or the corresponding period of economic benefit. Incentives not yet paid are accrued systematically and rationally based on management's estimate of each client's performance. These accruals are regularly reviewed and estimates of performance are adjusted as appropriate, based on changes in performance expectations, actual client performance, amendments to existing contracts or the execution of new contracts. Assumptions and judgment. Estimation of client incentives relies on forecasts of payments volume, card issuance and card conversion. Performance is estimated using customer-reported information, transactional information accumulated from our systems, historical information and discussions with our clients. Impact if actual results differ from assumptions. If our clients' actual performance or recoverable cash flows are not consistent with our estimates, client incentives may be materially different than initially recorded. Increases in incentive payments are generally driven by increased payments and transaction volume, which drive our net revenues. As a result, in the event incentive payments exceed estimates, such payments are not expected to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. The cumulative impact of a revision in estimates is recorded in the period such revisions become probable and estimable. For the year ended September 30, 2014 , client incentives represented 17% of gross operating revenues. Fair Value Visa Europe Put Option Critical estimates. We have granted Visa Europe a perpetual put option which, if exercised, will require us to purchase all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Visa Europe from its members. The put option provides a formula for determining the purchase price of the Visa Europe shares, which, subject to certain adjustments, applies our forward price-to-earnings multiple, or the P/E ratio (as defined in the option agreement), at the time the option is 46 Table of Contents exercised to Visa Europe's projected adjusted sustainable income for the forward 12-month period, or the adjusted sustainable income (as defined in the option agreement). The calculation of Visa Europe's adjusted sustainable income under the terms of the put option agreement includes potentially material adjustments for cost synergies and other negotiated items. Upon exercise, the key inputs to this formula, including Visa Europe's adjusted sustainable income, will be the result of negotiation between us and Visa Europe. The put option provides an arbitration mechanism in the event that the two parties are unable to agree on the ultimate purchase price. See Note 2 Visa Europe to our consolidated financial statements for further detail regarding the calculation of the put exercise price under the agreement. The fair value of Visa Europe's option was estimated to be approximately $145 million at September 30, 2014 . While the put option is in fact non-transferable, this amount, recorded in our financial statements, represents our estimate of the amount we would be required to pay a third-party market participant to transfer the potential obligation in an orderly transaction. The fair value of the put option is computed by comparing the estimated strike price, under the terms of the put agreement, to the estimated fair value of Visa Europe. The fair value of Visa Europe is defined as the estimated amount a third-party market participant might pay in an arm's length transaction under normal business conditions. A probability of exercise assumption is applied to reflect the possibility that Visa Europe will never exercise its option. While this amount represents the fair value of the put option at September 30, 2014 , it does not represent the actual purchase price that we may be required to pay if the option is exercised. Given current economic conditions, the purchase price under the terms of the put option would likely be in excess of $10 billion. See the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for further discussion. Assumptions and judgment. The most significant estimates used in the valuation of the put option are the assumed probability that Visa Europe will elect to exercise its option and the estimated differential between the forward price-to-earnings multiple applicable to our common stock, as defined in the put option agreement, and that applicable to Visa Europe on a stand-alone basis at the time of exercise, which we refer to as the P/E differential. Probability of exercise Exercise of the put option is at the sole discretion of Visa Europe (on behalf of the Visa Europe shareholders pursuant to authority granted to Visa Europe, under its Articles of Association). We estimate the assumed probability of exercise based on reasonably available information including, but not limited to: (i) Visa Europe's stated intentions; (ii) indications that Visa Europe is preparing to exercise as reflected in its reported financial results; (iii) evaluation of market conditions, including the regulatory environment, that could impact the potential future profitability of Visa Europe; and (iv) qualitative factors applicable to Visa Europe's largest members, which could indicate a change in their need or desire to liquidate their investment holdings. P/E differential The P/E differential is determined by estimating the relative difference in the forward price-to-earnings multiples applicable to our common stock, as defined in the put option agreement, and that applicable to Visa Europe at the time of exercise. For valuation purposes, the forward price-to-earnings multiple applicable to our common stock at the time of exercise is estimated by evaluating various quantitative measures and qualitative factors. Quantitatively, we estimate our P/E ratio by dividing the average stock price over the preceding 24 months (the long-term P/E calculation ) and the last 30 trading dates (the 30-day P/E calculation ) prior to the measurement date by the median estimate of our net income per share for the 12 months starting with the next calendar quarter immediately following the reporting date. This median earnings estimate is obtained from the Institutional Brokers' Estimate System. We then determine the best estimate of our long-term price-to-earnings multiple for valuation purposes by qualitatively evaluating the 30-day P/E calculation as compared to the long-term P/E calculation. In this evaluation we examine both measures to determine whether differences, if any, are the result of a fundamental change in our long-term value or the result of short-term market volatility or other non-Company specific market factors that may not be indicative of our long-term forward P/E. We believe, given the perpetual nature of the put option, that a market participant would more heavily weigh long-term value indicators, as opposed to short-term indicators. Factors that might indicate a fundamental change in long-term value include, but are not limited to, changes in the regulatory environment, client portfolios, long-term growth rates or new product innovations. A consistent methodology is applied to a group of comparable public companies used to estimate the forward price-to-earnings multiple applicable to Visa Europe. These estimates, therefore, are impacted by changes in stock prices and the financial market's expectations of our future earnings and those of comparable companies. 47 Table of Contents Other estimates of lesser significance include growth rates and foreign currency exchange rates applied in the calculation of Visa Europe's adjusted sustainable income. The valuation model assumes a large range of annual growth rates, reflecting the different economic environments and circumstances under which Visa Europe could decide to exercise its option. The lowest growth rates assumed reflect Visa Europe's current business model as an association, owned by its member banks, while the highest reflect a successful shift to a for-profit model in anticipation of its exercise. The scenarios with higher growth rates are assigned a significantly higher probability in the valuation model, as we believe a market participant would more heavily weigh these scenarios as it is likely that, should it choose to exercise its option, Visa Europe will seek to maximize the purchase price by adopting a for-profit business model in advance of exercising the put option. The foreign exchange rate used to translate Visa Europe's results from Euros to U.S. dollars reflects a blend of forward exchange rates observed in the marketplace. The assumed timing of exercise of the put option used in the various modeled scenarios is not an overly significant assumption in the valuation, as obligations calculated in later years are more heavily discounted in the calculation of present value. Impact if actual results differ from assumptions. In the determination of the fair value of the put option at September 30, 2014 , we have assumed a 40% probability of exercise by Visa Europe at some point in the future and an estimated long-term P/E differential at the time of exercise of approximately 1.9 x. The use of a probability of exercise that is 5% higher than our estimate would have resulted in an increase of approximately $18 million in the value of the put option. An increase of 1.0x in the assumed P/E differential would have resulted in an increase of approximately $84 million in the value of the put option. The put option is exercisable at any time at the sole discretion of Visa Europe. As such, the put option liability is included in accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2014 . Classification in current liabilities is not an indication of management's expectation of exercise and simply reflects the fact that this obligation could become payable within 12 months. Legal and Regulatory Matters Critical estimates. We are currently involved in various legal proceedings, the outcomes of which are not within our complete control or may not be known for prolonged periods of time. Management is required to assess the probability of loss and amount of such loss, if any, in preparing our financial statements. Assumptions and judgment. We evaluate the likelihood of a potential loss from legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party. We record a liability for such claims when a loss is deemed probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment may be required in the determination of both probability and whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. Our judgments are subjective based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings, the merits of our defenses and consultation with in-house and outside legal counsel. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims and may revise our estimates. Our retrospective responsibility plan only addresses monetary liabilities from settlements of, or final judgments in, the covered litigation. The plan's mechanisms include the use of the litigation escrow account. The accrual related to the covered litigation could be either higher or lower than the litigation escrow account balance. In fiscal 2014, we recorded litigation accruals totaling $1.5 billion for covered litigation, reflecting $1.1 billion of take-down payments received and an additional provision of $450 million. See Note 3 Retrospective Responsibility Plan and Note 20 Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements. Impact if actual results differ from assumptions. Due to the inherent uncertainties of the legal and regulatory processes in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate, our judgments may be materially different than the actual outcomes, which could have material adverse effects on our business, financial conditions and results of operations. See Note 20 Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements. Income Taxes Critical estimates. In calculating our effective income tax rate, we make judgments regarding certain tax positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions. Assumptions and judgment. We have various tax filing positions with regard to the timing and amount of deductions and credits, the establishment of liabilities for uncertain tax positions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. We are also required to inventory, evaluate and measure all uncertain tax positions taken or to be taken on tax returns and to record liabilities for the amount of such positions that may not be sustained, or may only be partially sustained, upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities. 48 Table of Contents Impact if actual results differ from assumptions. Although we believe that our estimates and judgments are reasonable, actual results may differ from these estimates. Some or all of these judgments are subject to review by the taxing authorities. If one or more of the taxing authorities were to successfully challenge our right to realize some or all of the tax benefit we have recorded, and we were unable to realize this benefit, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and cash flows.
