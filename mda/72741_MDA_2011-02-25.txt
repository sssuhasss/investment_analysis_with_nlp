Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related combined notes included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. References in this Annual Report to "NU," the "Company," "we," "us" and "our" refer to Northeast Utilities and its consolidated subsidiaries. All per share amounts are reported on a diluted basis. Refer to the Glossary of Terms included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for abbreviations and acronyms used throughout the combined notes to the consolidated financial statements. The only common equity securities that are publicly traded are common shares of NU. The earnings and EPS of each business discussed below do not represent a direct legal interest in the assets and liabilities allocated to such business but rather represent a direct interest in our assets and liabilities as a whole. EPS by business is a financial measure not recognized under GAAP that is calculated by dividing the net income or loss attributable to controlling interests of each business by the weighted average diluted NU common shares outstanding for the period. We use this non-GAAP financial measure to evaluate earnings results and to provide details of earnings results and guidance by business. We believe that this measurement is useful to investors to evaluate the actual and projected financial performance and contribution of our businesses. This non-GAAP financial measure should not be considered as an al ternative to our consolidated diluted EPS determined in accordance with GAAP as an indicator of operating performance. The discussion below also includes non-GAAP financial measures referencing our 2010 earnings and EPS excluding expenses related to NU's proposed merger with NSTAR and certain non-recurring benefits from the settlement of tax issues as well as our 2008 earnings and EPS excluding a significant charge resulting from the settlement of litigation. We use these non-GAAP financial measures to more fully compare and explain the 2010, 2009 and 2008 results without including the impact of these non-recurring items. Due to the nature and significance of these items on Net Income, management believes that this non-GAAP presentation is more representative of our performance and provides additional and useful information to readers of this report in analyzing historical and future performance. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as alternatives to reported Net Income Attributable to Controlling Interests or EPS deter mined in accordance with GAAP as indicators of operating performance. Reconciliations of the above non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures of consolidated diluted EPS and Net Income Attributable to Controlling Interests are included under "Financial Condition and Business Analysis-Overview-Consolidated" and "Financial Condition and Business Analysis-Future Outlook" in Management's Discussion and Analysis , herein. All forward-looking information for 2011 and thereafter provided in this Management Discussion and Analysis assumes we will operate on a stand-alone basis, excluding the impacts of the proposed merger with NSTAR, unless otherwise indicated. Financial Condition and Business Analysis Proposed Merger with NSTAR: On October 18, 2010, we and NSTAR announced that each company's Board of Trustees unanimously approved a Merger Agreement (the "agreement") to create a combined company that will be called Northeast Utilities. The transaction was structured as a merger of equals in a tax-free exchange. The post-transaction company will provide electric and natural gas energy delivery service to approximately 3.5 million electric and natural gas customers through six regulated electric and natural gas utilities in Connecticut, Massachusetts and New Hampshire, representing over half of all the customers in New England. Under the terms of the agreement, NSTAR shareholders would receive 1.312 NU common shares for each NSTAR common share that they own (the "exchange ratio"). The exchange ratio was structured to result in a no premium merger based on the average closing share price of each company's common shares for the 20 trading days preceding the announcement. Based on the number of NU common shares and NSTAR common shares estimated to be outstanding immediately prior to the closing of the merger, upon such closing, NU shareholders will own approximately 56 percent of the post-transaction company and former NSTAR shareholders will own approximately 44 percent of the post-transaction company. It is anticipated that we would issue approximately 137 million common shares to the NSTAR shareholders as a result of the merger. Subject to the conditions in the agreement, our first quarterly dividend per common share declared after the completion of the merger will be increased to an amount that is equivalent, after adjusting for the exchange ratio, to NSTAR's last quarterly dividend paid prior to the closing. Based on the last quarterly dividend paid by NSTAR, and assuming there are no changes to such dividend prior to the closing of the merger, this anticipated amount would be approximately $0.325 per share, or approximately $1.30 per share on an annualized basis. Completion of the merger is subject to various customary conditions, including, among others, approval by holders of two-thirds of the outstanding common shares of each company and receipt of all required regulatory approvals. The companies anticipate that the regulatory approvals can be obtained to permit the merger to close in the second half of 2011. Special meetings of shareholders of both companies to approve the merger are scheduled for March 4, 2011. On November 24, 2010, NU and NSTAR filed a joint petition requesting Massachusetts DPU approval of their proposed merger by May 15, 2011. On January 5, 2011, a public hearing and procedural conference were held before the DPU. The schedule has subsequently been suspended pending a decision on the appropriate standard of review for the merger. On January 4, 2011, we received approval from the FCC, and on February 10, 2011, the applicable Ha rt-Scott-Rodino waiting period expired. On January 7, 2011, NU and NSTAR filed an application with the FERC, requesting approval of the merger by May 10, 2011. 26 In November 2010, the DPUC issued a draft decision stating that it lacked jurisdiction over the merger. In December 2010, the Connecticut Office of Consumer Counsel, supported by the Connecticut Attorney General, petitioned the DPUC to reconsider its draft decision. In January 2011, the DPUC issued an Administrative Order stating that it plans to hold a hearing to determine if it has jurisdiction over the merger. Oral arguments surrounding the draft decision were held in February 2011. The DPUC plans to hold an informational hearing at a date to be determined. In addition, legislation proposing to give the DPUC jurisdiction over the merger may be introduced in the Connecticut legislature. Executive Summary The following items in this executive summary are explained in more detail in this Annual Report: Results: We earned $387.9 million, or $2.19 per share, in 2010, compared with $330 million, or $1.91 per share, in 2009. Improved results were due primarily to the impact of the CL&P and PSNH 2010 distribution rate case decisions that were effective July 1, 2010, higher retail electric sales due to weather impacts, the non-recurring benefits from the settlement of tax issues in the fourth quarter of 2010, and our continued success in managing operation and maintenance costs. These benefits were partially offset by higher pension and storm-related expenses and expenses related to our proposed merger with NSTAR. Our Regulated companies earned $384 million, or $2.16 per share, in 2010, compared with $323.5 million, or $1.87 per share, in 2009. Earnings from the distribution segment of our Regulated companies (which also includes the generation businesses of PSNH and WMECO and the natural gas distribution business of Yankee Gas) totaled $206.2 million, or $1.16 per share, in 2010, compared with $159.2 million, or $0.92 per share, in 2009. Earnings from the transmission segment of our Regulated companies totaled $177.8 million, or $1.00 per share, in 2010, compared with $164.3 million, or $0.95 per share, in 2009. Our competitive businesses, which are held by NU Enterprises, earned $8.3 million, or $0.05 per share, in 2010, compared with $15.8 million, or $0.09 per share, in 2009. NU Enterprises recorded $0.7 million of after-tax mark-to-market gains in 2010, compared with $3.8 million of after-tax mark-to-market gains in 2009. NU parent and other companies recorded net expenses of $4.4 million, or $0.02 per share, in 2010, compared with net expenses of $9.3 million, or $0.05 per share, in 2009. The 2010 results include a fourth quarter non-recurring benefit of $15.7 million, or $0.09 per share, associated with the settlement of tax issues and a fourth quarter after-tax charge of $9.4 million, or $0.06 per share, associated with expenses related to NU proposed merger with NSTAR. Outlook: Excluding certain non-recurring costs related to our proposed merger with NSTAR of approximately $0.15 per share, we project consolidated 2011 earnings of between $2.25 per share and $2.40 per share. This projection includes distribution segment earnings of between $1.25 per share and $1.35 per share, transmission segment earnings of between $1.05 per share and $1.10 per share, and net expenses at NU parent and other companies of approximately $0.05 per share, excluding merger-related costs of approximately $0.15 per share. The number of outstanding NU common shares used to calculate this guidance is approximately 177 million shares. Results from our competitive businesses are factored into the NU parent and other companies results. This projection assumes we will operate on a stand-alone basis in 2011, although our proposed merger with NSTAR is expected to close in the second half of 20 11. We project a compound average annual EPS growth rate through 2015 of between 6 percent and 9 percent using 2009 EPS of $1.91 per share as the base level. Assuming completion of our proposed merger with NSTAR, we expect our EPS growth rate will be at the higher end of this range. We project capital expenditures for 2011 through 2015 of approximately $6.6 billion (approximately $1.2 billion in 2011). During that time period, we expect our Regulated company rate base to increase from approximately $7.3 billion at the end of 2010 to approximately $11.4 billion at the end of 2015, excluding any impacts from the merger. On February 8, 2011, our Board of Trustees declared a quarterly common dividend of $0.275 per share, payable on March 31, 2011 to shareholders of record as of March 1, 2011, which equates to $1.10 per share on an annualized basis. Assuming completion of our proposed merger with NSTAR, based on the last quarterly dividend paid by NSTAR of $0.425 per share, and assuming there are no changes to such dividend prior to the closing of the merger, our first quarterly dividend per common share declared would be approximately $0.325 per share, or approximately $1.30 per share on an annualized basis. Strategy, Regulatory and Other Items: On June 30, 2010, the DPUC issued a final decision in CL&P's distribution rate case that approved annualized rate increases of $63.4 million effective July 1, 2010 and an additional $38.5 million effective July 1, 2011. The decision approved CL&P proposal to defer implementation of the first increase by six months until January 1, 2011 and maintained CL&P authorized distribution segment regulatory ROE of 9.4 percent. 27 On June 28, 2010, the NHPUC approved the distribution rate case settlement agreement among PSNH, the NHPUC staff and the Office of Consumer Advocate. Under the agreement, the settling parties agreed to a net annualized distribution rate increase of $45.5 million, effective July 1, 2010, and annualized distribution rate adjustments projected to be a decrease of $2.9 million and increases of $9.5 million and $11.1 million on July 1 of each of the three subsequent years. PSNH authorized distribution business regulatory ROE remained at 9.67 percent. On January 31, 2011, the DPU issued a final decision in WMECO's distribution rate case that approved an annualized rate increase of $16.8 million effective February 1, 2011 and an authorized distribution segment regulatory ROE of 9.6 percent. On January 7, 2011, Yankee Gas filed an application with the DPUC to increase distribution rates by $32.8 million effective July 1, 2011 and by an additional $13 million effective July 1, 2012. Among other items, Yankee Gas requested to maintain its current authorized regulatory ROE of 10.1 percent. A final decision is expected in June 2011. On February 11, 2011, the FERC accepted without modification the TSA that NPT and Hydro Renewable Energy entered into in connection with the Northern Pass transmission project. Assuming timely receipt of other regulatory reviews and siting approvals, NPT expects to place the project in service in late 2015. CL&P and WMECO have received siting approvals in Connecticut and Massachusetts, respectively, for the first and largest component of our NEEWS project, GSRP, which involves the construction of 115 KV and 345 KV lines from Ludlow, Massachusetts, to Bloomfield, Connecticut. We commenced substation construction in December 2010, and expect to begin overhead line construction in the first half of 2011. We expect the cost of this project to be $795 million and to place the project in service in late 2013. Construction of PSNH Clean Air Project at Merrimack Station was approximately 80 percent complete as of December 31, 2010 and is projected to cost approximately $430 million, which is approximately $27 million below the project previously announced cost of $457 million. The project must be operational by July 1, 2013, but PSNH expects it will commence operations by mid-2012. On December 17, 2010, President Obama signed into law the 2010 Tax Act. We expect the 2010 Tax Act to provide NU with cash flow benefits of approximately $250 million in 2011 and approximately $450 million to $550 million over the period 2011 through 2013. Liquidity: Cash capital expenditures totaled $954.5 million in 2010, compared with $908.1 million in 2009. Cash flows provided by operating activities in 2010 totaled $832.6 million, compared with $745 million in 2009 (amounts are net of RRB payments). The improved cash flows were due primarily to the absence in 2010 of costs incurred at PSNH and WMECO related to the major storm in December 2008 that were paid in the first quarter of 2009, a decrease in Fuel, Materials and Supplies attributable to a $31.8 million reduction in coal inventory levels at PSNH, and increases in amortization on regulatory deferrals within PSNH ES and CL&P CTA tracking mechanisms. Offsetting these favorable cash flow impacts was a $ 45 million contribution to our Pension Plan. Excluding the impact of our proposed merger with NSTAR, we project 2011 cash flows provided by operating activities, net of RRB payments, of approximately $950 million to $1 billion. The increase over 2010 is due prim arily to the accelerated depreciation provisions of the 2010 Tax Act and the impact of the 2010 distribution rate case decisions. Those benefits are partially offset by projected 2011 contributions to our Pension Plan of approximately $145 million. Cash and cash equivalents totaled $23.4 million as of December 31, 2010, compared with $27 million as of December 31, 2009. On September 24, 2010, CL&P, PSNH, WMECO, and Yankee Gas jointly entered into a three-year $400 million unsecured revolving credit facility, replacing a five-year $400 million credit facility that was scheduled to expire on November 6, 2010. On September 24, 2010, NU parent entered into a three-year $500 million unsecured revolving credit facility, replacing a five-year $500 million credit facility that was scheduled to expire on November 6, 2010. Both new revolving credit facilities expire on September 24, 2013. As of December 31, 2010, we had $600.9 million of aggregate borrowing availability on our revolving credit lines, as compared to $702.8 million as of December 31, 2009. We issued $145 million of new long-term debt in 2010, consisting of $95 million by WMECO and $50 million by Yankee Gas. Additionally, CL&P remarketed $62 million of tax-exempt PCRBs. In 2011, in addition to remarketing the CL&P $62 million PCRBs, we expect to issue approximately $260 million of long-term debt comprised of $160 million by PSNH and $100 million by WMECO in the second half of 2011. We have no debt maturities until April 2012. Overview Consolidated: We earned $387.9 million, or $2.19 per share, in 2010, compared with $330 million, or $1.91 per share, in 2009 and $260.8 million, or $1.67 per share, in 2008. Improved results were due primarily to the impact of the CL&P and PSNH 2010 distribution rate case decisions that were effective July 1, 2010, higher retail electric sales due to warmer than normal summer weather and colder than normal December 2010 weather, the non-recurring benefits from the settlement of tax issues in the fourth quarter of 2010, lower uncollectibles expense, our continued success in managing operation and maintenance costs, and increased earnings in the 28 transmission segment. These benefits were partially offset by higher pension and storm-related expenses, expenses related to our proposed merger with NSTAR, charges associated with the enactment of the 2010 Healthcare Act, and lower earnings at our competitive businesses. Due primarily to weather impacts, retail electric sales were up 1.7 percent in 2010 compared with 2009. A summary of our earnings by business, which also reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures of consolidated non-GAAP earnings and EPS, as well as EPS by business, to the most directly comparable GAAP measures of consolidated Net Income Attributable to Controlling Interests and diluted EPS, for 2010, 2009 and 2008 is as follows: For the Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 (Millions of Dollars, except per share amounts) Amount Per Share Amount Per Share Amount Per Share Net Income Attributable to Controlling Interests (GAAP) $ 387.9 $ 2.19 $ 330.0 $ 1.91 $ 260.8 $ 1.67 Regulated Companies $ 384.0 $ 2.16 $ 323.5 $ 1.87 $ 289.1 $ 1.85 Competitive Businesses 8.3 0.05 15.8 0.09 13.1 0.08 NU Parent and Other Companies (10.7) (0.05) (9.3) (0.05) (11.6) (0.07) Non-GAAP Earnings 381.6 2.16 330.0 1.91 290.6 1.86 Non-Recurring Tax Settlements 15.7 0.09 - - - - Merger-Related Costs (after-tax) (9.4) (0.06) - - - - Litigation Charge (after-tax) - - - - (29.8) (0.19) Net Income Attributable to Controlling Interests (GAAP) $ 387.9 $ 2.19 $ 330.0 $ 1.91 $ 260.8 $ 1.67 Regulated Companies: Our Regulated companies consist of the distribution and electric transmission segments, with Yankee Gas natural gas distribution segment and PSNH and WMECO generation activities included in the distribution segment. A summary of our Regulated companies' earnings by segment for 2010, 2009 and 2008 is as follows: For the Years Ended December 31, (Millions of Dollars) 2010 2009 2008 CL&P Transmission $ 143.9 $ 136.8 $ 115.6 PSNH Transmission 20.7 18.0 16.7 WMECO Transmission 13.0 9.5 6.0 NUTV 0.2 - - Total Transmission $ 177.8 $ 164.3 $ 138.3 CL&P Distribution $ 94.1 $ 74.0 $ 70.0 PSNH Distribution 69.3 47.5 41.4 WMECO Distribution 10.1 16.7 12.3 Yankee Gas 32.7 21.0 27.1 Total Distribution $ 206.2 $ 159.2 $ 150.8 Net Income - Regulated Companies $ 384.0 $ 323.5 $ 289.1 The higher 2010 and 2009 transmission segment earnings reflect increasing investment in transmission infrastructure to meet the reliability needs of our customers and the region. Our transmission rate base totaled $2.76 billion at the end of 2010, compared with $2.6 billion at the end of 2009. CL&P 2010 distribution segment earnings were $20.1 million higher than 2009 due primarily to the DPUC distribution rate case decision that was effective July 1, 2010. The decision allowed CL&P to defer operating and maintenance expenses for the last six months of 2010 in lieu of cash rate relief until new rates begin on January 1, 2011. CL&P 2010 earnings also benefitted from lower depreciation expense as authorized in the distribution rate case decision, lower interest expense as a result of the favorable resolution of state tax audits in the fourth quarter of 2010, and lower uncollectibles expenses. Partially offsetting these favorable items were higher storm restoration costs and higher pension costs. CL&P 2010 retail electric sales were 1.8 percent higher than 2009 due primarily to warmer than normal weather during the summer of 2010. CL&P distribution segm ent regulatory ROE was 7.9 percent in 2010 compared to 7.3 percent in 2009. We expect CL&P distribution segment regulatory ROE will be approximately 9 percent in 2011. PSNH 2010 distribution segment earnings were $21.8 million higher than 2009. The improved performance in 2010 was due primarily to higher revenues as a result of distribution rate increases effective August 1, 2009 and July 1, 2010, higher AFUDC earnings related to the Clean Air Project capital expenditures, and higher retail electric sales of 1.3 percent due primarily to warmer than normal weather during the summer of 2010. The permanent distribution rate case settlement approved on June 28, 2010 allowed for certain costs to be recovered retroactive to August 1, 2009. These favorable items were partially offset by higher expenses, including employee benefit costs, storm restoration costs, depreciation, interest expense and income taxes as a result of a higher effective tax rate in 2010. PSNH distribution segment regulatory ROE was 10.2 percent (including generation) in 2010, compared to 7.2 per cent in 2009. We expect PSNH distribution segment regulatory ROE will be approximately 9 percent in 2011. WMECO 2010 distribution segment earnings were $6.6 million lower than 2009 due primarily to higher operating costs including storm restoration costs, employee benefit costs, depreciation and property taxes as well as a net $2.1 million after-tax charge primarily related to uncollectibles expense as a result of the outcome of the distribution rate case decision from the DPU on January 31, 2011. These 29 unfavorable items were partially offset by stronger retail distribution revenues. WMECO 2010 retail electric sales were 2.4 percent higher than 2009 due primarily to warmer than normal weather during the summer of 2010. WMECO distribution segment regulatory ROE was 4.6 percent in 2010 compared to 8.4 percent in 2009. On January 31, 2011, the DPU authorized a distribution segment regulatory ROE of 9.6 percent as part of its distribution rate case decision. We expect WMECO distribution segment regulatory ROE will be approximately 9 percent in 2011. Yankee Gas 2010 earnings were $11.7 million higher than 2009 due primarily to lower uncollectibles expenses, higher revenues attributable to a 1.9 percent increase in firm sales as compared to 2009, and lower depreciation expense. Partially offsetting these favorable items were higher employee benefit costs. Yankee Gas regulatory ROE was 8.6 percent in 2010 compared to 6.6 percent in 2009. In June 2011 we anticipate the DPUC will issue a decision on Yankee Gas request to raise its distribution rates effective July 1, 2011. Yankee Gas request includes a recommendation to maintain its authorized regulatory ROE of 10.1 percent. For the distribution segment of our Regulated companies, a summary of changes in CL&P, PSNH and WMECO retail electric GWh sales and Yankee Gas firm natural gas sales for 2010 as compared to 2009 on an actual and weather normalized basis (using a 30-year average) is as follows: Electric Firm Natural Gas CL&P PSNH WMECO Total Yankee Gas Percentage Increase Weather Normalized Percentage Decrease Percentage Increase/ (Decrease) Weather Normalized Percentage Increase/ (Decrease) Percentage Increase/ (Decrease) Weather Normalized Percentage Increase/ (Decrease) Percentage Increase/ (Decrease) Weather Normalized Percentage Decrease Percentage Increase/ (Decrease) Weather Normalized Percentage Increase Residential 3.5% (1.0)% 2.5% (0.5)% 5.1% 1.4% 3.5% (0.7)% (1.2)% 4.9% Commercial 0.1% (3.0)% (0.1)% (3.0)% 1.5% (1.4)% 0.2% (2.8)% 6.6% 12.1% Industrial 1.7% (1.0)% 1.6% (1.9)% (0.6)% (2.4)% 1.3% (1.5)% 0.3% 1.7% Other - - 0.4% 0.4% (19.9)% (19.9)% (1.4)% (1.4)% - - Total 1.8% (1.8)% 1.3% (1.8)% 2.4% (0.6)% 1.7% (1.7)% 1.9% 6.2% A summary of our retail electric sales in GWh for CL&P, PSNH and WMECO and firm natural gas sales in million cubic feet for Yankee Gas for 2010 and 2009 is as follows: Electric Firm Natural Gas 2010 2009 Percentage Increase/ (Decrease) 2010 2009 Percentage Increase/ (Decrease) Residential 14,913 14,412 3.5% 13,403 13,562 (1.2)% Commercial 14,506 14,474 0.2% 14,982 14,063 6.6 % Industrial 4,481 4,423 1.3% 14,866 14,825 0.3 % Other 330 336 (1.4)% - - - Total 34,230 33,645 1.7% 43,251 42,450 1.9 % Actual retail electric sales for all three electric companies were higher in 2010 compared to 2009 due primarily to warmer than normal summer weather and colder than normal weather in December 2010. Residential sales benefitted the most from the favorable impacts of the weather in 2010 and were higher for all three electric companies in 2010 compared to 2009. Cooling degree days in 2010 for Connecticut and Western Massachusetts were 77 percent higher than 2009 and 41 percent above normal. In New Hampshire, cooling degree days in 2010 were 107 percent higher than 2009 and 42 percent above normal. On a weather normalized basis, retail electric sales for all three electric companies were lower in 2010 compared to 2009. We believe the decrease in weather normalized residential sales was due in part to increased conservation efforts by our customers and continuing effects of the weak economy on our customers. The decline in commercial sales in 2010 compared to 2009 can be attributed in part to relatively weak employment growth, higher vacancy rates and uncertainty in consumer confidence. Industrial sales were also lower in 2010 compared to 2009 due to a lack of manufacturing sector hiring although industrial sales benefitted from increased manufacturing hours worked. Our commercial and industrial sales continue to be negatively impacted by additional installation of gas-fired distributed generation and utilization of C&LM programs. Our firm natural gas sales are subject to many of the same influences as our retail electric sales, but have benefitted from a favorable price for natural gas and the addition of gas-fired distributed generation in Yankee Gas service territory. Actual firm natural gas sales in 2010 were higher than 2009 despite the milder weather during the first quarter 2010 heating season. Heating degree days in 2010 for Connecticut were 11 percent below 2009 levels and 11 percent below normal levels. Firm natural gas sales benefitted from commercial and industrial customers switching from interruptible service to firm service, additional gas-fired distributed generation, and a large commercial customer who began to take service from Yankee Gas mid-way through the third quarter of 2009 and continued to take service throughout all of 2010. Our expense related to uncollectible receivable balances (our uncollectibles expense) is influenced by the economic conditions of our region. Fluctuations in our uncollectibles expense are mitigated from an earnings perspective because a portion of the total uncollectibles expense for each of the electric distribution companies is allocated for recovery to the respective company's energy supply rate and recovered through its tariffs. Additionally, for CL&P and Yankee Gas, write-offs of uncollectible receivable balances attributable to qualified customers under financial or medical duress (hardship customers) are fully recovered through their respective tariffs. In 2010, our total pre-tax uncollectibles expense that impacts earnings was $23.4 million as compared to $46.5 million in 2009. 30 The improvement in 2010 uncollectibles expense was due in part to continued accounts receivable collection efforts and we expect our 2011 uncollectibles expense to be consistent with 2010. Competitive Businesses: NU Enterprises, which continues to manage to completion Select Energy's remaining wholesale marketing contracts and to manage its electrical contracting business and other operating and maintenance services contracts, earned $8.3 million, or $0.05 per share, in 2010, compared with $15.8 million, or $0.09 per share, in 2009 and $13.1 million, or $0.08 per share, in 2008. In 2010, NU Enterprises recorded $0.7 million of after-tax mark-to-market gains, compared with after-tax mark-to-market gains of $3.8 million in 2009 and $1.1 million in 2008. NU Parent and Other Companies: NU parent and other companies recorded net expenses of $4.4 million, or $0.02 per share, in 2010, compared with net expenses of $9.3 million, or $0.05 per share, in 2009 and net expenses of $41.4 million, or $0.26 per share, in 2008. The 2010 results include a fourth quarter non-recurring benefit of $15.7 million, or $0.09 per share, associated with the settlement of tax issues and a fourth quarter after-tax charge of $9.4 million, or $0.06 per share, associated with expenses related to NU proposed merger with NSTAR. Excluding these impacts, 2010 net expenses increased by $1.4 million as compared to 2009 due primarily to a $0.9 million after-tax unfavorable change in the HWP environmental reserve and a $0.6 million net after-tax charge associated with the 2010 Healthcare Act, partially offset by lower interest expense at NU parent. The net expenses in 2008 included a $2 9.8 million, or $0.19 per share, after-tax charge resulting from the payment of $49.5 million made in March 2008 associated with the settlement of litigation. Future Outlook EPS Guidance : Following is a summary of our projected 2011 EPS by business, which also reconciles consolidated diluted EPS to the non-GAAP financial measure of EPS by business. Non-GAAP EPS by business also excludes a $0.15 per share charge related to expected non-recurring merger costs we will incur relating to financial advisor costs, legal, accounting and consulting fees, which will affect NU parent and other companies' results. 2011 EPS Range (Approximate amounts) Low High Diluted EPS (GAAP) $ 2.10 $ 2.25 Regulated Companies: Distribution Segment $ 1.25 $ 1.35 Transmission Segment 1.05 1.10 Total Regulated Companies 2.30 2.45 NU Parent and Other Companies (0.05) (0.05) Non-GAAP EPS $ 2.25 $ 2.40 Merger-Related Costs (0.15) (0.15) Diluted EPS (GAAP) $ 2.10 $ 2.25 This projection assumes we will operate on a stand-alone basis in 2011, although our proposed merger with NSTAR is expected to close in the second half of 2011. We have included the impacts of the CL&P, PSNH, and WMECO electric distribution rate case decisions received as well as an anticipated reasonable outcome in the Yankee Gas rate case decision expected in June 2011 in the assumptions used to develop our 2011 earnings guidance. The 2011 distribution and transmission earnings guidance reflects the impact of a higher rate base as well as $1.2 billion of projected capital expenditures in 2011. The 2011 distribution segment earnings guidance assumes that total weather-normalized retail electric sales are essentially unchanged from 2010 and weather-normalized firm natural gas sales, excluding special contracts as fluctuations in their usage do not impact earnings, are approximately 4 percent higher than 2010. Offsetting these favorable items are assumed increases in pension costs and certain operation and maintenance costs. In 2010, the NU effective tax rate was 34.8 percent. For 2011, we estimate that the effective tax rate for NU will be approximately 35 percent. Long-Term Growth Rate: We project that we will achieve a compound average annual EPS growth rate for the five-year period from 2011 to 2015 of between 6 percent and 9 percent using 2009 EPS of $1.91 per share as the base level. Assuming completion of our proposed merger with NSTAR in the second half of 2011, we expect to achieve an EPS growth rate at the higher end of the range of 6 percent and 9 percent. Liquidity Consolidated: Cash and cash equivalents totaled $23.4 million as of December 31, 2010, compared with $27 million as of December 31, 2009. NU subsidiaries issued a total of $145 million in long-term debt in 2010. On March 8, 2010, WMECO issued $95 million of senior unsecured notes due March 1, 2020 carrying a coupon rate of 5.1 percent. On April 22, 2010, Yankee Gas issued $50 million of first mortgage bonds through a private placement with a maturity date of April 1, 2020 carrying a coupon rate of 4.87 percent. The proceeds from these financings were used to repay short-term borrowings incurred in the ordinary course of business and to fund ongoing capital investment programs. 31 On April 1, 2010, CL&P remarketed $62 million of tax-exempt PCRBs that were subject to a mandatory tender on April 1, 2010. The PCRBs, which mature on May 1, 2031, carry a coupon rate of 1.4 percent for a one-year period and are subject to a mandatory tender for purchase on April 1, 2011, at which time CL&P expects to remarket them. On November 1, 2010, the DPUC approved CL&P's application requesting authority to issue up to $900 million in long-term debt through 2014. Proceeds will be used to refinance CL&P's short-term debt previously incurred in the ordinary course of business, to finance capital expenditures, to provide working capital and to pay issuance costs. On November 10, 2010, the DPUC approved Yankee Gas application to issue up to $300 million in long-term debt through 2014. Proceeds will be used to refinance Yankee Gas short-term debt previously incurred in the ordinary course of business, to refinance its Series G first mortgage bonds due in 2014, to finance capital expenditures, to provide working capital and to pay issuance costs. On November 12, 2010, PSNH filed an application with the NHPUC requesting authority to issue securities for the purpose of refinancing certain series of PCRBs totaling $209 million. A public hearing for this application was held February 4, 2011 and a decision is pending. On December 17, 2010, the NHPUC authorized PSNH to issue up to $160 million of long-term debt through 2011. Proceeds will be used to refinance PSNH's short-term debt previously incurred in the ordinary course of business, to finance capital expenditures, to provide working capital and to pay issuance costs. On January 28, 2011, the DPU authorized WMECO to issue up to $330 million in long-term debt through December 31, 2012 to be used to refinance WMECO short-term debt previously incurred in the ordinary course of business, to finance capital expenditures, to provide working capital and to pay issuance costs. On September 24, 2010, CL&P, PSNH, WMECO, and Yankee Gas jointly entered into a three-year $400 million unsecured revolving credit facility, which expires on September 24, 2013. This facility replaced a five-year $400 million credit facility on similar terms and conditions that was scheduled to expire on November 6, 2010. CL&P and PSNH are each able to draw up to $300 million under this facility, and WMECO and Yankee Gas are each able to draw up to $200 million, subject to the $400 million maximum aggregate borrowing limit. This total commitment may be increased to $500 million at the request of the borrowers, subject to lender approval. Under this facility, each company can borrow either on a short-term or a long-term basis, subject to regulatory approval. As of December 31, 2010, PSNH had $30 million of short-term borrowings outstanding under this facility, leaving $370 million of aggregate borrowi ng capacity available. The weighted-average interest rate on these short-term borrowings as of December 31, 2010 was 2.05 percent, which is based on a variable rate plus an applicable margin based on PSNH's credit ratings. On September 24, 2010, NU parent entered into a three-year $500 million unsecured revolving credit facility, which expires on September 24, 2013. This facility replaced a five-year $500 million credit facility on similar terms and conditions that was scheduled to expire on November 6, 2010. Like the previous facility, the new revolving credit facility allows NU parent to borrow up to $500 million at any one time on a short-term or long-term basis and allows for the issuance of LOCs up to $500 million in the aggregate (net of the amount of borrowings then outstanding) on behalf of NU or any of its subsidiaries for periods up to 364 days. This total commitment may be increased to $600 million at the request of NU parent, subject to lender approval. As of December 31, 2010, NU parent had $32.1 million of LOCs issued primarily for the benefit of PSNH and $237 million of short-term borrowings outstanding, leaving $230.9 million of borrowing capacity available. The weighted-average interest rate on these short-term borrowings as of December 31, 2010 was 2.85 percent, which is based on a variable rate plus an applicable margin based on NU parent's credit ratings. Our credit facilities and indentures require that NU parent and certain of its subsidiaries, including CL&P, PSNH and WMECO, comply with certain financial and non-financial covenants as are customarily included in such agreements, including a consolidated debt to total capitalization ratio. As of December 31, 2010, all such companies were in compliance with these covenants. Refer to Note 8, "Short-Term Debt," and Note 9, "Long-Term Debt," to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of material terms and conditions of these agreements. In 2011, in addition to remarketing the CL&P $62 million PCRBs, we expect to issue approximately $260 million of long-term debt comprised of $160 million by PSNH and $100 million by WMECO in the second half of 2011. We have annual sinking fund requirements of $4.3 million continuing in 2011 through 2012, the mandatory tender of $62 million of tax-exempt PCRBs by CL&P on April 1, 2011, at which time CL&P expects to remarket the bonds in the ordinary course, and no debt maturities until April 1, 2012. In light of the 2010 Tax Act and the related cash flow benefits, we are currently reevaluating the timing of our previously planned NU common equity issuance. If we complete the proposed merger with NSTAR, we would no longer need to undertake the previously planned $300 million NU common equity issuance in 2012 nor issue any additional equity in the foreseeable future. Cash flows provided by operating activities in 2010 totaled $832.6 million, compared with operating cash flows of $745 million in 2009 and $424.1 million in 2008 (all amounts are net of RRB payments, which are included in financing activities on the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows). The improved cash flows were due primarily to the absence in 2010 of costs incurred at PSNH and WMECO related to the major storm in December 2008 that were paid in the first quarter of 2009, a decrease in Fuel, Materials and Supplies attributable to a $31.8 million reduction in coal inventory levels at the PSNH generation business as ordered by the NHPUC, and increases in amortization on regulatory deferrals primarily attributable to 2009 activity within PSNH ES and CL&P CTA tracking mechanisms where such costs exceeded revenues resulting in an unfavorable cash flow impact in 2009. Offsetting these favorable ca sh flow impacts was a $ 45 million contribution made into our Pension Plan in September 2010. The increase in operating cash flows from 2008 to 2009 was due primarily to higher transmission revenues at CL&P after significant projects were placed in service in late 2008, as well as cost management efforts; a decrease of approximately $225 million related primarily to amounts spent on CL&P's 32 FMCC and GSC, the costs of which are passed on to customers; approximately $100 million less in cash expenditures on Fuel, Materials and Supplies in 2009 due primarily to the lower cost of natural gas being stored by Yankee Gas for the winter heating season; and the absence in 2009 of the litigation settlement payment of $49.5 million made in 2008. Excluding the impact of our proposed merger with NSTAR, we project 2011 cash flows provided by operating activities of approximately $950 million to $1 billion, net of RRB payments. The increase over 2010 is due primarily to the accelerated depreciation provisions of the 2010 Tax Act, which is expected to result in a cash flow benefit of approximately $250 million in 2011, and the impact of the 2010 distribution rate case decisions. Those benefits are partially offset by projected 2011 contributions to our Pension Plan of approximately $145 million. On December 30, 2010, CL&P made its final principal and interest payment on approximately $1.4 billion of RRBs that were issued in 2001. As a result, CL&P will no longer recover any payments from customers associated with these RRBs. A total of $203.2 million of principal and interest payments were made on these RRBs in 2010. The full amortization of these RRBs in 2010 will reduce CL&P cash flows provided by operating activities in 2011, compared with previous years, but will have no material impact on CL&P operating cash flows net of RRB payments. PSNH and WMECO RRBs do not fully amortize until 2013, therefore the RRBs do not have an impact on their respective operating cash flows in 2011 when compared to 2010. A summary of the current credit ratings and outlooks by Moody's, S&P and Fitch for senior unsecured debt of NU parent and WMECO and senior secured debt of CL&P and PSNH is as follows: Moody's S&P Fitch Current Outlook Current Outlook Current Outlook NU parent Baa2 Stable BBB- Watch-Positive BBB Watch-Positive CL&P A2 Stable BBB+ Watch-Positive A- Stable PSNH A3 Stable BBB+ Watch-Positive BBB+ Stable WMECO Baa2 Stable BBB Watch-Positive BBB+ Stable On October 18, 2010, following the announcement of the proposed merger of NU and NSTAR, Moody's announced that it had reaffirmed the ratings and "stable" outlooks of NU parent, CL&P, PSNH and WMECO, and S&P announced that it had placed NU parent, CL&P, PSNH and WMECO's ratings outlooks on credit watch with "positive" implications. On October 19, 2010, also due to the announcement of the proposed merger, Fitch announced that it had reaffirmed the ratings and "stable" outlooks of CL&P, PSNH and WMECO and placed NU parent's ratings outlook on credit watch with "positive" implications. Assuming completion of the proposed merger with NSTAR, we expect our credit ratings will improve. On January 22, 2010, Fitch downgraded CL&P preferred stock rating from BBB to BBB- as a result of revised guidelines for rating preferred stock and hybrid securities in general. If the senior unsecured debt ratings of NU parent were to be reduced to below investment grade level by either Moody's or S&P, a number of Select Energy's supply contracts would require Select Energy to post additional collateral in the form of cash or LOCs. If such an event had occurred as of December 31, 2010, Select Energy would have been required to provide additional cash or LOCs in an aggregate amount of $24 million to various unaffiliated counterparties and additional cash or LOCs in the aggregate amount of $7.4 million to independent system operators. NU parent would have been and remains able to provide that collateral on behalf of Select Energy. If the unsecured debt ratings of PSNH were to be reduced by either Moody's or S&P, certain supply contracts could require PSNH to post additional collateral in the form of cash or LOCs with various unaffiliated counterparties. As of December 31, 2010, if the unsecured debt ratings of PSNH had been reduced by one level or to below investment grade, PSNH had an adequate amount of collateral posted and would not have been required to post additional amounts. We paid common dividends of $180.5 million in 2010, compared with $162.4 million in 2009 and $129.1 million in 2008. The increase reflects a 7.9 percent increase in our common dividend rate that took effect in the first quarter of 2010, as well as a higher number of shares outstanding as a result of the March 2009 issuance of nearly 19 million common shares. On February 8, 2011, our Board of Trustees declared a quarterly common dividend of $0.275 per share, payable on March 31, 2011 to shareholders of record as of March 1, 2011, which equates to $1.10 per share dividend on an annualized basis. This increase represented an approximately 7.3 percent increase over the previous dividend rate. Assuming completion of our proposed merger with NSTAR and subject to the conditions in the merger agreement, our first quarterly dividend per common share declared after the completion of the proposed merger will be increased to an amount that is equivalent, after adjusting for the exchange ratio, to NSTAR's last quarterly dividend paid prior to the closing. Based on the last quarterly dividend paid by NSTAR of $0.425 per share, and assuming there are no changes to such dividend prior to the closing of the merger, that would result in NU quarterly dividend being increased by approximately 18 percent to approximately $0.325 per share, or approximately $1.30 per share on an annualized basis. Our ability to pay common dividends is subject to approval by our Board of Trustees and our future earnings and cash flow requirements and may be limited by state statute, the leverage restrictions in our revolving credit agreement and the ability of our subsidiaries to pay common dividends to NU parent. The Federal Power Act limits the payment of dividends by CL&P, PSNH and WMECO to their respective retained earnings balances unless a higher amount is approved by FERC; PSNH is required to reserve an additional amount of retained earnings under its FERC hydroelectric license conditions. In addition, relevant state statutes may impose 33 additional limitations on the payment of dividends by the Regulated companies. CL&P, PSNH, WMECO and Yankee Gas also are parties to a revolving credit agreement that imposes leverage restrictions. We do not expect the restrictions to prevent NU from meeting its obligations under the merger agreement. In general, the Regulated companies pay approximately 60 percent of their earnings to NU parent in the form of common dividends. In 2010, CL&P, PSNH, WMECO, and Yankee Gas paid $217.7 million, $50.6 million, $14.9 million, and $18.8 million, respectively, in common dividends to NU parent. In 2010, NU parent made equity contributions to CL&P, PSNH and WMECO of $2.5 million, $159 million and $102.5 million, respectively. Cash capital expenditures included on the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows and described in this "Liquidity" section do not include amounts incurred on capital projects but not yet paid, cost of removal, AFUDC related to equity funds, and the capitalized portions of pension and PBOP expense or income. A summary of our cash capital expenditures by company for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 is as follows: For the Years Ended December 31, (Millions of Dollars) 2010 2009 2008 CL&P $ 380.3 $ 435.7 $ 849.5 PSNH 296.3 266.4 238.9 WMECO 115.2 105.4 78.3 Yankee Gas 82.5 54.8 58.3 NPT 7.5 - - Other 72.7 45.8 30.4 Total $ 954.5 $ 908.1 $ 1,255.4 The increase in our cash capital expenditures was the result of higher distribution segment capital expenditures of $66.3 million, particularly at PSNH and Yankee Gas, and an increase in Other of $26.9 million primarily related to technology and facility projects at NUSCO, one of our corporate service companies. These increases were offset by a $46.8 million decrease in transmission segment capital expenditures primarily by CL&P. Business Development and Capital Expenditures Consolidated: Our consolidated capital expenditures, including amounts incurred but not paid, cost of removal, AFUDC, and the capitalized portions of pension and PBOP expense or income (all of which are non-cash factors), totaled $1 billion in 2010, $969.2 million in 2009 and $1.3 billion in 2008. These amounts included $68.7 million in 2010, $52.7 million in 2009 and $33.2 million in 2008 related to our corporate service companies, NUSCO and RRR. Regulated Companies: Capital expenditures for the Regulated companies totaled $967 million ($412.6 million for CL&P, $310 million for PSNH, and $138.4 million for WMECO) in 2010. Transmission Segment : Transmission segment capital expenditures decreased by $30.9 million in 2010, as compared with 2009, due primarily to reductions in expenditures at CL&P and PSNH, partially offset by increases at WMECO and capital expenditures incurred by NPT for the Northern Pass project. A summary of transmission segment capital expenditures by company in 2010, 2009 and 2008 is as follows: For the Years Ended December 31, (Millions of Dollars) 2010 2009 2008 CL&P $ 107.2 $ 163.0 $ 586.3 PSNH 49.1 59.4 81.9 WMECO 95.2 67.7 46.1 NPT 9.4 1.7 - Total $ 260.9 $ 291.8 $ 714.3 CL&P and WMECO have received siting approvals in Connecticut and Massachusetts, respectively, for the first and largest component of our NEEWS project, GSRP, which involves the construction of 115 KV and 345 KV lines from Ludlow, Massachusetts, to Bloomfield, Connecticut. We commenced substation construction in December 2010 and expect to begin overhead line construction in the first half of 2011. We expect the cost of GSRP to be $795 million and to place the project in service in late 2013. In June 2010, residents living near the proposed Connecticut route of the GSRP appealed the CSC approval in New Britain Superior Court, claiming that the CSC acted improperly by approving an overhead route for the line. We do not expect the appeal to have a material impact on the timing of construction. Our second major NEEWS project is the Interstate Reliability Project, which is being designed and built in coordination with National Grid USA. CL&P's share of this project includes an approximately 40-mile, 345 KV all overhead line from Lebanon, Connecticut to the Connecticut-Rhode Island border where it would connect with enhancements National Grid USA is designing in Rhode Island and Massachusetts. In August 2010, ISO-NE reaffirmed the need for the Interstate Reliability Project, which is now expected to be placed in service in late 2015. This in-service date assumes that siting applications are filed in all three states in late 2011, with orders received in mid/late 2013 and construction commencing in late 2013 or early 2014. We expect CL&P's share of the costs of this project to be $301 million. 34 The third major part of NEEWS is the Central Connecticut Reliability Project, which involves construction of a new line from Bloomfield, Connecticut to Watertown, Connecticut. This line would provide another 345 KV all overhead connection to move power across the state of Connecticut. The timing of this project is expected to be twelve months behind the Interstate Reliability Project. We expect the cost of this project to be $338 million. ISO-NE continues to assess the need date for the Central Connecticut Reliability Project and we expect that ISO-NE will conclude its evaluation by mid-2011. Included as part of NEEWS are $84 million of expenditures for associated reliability related projects, all of which have received siting approval and most of which are under construction. The in-service dates for these projects range from later this year through 2013. Since inception of NEEWS through December 31, 2010, CL&P and WMECO have capitalized approximately $105.9 million and $136.9 million, respectively, in costs associated with NEEWS, of which $38.4 million and $62.6 million, respectively, were capitalized in 2010. The total cost estimate for the NEEWS projects is $1.52 billion. As these projects are completed and put in service, actual costs may differ from these estimates. On October 4, 2010, NPT and Hydro Renewable Energy entered into a TSA in connection with the Northern Pass transmission project. Northern Pass is comprised of a planned HVDC transmission line from the U.S./Canadian border to Franklin, New Hampshire and an associated alternating current radial transmission line between Franklin and Deerfield, New Hampshire that will be constructed by NPT. Northern Pass will interconnect at the U.S./Canadian border with a planned HVDC transmission line that HQ Trans nergie, the transmission division of HQ, will construct in Qu bec. Consistent with the FERC's February 11, 2011 order accepting without modification the TSA between NPT and Hydro Renewable Energy that was filed on December 15, 2010, NPT will sell to Hydro Renewable Energy 1,200 MW of firm electric transmission rights over the Northern Pass for a 40-year term and charge cost-based rates. The projected cost-of-service calculation includes an ROE of 12.56 percent through the construction phase of the project, and upon commercial operation, the ROE will be equal to the ISO-NE regional rates base ROE (currently 11.14 percent) plus 1.42 percent. The TSA rates will be based on a deemed capital structure for NPT of 50 percent debt and 50 percent equity. During the development and the construction phases under the TSA, NPT will be recording non-cash AFUDC earnings. On October 13, 2010, NPT filed the Northern Pass project design with ISO-NE for technical approval and on October 14, 2010, NPT filed a presidential permit application with the DOE, which seeks permission to construct and maintain facilities that cross the U.S. border and connect to HQ Trans nergie's facilities in Canada. NPT anticipates filing additional state and federal permit and siting applications in 2011. Assuming timely regulatory review and siting approvals, NPT expects to commence construction of Northern Pass in 2013 and complete the line with power flowing in late 2015. We currently estimate that NU's 75 percent share of the Northern Pass transmission project will be approximately $830 million and NSTAR 25 percent share of the Northern Pass transmission project will be approximately $280 million, for a combined total expected cost of approximately $1.1 billion (including capitalized AFUDC). In July 2010, CL&P and UI entered into an agreement providing UI an option to make quarterly payments to CL&P in exchange for ownership of specific Connecticut based NEEWS transmission assets as they come into commercial operation. Under the agreement, which has received approval of the FERC and the DPUC, UI will have the right to invest up to $69 million or an amount equal to 8.4 percent of CL&P's costs for the Connecticut portion of these projects, which are expected to aggregate to approximately $828 million. On December 30, 2010, CL&P received the first of these deposits in the amount of $7.2 million. The impact of the UI transaction is reflected in the 2010 capital expenditures and our five-year capital expenditures and rate base forecasts. On December 17, 2010, CL&P and the Connecticut Transmission Municipal Electric Energy Cooperative (CTMEEC), a non-profit municipal joint action transmission entity formed by several Connecticut municipal electric companies, filed with the DPUC and the FERC a joint application seeking regulatory approval of the transfer of a segment of high voltage transmission lines built by CL&P in the town of Wallingford, Connecticut. FERC approval for the transfer was received on January 31, 2011. The purchase price will be based on the net book value of the assets at the time of the closing of the sale, plus any additional closing adjustments. This segment of lines is projected to have a value of $42.3 million at the anticipated time of closing in May of 2011. CL&P will continue to operate and maintain the lines for CTMEEC. The transaction does not include the transfer of land or equipment not related to electric transmission service. The transaction will not impact our five-year capital plan and is already reflected in CL&P transmission rate base forecasts. 35 Distribution Segment : Distribution segment capital expenditures increased by $81.4 million in 2010, as compared with 2009, due to expenditures related primarily to the PSNH Clean Air Project, the WMECO solar generation project, and the Yankee Gas WWL Project. A summary of distribution segment capital expenditures by company for 2010, 2009 and 2008 is as follows: For the Years Ended December 31, (Millions of Dollars) 2010 2009 2008 CL&P: Basic business $ 126.2 $ 104.6 $ 114.7 Aging infrastructure 104.0 104.1 95.4 Load growth 75.2 74.3 86.5 Total CL&P 305.4 283.0 296.6 PSNH: Basic business 41.2 55.5 41.6 Aging infrastructure 19.5 17.8 19.6 Load growth 23.1 25.5 37.0 Total PSNH 83.8 98.8 98.2 WMECO: Basic business 17.5 21.5 18.1 Aging infrastructure 10.5 12.2 12.9 Load growth 5.1 4.0 6.8 Total WMECO 33.1 37.7 37.8 Totals - Electric Distribution (excluding Generation) 422.3 419.5 432.6 Yankee Gas 94.6 59.6 44.0 Other 2.0 0.6 0.5 Total Distribution 518.9 479.7 477.1 PSNH Generation: Clean air project 149.7 119.3 24.8 Other 27.4 25.7 49.2 Total PSNH Generation 177.1 145.0 74.0 WMECO Generation 10.1 - - Total Distribution Segment $ 706.1 $ 624.7 $ 551.1 For the electric distribution business, basic business includes the relocation of plant, the purchase of meters, tools, vehicles, and information technology. Aging infrastructure relates to the planned replacement of overhead lines, plant substations, transformer replacements, and underground cable replacement. Load growth includes requests for new business and capacity additions on distribution lines and substation overloads. For the natural gas business, basic business includes the relocation of conflicting natural gas facilities due to municipal and state road work and the purchase of meters, tools, and information technology. Aging infrastructure relates to the planned replacement of natural gas facilities. Load growth includes requests for new natural gas service, new service mains and new distributed generation service. PSNH's Clean Air Project is a wet scrubber project under construction at its Merrimack coal station, the cost of which will be recovered through PSNH's ES rates under New Hampshire law. Construction costs are running below their previously announced cost of $457 million and the project is expected to be completed in mid-2012, about a year ahead of schedule. We currently expect the project to cost approximately $430 million, including capitalized interest and equity returns. Since inception of the project, PSNH has capitalized $296.5 million associated with this project, of which $149.7 million was capitalized in 2010. Construction of the project was approximately 80 percent complete as of December 31, 2010. On August 12, 2009, the DPU approved a stipulation agreement between WMECO and the Massachusetts Attorney General concerning WMECO's proposal, under the Massachusetts Green Communities Act, to install 6 MW of solar energy generation in its service territory at an estimated cost of $41 million by the end of 2012. In October 2010, WMECO completed construction of a 1.8 MW solar generation facility on a site in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. The full cost of this project was approximately $9.4 million, all of which WMECO has capitalized as of December 31, 2010. On January 17, 2011, WMECO announced its plans to develop a second project on a site in Springfield, Massachusetts. WMECO believes this site is capable of accommodating a 4.2 MW solar generation facility. The major permitting and procurement activities for this project are underway and, assuming their favorable and timely completion, WMECO woul d expect to begin construction during the second quarter of 2011. In April 2010, Yankee Gas commenced construction of its WWL Project, a 16-mile natural gas pipeline between Waterbury and Wallingford, Connecticut and the increase of vaporization output of its LNG plant. The project is now expected to cost $57.6 million, down from our previously announced cost of approximately $63 million. Construction during 2010, which cost $26.6 million, included the completion of Phase I, a seven-mile segment of pipeline connecting the Cheshire and Wallingford distribution systems, and four miles of Phase II. The remainder of the Phase II pipeline construction (approximately five miles) and the expansion of the vaporization capacity of the LNG facility are expected to be completed by the fourth quarter of 2011. Construction of the project was 46 percent complete as of December 31, 2010 and is currently on schedule. Strategic Initiatives: We continue to evaluate a number of development projects that will benefit our customers, some of which are detailed below. 36 Over the past three years, we have participated in discussions with other utilities, policymakers, and prospective developers of renewable energy projects in the New England region regarding a framework whereby renewable power projects built in rural areas of northern New England could be connected to the electric load centers of New England. We believe there are significant opportunities for developers to build wind and biomass projects in northern New England that could help the region meet its renewable portfolio standards. We believe that a collaborative approach among project developers and transmission owners is necessary to be able to construct needed projects and bring their electrical output into the market. We have not yet included any capital expenditures associated with potential projects in our five-year capital program and these discussions are continuing. On March 31, 2010, CL&P filed with the DPUC an AMI and dynamic pricing plan that included a cost benefit analysis. CL&P concluded that a full deployment of AMI meters accompanied by dynamic pricing options for all CL&P customers would be cost beneficial under a set of reasonable assumptions, identified as the "base case scenario." Under the base case scenario, capital expenditures associated with the installation of the meters are estimated at $296 million, which are included in the Company's five-year capital program. Under CL&P's proposal, installation of meters is proposed to begin in late 2012 and continue through 2016. The DPUC procedural review began in late October 2010 and is scheduled to end in April 2011. On October 16, 2009, WMECO filed its proposal for a dynamic pricing smart meter pilot program with the DPU. On July 27, 2010, the DPU approved a settlement agreement between WMECO, the Attorney General and other stakeholders to postpone implementation of a dynamic pricing smart meter pilot program until results of smart meter pilots conducted by three other Massachusetts utilities are gathered and WMECO's meter data management system is operational. WMECO does not expect it will conduct a pilot program prior to 2012. Projected Capital Expenditures and Rate Base Estimates: Excluding the impacts of the proposed merger with NSTAR, a summary of the projected capital expenditures for the Regulated companies' electric transmission segment and their distribution segment (including generation) by company for 2011 through 2015, including our corporate service companies' capital expenditures on behalf of the Regulated companies, is as follows: Year (Millions of Dollars) 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2011-2015 Total CL&P transmission $ 137 $ 194 $ 169 $ 229 $ 280 $ 1,009 PSNH transmission 59 75 58 45 56 293 WMECO transmission 229 260 161 75 7 732 NPT 19 23 241 298 241 822 Subtotal transmission $ 444 $ 552 $ 629 $ 647 $ 584 $ 2,856 CL&P distribution: Basic business $ 135 $ 146 $ 137 $ 218 $ 276 $ 912 Aging infrastructure 131 108 116 116 118 589 Load growth 71 66 65 78 75 355 Total CL&P distribution 337 320 318 412 469 1,856 PSNH distribution: Basic business 49 48 48 51 52 248 Aging infrastructure 26 28 40 41 35 170 Load growth 38 41 39 40 45 203 Total PSNH distribution 113 117 127 132 132 621 WMECO distribution: Basic business 15 16 16 17 17 81 Aging infrastructure 15 13 13 14 14 69 Load growth 6 10 10 9 9 44 Total WMECO distribution 36 39 39 40 40 194 Subtotal electric distribution $ 486 $ 476 $ 484 $ 584 $ 641 $ 2,671 PSNH generation: Clean air project $ 77 $ 34 $ 22 $ - $ - $ 133 Other 35 18 30 29 29 141 Total PSNH generation 112 52 52 29 29 274 WMECO generation 22 9 5 5 5 46 Subtotal generation $ 134 $ 61 $ 57 $ 34 $ 34 $ 320 Yankee Gas distribution: Basic business $ 37 $ 31 $ 30 $ 31 $ 33 $ 162 Aging infrastructure 30 48 50 51 52 231 Load growth 16 20 46 47 35 164 WWL project 30 - - - - 30 Total Yankee Gas distribution $ 113 $ 99 $ 126 $ 129 $ 120 $ 587 Corporate service companies $ 32 $ 28 $ 35 $ 34 $ 28 $ 157 Total $ 1,209 $ 1,216 $ 1,331 $ 1,428 $ 1,407 $ 6,591 Yankee Gas determines the amount of capital spending by category based on business needs and opportunities. Future capital spending will likely be affected by price differences between the cost of natural gas with respect to home heating oil, natural gas supply, new home construction, road reconstruction, regulatory mandates and business requirements. 37 Actual capital expenditures could vary from the projected amounts for the companies and periods above. Economic conditions in the northeast could impact the timing of our major transmission projects. Most of these capital investment projections, including those for NPT, assume timely regulatory approval, which in most cases requires extensive review. Delays in or denials of those approvals could reduce the levels of expenditures, associated rate base, and anticipated EPS growth. Based on the 2010 actual and 2011 through 2015 projected capital expenditures, the 2010 actual and 2011 through 2015 projected transmission, distribution and generation rate base as of December 31 of each year are as follows: Year (Millions of Dollars) 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 CL&P transmission $ 2,149 $ 2,114 $ 2,178 $ 2,234 $ 2,394 $ 2,552 PSNH transmission 341 360 406 406 505 540 WMECO transmission 269 459 650 730 834 803 NPT - - - - - 830 Total transmission 2,759 2,933 3,234 3,370 3,733 4,725 CL&P distribution 2,273 2,382 2,540 2,736 3,007 3,297 PSNH distribution 803 866 947 1,006 1,070 1,143 WMECO distribution 412 422 425 429 439 453 Total electric distribution 3,488 3,670 3,912 4,171 4,516 4,893 PSNH generation 394 399 727 742 740 728 WMECO generation 11 27 31 31 33 35 Total generation 405 426 758 773 773 763 Yankee Gas distribution 682 743 756 790 847 969 Total $ 7,334 $ 7,772 $ 8,660 $ 9,104 $ 9,869 $ 11,350 Transmission Rate Matters and FERC Regulatory Issues CL&P, PSNH and WMECO and most other New England utilities, generation owners and marketers are parties to a series of agreements that provide for coordinated planning and operation of the region's generation and transmission facilities and the rules by which these parties participate in the wholesale markets and acquire transmission services. Under these arrangements, ISO-NE, a non-profit corporation whose board of directors and staff are independent from all market participants, has served as the RTO for New England since February 1, 2005. ISO-NE works to ensure the reliability of the New England transmission system, administers the independent system operator tariff, subject to FERC approval, oversees the efficient and competitive functioning of the regional wholesale power market and determines the portion of the costs of our major transmission facilities that are regionalized throughout New England. Transmission - Wholesale Rates: NU's transmission rates recover total transmission revenue requirements, ensuring that we recover all regional and local revenue requirements. These rates provide for annual true-ups to actual costs. The financial impacts of differences between actual and projected costs are deferred for future recovery from, or refund to, customers. As of December 31, 2010, NU was in a total overrecovery position of $40.9 million ($37.2 million for CL&P, $3 million for PSNH, and $0.7 million for WMECO), which will be refunded to customers in June 2011. Pursuant to a series of orders involving the ROE for regionally planned New England transmission projects, the FERC set the base ROE at 11.14 percent and approved incentives that increased the ROE to 12.64 percent for those projects that were in-service by the end of 2008. In addition, certain projects were granted additional ROE incentives by FERC under its transmission incentive policy. As a result, CL&P earns between 12.64 percent and 13.1 percent on its major transmission projects. All appeals of FERC's orders on the ROE for New England transmission owners have been denied. NEEWS Incentives: On November 17, 2008, the FERC issued an order granting incentives and rate amendments to us and National Grid USA for the NEEWS projects. The approved incentives included (1) an ROE of 12.89 percent, representing an incentive of 125 basis points; (2) 100 percent inclusion of CWIP in rate base; and (3) full recovery of prudently incurred costs if NEEWS, or any portion thereof, is cancelled as a result of factors beyond NU's or National Grid USA's control. Several parties have sought rehearing of this yet to be acted upon FERC order. Legislative Matters 2010 Federal Legislation: On March 23, 2010, President Obama signed into law the 2010 Healthcare Act. The 2010 Healthcare Act was amended by a Reconciliation Bill signed into law on March 30, 2010. The 2010 Healthcare Act includes a provision that eliminated the tax deductibility of certain PBOP contributions equal to the amount of the federal subsidy received by companies like NU, which sponsor retiree health care benefit plans with a prescription drug benefit that is actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D. The tax deduction eliminated by this legislation represented a loss of previously recognized deferred income tax assets established through 2009 and as a result, these assets were written down by approximately $18 million in the first quarter of 2010. Since the electric and natural gas distribution companies are cost-of-service and rate-regulated, a portion of the $18 million was able to be deferred and recovered th rough future rates. For the year ended December 31, 2010, NU deferred approximately $15 million of recoverable write-offs related to these businesses and reduced 2010 earnings on a net basis by approximately $3 million of non-recoverable costs. In addition, as a result of the elimination of the tax deduction in 2010, NU was not able to recognize approximately $2 million of net annual benefits. 38 On September 27, 2010, President Obama signed into law the Small Business Jobs and Credit Act of 2010, which extends the bonus depreciation provisions of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 to small and large businesses through 2010. This extended stimulus provided NU with cash flow benefits of approximately $100 million. On December 17, 2010, President Obama signed into law the 2010 Tax Act, which, among other things, provides 100 percent bonus depreciation for tangible personal property placed in service after September 8, 2010, and through December 31, 2011. For tangible personal property placed in service after December 31, 2011, and through December 31, 2012, the 2010 Tax Act provides for 50 percent bonus depreciation. We expect the 2010 Tax Act to provide NU with cash flow benefits of approximately $250 million in 2011 and approximately $450 million to $550 million over the period 2011 through 2013. 2010 Connecticut Legislation: In May 2010, the Connecticut Legislature approved a state budget for the 2010-2011 fiscal year, which calls for the issuance by the state of Connecticut of up to $760 million of economic recovery revenue bonds that would be amortized over eight years. These bonds will be repaid through a charge on the bills of customers of CL&P and other Connecticut electric distribution companies. For CL&P, the revenue to pay interest and principal on the bonds would come from a continuation of a portion of its CTA, which would have otherwise ended by December 31, 2010 with the final principal and interest payment on its RRBs, and the diversion of about one-third of the annual funding for C&LM programs beginning in April 2012. On September 29, 2010, the DPUC approved a financing order for the bonds. A lawsuit fil ed by a state senator against the DPUC could delay the issuance. By order dated December 21, 2010, the trial court dismissed the state senator suit on jurisdictional grounds, and the state senator promptly appealed that order to the Connecticut Appellate Court. The DPUC has requested that the case be transferred to the Connecticut Supreme Court and decided on an expedited schedule. In addition, several bills have been introduced by the state senator and other state lawmakers to rescind the law authorizing these bonds. Unlike the RRBs issued in 2001, the revenues, interest expense and amortization expense associated with these bonds, should they be issued, will not be reflected on CL&P financial statements. Regulatory Developments and Rate Matters Connecticut - CL&P: Distribution Rates: On January 8, 2010, CL&P filed an application with the DPUC to raise distribution rates by $133.4 million (later revised to $129 million) to be effective July 1, 2010 and by an additional $44.2 million (later revised to $41.4 million) to be effective July 1, 2011. On June 30, 2010, the DPUC issued a final order in the distribution rate case, which approved annualized rate increases of $63.4 million effective July 1, 2010 and an additional $38.5 million effective July 1, 2011. The 2010 increase was deferred from customer bills until January 1, 2011 to coincide with the decline in revenue requirements associated with the amortization of the aforementioned CL&P RRBs, which more than offset the revenue requirements associated with the January 1, 2011 distribution rate increase. While CL&P earnings benefitted in the second half of 2010 from the rate decision as a resul t of declines in depreciation and maintenance expense, cash flow benefits will not begin until early 2011 when customer bills begin to reflect an approximately $110 million increase in distribution rates. That $110 million increase reflects the two distribution rate increases and the recovery of approximately $32 million in maintenance expense that was deferred for recovery from the second half of 2010 to 2011 and the first half of 2012. In its decision, the DPUC also maintained CL&P authorized distribution segment regulatory ROE of 9.4 percent. Standard Service and Last Resort Service Rates: CL&P's residential and small commercial customers who do not choose competitive suppliers are served under SS rates, and large commercial and industrial customers who do not choose competitive suppliers are served under LRS rates. CL&P is fully recovering from customers the costs of its SS and LRS services. Effective January 1, 2011, the DPUC approved a decrease to CL&P total average SS rate of approximately 7.8 percent and a slight increase to CL&P total average LRS rate of approximately 0.8 percent. The energy supply portion of the total average SS rate decreased from 11.282 cents per KWh to 9.732 cents per KWh while the energy supply portion of the total average LRS rate increased from 7.062 cents per KWh to 7.193 cents per KWh. CTA and SBC Reconciliation : On March 31, 2010, CL&P filed with the DPUC its 2009 CTA and SBC reconciliation, which compared CTA and SBC revenues charged to customers to revenue requirements and allows for full recovery of revenue requirements. For the 12 months ended December 31, 2009, total CTA revenue requirements exceeded CTA revenues by $46.9 million. For the 12 months ended December 31, 2009, the SBC revenues exceeded SBC revenue requirements by $23.7 million. On November 10, 2010, a decision in the 2009 CTA and SBC docket was issued approving the 2009 CTA and SBC reconciliations as filed. The decision stated that the CTA and SBC rates would need to be reset effective January 1, 2011 based on current projections. On December 22, 2010, the DPUC approved new CTA and SBC rates, effective January 1, 2011, using updated information provided by CL&P. Based on that updated information, the CTA rate decreased from 1.054 cents per KWh to 0.332 cents per KWh and the SBC rate decreased from 0.207 cents per KWh to 0.037 cents per KWh. FMCC Filing: On February 5, 2010, CL&P filed with the DPUC its semi-annual filing, which reconciled actual FMCC revenues and charges and GSC revenues and expenses, for the period July 1, 2009 through December 31, 2009, and also included the previously filed revenues and expenses for the January 1, 2009 through June 30, 2009 period. The filing identified a total net underrecovery of $6.5 million, which includes the remaining uncollected portions from previous filings. On November 10, 2010, the DPUC issued a final decision accepting CL&P's calculations of GSC, bypassable FMCC and nonbypassable FMCC revenues and expenses for the period July 1, 2009 through December 31, 2009. On August 5, 2010, CL&P filed with the DPUC its semi-annual FMCC filing for the period January 1, 2010 through June 30, 2010. The filing identified a total net underrecovery of $7 million for the period, which includ es the remaining uncollected portions from previous filings. On January 6, 2011, the DPUC issued a decision accepting CL&P's calculations of GSC, bypassable FMCC and nonbypassable FMCC revenues and expenses for the period January 1, 2010 through June 30, 2010. 39 On February 4, 2011, CL&P filed with the DPUC its semi-annual filing, which reconciled actual FMCC revenues and charges and GSC revenues and expenses, for the period July 1, 2010 through December 31, 2010, and also included the previously filed revenues and expenses for the January 1, 2010 through June 30, 2010 period. The filing identified a total net overrecovery of $0.3 million, which includes the remaining uncollected portions from previous filings. We do not expect the outcome of the DPUC's review of this filing to have a material adverse impact on CL&P's financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Procurement Fee Rate Proceedings: In prior years, CL&P submitted to the DPUC its proposed methodology to calculate the variable incentive portion of its transition service procurement fee, which was effective for the years 2004, 2005 and 2006, and requested approval of the pre-tax $5.8 million 2004 incentive fee. CL&P has not recorded amounts related to the 2005 and 2006 procurement fee in earnings. CL&P recovered the $5.8 million pre-tax amount, which was recorded in 2005 earnings, through a CTA reconciliation process. On January 15, 2009, the DPUC issued a final decision in this docket reversing its December 2005 draft decision and stated that CL&P was not eligible for the procurement incentive compensation for 2004. A $5.8 million pre-tax charge (approximately $3.5 million net of tax) was recorded in the 2008 earnings of CL&P, and an obligation to refund the $5.8 million to cust omers was established as of December 31, 2008. CL&P filed an appeal of this decision on February 26, 2009. On February 4, 2010, the Connecticut Superior Court reversed the DPUC decision. The Court remanded the case back to the DPUC for the correction of several specific errors. On February 22, 2010, the DPUC appealed the Connecticut Superior Court February 4, 2010 decision to the Connecticut Appellate Court, which then transferred the appeal to the Connecticut Supreme Court. A decision is expected from the Connecticut Supreme Court in late 2011 or early 2012. Connecticut Yankee Gas Distribution Rates: On January 7, 2011, Yankee Gas filed an application with the DPUC to increase its distribution rates by $32.8 million, or 7.3 percent, to be effective July 1, 2011, and by an additional $13 million, or 2.8 percent, to be effective July 1, 2012. Among other items, Yankee Gas requested to maintain its current authorized regulatory ROE of 10.1 percent, that $57.6 million of costs associated with the WWL Project be placed into rates, and a substantial increase in capital funding to replace bare steel and cast iron pipe throughout its natural gas distribution system. A final decision is expected in June 2011. New Hampshire: Distribution Rates: On June 28, 2010, the NHPUC approved a joint settlement agreement of PSNH permanent distribution rate case, effective July 1, 2010, reached in April 2010 among PSNH, the NHPUC staff and the Office of Consumer Advocate. Under the agreement, the settling parties agreed to a net annualized distribution rate increase of $45.5 million, effective July 1, 2010, and annualized distribution rate adjustments projected to be a decrease of $2.9 million and increases of $9.5 million and $11.1 million on July 1 of each of the three subsequent years. The $45.5 million increase was in addition to the $25.6 million temporary increase that became effective August 1, 2009 and includes $13.7 million to reconcile the difference between the temporary rates and the permanent rates back to August 1, 2009. The projected decrease of $2.9 million on July 1, 2011 reflects primarily the end of the one ye ar recovery of the $13.7 million reconciliation on that date. PSNH also agreed not to file a new distribution rate request prior to July 1, 2015. During the term of the settlement, PSNH ability to propose changes to its permanent distribution rate level will be limited to situations where its 12-month distribution ROE falls below 7 percent for two consecutive quarters or certain specified external events occur, as described in the settlement. If PSNH's 12-month distribution ROE rolling average is greater than 10 percent, anything over the 10 percent level will be allocated 75 percent to customers and 25 percent to PSNH. The settlement also provided that the authorized regulatory ROE on distribution only plant will continue at the previously allowed level of 9.67 percent. ES and SCRC Filings : On June 11, 2010, PSNH petitioned the NHPUC to change the 2010 ES and SCRC rates. On June 28, 2010, the NHPUC issued orders approving ES and SCRC rates of 8.78 cents per KWh and 1.20 cents per KWh, respectively, effective July 1, 2010. On September 21, 2010, PSNH filed petitions with the NHPUC requesting changes in both its ES and SCRC annual rates for the period January 1, 2011 through December 31, 2011. On December 16, 2010, PSNH submitted final proposed ES and SCRC rates of 8.67 cents per KWh and 1.17 cents per KWh, respectively. On December 29, 2010, the NHPUC issued orders approving the ES and SCRC rate petitions as filed. TCAM Filing: On June 3, 2010, PSNH filed a petition with the NHPUC requesting reconciliation of the TCAM revenues and costs for 2009, and recovery of forecasted retail transmission costs for the period July 1, 2010 through June 30, 2011. On June 11, 2010, PSNH petitioned the NHPUC for a TCAM rate of 1.501 cents per KWh. On June 28, 2010, the NHPUC issued an order approving the TCAM rate as filed. ES and SCRC Reconciliation: On an annual basis, PSNH files with the NHPUC an ES/SCRC cost reconciliation filing for the preceding year. On April 30, 2010, PSNH filed its 2009 ES/SCRC reconciliation with the NHPUC, whose evaluation includes a prudence review of PSNH's generation and power purchase activities. As of December 31, 2009 PSNH had an ES regulatory asset and an SCRC regulatory asset of $4.4 million and $3.9 million, respectively, which is being recovered from customers in the 2010 ES/SCRC rate period. Merrimack Clean Air Project: On July 7, 2009, the New Hampshire Site Evaluation Committee determined that PSNH's Clean Air Project to install wet scrubber technology at its Merrimack Station was not subject to the Committee's review as a "sizeable" addition to a power plant under state law. That Committee upheld its decision in an order dated January 15, 2010, denying requests for rehearing. This order was appealed on February 23, 2010. On April 15, 2010, the New Hampshire Supreme Court determined that it would accept the appeal. Briefs have been filed and the Court has scheduled oral arguments for March 10, 2011. We do not believe that the appeal will have a material impact on the timing or costs of the project. PSNH is continuing with construction of this project and has capitalized $296.5 million since inception of the project through December 31, 2010. 40 Massachusetts: Distribution Rates: On July 16, 2010, WMECO filed an application with the DPU, requesting approval of a $28.4 million increase in distribution rates and a decoupling plan to be effective February 1, 2011. Among other items, WMECO sought a distribution segment regulatory ROE of 10.5 percent, recovery over five years of its remaining deferred December 2008 and 2010 major storm costs and recovery of its hardship receivable costs. On January 31, 2011, the DPU issued a final decision approving an annualized rate increase of $16.8 million effective February 1, 2011, an authorized distribution segment regulatory ROE of 9.6 percent, a decoupling plan with no inflation adjustment, recovery of certain 2008 and 2010 major storm costs over five years, and recovery of certain hardship receivable costs. Basic Service Rates : In 2010, fixed basic service rates ranged from 7.647 cents per KWh to 8.237 cents per KWh for residential customers, 8.44 cents per KWh to 8.972 cents per KWh for small commercial and industrial customers, and 7.052 cents per KWh to 8.893 cents per KWh for medium and large commercial and industrial customers. Effective January 1, 2011, the rates for all basic service customers changed to reflect the basic service solicitations conducted by WMECO in November 2010. Fixed basic service rates for residential customers decreased to 6.993 cents per KWh, rates for small commercial and industrial customers decreased to 8.006 cents per KWh and rates for large commercial and industrial customers decreased to 7.405 cents per KWh. The fixed price increased by 0.063 cents per KWh for street lighting customers to 5.822 cents per KWh. Transition Cost Reconciliation : On May 12, 2010, WMECO filed its 2009 cost reconciliation for transition, transmission, basic/default service, basic/default service adder, and capital projects scheduling list. A public hearing was held on July 12, 2010. An evidentiary hearing was held on November 12, 2010. The briefing period ended on December 17, 2010. We do not expect the outcome of the DPU's review of this filing to have a material adverse impact on WMECO's financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Pension Factor Reconciliation Filing : On July 2, 2009, WMECO filed the 2008 reconciliation for its pension factor revenues and expenses. An evidentiary hearing was held on March 26, 2010 and the briefing period ended on May 20, 2010. On August 31, 2010, the DPU issued an approval order. The order did not have a material adverse impact on WMECO's financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Deferred Contractual Obligations Refer to Note 12D, "Commitments and Contingencies Deferred Contractual Obligations," to the consolidated financial statements and also Part I, Item 3, "Legal Proceedings," for discussion of recent changes with regard to the CYAPC, YAEC, and MYAPC litigation against the DOE. Enterprise Risk Management We have implemented an Enterprise Risk Management methodology for identifying the principal risks of the Company. Enterprise Risk Management involves the application of a well-defined, enterprise-wide methodology that enables our Risk and Capital Committee, comprised of our senior officers, to oversee the identification, management and reporting of the principal risks of the business. However, there can be no assurances that the Enterprise Risk Management process will identify or manage every risk or event that could impact our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. The findings of this process are periodically discussed with our Board of Trustees. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates, assumptions and, at times, difficult, subjective or complex judgments. Changes in these estimates, assumptions and judgments, in and of themselves, could materially impact our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Our management communicates to and discusses with our Audit Committee of the Board of Trustees significant matters relating to critical accounting policies and estimates. Our critical accounting policies and estimates are discussed below. See the combined notes to our consolidated financial statements for further information concerning the accounting policies, estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Regulatory Accounting: The accounting policies of the Regulated companies conform to GAAP applicable to rate-regulated enterprises and historically reflect the effects of the rate-making process. The application of accounting guidance applicable to rate-regulated enterprises results in recording regulatory assets and liabilities. Regulatory assets represent the deferral of incurred costs that are probable of future recovery in customer rates. In some cases, we record regulatory assets before approval for recovery has been received from the applicable regulatory commission. We must use judgment to conclude that costs deferred as regulatory assets are probable of future recovery. We base our conclusion on certain factors, including, but not limited to, regulatory precedent. Regulatory liabilities represent revenues received from customers to fund expected costs that have not yet been incurred or probable future refunds to customers. We use our best judgment when recording regulatory assets and liabilities; however, regulatory commissions can reach different conclusions about the recovery of costs, and those conclusions could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. We believe it is probable that the Regulated companies will recover the regulatory assets that have been recorded. If we determined that we could no longer apply the accounting guidance applicable to rate-regulated enterprises to our operations, or if we could not 41 conclude that it is probable that costs would be recovered or reflected in future rates, the costs would be charged to earnings in the period in which they were incurred. If we determine that a regulatory asset is no longer probable of recovery in rates, then we would record the charge in earnings at that time. For further information, see Note 2, "Regulatory Accounting," to the consolidated financial statements. Unbilled Revenues: The determination of retail energy sales to residential, commercial and industrial customers is based on the reading of meters, which occurs on a systematic basis throughout the month. Billed revenues are based on these meter readings and the majority of recorded revenues is based on actual billings. At the end of each month, amounts of energy delivered to customers since the date of the last meter reading are estimated, and an estimated amount of unbilled revenues is recorded. Unbilled revenues represent an estimate of electricity or natural gas delivered to customers but not yet billed. Unbilled revenues are included in Operating Revenues on the statement of income and are assets on the balance sheet that are reclassified to Accounts Receivable in the following month as customers are billed. Such estimates are subject to adjustment when actual meter readings become available, when changes in estimating methodology occur and under other circumstances. There were no changes in estimating methodology in 2010. The Regulated companies estimate unbilled revenues monthly using the daily load cycle (DLC) method. The DLC method allocates billed sales to the current calendar month based on the daily load for each billing cycle. The billed sales are subtracted from total calendar month sales to estimate unbilled sales. Unbilled revenues are estimated by first allocating sales to the respective rate classes and then applying an average rate to the estimate of unbilled sales. The estimate of unbilled revenues is sensitive to numerous factors, such as energy demands, weather and changes in the composition of customer classes, that can significantly impact the amount of revenues recorded. For further information, see Note 1M, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Revenues," to the consolidated financial statements. Pension and PBOP: Our subsidiaries participate in a Pension Plan covering certain of our regular employees and in a PBOP Plan to provide certain health care benefits, primarily medical and dental, and life insurance benefits to retired employees. For each of these plans, the development of the benefit obligation, fair value of plan assets, funded status and net periodic benefit cost is based on several significant assumptions. We evaluate these assumptions at least annually and adjust them as necessary. Changes in these assumptions could have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Pre-tax net periodic pension expense for the Pension Plan was $80.4 million, $39.7 million and $2.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The pre-tax net PBOP Plan expense was $41.6 million, $37.2 million and $36.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. We develop key assumptions for purposes of measuring the plans liabilities as of December 31 and expenses for the subsequent year. These assumptions include the long-term rate of return on plan assets, discount rate, compensation/progression rate, and health care cost trend rates and are discussed below. Long-Term Rate of Return on Plan Assets : In developing this assumption, we consider historical and expected returns and input from our actuaries and consultants. Our expected long-term rate of return on assets is based on assumptions regarding target asset allocations and corresponding expected rates of return for each asset class. We routinely review the actual asset allocations and periodically rebalance the investments to the targeted asset allocations when appropriate. We used aggregate expected long-term rate of return assumptions of 8.25 percent and 8.75 percent on Pension Plan assets and PBOP Plan life and non-taxable health assets and a 6.45 percent and 6.85 percent for PBOP taxable health assets as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Discount Rate : Payment obligations related to the Pension Plan and PBOP Plan are discounted at interest rates applicable to the timing of the plans cash flows. The discount rate that is utilized in determining the pension and PBOP obligations is based on a yield-curve approach. The yield curve is developed from the top quartile of "AA-rated" Moody and S&P bonds without callable features outstanding as of December 31, 2010. The discount rates determined on this basis are 5.57 percent for the Pension Plan and 5.28 percent for the PBOP Plan as of December 31, 2010 and 5.98 percent and 5.73 percent for the respective plans as of December 31, 2009. Compensation/Progression Rate : This assumption reflects the expected long-term salary growth rate, which impacts the estimated benefits that pension plan participants receive in the future. We used a compensation/progression rate of 3.5 percent and 4.0 percent as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The 3.5 percent rate reflects our current expectation of future salary increases and promotions, including consideration of the levels of increases built into union contracts. Actuarial Determination of Expense : Pension and PBOP expense are determined by our actuaries and consist of service cost and prior service cost, interest cost based on the discounting of the obligations, amortization of actuarial gains and losses and amortization of the net transition obligation, offset by the expected return on plan assets. Actuarial gains and losses represent differences between assumptions and actual information or updated assumptions. We determine the expected return on plan assets by applying our assumed rate of return to a calculation of plan assets that recognizes investment gains or losses over a four-year period after the year in which they occur, which reduces year-to-year volatility. Investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the calculated expected return using our long-term rate of return assumption 42 and the actual return or loss based on the change in the fair value of assets during the year. As of December 31, 2010, investment losses that remain to be reflected in the calculation of plan assets over the next four years were $238.9 million and $1.8 million for the Pension Plan and PBOP Plan, respectively. These asset losses will be subject to amortization with other unrecognized actuarial gains or losses as they are reflected in the calculation of plan assets. The plans currently amortize unrecognized actuarial gains or losses as a component of pension and PBOP expense over the average future employee service period of approximately 10 and 9 years, respectively. As of December 31, 2010, the net unrecognized actuarial losses on the Pension and PBOP Plan liabilities, subject to amortization, were $676.7 million and $171.3 million, respectively. Forecasted Expenses and Expected Contributions : Based upon the assumptions and methodologies discussed above, we estimate that forecasted expense for the Pension Plan and PBOP Plan will be $124.9 million and $42.8 million, respectively, in 2011, which is included in our earnings guidance. Pension and PBOP expense for subsequent years will depend on future investment performance, changes in future discount rates and other assumptions, and various other factors related to the populations participating in the plans. Pension and PBOP expense charged to earnings is net of the amounts capitalized. We expect to continue our policy to contribute to the PBOP Plan at the amount of PBOP expense, excluding curtailments and special benefit amounts and adding contributions for the amounts received from the federal Medicare subsidy. NU's policy is to annually fund the Pension Plan in an amount at least equal to what will satisfy the requirements of ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code. NU's Pension Plan has historically been well funded, and a contribution was not required to be made from 1991 until the third quarter of 2010, when PSNH made a contribution to the plan of $45 million. Using the segment rate approach as allowed under PPA guidelines, our Pension Plan funded ratio (the value of plan assets divided by the funding target in accordance with the requirement of the PPA) was 92 percent as of January 1, 2010. We currently estimate that quarterly contributions aggregating to a total of approximately $145 million will be made in 2011. Sensitivity Analysis : The following represents the increase to the Pension Plan and PBOP Plan reported cost as a result of a change in the following assumptions by 50 basis points (in millions): As of December 31, Pension Plan Cost Postretirement Plan Cost Assumption Change 2010 2009 2010 2009 Lower long-term rate of return $ 10.7 $ 11.1 $ 1.2 $ 1.7 Lower discount rate $ 13.4 $ 12.0 $ 2.2 $ 1.5 Higher compensation increase $ 6.1 $ 6.0 N/A N/A Health Care Cost : The health care cost trend assumption used to project increases in medical costs was 7.5 percent for determining 2010 PBOP Plan expense. For 2011 through 2013, the rate is 7 percent, subsequently decreasing one half percentage point per year to an ultimate rate of 5 percent in 2017. The effect of increasing the health care cost trend by one percentage point would have increased service and interest cost components of PBOP Plan expense by $1.2 million in 2010, with a $14.5 million impact on the postretirement benefit obligation. See Note 10A, "Employee Benefits - Pension Benefits and Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions," to the consolidated financial statements for more information. Goodwill and Intangible Assets: We are required to test goodwill balances for impairment at least annually by applying a fair value-based test that requires us to use estimates and judgment. We have selected October 1 st of each year as the annual goodwill impairment testing date. Goodwill impairment is deemed to exist if the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value and if the implied fair value of goodwill based on the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount of the goodwill. If goodwill is deemed to be impaired, it is written down in the current period to the extent of the impairment. We performed an impairment analysis as of October 1, 2010 for the Yankee Gas goodwill balance of $287.6 million. We determined that no triggering events occurred in 2010 that would have required testing before or after October 1 st . We determined that the fair value of Yankee Gas substantially exceeds its carrying value and no impairment exists. In performing the evaluation, we estimated the fair value of the Yankee Gas reporting unit and compared it to the carrying amount of the reporting unit, including goodwill. We estimated the fair value of Yankee Gas using a discounted cash flow methodology and two market approaches that analyze comparable companies or transactions. This evaluation requires the input of several critical assumptions, including future growth rates, cash flow projections, operating cost escalation rates, rates of return, a risk-adjusted discount rate, long-term earnings and merger multiples of comparable companies. We determined the discount rate using the capital asset pricing model methodology. This methodology uses a weighted average cost of capital in which the ROE is developed using risk-free rates, equity premiums and a beta representing Yankee Gas' volatility relative to the overall market. The resulting discount rate is intended to be comparable to a rate that would be applied by a market participant. The discount rate may change from year to year as it is based on external market conditions. The discount rate decreased in 2010, as compared to 2009, as a result of lower beta and risk-free treasury rates. Income Taxes: Income tax expense is estimated annually for each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves estimating current and deferred income tax expense or benefit and the impact of temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items. Such differences are the result of timing of the deduction for expenses, as well as any impact of permanent differences resulting from tax credits, non-tax deductible expenses, in addition to various other items, including items that directly impact our tax return as a result of a regulatory activity (flow-through items). The temporary differences and flow-through items result in 43 deferred tax assets and liabilities that are included in the consolidated balance sheets. The income tax estimation process impacts all of our segments. We record income tax expense quarterly using an estimated annualized effective tax rate. Adjustments to these estimates can significantly impact our consolidated financial statements. A reconciliation of expected tax expense at the statutory federal income tax rate to actual tax expense recorded is included in Note 11, "Income Taxes," to the consolidated financial statements. We also account for uncertainty in income taxes, which applies to all income tax positions previously filed in a tax return and income tax positions expected to be taken in a future tax return that have been reflected on our balance sheets. We follow generally accepted accounting principles to address the methodology to be used in recognizing, measuring and classifying the amounts associated with tax positions that are deemed to be uncertain, including related interest and penalties. The determination of whether a tax position meets the recognition threshold under this guidance is based on facts, circumstances and information available to us. Once a tax position meets the recognition threshold, the tax benefit is measured using a cumulative probability assessment. Assigning probabilities in measuring a recognized tax position and evaluating new information or events in subsequent periods requires significant judgm ent and could change previous conclusions used to measure the tax position estimate. New information or events may include tax examinations or appeals, developments in case law, settlements of tax positions, changes in tax law and regulations, rulings by taxing authorities and statute of limitation expirations. Such information or events may have a significant impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Accounting for Environmental Reserves: Accounting for Environmental Reserves: Environmental reserves are accrued when assessments indicate that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and an amount can be reasonably estimated. Adjustments made to environmental reserves could have a significant impact on earnings. We estimate these liabilities based on findings through various phases of the assessment, considering the most likely action plan from a variety of available options (ranging from no action to full site remediation and long-term monitoring), current site information from our site assessments, remediation estimates from third party engineering and remediation contractors, and our prior experience in remediating contaminated sites. Our estimates incorporate currently enacted state and federal environmental laws and regulations and data released by the EPA and other organizations. The estimates associated with each possible action plan are judgmental in nature partly because there are usually several different remediation options from which to choose. Our estimates are subject to revision in future periods based on actual costs or new information from other sources, including the level of contamination at the site. For further information, see Note 12A, "Commitments and Contingencies- Environmental Matters," to the consolidated financial statements. Fair Value Measurements: We follow fair value measurement guidance that defines fair value as the price that would be received for the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (an exit price). We have applied this guidance to the Company's derivative contracts that are recorded at fair value, marketable securities held in NU supplemental benefit trust and WMECO spent nuclear fuel trust, our valuations of investments in our pension and PBOP plans, and nonrecurring fair value measurements of nonfinancial assets such as goodwill and AROs. Derivative assets are a large portion of our total assets measured at fair value (excluding assets held in our external pension and PBOP trusts), and derivative liabilities comprise almost all of our total liabilities measured at fair value as of December 31, 2010. Changes in fair value of the regulated company derivative contracts are recorded as Regulatory assets or liabilities, as we expect to recover the costs of these contracts in rates. These valuations are sensitive to the prices of energy and energy related products in future years for which markets have not yet developed and assumptions are made. A significant portion of our derivative liabilities relate to the Regulated companies, for which changes in fair value do not affect our earnings and are not material to our liquidity or capital resources because the costs and benefits of the contracts are recoverable from or refundable to customers on a timely basis. We use quoted market prices when available to determine fair values of financial instruments. If quoted market prices are not available, fair value is determined using quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments that are not active and model-derived valuations. When quoted prices in active markets for the same or similar instruments are not available, we value derivative contracts using models that incorporate both observable and unobservable inputs. Significant unobservable inputs utilized in the models include energy and energy-related product prices for future years for long-dated derivative contracts, future contract quantities under full requirements and supplemental sales contracts, and market volatilities. Discounted cash flow valuations incorporate estimates of premiums or discounts, reflecting risk adjusted profit that would be required by a market participant to arrive at an exit price, using available historical market transaction information. Valuations of derivative contracts also reflect our estimates of nonperformance risk, including credit risk. For further information see Item 7A, "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk," included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a sensitivity analysis of how changes in the prices of energy and energy related products would impact earnings. For further information on derivative contracts and marketable securities, see Note 1J, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Derivative Accounting," Note 4, "Derivative Instruments," and Note 5, "Marketable Securities," to the consolidated financial statements. 44 Other Matters Environmental Matter: HWP, a subsidiary of NU, continues to investigate the potential need for additional remediation at a river site in Massachusetts containing tar deposits associated with an MGP site that HWP sold to HG&E, a municipal utility, in 1902. As of December 31, 2010, HWP has a $2.9 million reserve for estimated costs that HWP considers probable over the remaining life of the project. Although a material increase to the reserve is not presently anticipated, management cannot reasonably estimate potential additional investigation or remediation costs because these costs would depend, among other things, on the nature, extent and timing of additional investigation and remediation that may be required by the MA DEP. For further information, see Note 12A, "Commitments and Contingencies- Environmental Matters," to the consolidated financial statements. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments: Information regarding our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of December 31, 2010 is summarized annually through 2015 and thereafter as follows: NU (Millions of Dollars) 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Thereafter Total Long-term debt maturities (a) (b) $ 66.3 $ 267.3 $ 305.0 $ 275.0 $ 150.0 $ 3,327.9 $ 4,391.5 Estimated interest payments on existing debt (c) 236.2 231.8 220.6 208.9 194.8 1,871.4 2,963.7 Capital leases (d) 2.5 2.6 2.4 2.0 2.0 11.4 22.9 Operating leases (e) 7.9 7.0 6.8 4.9 4.5 19.1 50.2 Funding of pension obligations (e) (j) 145.0 160.0 100.0 90.0 40.0 - 535.0 Funding of other postretirement benefit obligations (e) 42.8 41.9 24.2 21.7 20.2 - 150.8 Estimated future annual companies costs (f) 641.2 719.4 596.9 550.5 478.6 3,404.1 6,390.7 Other purchase commitments (e) (h) 1,570.4 - - - - - 1,570.4 Total (g) (i) $ 2,712.3 $ 1,430.0 $ 1,255.9 $ 1,153.0 $ 890.1 $ 8,633.9 $ 16,075.2 CL&P (Millions of Dollars) 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Thereafter Total Long-term debt maturities (a) (b) $ 62.0 $ - $ - $ 150.0 $ 100.0 $ 2,031.7 $ 2,343.7 Estimated interest payments on existing debt (c) 133.8 133.8 133.8 133.8 124.1 1,381.7 2,041.0 Capital leases (d) 1.9 2.0 2.0 1.8 1.8 11.3 20.8 Operating leases (e) 7.2 6.8 6.7 6.5 6.5 23.0 56.7 Funding of other postretirement benefit obligations (e) 17.0 16.6 8.1 7.3 6.8 6.4 62.2 Estimated future annual long-term contractual costs (f) 284.2 415.1 436.5 451.5 397.7 3,129.5 5,114.5 Other purchase commitments (e) (h) 598.2 - - - - - 598.2 Total (g) (i) $ 1,104.3 $ 574.3 $ 587.1 $ 750.9 $ 636.9 $ 6,583.6 $ 10,237.1 (a) Included in our debt agreements are usual and customary positive, negative and financial covenants. Non-compliance with certain covenants, for example timely payment of principal and interest, may constitute an event of default, which could cause an acceleration of principal payments in the absence of receipt by us of a waiver or amendment. Such acceleration would change the obligations outlined in the table of contractual obligations and commercial commitments. (b) Long-term debt maturities exclude $301 million and $243.8 million for NU and CL&P, respectively, of fees and interest due for spent nuclear fuel disposal costs, a positive $11.8 million for NU of net changes in fair value of hedged debt and a negative $5.1 million and $4.4 million for NU and CL&P, respectively, of net unamortized premium and discount as of December 31, 2010. (c) Estimated interest payments on fixed-rate debt are calculated by multiplying the coupon rate on the debt by its scheduled notional amount outstanding for the period of measurement. Estimated interest payments on floating-rate debt are calculated by multiplying the average of the 2010 floating-rate resets on the debt by its scheduled notional amount outstanding for the period of measurement. This same rate is then assumed for the remaining life of the debt. Interest payments on debt that have an interest rate swap in place are estimated using the effective cost of debt resulting from the swap rather than the underlying interest cost on the debt, subject to the fixed and floating methodologies. (d) The capital lease obligations include imputed interest of $10.7 million and $10.2 million for NU and CL&P, respectively, as of December 31, 2010. (e) Amounts are not included on our consolidated balance sheets. (f) Other than the net mark-to-market changes on respective derivative contracts held by both the Regulated companies and NU Enterprises, these obligations are not included on our consolidated balance sheets. On February 7, 2010, an explosion occurred at the construction site of Kleen Energy Systems, LLC 620 MW generation project with which CL&P has a Contract for Differences (CfD) contract. This event could delay or change CL&P estimated payments under the CfD contract. For further information, see Note 12C, "Commitments and Contingencies - Long-Term Contractual Arrangements," to the consolidated financial statements. (g) Does not include unrecognized tax benefits of $101.2 million for NU and $80.8 million for CL&P as of December 31, 2010, as we cannot make reasonable estimates of the periods or the potential amounts of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities. Also does not include an NU $50 million contingent commitment to an energy investment fund, which would be invested under certain conditions, as we cannot make reasonable estimates of the periods or the investment contributions. 45 (h) Amount represents open purchase orders, excluding those obligations that are included in the capital leases, operating leases, estimated future annual regulated company costs and the estimated future annual NU Enterprises costs. These payments are subject to change as certain purchase orders include estimates based on projected quantities of material and/or services that are provided on demand, the timing of which cannot be determined. Because payment timing cannot be determined, we include all open purchase order amounts in 2011. (i) For NU, excludes other long-term liabilities, including a significant portion of the unrecognized tax benefits described above, deferred contractual obligations ($133.1 million), environmental reserves ($37.1 million), various injuries and damages reserves ($35.1 million), employee medical insurance reserves ($6.9 million), long-term disability insurance reserves ($12 million) and the ARO liability reserves ($53.3 million) as we cannot make reasonable estimates of the timing of payments. For CL&P, excludes unrecognized tax benefits described above, deferred contractual obligations ($91.7 million) environmental reserves ($2.8 million), various injuries and damages reserves ($23.5 million), employee medical insurance reserves ($2.2 million), long-term disability insurance reserves ($3.8 million) and the ARO liability reserves ($29.3 million). (j) These amounts represent NU's estimated minimum pension contributions to its qualified Pension Plan required under ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code. Contributions in 2012 through 2015 will vary depending on many factors, including the performance of existing plan assets, valuation of the plan's liabilities and long-term discount rates, and are subject to change. RRB amounts are non-recourse to us, have no required payments over the next five years and are not included in this table. The Regulated companies' standard offer service contracts and default service contracts are also not included in this table. For further information regarding our contractual obligations and commercial commitments, see the consolidated statements of capitalization and Note 8, "Short-Term Debt," Note 9, "Long-Term Debt," Note 10A, "Employee Benefits - Pension Benefits and Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions," Note 12C, "Commitments and Contingencies - Long-Term Contractual Arrangements," and Note 13, "Leases," to the consolidated financial statements.

The tracked electric distribution revenues decreased due primarily to lower generation service and related congestion charges ($574 million) and lower CL&P delivery-related FMCC ($39 million), partially offset by higher retail transmission revenues ($66 million) and higher transition cost recoveries ($48 million). The tracking mechanisms allow for rates to be changed periodically with overcollections refunded to customers or undercollections recovered from customers in future periods. In addition, Regulated companies revenues that eliminate in consolidation decreased by $92 million. The portion of electric distribution revenues that impacts earnings increased $40 million due primarily to a 1.7 percent increase in retail electric sales due to warmer than normal summer weather and PSNH's rate changes that were effective July 1, 2010. A decrease in natural gas revenues was due primarily to lower cost of fuel, as fuel costs are fully recovered in revenues from sales to our customers, offset by an increase in sales volume. Firm natural gas sales increased 1.9 percent in 2010 compared to 2009. Improved transmission segment revenues resulting from a higher level of investment in this segment and the return of higher overall expenses, which are tracked and result in a related increase in revenues. The increase in expenses is directly related to the increase in transmission plant, including costs associated with higher property taxes, depreciation and operation and maintenance expenses. 47 Fuel, Purchased and Net Interchange Power Fuel, Purchased and Net Interchange Power decreased in 2010, as compared to 2009, due primarily to the following: (Millions of Dollars) 2010 Increase/(Decrease) as compared to 2009 Lower GSC supply costs, deferred fuel costs and other purchased power costs at CL&P $ (437.4) An increased level of ES customer migration to third party electric suppliers, partially offset by higher retail sales at PSNH (157.4) Lower basic/default service supply costs at WMECO (34.9) Lower prices on purchased natural gas, partially offset by a lower net underrecovery in 2010 at Yankee Gas (19.7) Increased competitive businesses' expenses due primarily to lower Select Energy mark-to-market gains 5.4 $ (644.0) Other Operating Expenses Other Operating Expenses decreased in 2010, as compared to 2009, due primarily to: Lower distribution and transmission segment expenses of $66 million were due primarily to lower costs that are recovered through distribution tracking mechanisms that have no earnings impact ($65 million), such as retail transmission, RMR and customer service expenses, and lower uncollectibles expense at Yankee Gas ($16 million), partially offset by higher electric distribution and natural gas expenses ($22 million and $3 million, respectively), including higher pension costs and storm restoration costs, and higher transmission segment expenses ($4 million). In addition, amounts that eliminate in consolidation primarily related to service company charges decreased by $45 million. Higher NU parent and other companies expenses of $22 million due primarily to costs incurred in 2010 related to NU's proposed merger with NSTAR and higher pension and environmental costs. Maintenance Maintenance decreased in 2010, as compared to 2009, due primarily to the allowed regulatory deferral of approximately $32 million as a result of the June 30, 2010 CL&P rate case decision, of which $29.5 million was recognized as a deferral in maintenance expense, lower boiler and maintenance costs at PSNH generation business ($12 million), offset by higher distribution segment overhead line expenses ($13 million), higher distribution segment vegetation management costs ($2 million) and higher transmission segment routine station maintenance expenses ($2 million). Depreciation Depreciation decreased in 2010, as compared to 2009, due primarily to a lower depreciation rate being used at CL&P as a result of the distribution rate case decision that was effective July 1, 2010, partially offset by higher utility plant balances resulting from completed construction projects placed into service in 2010. Amortization of Regulatory Assets, Net Amortization of Regulatory Assets, Net increased in 2010, as compared to 2009, due primarily to a higher recovery of CTA costs at CL&P ($39 million), higher PSNH amortization on the ES deferral and TCAM ($42 million and $11 million, respectively), and previously deferred unrecovered stranded generation costs at WMECO ($11 million), partially offset by the impact of the 2010 Healthcare Act related to the deferral of lost tax benefits that we believe are probable of recovery in future electric and natural gas distribution rates ($26 million). Taxes Other Than Income Taxes (Millions of Dollars) 2010 Increase/(Decrease) as compared to 2009 Connecticut Gross Earnings Tax $ 8.9 Property Taxes 12.5 Use Taxes 10.4 Other 0.7 $ 32.5 The increase in Taxes Other Than Income Taxes was due primarily to an increase in property taxes as a result of an increase in Property, Plant and Equipment related to our capital programs. The Connecticut Gross Earnings Tax increased primarily as a result of an increase in the transmission segment revenues and an increase in distribution segment revenues primarily related to retail transmission and higher transition cost recoveries in 2010, as compared to 2009. The increase in use taxes was due primarily to the absence in 2010 of a Connecticut state use tax refund. 48 Interest Expense For the Years Ended December 31, (Millions of Dollars) 2010 2009 Increase/ (Decrease) Percent Interest on Long-Term Debt $ 231.1 $ 224.7 $ 6.4 2.8 % Interest on RRBs 20.6 36.5 (15.9) (43.6) Other Interest (14.4) 12.4 (26.8) (a) $ 237.3 $ 273.6 $ (36.3) (13.3) % (a) Percent greater than 100 percent not shown as it is not meaningful. Interest Expense decreased in 2010, as compared to 2009, due primarily to the settlement of various state tax matters in the fourth quarter of 2010, which resulted in a reduction in Other Interest and lower Interest on RRBs resulting from lower principal balances outstanding, offset by higher Interest on Long-Term Debt as a result of $145 million in new long-term debt issuances in the first half of 2010 and $400 million in 2009, $150 million of which was issued by PSNH in December 2009. Other Income, Net For the Years Ended December 31, (Millions of Dollars) 2010 2009 Increase/ (Decrease) Percent Other Income, Net $ 41.9 $ 37.8 $ 4.1 10.8 % Other Income, Net increased in 2010, as compared to 2009, due primarily to higher AFUDC related to equity funds ($7 million), higher C&LM and EIA incentives ($3 million and $2 million, respectively), offset with lower investment and interest income ($4 million and $2 million, respectively). Income Tax Expense For the Years Ended December 31, (Millions of Dollars) 2010 2009 Increase/ (Decrease) Percent Income Tax Expense $ 210.4 $ 179.9 $ 30.5 17.0 % Income Tax Expense increased in 2010, as compared to 2009, due primarily to the impacts of the 2010 Healthcare Act ($30 million) and higher pre-tax earnings ($10 million), partially offset by lower impacts related to items that directly impact our tax return as a result of a regulatory activity ("flow-through") and other impacts ($5 million) and adjustments for prior years' taxes including adjustments to reconcile estimated taxes accrued to actual amounts reflected in our filed tax returns ($5 million). Comparison of 2009 to 2008 : Revenues and Expenses For the Years Ended December 31, (Millions of Dollars) 2009 2008 Increase/ (Decrease) Percent Operating Revenues $ 5,439.4 $ 5,800.1 $ (360.7) (6.2) % Operating Expenses: Fuel, Purchased and Net Interchange Power 2,629.6 2,996.2 (366.6) (12.2) Other Operating Expenses 1,001.2 1,021.7 (20.5) (2.0) Maintenance 234.2 254.0 (19.8) (7.8) Depreciation 309.6 278.6 31.0 11.1 Amortization of Regulatory Assets, Net 13.3 186.4 (173.1) (92.9) Amortization of Rate Reduction Bonds 217.9 204.9 13.0 6.3 Taxes Other Than Income Taxes 282.2 267.5 14.7 5.5 Total Operating Expenses 4,688.0 5,209.3 (521.3) (10.0) Operating Income $ 751.4 $ 590.8 $ 160.6 27.2 % 49 Operating Revenues For the Years Ended December 31, (Millions of Dollars) 2009 2008 Increase/ (Decrease) Percent Electric Distribution $ 4,358.4 $ 4,716.1 $ (357.7) (7.6) % Natural Gas Distribution 449.6 577.4 (127.8) (22.1) Total Distribution 4,808.0 5,293.5 (485.5) (9.2) Transmission 577.9 424.8 153.1 36.0 Total Regulated Companies 5,385.9 5,718.3 (332.4) (5.8) Competitive Businesses 81.3 114.1 (32.8) (28.7) Other and Eliminations (27.8) (32.3) 4.5 13.9 NU $ 5,439.4 $ 5,800.1 $ (360.7) (6.2) % A summary of our retail electric sales and firm natural gas sales were as follows: For the Years Ended December 31, 2009 2008 Increase/ (Decrease) Percent Retail Electric Sales in GWh 33,645 34,883 (1,238) (3.5) % Firm Natural Gas Sales in Million Cubic Feet 42,450 39,717 2,733 6.9 % Operating Revenues decreased in 2009, as compared to 2008, due primarily to lower distribution segment revenues ($485 million) as a result of the recovery of a lower level of electric and natural gas distribution fuel and other expenses passed through to customers through regulatory tracking mechanisms. Electric distribution revenues decreased due primarily to a decrease in the portion of electric distribution revenues that does not impact earnings ($395 million), partially offset by an increase in the component of revenues that impacts earnings ($37 million). The portion of electric distribution revenues that impacts earnings increased $37 million due primarily to higher CL&P and PSNH retail rates, partially offset by lower retail electric sales. Retail electric sales for the Regulated companies decreased 3.5 percent. Natural gas distribution revenues decreased $128 million due primarily to decreased recovery of fuel costs primarily as a result of lower prices, partially offset by higher sales volumes. Firm natural gas sales increased 6.9 percent in 2009 compared with 2008. The $395 million decrease in electric distribution revenues that does not impact earnings consists of the portions of distribution revenues that are included in regulatory commission approved tracking mechanisms that recover certain incurred costs ($356 million) and revenues that are eliminated in consolidation of the Regulated companies ($39 million). The distribution revenue tracking components decreased $356 million due primarily to lower recovery of generation service and related congestion charges ($331 million) and lower CL&P wholesale revenues as a result of decreased market revenue related to sales of IPP purchased generation output ($163 million), partially offset by higher retail transmission revenues ($104 million) mainly as a result of the higher 2009 retail rates. The tracking mechanisms allow for rates to be changed periodically with overcollections refunded to customers or undercollections recovered from cu stomers in future periods. Transmission segment revenues increased due primarily to a higher transmission investment base as a result of the completion of our southwest Connecticut projects in 2008 and higher overall expenses. Competitive businesses' revenues decreased $33 million due primarily to lower Boulos revenues as a result of less work on transmission projects and a lower level of work in other areas. Fuel, Purchased and Net Interchange Power Fuel, Purchased and Net Interchange Power decreased in 2009, as compared to 2008, due primarily to the following: (Millions of Dollars) 2009 Increase/(Decrease) as compared to 2008 Lower GSC supply costs and other purchased power costs, partially offset by an increase in deferred fuel costs at CL&P $ (154.7) Lower prices on purchased natural gas at Yankee Gas (132.6) An increased level of ES customer migration to third party electric suppliers and lower retail sales, partially offset by higher forward energy market prices at PSNH (37.8) Lower basic/default service supply costs at WMECO (45.2) Increased competitive businesses' expenses due primarily to lower Select Energy mark-to-market gains 3.7 $ (366.6) 50 Other Operating Expenses Other Operating Expenses decreased in 2009, as compared to 2008, due primarily to lower NU parent and other companies' expenses ($49 million) and lower competitive businesses' expenses ($39 million), partially offset by higher distribution and transmission segment expenses ($68 million). NU parent and other companies' expenses were lower by $49 million in 2009 due primarily to the absence of the $49.5 million payment resulting from the settlement of litigation made in 2008 ($29.8 million after-tax). Competitive businesses' expenses were lower by $39 million due primarily to lower Boulos expenses as a result of a lower level of work. Higher distribution and transmission segment expenses of $68 million were due primarily to higher electric distribution segment expenses ($49 million), higher expenses at Yankee Gas ($18 million), and higher transmission segment expenses ($15 million), partially offset by lower costs that are recovered through distribution tracking mechanisms and have no earnings impact ($8 million), and all other operating costs ($6 million). The higher operations expenses impacting earnings include higher uncollectible and pension expenses. Maintenance Maintenance decreased in 2009, as compared to 2008, due primarily to lower distribution segment expenses ($21 million), partially offset by higher transmission line expenses ($1 million). Distribution segment expenses were lower due primarily to lower repair and maintenance of distribution lines ($15 million), including lower storm-related expenses, lower equipment maintenance expenses ($4 million), and lower PSNH generation expenses ($3 million), partially offset by higher vegetation management expenses ($5 million). Depreciation Depreciation increased in 2009, as compared to 2008, due primarily to higher transmission segment ($23 million) and distribution segment ($11 million) plant balances resulting from completed construction projects placed into service. Amortization of Regulatory Assets, Net Amortization of Regulatory Assets, Net decreased $173 million in 2009, as compared to 2008, for the distribution segment due primarily to lower amortization at CL&P resulting from a lower recovery of stranded costs ($131 million) as a result of lower retail CTA revenues and higher transition costs, partially offset by higher amortization of the SBC balance ($15 million). The decreases for PSNH and WMECO are $39 million and $15 million, respectively. Taxes Other Than Income Taxes Taxes Other Than Income Taxes increased in 2009, as compared to 2008, due primarily to higher property taxes ($18 million) as a result of higher plant balances and increased municipal tax rates and higher payroll related taxes, partially offset by the resolution of various routine tax issues primarily surrounding sales and use tax amounts ($8 million). Interest Expense For the Years Ended December 31, (Millions of Dollars) 2009 2008 Increase/ (Decrease) Percent Interest on Long-Term Debt $ 224.7 $ 193.9 $ 30.8 15.9 % Interest on RRBs 36.5 50.2 (13.7) (27.3) Other Interest 12.4 25.0 (12.6) (50.4) $ 273.6 $ 269.1 $ 4.5 1.7 % Interest Expense increased in 2009, as compared to 2008, due primarily to higher Interest on Long-Term Debt resulting from the issuance of new long-term debt in 2008 and 2009, partially offset by lower Interest on RRBs resulting from lower principal balances outstanding, and lower Other Interest mostly related to the resolution of various routine tax issues. Other Income, Net For the Years Ended December 31, (Millions of Dollars) 2009 2008 Increase/ (Decrease) Percent Other Income, Net $ 37.8 $ 50.4 $ (12.6) (25.0) % Other Income, Net decreased in 2009, as compared to 2008, due primarily to lower AFUDC equity income ($20 million) as a result of lower eligible CWIP balances, the absence of interest income related to the federal tax settlement in 2008 ($10 million), and lower CL&P EIA incentives ($6 million), partially offset by higher investment income due primarily to improved results from NU's supplemental benefit trust and the absence of other-than-temporary impairments recorded in 2008 ($24 million). 51 Income Tax Expense For the Years Ended December 31, (Millions of Dollars) 2009 2008 Increase/ (Decrease) Percent Income Tax Expense $ 179.9 $ 105.7 $ 74.2 70.2 % Income Tax Expense increased in 2009, as compared to 2008, due primarily to higher pre-tax earnings ($50 million), lower tax benefits associated with less capital expenditures ($10 million), lower federal and state tax credits ($4 million), and increases in allowance for uncollectible accounts reserves ($3 million). 52 Selected Consolidated Sales Statistics 2010 2009 2008 2007 2006 Revenues: (Thousands) Regulated Companies: Residential $ 2,336,078 $ 2,569,278 $ 2,525,635 $ 2,558,547 $ 2,409,414 Commercial 1,303,841 1,462,786 1,607,224 1,735,923 1,977,444 Industrial 268,598 297,854 399,753 412,381 589,742 Wholesale 506,475 445,261 545,127 392,675 388,635 Streetlighting and Railroads 42,387 33,035 38,522 45,880 52,853 Miscellaneous and Eliminations (29,878) 128,118 24,673 84,043 133,925 Total Electric 4,427,501 4,936,332 5,140,934 5,229,449 5,552,013 Natural Gas 434,277 449,571 577,390 514,185 453,894 Total - Regulated Companies $ 4,861,778 $ 5,385,903 $ 5,718,324 $ 5,743,634 $ 6,005,907 NU Enterprises: Retail $ - $ - $ - $ - $ 583,829 Wholesale 24,633 30,009 31,882 25,992 20,163 Generation - - - - 258,178 Services 51,998 48,195 78,625 68,324 39,887 Miscellaneous and Eliminations 3,716 3,145 3,574 3,354 (243) Total - NU Enterprises $ 80,347 $ 81,349 $ 114,081 $ 97,670 $ 901,814 Other Miscellaneous and Eliminations (43,958) (27,822) (32,310) (19,078) (30,034) Total $ 4,898,167 $ 5,439,430 $ 5,800,095 $ 5,822,226 $ 6,877,687 Regulated Companies - Sales: (GWh) Residential 14,913 14,412 14,509 15,051 14,652 Commercial 14,506 14,474 14,885 15,103 14,886 Industrial 4,481 4,423 5,149 5,635 5,750 Wholesale 3,423 4,183 3,576 3,855 8,777 Streetlighting and Railroads 330 336 340 353 332 Total 37,653 37,828 38,459 39,997 44,397 Regulated Companies - Customers: (Average) Residential 1,704,197 1,696,756 1,700,207 1,697,073 1,686,169 Commercial 192,266 189,265 190,067 189,727 188,281 Industrial 7,150 7,207 7,342 7,291 7,406 Streetlighting and Railroads* 6,292 7,548 4,605 3,855 3,873 Total Electric 1,909,905 1,900,776 1,902,221 1,897,946 1,885,729 Natural Gas 205,885 206,438 204,834 202,743 199,377 Total 2,115,790 2,107,214 2,107,055 2,100,689 2,085,106 *Customer counts were redefined with the implementation of a new customer service system (C2) completed in October 2008. 53 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS THE CONNECTICUT LIGHT AND POWER COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES The following table provides the amounts and variances in operating revenues and expense line items for the consolidated statements of income for CL&P included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008: Comparison of 2010 to 2009 : Revenues and Expenses For the Years Ended December 31, (Millions of Dollars) 2010 2009 Increase/ (Decrease) Percent Operating Revenues $ 2,999.1 $ 3,424.5 $ (425.4) (12.4) % Operating Expenses: Fuel, Purchased and Net Interchange Power 1,253.3 1,690.7 (437.4) (25.9) Other Operating Expenses 524.3 571.0 (46.7) (8.2) Maintenance 96.5 117.8 (21.3) (18.1) Depreciation 172.2 186.9 (14.7) (7.9) Amortization of Regulatory Assets, Net 83.9 45.8 38.1 83.2 Amortization of Rate Reduction Bonds 167.0 156.0 11.0 7.1 Taxes Other Than Income Taxes 214.2 191.2 23.0 12.0 Total Operating Expenses 2,511.4 2,959.4 (448.0) (15.1) Operating Income $ 487.7 $ 465.1 $ 22.6 4.9 % Operating Revenues CL&P's retail electric sales were as follows: For the Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 Increase/ (Decrease) Percent Retail Electric Sales in GWh 22,666 22,266 400 1.8 % CL&P's Operating Revenues decreased in 2010, as compared to 2009, due primarily to: Lower electric distribution revenues related to the portions that are included in DPUC approved tracking mechanisms that track and recover certain incurred costs that do not impact earnings. The tracked electric distribution revenues decreased due primarily to lower GSC and supply-related FMCC revenues ($421 million) and lower delivery-related FMCC revenues ($39 million). The lower GSC and supply-related FMCC revenues were due primarily to lower customer rates resulting from lower average supply prices and additional customer migration to third party electric suppliers in 2010, as compared to 2009. The lower delivery-related FMCC revenues were due primarily to changes in projections for certain delivery-related FMCC costs for 2010 that lowered the average rate charged to customers. These lower revenues were partially offset by higher retail transmission revenues ($37 million), higher transitio n cost recoveries ($27 million) and higher wholesale revenues ($4 million). The tracking mechanisms allow for rates to be changed periodically with overcollections refunded to customers or undercollections recovered from customers in future periods. In addition, transmission segment intracompany billings to the distribution segment that are eliminated in consolidation decreased by $66 million. The portion of electric distribution revenues that impacts earnings decreased $3 million due primarily to an unfavorable variance in demand and customer service charge components offset by a 1.8 percent increase in retail electric sales in 2010, as compared to 2009. Improved transmission segment revenues ($29 million) resulting from a higher level of investment in this segment and the return of higher overall expenses, which are tracked and result in a related increase in revenues. The increase in expenses is directly related to the increase in transmission plant, including costs associated with higher property taxes, depreciation and operation and maintenance expenses. Fuel, Purchased and Net Interchange Power Fuel, Purchased and Net Interchange Power decreased in 2010, as compared to 2009, due primarily to the following: (Millions of Dollars) 2010 Increase/(Decrease) as compared to 2009 GSC Supply Costs $ (385.7) Deferred Fuel Costs (26.0) Other Purchased Power Costs (25.7) $ (437.4) The decrease in GSC supply costs was due primarily to lower average supply prices and additional customer migration to third party electric suppliers in 2010, as compared to 2009. These GSC supply costs are the contractual amounts CL&P must pay to various 54 suppliers that have been awarded the right to supply SS and LRS load through a competitive solicitation process. The decrease in deferred fuel costs was due primarily to a smaller net overrecovery in 2010, as compared to 2009. These costs are included in DPUC approved tracking mechanisms and do not impact earnings. Other Operating Expenses Other Operating Expenses decreased in 2010, as compared to 2009, as a result of lower costs that are recovered through distribution tracking mechanisms and have no earnings impact ($69 million) including RMR ($32 million) and retail transmission ($31 million), partially offset by higher distribution segment expenses ($20 million) mainly as a result of higher administrative and general expenses, including higher pension costs, and higher transmission segment expenses ($3 million). Maintenance Maintenance decreased in 2010, as compared to 2009, primarily related to the allowed regulatory deferral of approximately $32 million as a result of the June 30, 2010 rate case decision, of which $29.5 million was recognized as a deferral in maintenance expense. Partially offsetting this decrease was higher distribution overhead line expenses ($3 million) and higher distribution segment vegetation management costs ($3 million). Depreciation Depreciation decreased in 2010, as compared to 2009, due primarily to a lower depreciation rate being used as a result of the distribution rate case decision that was effective July 1, 2010. Amortization of Regulatory Assets, Net Amortization of Regulatory Assets, Net, increased in 2010, as compared to 2009, due primarily to higher retail CTA revenue ($22 million) and lower CTA transition costs ($17 million). Partially offsetting these increases was a deferral of lost tax benefits related to the 2010 Healthcare Act that we believe are probable of recovery in future electric distribution rates ($15 million). Taxes Other Than Income Taxes (Millions of Dollars) 2010 Increase/(Decrease) as compared to 2009 Connecticut Gross Earnings Tax $ 9.8 Property Taxes 7.0 Use Taxes 5.9 Other 0.3 $ 23.0 The increase in Taxes Other Than Income Taxes was due primarily to an increase in the Connecticut Gross Earnings Tax due primarily to the increase in the transmission segment revenues and an increase in distribution segment revenues primarily related to retail transmission and higher transition cost recoveries in 2010, as compared to 2009. The increase in property taxes was a result of an increase in Property, Plant and Equipment related to CL&P's capital programs. The increase in use taxes was due to the absence in 2010 of a Connecticut state use tax refund. Interest Expense For the Years Ended December 31, (Millions of Dollars) 2010 2009 Increase/ (Decrease) Percent Interest on Long-Term Debt $ 134.6 $ 133.4 $ 1.2 0.9 % Interest on RRBs 7.5 19.1 (11.6) (60.7) Other Interest (4.4) 3.3 (7.7) (a) $ 137.7 $ 155.8 $ (18.1) (11.6) % (a) Percent greater than 100 percent not shown as it is not meaningful. Interest Expense decreased in 2010, as compared to 2009, due primarily to lower Interest on RRBs resulting from lower principal balances outstanding and the settlement of various state tax matters in the fourth quarter of 2010, which resulted in a reduction in Other Interest. Other Income, Net For the Years Ended December 31, (Millions of Dollars) 2010 2009 Increase/ (Decrease) Percent Other Income, Net $ 26.7 $ 25.9 $ 0.8 3.1 % Other Income, Net increased in 2010, as compared to 2009, due primarily to higher C&LM and EIA incentives ($3 million and $3 million, respectively), offset by lower investment income ($3 million) and lower AFUDC related to equity funds ($1 million). 55 Income Tax Expense For the Years Ended December 31, (Millions of Dollars) 2010 2009 Increase/ (Decrease) Percent Income Tax Expense $ 132.4 $ 118.8 $ 13.6 11.4 % Income Tax Expense increased in 2010, as compared to 2009, due primarily to the impacts of the 2010 Healthcare Act ($15 million) and higher pre-tax earnings ($5 million), partially offset by lower impacts related to flow-through items ($4 million) and adjustments to reconcile estimated taxes accrued to actual amounts reflected in our filed tax returns ($2 million). Comparison of 2009 to 2008 : Revenues and Expenses For the Years Ended December 31, (Millions of Dollars) 2009 2008 Increase/ (Decrease) Percent Operating Revenues $ 3,424.5 $ 3,558.4 $ (133.9) (3.8) % Operating Expenses: Fuel, Purchased and Net Interchange Power 1,690.7 1,845.4 (154.7) (8.4) Other Operating Expenses 571.0 557.6 13.4 2.4 Maintenance 117.8 130.4 (12.6) (9.7) Depreciation 186.9 162.6 24.3 14.9 Amortization of Regulatory Assets, Net 45.8 164.2 (118.4) (72.1) Amortization of Rate Reduction Bonds 156.0 145.6 10.4 7.1 Taxes Other Than Income Taxes 191.2 179.2 12.0 6.7 Total Operating Expenses 2,959.4 3,185.0 (225.6) (7.1) Operating Income $ 465.1 $ 373.4 $ 91.7 24.6 % Operating Revenues CL&P's retail electric sales were as follows: For the Years Ended December 31, 2009 2008 Increase/ (Decrease) Percent Retail Electric Sales in GWh 22,266 23,145 (879) (3.8) % Operating Revenues decreased in 2009, as compared to 2008, due to lower distribution segment revenues ($264 million), partially offset by higher transmission segment revenues ($130 million). The distribution segment revenues decreased $264 million due primarily to a decrease in the portion of distribution revenues that does not impact earnings ($289 million). These revenues do not impact earnings, primarily as a result of the inclusion of these distribution revenues in regulatory tracking mechanisms and intracompany revenues that are eliminated in consolidation. The portion of revenues that impacts earnings increased $25 million. The $289 million decrease in distribution segment revenues that does not impact earnings was due primarily to a decrease in the portions of retail revenues that are included in DPUC approved tracking mechanisms that track the recovery of certain incurred costs through CL&P's tariffs ($265 million) and transmission segment intracompany billings to the distribution segment that are eliminated in consolidation ($24 million). The distribution segment revenues included in DPUC approved tracking mechanisms decreased $265 million due primarily to a decrease in revenues associated with the recovery of GSC and supply-related FMCC ($184 million) and lower wholesale revenues as a result of decreased market revenue related to sales of CL&P's IPP purchased generation output to ISO-NE due to a decrease in the market price of energy ($163 million), partially offset by higher retail transmission revenues ($75 million). The lower GSC and supply-related FMCC revenue was due primarily to lower retail sales, lower customer rates resulting from lower average supply prices and additional customer migration to third-party suppliers in 2009, as compared to 2008. The tracking mechanisms allow for rates to be changed periodically with overcollections refunded to customers or undercollections recovered from customers in future periods. The portion of revenues that impacts earnings increased $25 million primarily as a result of rate changes, partially offset by lower retail sales. The 2009 retail sales, as compared to the same period in 2008, decreased 17.6 percent for the industrial, 2.9 percent for the commercial, and 0.7 percent for the residential classes. Total retail sales decreased overall by 3.8 percent. Transmission segment revenues increased $130 million due primarily to a higher transmission investment base as a result of the completion of our southwest Connecticut projects in 2008 and higher overall expenses. 56 Fuel, Purchased and Net Interchange Power Fuel, Purchased and Net Interchange Power decreased in 2009, as compared to 2008, due primarily to lower GSC supply costs ($280 million) and other purchased power costs ($41 million), partially offset by an increase in deferred fuel costs ($165 million), all of which are included in DPUC approved tracking mechanisms. The $280 million decrease in GSC supply costs was due primarily to lower retail sales, lower average supply prices and additional customer migration to third-party suppliers. These GSC supply costs are the contractual amounts CL&P must pay to various suppliers that have been awarded the right to supply SS and LRS load through a competitive solicitation process. The $165 million increase in deferred fuel costs was due primarily to the combined effect of the twelve months of 2008 net underrecovery of GSC and FMCC expenses, as compared to the twelve months of 2009 net overrecovery of these expenses. Other Operating Expenses Other Operating Expenses increased in 2009, as compared to 2008, as a result of higher distribution segment expenses ($36 million) due primarily to pension and expenses related to uncollectible receivable balances, and higher transmission segment expenses, which are tracked and recorded through FERC rate tariffs ($14 million), partially offset by lower costs that are recovered through distribution tracking mechanisms and have no earnings impact ($30 million), and lower transmission segment intracompany billing to the distribution segment that are eliminated in consolidation ($6 million). Maintenance Maintenance decreased in 2009, as compared to 2008, due primarily to lower repair and maintenance of distribution lines ($6 million), including lower storm expenses, lower distribution substation equipment expenses ($2 million), lower transmission segment expenses ($1 million), and lower transformer maintenance expenses ($1 million). Depreciation Depreciation increased in 2009, as compared to 2008, due primarily to higher utility plant balances resulting from completed construction projects placed into service in the transmission segment ($19 million) and the distribution segment ($5 million). Amortization of Regulatory Assets, Net Amortization of Regulatory Assets, Net decreased in 2009, as compared to 2008, due primarily to lower amortization related to the recovery of stranded charges ($131 million) as a result of lower retail CTA revenue and higher transition costs, partially offset by higher amortization of the SBC balance ($15 million). Taxes Other Than Income Taxes Taxes Other Than Income Taxes increased in 2009, as compared to 2008, due primarily to higher property taxes as a result of higher plant balances and increased municipal tax rates ($10 million), higher gross earnings taxes ($4 million) recoverable in rates mainly as a result of higher transmission segment revenues that are subject to gross earnings tax, and higher payroll taxes ($2 million), partially offset by the resolution of various routine tax issues primarily surrounding sales and use tax amounts ($4 million). Interest Expense For the Years Ended December 31, (Millions of Dollars) 2009 2008 Increase/ (Decrease) Percent Interest on Long-Term Debt $ 133.4 $ 105.0 $ 28.4 27.0 % Interest on RRBs 19.1 29.1 (10.0) (34.4) Other Interest 3.3 12.1 (8.8) (72.7) $ 155.8 $ 146.2 $ 9.6 6.6 % Interest Expense increased in 2009, as compared to 2008, due primarily to higher Interest on Long-Term Debt resulting from the $300 million debt issuance in May 2008 and the $250 million debt issuance in February 2009, partially offset by lower Other Interest mostly related to the resolution of various routine tax issues, and lower Interest on RRBs resulting from lower principal balances outstanding. Other Income, Net For the Years Ended December 31, (Millions of Dollars) 2009 2008 Increase/ (Decrease) Percent Other Income, Net $ 25.9 $ 41.9 $ (16.0) (38.2) % Other Income, Net decreased in 2009, as compared to 2008, due primarily to lower AFUDC equity income ($18 million) as a result of lower eligible CWIP due to large transmission projects being completed and placed in-service in 2008 and lower capital expenditures in 2009, the absence in 2009 of interest income related to a federal tax settlement in 2008 ($6 million), and lower EIA incentives ($6 million), partially offset by higher investment income due primarily to improved results from NU's supplemental benefit trust and the absence of other-than-temporary impairments recorded in 2008 ($16 million). 57 Income Tax Expense For the Years Ended December 31, (Millions of Dollars) 2009 2008 Increase/ (Decrease) Percent Income Tax Expense $ 118.8 $ 77.9 $ 40.9 52.5 % Income Tax Expense increased due primarily to higher pre-tax earnings ($23 million), less tax benefits as a result of lower capital expenditures ($9 million), lower state tax credits ($3 million), and increases in allowance for doubtful accounts reserves ($4 million). LIQUIDITY CL&P had cash flows from operating activities in 2010 of $501.7 million, compared with operating cash flows of $482.2 million in 2009 and $267.3 million in 2008 (all amounts are net of RRB payments, which are included in financing activities). Improved cash flows in 2010 were attributed to a decrease in payments made related to CL&P's accounts payable in support of its operating activities. Improved cash flows were further due to increases in amortization on regulatory deferrals primarily attributable to 2009 activity within CL&P CTA tracking mechanism where such costs exceeded revenues resulting in an unfavorable cash flow impact in 2009. Offsetting the improved cash flows was an increase in income tax payments of $29.1 million, which was the result of bonus depreciation tax deduction benefits received throughout 2009 not being extended for the full year of 2010 until the fourth quarter of 2010, as f urther described below. On September 27, 2010, President Obama signed into law the Small Business Jobs and Credit Act of 2010, which extended bonus depreciation tax deduction through 2010. On December 17, 2010, President Obama signed into law the 2010 Tax Act, which, among other things, provides 100 percent bonus depreciation for tangible personal property placed in service after September 8, 2010, and through December 31, 2011. For tangible personal property placed in service after December 31, 2011, and through December 31, 2012, the 2010 Tax Act provides for 50 percent bonus depreciation. We project cash flows provided by operating activities at CL&P of between $600 million and $650 million in 2011, net of RRB payments, the increase over 2010 is due primarily to the cash flow benefits from the 2010 Tax Act. On April 1, 2010, CL&P remarketed $62 million of tax-exempt PCRBs that were subject to a mandatory tender for purchase on April 1, 2010. The PCRBs, which mature on May 1, 2031, carry a coupon rate of 1.4 percent for a one-year period and are subject to a mandatory tender on April 1, 2011, at which time CL&P expects to remarket the bonds. On September 24, 2010, CL&P, together with PSNH, WMECO, and Yankee Gas, entered into a three-year $400 million unsecured revolving credit facility, which expires on September 24, 2013. This facility replaced a five-year $400 million credit facility on similar terms and conditions that was scheduled to expire on November 6, 2010. CL&P is able to draw up to $300 million under this facility, subject to the $400 million maximum aggregate borrowing limit, either on a short-term or a long-term basis subject to regulatory approval. As of December 31, 2010, CL&P had no borrowings under this facility. Other financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2010 included $217.7 million in common dividends paid to NU parent, a $6.2 million increase in NU Money Pool borrowings, and $2.5 million in capital contributions from NU Parent. In 2011, CL&P has the mandatory tender of $62 million, which it pla ns to remarket, but does not have any long-term debt maturities until 2014, and there are no CL&P debt issuances planned for 2011. On November 1, 2010, the DPUC approved CL&P's application requesting authority to issue up to $900 million in long-term debt through 2014. Proceeds will be used to refinance CL&P's short-term debt previously incurred in the ordinary course of business, to finance capital expenditures, to provide working capital and to pay issuance costs. On December 30, 2010, CL&P made its final interest and principal payment on approximately $1.4 billion of rate reduction bonds that were issued in 2001. As a result, CL&P will no longer recover any payments from customers associated with these RRBs. A total of $203.2 million of principal and interest payments were made on these RRBs in 2010. The full amortization of these RRBs in 2010 will reduce CL&P cash flows provided by operating activities in 2011, compared with previous years, but will have no material impact on CL&P operating cash flows net of RRB payments. On October 18, 2010, following the announcement of the proposed merger of NU and NSTAR, Moody's announced that it had reaffirmed the ratings and "stable" outlooks of CL&P and S&P announced that it had placed CL&P's ratings outlooks on credit watch with "positive" implications. On October 19, 2010, also due to the announcement of the proposed merger, Fitch announced that it had reaffirmed the ratings and "stable" outlooks of CL&P. On January 22, 2010, Fitch downgraded CL&P preferred stock rating from BBB to BBB- as a result of revised guidelines for rating preferred stock and hybrid securities in general. Cash capital expenditures included on the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows do not include amounts incurred on capital projects but not yet paid, cost of removal, the AFUDC related to equity funds, and the capitalized portions of pension and PBOP expense or income. CL&P's cash capital expenditures totaled $380.3 million in 2010, compared with $435.7 million in 2009. This decrease was primarily the result of lower transmission segment capital expenditures in 2010. Other investing activities in 2010 included a decrease in lendings to the NU Money Pool of $97.8 million. 58 Selected Consolidated Sales Statistics 2010 2009 2008 2007 2006 Revenues: (Thousands) Residential $ 1,597,754 $ 1,840,750 $ 1,811,845 $ 1,854,404 $ 1,709,700 Commercial 821,872 935,586 1,042,077 1,182,196 1,405,281 Industrial 144,463 151,839 190,723 208,087 380,479 Wholesale 441,660 386,034 484,843 347,514 318,958 Streetlighting and Railroads 32,084 22,638 28,710 35,370 42,099 Miscellaneous (38,731) 87,691 163 54,246 123,294 Total $ 2,999,102 $ 3,424,538 $ 3,558,361 $ 3,681,817 $ 3,979,811 Sales: (GWh) Residential 10,196 9,848 9,913 10,336 10,053 Commercial 9,716 9,705 9,993 10,128 9,995 Industrial 2,467 2,427 2,945 3,264 3,306 Wholesale 3,040 3,434 3,637 3,563 3,749 Streetlighting and Railroads 286 286 294 304 284 Total 25,705 25,700 26,782 27,595 27,387 Customers: (Average) Residential 1,096,576 1,093,229 1,094,991 1,091,799 1,084,937 Commercial 103,166 101,814 102,464 102,411 101,563 Industrial 3,359 3,381 3,613 3,743 3,848 Streetlighting and Railroads* 4,366 5,307 2,883 2,583 2,592 Total 1,207,467 1,203,731 1,203,951 1,200,536 1,192,940 * Customer counts were redefined with the implementation of a new customer service system (C2) completed in October 2008. 59 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS PUBLIC SERVICE COMPANY OF NEW HAMPSHIRE AND SUBSIDIARIES The following table provides the amounts and variances in operating revenues and expense line items for the consolidated statements of income for PSNH included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008: Comparison of 2010 to 2009 : Revenues and Expenses For the Years Ended December 31, (Millions of Dollars) 2010 2009 Increase/ (Decrease) Percent Operating Revenues $ 1,033.4 $ 1,109.6 $ (76.2) (6.9) % Operating Expenses: & nbsp; Fuel, Purchased and Net Interchange Power 363.1 520.5 (157.4) (30.2) Other Operating Expenses 230.2 239.7 (9.5) (4.0) Maintenance 82.4 87.0 (4.6) (5.3) Depreciation 67.2 62.0 5.2 8.4 Amortization of Regulatory Assets/(Liabilities), Net 11.2 (29.6) 40.8 (a) Amortization of Rate Reduction Bonds 50.4 47.5 2.9 6.1 Taxes Other Than Income Taxes 52.7 47.9 4.8 10.0 Total Operating Expenses 857.2 975.0 (117.8) (12.1) Operating Income $ 176.2 $ 134.6 $ 41.6 30.9 % (a) Percent greater than 100 percent not shown as it is not meaningful. Operating Revenues PSNH's retail electric sales were as follows: For the Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 Increase/ (Decrease) Percent Retail Electric Sales in GWh 7,847 7,750 97 1.3 % PSNH's Operating Revenues decreased in 2010, as compared to 2009, due primarily to: A $125 million decrease in distribution revenues that did not impact earnings. Of this decrease, $121 million related to lower recovery of purchased fuel and power costs mostly related to ES customer migration to third party electric suppliers, $19 million in lower transmission segment intracompany billings to the distribution segment that are eliminated in consolidation and $11 million related to lower wholesale revenues, offset by higher retail transmission revenues ($25 million) and an increase in the SCRC ($12 million). The tracking mechanisms allow for rates to be changed periodically with overcollections refunded to customers and undercollections to be recovered from customers in future periods. A $40 million increase in distribution segment revenues that impacts earnings primarily as a result of the retail rate increase effective July 1, 2010 and higher sales volume. Retail electric sales increased 1.3 percent in 2010 compared to 2009. A $9 million improvement in transmission segment revenues resulting from a higher level of investment in this segment and the return of higher overall expenses, which are tracked and result in a related increase in revenues. The increase in expenses is directly related to the increase in transmission plant, including costs associated with higher property taxes, depreciation and operation and maintenance expenses. Fuel, Purchased and Net Interchange Power Fuel, Purchased and Net Interchange Power decreased in 2010, as compared to 2009, due primarily to an increased level of ES customer migration to third party electric suppliers, partially offset by higher retail sales. Other Operating Expenses Other Operating Expenses decreased in 2010, as compared to 2009, due primarily to lower distribution segment expenses ($7 million), mainly as a result of the rate case decision changing the collection of certain expenses to be tracked through the TCAM included in Amortization of Regulatory Assets/(Liabilities), Net in 2010. Maintenance Maintenance decreased in 2010, as compared to 2009, due primarily to lower boiler equipment and maintenance costs at the generation business ($12 million) as a result of insurance proceeds received in 2010 related to turbine damage, offset by higher distribution overhead line expenses related to storms in 2010 ($8 million). Depreciation Depreciation increased in 2010, as compared to 2009, due primarily to higher utility plant balances resulting from completed construction projects placed into service related to PSNH's capital programs. 60 Amortization of Regulatory Assets/(Liabilities), Net Amortization of Regulatory Assets/(Liabilities), Net increased in 2010, as compared to 2009, due primarily to increases in ES deferral ($42 million) and TCAM ($11 million) offset by decreases in the impact of the 2010 Healthcare Act related to the deferral of lost tax benefits that we believe are probable of recovery in future electric distribution rates ($7 million) and the NWPP accrual ($5 million) . Taxes Other Than Income Taxes (Millions of Dollars) 2010 Increase/(Decrease) as compared to 2009 Property Taxes $ 3.1 Use Taxes 1.5 Other 0.2 $ 4.8 The increase in Taxes Other Than Income Taxes was due primarily to an increase in property taxes as a result of an increase in Property, Plant and Equipment related to PSNH's capital programs.

Operating Revenues PSNH's retail electric sales were as follows: For the Years Ended December 31, 2009 2008 Increase/ (Decrease) Percent Retail Electric Sales in GWh 7,750 7,926 (176) (2.2) % Operating Revenues decreased in 2009, as compared to 2008, due to lower distribution segment revenues ($46 million), partially offset by higher transmission segment revenues ($15 million). The distribution segment revenues decreased $46 million due primarily to a decrease in the portion of distribution revenues that does not impact earnings ($57 million). These revenues do not impact earnings, primarily as a result of the inclusion of these distribution revenues in regulatory tracking mechanisms and intracompany revenues that are eliminated in consolidation. The portion of revenues that impacts earnings increased $11 million primarily as a result of higher retail rates, partially offset by lower retail sales volumes. The 2009 retail sales, as compared to the same period in 2008, decreased 8.2 percent for the industrial, 1.5 percent for the commercial, and 0.2 percent for the residential classes. Total retail sales decreased overall by 2.2 percent. The $57 million decrease in the portion of distribution segment revenues that does not impact earnings was due primarily to a decrease in the portions of retail revenues that are included in NHPUC approved tracking mechanisms that track the recovery of certain incurred costs through PSNH's tariffs ($47 million) and transmission segment intracompany billings to the distribution segment that are eliminated in consolidation ($9 million). The distribution segment revenues included in NHPUC approved tracking mechanisms decreased $47 million due primarily to lower purchased fuel and power costs ($99 million), partially offset by an increase in the SCRC ($27 million), higher retail transmission revenues ($14 million), higher wholesale revenue ($8 million), and higher NWPP renewable energy certificate revenues ($4 million). The tracking mechanisms allow for rates to be changed periodically with overcollections refunded to customers o r undercollections recovered from customers in future periods. Transmission segment revenues increased $15 million due primarily to a higher transmission investment base and higher expenses. Fuel, Purchased and Net Interchange Power Fuel, Purchased and Net Interchange Power decreased in 2009, as compared to 2008, due primarily to an increased level of migration of ES customers to competitive supply and lower retail sales, partially offset by higher forward energy market prices. Other Operating Expenses Other Operating Expenses increased in 2009, as compared to 2008, as a result of higher distribution segment expenses ($15 million), mainly as a result of higher administrative and general expenses, including higher pension and medical costs, and higher expenses related to uncollectible receivable balances, and higher retail transmission expenses that are recovered through distribution tracking mechanisms and have no earnings impact ($10 million). Maintenance Maintenance decreased in 2009, as compared to 2008, due primarily to lower repair and maintenance of distribution lines ($7 million), including lower storm costs, lower generation expenses primarily as a result of lower maintenance outage expenses at Merrimack Station ($2 million) and hydro expenses incurred in 2008 primarily as a result of two major dam resurfacing projects ($1 million), partially offset by higher vegetation management expenses ($5 million). 62 Depreciation Depreciation increased in 2009, as compared to 2008, due primarily to higher utility plant balances resulting from completed construction projects placed into service in the distribution segment ($3 million) and the transmission segment ($2 million). Amortization of Regulatory Assets/(Liabilities), Net Amortization of Regulatory Assets/(Liabilities), Net decreased in 2009, as compared to 2008, due primarily to a decrease in net deferrals associated with the ES and TCAM tracking mechanisms, partially offset by an increase in net deferrals associated with the SCRC tracking mechanism. Taxes Other Than Income Taxes Taxes Other Than Income Taxes increased in 2009, as compared to 2008, due primarily to higher property taxes as a result of higher net plant balances and increased local municipal tax rates ($7 million), partially offset by lower sales taxes as a result of the resolution of various routine tax issues ($1 million). Interest Expense For the Years Ended December 31, (Millions of Dollars) 2009 2008 Increase/ (Decrease) Percent Interest on Long-Term Debt $ 33.0 $ 32.7 $ 0.3 0.9 % Interest on RRBs 13.1 16.0 (2.9) (18.1) Other Interest 0.4 1.5 (1.1) (73.3) $ 46.5 $ 50.2 $ (3.7) (7.4) % Interest Expense decreased in 2009, as compared to 2008, due primarily to lower Interest on RRBs resulting from lower principal balances outstanding and lower Other Interest mostly related to the resolution of various routine tax issues. Other Income, Net For the Years Ended December 31, (Millions of Dollars) 2009 2008 Increase/ (Decrease) Percent Other Income, Net $ 9.5 $ 7.3 $ 2.2 30.1 % Other Income, Net increased in 2009, as compared to 2008, due primarily to higher investment income related to improved results from the NU supplemental benefit trust and the absence of other-than-temporary impairments recorded in 2008, and higher interest income related to the return on the December 2008 ice storm, partially offset by the absence in 2009 of interest income related to a federal tax settlement in 2008 and lower AFUDC equity income due to higher short-term debt, which resulted in a lower rate based on borrowing costs. Income Tax Expense For the Years Ended December 31, (Millions of Dollars) 2009 2008 Increase/ (Decrease) Percent Income Tax Expense $ 32.0 $ 22.0 $ 10.0 45.5 % Income tax expense increased in 2009, as compared to 2008, due primarily to higher pre-tax earnings ($6 million) and less favorable depreciation deduction adjustments ($2 million). LIQUIDITY PSNH had cash flows provided by operating activities in 2010 of $145.4 million, compared with operating cash flows of $58.2 million in 2009 and $116.4 million in 2008, all amounts are net of RRB payments included in financing activities on the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows. The improved cash flows were due primarily to the absence in 2010 of costs related to the major storm in December 2008 that were paid in the first quarter of 2009, a decrease in Fuel, Materials and Supplies attributable to a $31.8 million reduction in coal inventory levels in 2010 at the generation business as ordered by the NHPUC, and increases in amortization on regulatory deferrals primarily attributable to 2009 activity within PSNH ES tracking mechanism where such costs exceeded revenues resulting in an unfavorable cash flow impact in 2009. Offsetting these favorable cash flow impacts was a $45 million contribution made in t he third quarter of 2010 into the NU Pension Plan and payments made relating to the February 2010 severe storm for which the costs were deferred. PSNH expects to develop a recovery plan for these 2010 storm costs, net of any insurance payments PSNH would receive, through a previously agreed upon cooperative effort between PSNH, the NHPUC Staff, and the Office of Consumer Advocate as outlined in the joint settlement agreement of PSNH's distribution rate case that was effective July 1, 2010. 63 Selected Consolidated Sales Statistics 2010 2009 2008 2007 2006 Revenues: (Thousands) Residential $ 529,992 $ 506,725 $ 472,486 $ 457,616 $ 467,517 Commercial 360,373 407,743 431,461 413,196 439,828 Industrial 90,243 112,460 169,785 156,258 166,132 Wholesale 33,003 41,193 35,935 25,030 52,255 Streetlighting and Railroads 6,669 6,331 6,515 6,018 5,729 Miscellaneous 13,159 35,139 25,020 24,954 9,439 Total $ 1,033,439 $ 1,109,591 $ 1,141,202 $ 1,083,072 $ 1,140,900 Sales: (GWh) Residential 3,175 3,097 3,105 3,176 3,087 Commercial 3,309 3,311 3,361 3,403 3,342 Industrial 1,339 1,318 1,435 1,528 1,582 Wholesale 206 562 (243) 105 985 Streetlighting and Railroads 24 24 25 24 23 Total 8,053 8,312 7,683 8,236 9,019 Customers: (Average) Residential 420,481 417,670 418,107 417,420 413,980 Commercial 71,746 70,984 70,807 70,341 69,528 Industrial 3,088 3,134 2,978 2,770 2,761 Streetlighting and Railroads 1,442 1,438 970 602 592 Total 496,757 493,226 492,862 491,133 486,861 64 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS WESTERN MASSACHUSETTS ELECTRIC COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARY The following table provides the amounts and variances in operating revenues and expense line items for the consolidated statements of income for WMECO included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008: Comparison of 2010 to 2009 : Revenues and Expenses For the Years Ended December 31, (Millions of Dollars) 2010 2009 Increase/ (Decrease) Percent Operating Revenues $ 395.2 $ 402.4 $ (7.2) (1.8) % Operating Expenses: & nbsp; Fuel, Purchased and Net Interchange Power 157.3 192.2 (34.9) (18.2) Other Operating Expenses 102.1 85.6 16.5 19.3 Maintenance 19.2 17.9 1.3 7.3 Depreciation 23.6 22.5 1.1 4.9 Amortization of Regulatory Assets/(Liabilities), Net 2.3 (3.0) 5.3 (a) Amortization of Rate Reduction Bonds 15.5 14.5 1.0 6.9 Taxes Other Than Income Taxes 16.5 14.1 2.4 17.0 Total Operating Expenses 336.5 343.8 (7.3) (2.1) Operating Income $ 58.7 $ 58.6 $ 0.1 0.2 % (a) Percent greater than 100 percent not shown as it is not meaningful. Operating Revenues WMECO's retail electric sales were as follows: For the Years Ended December 31, 2010 2009 Increase/ (Decrease) Percent Retail Electric Sales in GWh 3,732 3,644 88 2.4 % WMECO's Operating Revenues decreased in 2010, as compared to 2009, due primarily to: A $20 million decrease related to distribution revenues that did not impact earnings and was included in DPU approved tracking mechanisms that track the recovery of certain incurred costs through WMECO's tariffs. Included in these costs are a decrease of $31 million related to a lower recovery of energy supply costs and a decrease of $7 million related to transmission segment intracompany billings to the distribution segment that are eliminated in consolidation. Offsetting these decreases were increases in transition cost recoveries, C&LM collections and retail transmission revenues ($8 million, $5 million and $4 million, respectively). The tracking mechanisms allow for rates to be changed periodically with overcollections refunded to customers or undercollections to be recovered from customers in future periods. The portion of electric distribution revenues that impacts earnings increased $2 million due primarily to a 2.4 percent increase in retail electric sales in 2010, as compared to 2009. A $10 million improvement in transmission segment revenues resulting from a higher level of investment in this segment and the return of higher overall expenses, which are tracked and result in a related increase in revenues. The increase in expenses is directly related to the increase in transmission plant, including costs associated with higher property taxes, depreciation and operation and maintenance expenses. Fuel, Purchased and Net Interchange Power Fuel, Purchased and Net Interchange Power decreased in 2010, as compared to 2009, due primarily to lower Basic/Default service supply costs. The basic/default service supply costs are the contractual amounts WMECO must pay to various suppliers that serve this load after winning a competitive solicitation process. These costs decreased due primarily to lower supplier contract rates. Other Operating Expenses Other Operating Expenses increased in 2010, as compared to 2009, as a result of higher distribution segment expenses ($9 million) resulting from higher administrative and general expenses, including pension costs, higher costs that are recovered through distribution tracking mechanisms and have no earnings impact primarily related to an increase in C&LM expenses attributable to the Massachusetts Green Communities Act ($6 million), and higher transmission segment expenses ($1 million). Maintenance Maintenance increased in 2010, as compared to 2009, due primarily to higher distribution overhead line expenses. 65 Depreciation Depreciation increased in 2010, as compared to 2009, due primarily to higher utility plant balances resulting from completed construction projects placed into service related to WMECO's capital programs. Amortization of Regulatory Assets/(Liabilities), Net Amortization of Regulatory Assets/(Liabilities), Net, increased in 2010, as compared to 2009, due primarily to the recovery of the previously deferred unrecovered stranded generation costs ($11 million), offset by a deferral of lost tax benefits related to the 2010 Healthcare Act that we believe are probable of recovery in future electric distribution rates ($4 million). Taxes Other Than Income Taxes (Millions of Dollars) 2010 Increase/(Decrease) as compared to 2009 Property Taxes $ 1.5 Sales Taxes 0.6 Other 0.3 $ 2.4 The increase in Taxes Other Than Income Taxes was due primarily to an increase in property taxes as a result of an increase in Property, Plant and Equipment related to WMECO's capital programs. Interest Expense For the Years Ended December 31, (Millions of Dollars) 2010 2009 Increase/ (Decrease) Percent Interest on Long-Term Debt $ 18.0 $ 14.1 $ 3.9 27.7 % Interest on RRBs 3.4 4.3 (0.9) (20.9) Other Interest 0.4 0.9 (0.5) (55.6) $ 21.8 $ 19.3 $ 2.5 13.0 % Interest Expense increased in 2010, as compared to 2009, due primarily to higher Interest on Long-Term Debt resulting from the $95 million debt issuance in March 2010, offset by lower Interest on RRBs resulting from lower principal balances outstanding. Other Income, Net For the Years Ended December 31, (Millions of Dollars) 2010 2009 Increase/ (Decrease) Percent Other Income, Net $ 2.6 $ 1.8 $ 0.8 44.4 % Other Income, Net increased in 2010, as compared to 2009, due primarily to higher AFUDC related to equity funds ($1 million) and higher interest income ($1 million), offset by lower investment income ($1 million). Income Tax Expense For the Years Ended December 31, (Millions of Dollars) 2010 2009 Increase/ (Decrease) Percent Income Tax Expense $ 16.3 $ 14.9 $ 1.4 9.4 % Income Tax Expense increased in 2010, as compared to 2009, due primarily to the impacts of the 2010 Healthcare Act ($3 million), partially offset by lower pre-tax earnings and other impacts ($2 million). 66 Comparison of 2009 to 2008 : Revenues and Expenses For the Years Ended December 31, (Millions of Dollars) 2009 2008 Increase/ (Decrease) Percent Operating Revenues $ 402.4 $ 441.5 $ (39.1) (8.9) % Operating Expenses: Fuel, Purchased and Net Interchange Power 192.2 237.4 (45.2) (19.0) Other Operating Expenses 85.6 77.0 8.6 11.2 Maintenance 17.9 20.7 (2.8) (13.5) Depreciation 22.5 21.0 1.5 7.1 Amortization of Regulatory Assets/(Liabilities), Net (3.0) 12.4 (15.4) (a) Amortization of Rate Reduction Bonds 14.5 13.6 0.9 6.6 Taxes Other Than Income Taxes 14.1 12.9 1.2 9.3 Total Operating Expenses 343.8 395.0 (51.2) (13.0) Operating Income $ 58.6 $ 46.5 $ 12.1 26.0 % (a) Percent greater than 100 percent not shown as it is not meaningful. Operating Revenues WMECO's retail electric sales were as follows: For the Years Ended December 31, 2009 2008 Increase/ (Decrease) Percent Retail Electric Sales in GWh 3,644 3,829 (185) (4.8) % Operating Revenues decreased in 2009, as compared to 2008, due to lower distribution segment revenues ($47 million), partially offset by higher transmission segment revenues ($8 million). The distribution segment revenues decreased $47 million due primarily to a decrease in the portion of distribution revenues that does not impact earnings ($49 million). These revenues do not impact earnings, primarily as a result of the inclusion of these distribution revenues in regulatory tracking mechanisms and intracompany revenues that are eliminated in consolidation. The portion of revenues that impacts earnings increased $1 million. The $49 million distribution segment revenues decrease that does not impact earnings was due primarily to a decrease in the portions of retail revenues that are included in DPU approved tracking mechanisms that track the recovery of certain incurred costs through WMECO's tariffs ($44 million) and transmission segment intracompany billings to the distribution segment that are eliminated in consolidation ($5 million). The distribution revenues included in DPU approved tracking mechanisms decreased $44 million due primarily to lower energy supply costs ($48 million), lower transition cost recoveries ($10 million), and lower wholesale revenues ($5 million), partially offset by higher retail transmission revenues ($15 million). The tracking mechanisms allow for rates to be changed periodically with overcollections refunded to customers or undercollections recovered from customers in future periods. The 2009 retail sales, as compared to the same period in 2008, decreased 11.7 percent for the industrial, 4.8 percent for the commercial, and 1.6 percent for the residential classes. Total retail sales decreased overall by 4.8 percent. Transmission segment revenues increased $8 million due primarily to a higher transmission investment base and higher expenses. Fuel, Purchased and Net Interchange Power Fuel, Purchased and Net Interchange Power decreased in 2009, as compared to 2008, due primarily to lower Basic/Default Service supply costs ($47 million) and lower other purchased power costs ($2 million), partially offset by higher deferral of excess Basic/Default Service revenue over Basic/Default Service expense ($4 million). The Basic/Default Service supply costs are the contractual amounts WMECO must pay to various suppliers that serve this load after winning a competitive solicitation process. These costs decreased as a result of lower supplier contract rates and reduced load volumes. To the extent that these costs do not match the revenues collected from customers, the DPU allows the difference to be deferred for future collection or refund. Lower other purchased power costs are due primarily to a decrease in costs associated with customer generation and IPPs. Other Operating Expenses Other Operating Expenses increased in 2009, as compared to 2008, as a result of higher retail transmission and other costs that are recovered through distribution tracking mechanisms and have no earnings impact ($11 million), partially offset by lower distribution segment expenses ($2 million) mainly as a result of lower administrative and general expenses. Maintenance Maintenance decreased in 2009, as compared to 2008, due primarily to lower repair and maintenance of distribution lines including lower storm expenses and lower vegetation management expense. 67 Amortization of Regulatory Assets/(Liabilities), Net Amortization of Regulatory Assets/(Liabilities), Net decreased in 2009, as compared to 2008, due primarily to the deferral of allowed transition costs that are in excess of transition revenues, resulting from a decrease in the transition cost portion of the rate and lower IPP revenue than previous years. Taxes Other Than Income Taxes Taxes Other Than Income Taxes increased in 2009, as compared to 2008, due primarily to higher property taxes as a result of higher plant balances and increased municipal tax rates. Income Tax Expense For the Years Ended December 31, (Millions of Dollars) 2009 2008 Increase/ (Decrease) Percent Income Tax Expense $ 14.9 $ 10.5 $ 4.4 41.9 % Income tax expense increased due primarily to higher pre-tax earnings. LIQUIDITY WMECO had cash flows provided by operating activities in 2010 of $50.5 million, compared with operating cash flows of $47.7 million in 2009 and $53.9 million in 2008, all amounts are net of RRB payments included in financing activities on the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows. The increase in cash flows was primarily due to the absence in 2010 of costs related to the major storm in December 2008 that were paid in the first quarter of 2009. These costs, as well as storm costs in 2010, were deferred and in accordance with WMECO February 1, 2011 distribution rate case decision will be recovered from customers over five years as part of WMECO's storm reserve. The deferral of the 2010 significant storms cost created an unfavorable cash flow impact to WMECO's regulatory underrecoveries of approximately $6.1 million. Offsetting the improved cash flows was an increase in income tax payments of $14.1 million, which was the result of bonus depreciation tax deduction benefits received throughout 2009 not being extended for the full year of 2010 until the fourth quarter of 2010. 68 Selected Consolidated Sales Statistics 2010 2009 2008 2007 2006 Revenues: (Thousands) Residential $ 208,332 $ 221,803 $ 241,303 $ 246,526 $ 232,197 Commercial 121,597 119,457 133,686 140,531 132,336 Industrial 33,892 33,555 39,245 48,036 43,131 Other Utilities 31,812 18,034 24,349 20,131 17,421 Streetlighting and Railroads 3,633 4,066 3,297 4,492 5,025 Miscellaneous (4,105) 5,498 (353) 5,029 1,399 Total $ 395,161 $ 402,413 $ 441,527 $ 464,745 $ 431,509 Sales: (GWh) Residential 1,542 1,467 1,491 1,539 1,511 Commercial 1,496 1,474 1,547 1,589 1,574 Industrial 675 679 769 842 862 Other Utilities 177 187 179 178 189 Streetlighting and Railroads 20 24 22 25 25 Total 3,910 3,831 4,008 4,173 4,161 Customers: (Average) Residential 187,140 185,856 187,109 187,854 187,252 Commercial 17,475 16,587 16,916 17,096 17,310 Industrial 703 692 751 777 798 Streetlighting and Railroads 516 835 785 703 705 Total 205,834 203,970 205,561 206,430 206,065 69
