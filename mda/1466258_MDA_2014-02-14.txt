Item 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause a difference include, but are not limited to, those discussed under Item 1A. Risk Factors in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following section is qualified in its entirety by the more detailed information, including our financial statements and the notes thereto, which appears elsewhere in this Annual Report. Overview Organization We are a diversified, global company that provides products, services and solutions to enhance the quality and comfort of air in homes and buildings, transport and protect food and perishables and increase industrial productivity and efficiency. Our business segments consist of Climate and Industrial, both with strong brands and leading positions within their respective markets. We generate revenue and cash primarily through the design, manufacture, sale and service of a diverse portfolio of industrial and commercial products that include well-recognized, premium brand names such as Trane , Ingersoll-Rand , Thermo King , American Standard and Club Car . To achieve our mission of being a world leader in creating comfortable and efficient environments, we continue to focus on increasing our recurring revenue stream from parts, service, used equipment and rentals; and to continuously improve the efficiencies and capabilities of the products and services of our high-potential businesses. We also continue to focus on operational excellence strategies as a central theme to improving our earnings and cash flows. Trends and Economic Events We are a global corporation with worldwide operations. As a global business, our operations are affected by worldwide, regional and industry-specific economic factors, as well as political factors, wherever we operate or do business. Our geographic and industry diversity, as well as the diversity of our product sales and services, has helped mitigate the impact of any one industry or the economy of any single country on our consolidated operating results. Given the broad range of products manufactured and geographic markets served, management uses a variety of factors to predict the outlook for the Company. We monitor key competitors and customers in order to gauge relative performance and the outlook for the future. In addition, our order rates are indicative of future revenue and thus a key measure of anticipated performance. In those industry segments where we are a capital equipment provider, revenues depend on the capital expenditure budgets and spending patterns of our customers, who may delay or accelerate purchases in reaction to changes in their businesses and in the economy. Current market conditions, including challenges in international markets, continue to impact our financial results. Uneven global commercial new construction activity is negatively impacting the results of our commercial Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) business. However, we believe the commercial HVAC equipment replacement and aftermarket is slowly recovering. We have seen slower worldwide industrial equipment and aftermarket activity. While U.S. residential and consumer markets continue to be a challenge, we continue to see improvements in the U.S. new builder and replacement markets. The residential HVAC business also continues to be impacted by a mix shift to units with a lower Seasonal Energy Efficiency Rating (SEER). As economic conditions stabilize, we expect slight revenue growth along with benefits from restructuring and productivity programs. Despite the current market environment, we believe we have a solid foundation of global brands and leading market shares in all of our major product lines. Our growing geographic and industry diversity coupled with our large installed product base provides growth opportunities within our service, parts and replacement revenue streams. In addition, we are investing substantial resources to innovate and develop new products and services which we expect will drive our future growth. 21 Table of Contents Significant events in 2013 Allegion Spin-Off On December 1, 2013 (the Distribution Date), we completed the spin-off of our commercial and residential security businesses to our shareholders (the spin-off). On the Distribution Date, each of our shareholders of record as of the close of business on November 22, 2013 (the Record Date) received one ordinary share of Allegion, plc (Allegion) for every three Ingersoll-Rand plc ordinary shares held as of the Record Date. Allegion is now an independent public company trading under the symbol ALLE on the New York Stock Exchange. After the Distribution Date, we do not beneficially own any Allegion ordinary shares (other than approximately 7,045 shares received in a deferred compensation trust upon the spin-off as a result of the trust holding ordinary shares of Ingersoll-Rand plc as of the Record Date), and will no longer consolidate Allegion into our financial results. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2013, Allegion's historical financial results for periods prior to the Distribution Date will be reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements as a discontinued operation. See Discontinued Operations and Divestitures within Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and also Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of our discontinued operations. Senior Notes due 2019, 2023, and 2043 In June 2013, we issued $1.55 billion principal amount of Senior Notes in three tranches through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Ingersoll-Rand Global Holding Company Limited (IR-Global) pursuant to Rule 144A of the U.S. Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act). The tranches consist of $350 million of 2.875% Senior Notes due in 2019, $700 million of 4.250% Senior Notes due in 2023, and $500 million of 5.750% Senior Notes due in 2043. The notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by each of IR-Ireland, Ingersoll-Rand Company Limited (IR-Limited), and Ingersoll-Rand International Holding Limited (IR-International). Interest on the notes will be paid twice a year in arrears. The Company has the option to redeem the notes in whole or in part at any time, and from time to time, prior to their stated maturity date at redemption prices set forth in the indenture agreement. The notes are subject to certain customary covenants, however, none of these covenants are considered restrictive to the Company operations. In connection with the issuance of each series of notes, IR-Global, the Guarantors and the initial purchasers of the notes entered into a Registration Rights Agreement. Each Registration Rights Agreement requires IR-Global and the Guarantors to use their commercially reasonable efforts to execute an effective exchange offer registration statement with the SEC no later than 365 days after the closing date of the notes offering and to complete an exchange offer within 30 business days of such effective date. If a registration default occurs additional interest shall accrue on the notes. The proceeds from these notes were used to fund the July 2013 redemption of $600 million of 6.000% Senior Notes due 2013 and $655 million of 9.500% Senior Notes due 2014 and to fund expenses related to the spin-off of the commercial and residential security businesses, with any remaining proceeds to be used for general corporate purposes. Related to this redemption, the Company recorded $45.6 million of premium expense in the third quarter of 2013 in Interest expense. IRS Exam Results In 2007, we received a notice from the IRS containing proposed adjustments to our tax filings in connection with an audit of the 2001 and 2002 tax years. The IRS did not contest the validity of our reincorporation in Bermuda. The IRS proposed to ignore the entities that hold the intercompany debt incurred in connection with our reincorporation in Bermuda (the 2001 Debt ) and to which the interest was paid and impose 30% withholding tax on a portion of the interest payments as if they were made directly to a company that was not eligible for reduced U.S. withholding tax under a U.S. income tax treaty. The IRS asserted that we owe additional taxes with respect to 2002 of approximately $84 million plus interest. We strongly disagreed with the view of the IRS and filed a protest. In 2010, we received an amended notice from the IRS assessing penalties of 30% on the asserted underpayment of tax described above. We have so far been unsuccessful in resolving this dispute and recently received a Notice of Deficiency from the IRS for 2002. The Company filed a petition in the United States Tax Court in November 2013 contesting this deficiency. In its January 2014 answer to our petition, the IRS asserted that we also owe 30% withholding tax on the portion of 2002 interest payments made on the 2001 Debt upon which it did not previously assert withholding tax. A 30% withholding tax on this $85.0 million interest payment would increase the total tax liability proposed for 2002 to $109.0 million ( $84 million referred to in the paragraph above plus this additional $25.0 million ) plus 30% penalties and interest. Recently we received notices from the IRS containing proposed adjustments to the Company's tax filings in connection with an audit of the 2003-2006 tax years. In these notices, the IRS asserts that we owe a total of approximately $665.0 million of additional taxes, as described more fully below, in connection with our interest payments on the 2001 Debt for the 2003-2006 period, plus penalties and interest on these unpaid taxes. The IRS continues to take the position on the 2001 Debt, which was retired at the end of 2011, that it previously took for our 2002 tax year and which is described above. As a result of this recharacterization, the IRS asserts that we owe approximately $455.0 million of withholding tax for 2003-2006 plus 30% penalties. 22 Table of Contents The IRS also proposes to extend its position further and to treat all of the interest income from the 2001 Debt as creating earnings and profits at IR-Limited and, as a result, recharacterize the distributions made by IR-Limited during the 2002-2006 tax years as taxable dividends instead of as a return of capital. Consequently the IRS asserts that we owe approximately $210.0 million of income tax on these dividends plus penalties of 20% . Although we expect it to do so, the IRS has not yet proposed any similar adjustments for years subsequent to 2006, as the federal income tax audits for those years are still in process or have not yet begun. In addition, we do not know how the IRS will apply its position to the different facts presented in those years or whether the IRS will take a similar position in future audits with respect to intercompany debt instruments not outstanding in prior years. We have vigorously contested all of these proposed adjustments and intend to continue to do so. Although the outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, based upon an analysis of the merits of our position we believe that we are adequately reserved under the applicable accounting standards for these matters and do not expect that the ultimate resolution will have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows. As we move forward to resolve these matters with the IRS, the reserves established may be adjusted. Although we continue to contest the IRS's position, there can be no assurance that we will be successful. If the IRS's position with respect to the 2002-2006 tax years is ultimately sustained we would be required to record additional charges and the resulting liability will have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 2014 Dividend Increase and Share Repurchase Program In February 2014, we announced an increase in our quarterly share dividend from $0.21 to $0.25 per share beginning with our March 2014 payment. The dividend is payable March 31, 2014 to shareholders of record on March 14, 2014. In February 2014, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1.5 billion of our ordinary shares under a new share repurchase program upon completion of the current share repurchase program. The new share repurchase program is expected to begin in the second quarter of 2014. Share repurchases will be made from time to time at the discretion of management subject to market conditions, regulatory requirements and other considerations. 2013 Share Repurchase Program In December 2012, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $ 2.0 billion of our ordinary shares under a share repurchase program. The share repurchase program began in April 2013. During 2013 we repurchased 20.8 million shares for $ 1.2 billion , excluding commissions. These repurchases were accounted for as a reduction of Ordinary shares and Capital in excess of par value as they were canceled upon repurchase. 2011 Share Repurchase Program Our 2011 share repurchase program was authorized by our Board of Directors in April 2011 and was completed in April 2013. During the year ended December 31, 2012 , we repurchased 18.4 million shares for approximately $ 0.8 billion , excluding commissions. Significant events in 2012 2012 Dividend Increase In December 2012, we announced an increase in our quarterly share dividend from $ 0.16 to $ 0.21 per share beginning with our March 2013 payment. Pension and Other Postretirement Plan Amendments On June 8, 2012, our Board of Directors approved amendments to our retirement plans for certain U.S. and Puerto Rico non-bargained employees. Eligible non-bargained employees hired prior to July 1, 2012 were given a choice of remaining in their respective defined benefit plan until the plan freezes on December 31, 2022 or freezing their accrued benefits in their respective defined benefit plan as of December 31, 2012 and receiving an additional 2% non-matching Company contribution into the Company's applicable defined contribution plan. Eligible employees hired or rehired on or after July 1, 2012 will automatically receive the 2% non-matching Company contribution into the applicable defined contribution plan in lieu of participating in the defined benefit plan. Beginning January 1, 2023, all eligible employees will receive the 2% non-matching contribution into the applicable defined contribution plan. On February 1, 2012, our Board of Directors approved amendments to our postretirement medical plan with respect to post-65 retiree medical coverage. Effective January 1, 2013, we discontinued offering company-sponsored retiree medical coverage for certain individuals age 65 and older. We transitioned affected individuals to coverage through the individual Medicare market and will provide a tax-advantaged subsidy to those retirees eligible for subsidized company coverage that can be used toward reimbursing premiums and other qualified medical expenses for individual Medicare supplemental coverage that is purchased through our third-party Medicare coordinator. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of these amendments. 23 Table of Contents Significant events in 2011 Dividend Increase In April 2011, we increased our quarterly stock dividend from $ 0.07 to $ 0.12 per share beginning with our June 2011 payment. In December 2011, we announced an increase in our quarterly stock dividend from $ 0.12 per share to $ 0.16 per share beginning with our March 2012 payment. Divested Operations On September 30, 2011 and November 30, 2011, we completed transactions to sell our Hussmann refrigerated display case business to a newly-formed affiliate (Hussmann Parent) of private equity firm Clayton Dubilier & Rice, LLC (CD&R). These transactions included the equipment business and certain of the service branches in the U.S. and Canada, and the equipment, service and installation businesses in Mexico, Chile, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan (Hussmann Business) and the remaining North American Hussmann service and installation branches (Hussmann Branches). We negotiated the final terms of the transaction to include our ownership of a portion of the common stock of Hussmann Parent, which represents significant continuing involvement. Therefore, the results of Hussmann are included in continuing operations for all periods presented, with our ownership interest reported using the equity method of accounting subsequent to September 30, 2011. See Discontinued Operations and Divestitures within Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and also Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of our divested operations. 24 Table of Contents Results of Operations - For the years ended December 31 Dollar amounts in millions, except per share data 2013 % of Revenues 2012 % of Revenues 2011 % of Revenues Net revenues $ 12,350.5 $ 11,988.3 $ 12,760.8 Cost of goods sold (8,675.5 ) 70.3% (8,538.0 ) 71.2% (9,280.0 ) 72.7% Selling and administrative expenses (2,570.0 ) 20.8% (2,382.9 ) 19.9% (2,395.2 ) 18.8% Gain (loss) on sale/asset impairment % 4.5 % (646.9 ) 5.1% Operating income 1,105.0 8.9% 1,071.9 8.9% 438.7 3.4% Interest expense (278.8 ) (252.0 ) (278.5 ) Other, net 3.4 28.1 28.4 Earnings before income taxes 829.6 848.0 188.6 Provision for income taxes (189.0 ) (56.0 ) (45.4 ) Earnings from continuing operations 640.6 792.0 143.2 Discontinued operations, net of tax 13.3 252.0 226.1 Net earnings 653.9 1,044.0 369.3 Less: Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests (35.1 ) (25.4 ) (26.1 ) Net earnings attributable to Ingersoll-Rand plc $ 618.8 $ 1,018.6 $ 343.2 Diluted net earnings (loss) per ordinary share attributable to Ingersoll-Rand plc ordinary shareholders: Continuing operations $ 2.08 $ 2.49 $ 0.36 Discontinued operations (0.01 ) 0.79 0.65 Net earnings $ 2.07 $ 3.28 $ 1.01 Net Revenues Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2013 increased by 3.0% , or $ 362.2 million , compared with the same period of 2012 , which primarily resulted from the following: Volume/product mix 2.3 % Pricing 0.7 % Total 3.0 % The increase in revenues was primarily driven by volume improvements within the Climate segment and improved pricing for both Climate and Industrial. Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2012 decreased by 6.1% , or $ 772.5 million , compared with the same period of 2011 , which primarily resulted from the following: Pricing 1.4 % Volume/product mix 0.4 % Currency exchange rates (1.5 )% Hussmann (6.4 )% Total (6.1 )% The decrease in revenues was primarily driven by the absence of Hussmann for the year ended December 31, 2012, which contributed $ 818.5 million of revenue in the same period in 2011. This decrease was partially offset by improved pricing within both of our segments and higher volumes within the Industrial business segment. Operating Income/Margin Operating margin remained flat at 8.9% for the year ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 . During 2013 we experienced improved pricing in excess of material inflation (0.5%) and productivity benefits in excess of other inflation (0.4%), offset by increased 25 Table of Contents investment and restructuring spending (0.9%). During 2013 and 2012 , the Company incurred costs of $82.3 million and $23.3 million , respectively, associated with ongoing restructuring actions. These actions included workforce reductions as well as the closure and consolidation of manufacturing facilities in an effort to improve the Company's cost structure. Operating margin improved to 8.9% for the year ended December 31, 2012 , compared to 3.4% for the same period of 2011 . The improvement was primarily due to Operating income in 2011 including a $646.9 million loss on sale/asset impairment charge related to the divestiture of Hussmann (5.1%), improved pricing in excess of material inflation across (1.3%), and the realization of productivity benefits in excess of other inflation (0.9%). These improvements were partially offset by increased investment and restructuring spending (1.3%) and unfavorable product mix and volume (0.9%). Interest Expense Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2013 increased by $ 26.8 million compared with the same period of 2012 , primarily as a result of the redemption premium expense incurred during the July 2013 debt redemption discussed in Liquidity and Capital Resources. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2012 decreased $ 26.5 million compared with the same period of 2011 as a result of lower average debt balances in 2012 . Other, Net The components of Other, net, for the year ended December 31 are as follows: In millions 2013 2012 2011 Interest income $ 12.8 $ 16.3 $ 25.5 Exchange gain (loss) (14.0 ) 0.2 (1.3 ) Earnings (loss) from equity investments (2.6 ) (5.9 ) (3.5 ) Other 7.2 17.5 7.7 Other, net $ 3.4 $ 28.1 $ 28.4 Exchange gain (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2013 includes a loss of approximately $3.8 million related to the devaluation of the Venezuela Bolivar. Included within Earnings (loss) from equity investments for the years ended December 31, 2013 , 2012 and 2011 is $ 2.6 million , $ 5.9 million and $ 3.5 million of equity loss, respectively, on the Hussmann equity investment incurred subsequent to the Hussmann divestiture transaction dates. The activity included within Other for the year ended December 31, 2012 is primarily related to adjustments to actual and expected insurance recoveries as a result of a settlement. Provision for Income Taxes The 2013 effective tax rate was 22.8%. The 2013 effective tax rate is lower than the U.S. Statutory rate of 35% primarily due to earnings in non-U.S. jurisdictions, which in aggregate, have a lower effective rate and a $36 million net reduction in our liability for unrecognized tax benefits primarily due to the settlement of an audit in a major tax jurisdiction, partially offset by a tax charge of $51 million as a result of a change in assertion in certain subsidiary earnings that the company has previously determined to be permanently reinvested and approximately $74 million of Allegion spin-off tax charges, primarily related to a net increase in our valuation allowances on certain deferred tax assets. Revenues from non-U.S. jurisdictions account for approximately 41% of our total revenues, such that a material portion of our pretax income is earned and taxed outside the U.S. at rates ranging from 0% to 38%. When comparing the results of multiple reporting periods, among other factors, the mix of earnings between U.S. and foreign jurisdictions can cause variability on our overall effective tax rate. The 2012 effective tax rate was 6.6%, which included a tax benefit of approximately $140.0 million resulting from a reduction in valuation allowances on certain Non-U.S. deferred tax assets. The 2012 effective tax rate is lower than the U.S. Statutory rate of 35.0% primarily due to earnings in non-U.S. jurisdictions, which in aggregate, have a lower effective rate and a reduction in valuation allowances mentioned above, partially offset by a net increase in our liability for unrecognized tax benefits. For a further discussion of tax matters, see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Review of Business Segments The segment discussions that follow describe the significant factors contributing to the changes in results for each segment included in continuing operations. In the fourth quarter of 2013, the Company realigned its organizational structure to provide a greater focus on growth, continue implementation of business operating systems, build on our successful operational excellence philosophy and reduce complexity and costs. The Company new reporting structure includes the Climate and Industrial segments. 26 Table of Contents Segment operating income is the measure of profit and loss that our chief operating decision maker uses to evaluate the financial performance of the business and as the basis for performance reviews, compensation and resource allocation. For these reasons, we believe that Segment operating income represents the most relevant measure of segment profit and loss. We may exclude certain charges or gains from Operating income to arrive at a Segment operating income that is a more meaningful measure of profit and loss upon which to base our operating decisions. We define Segment operating margin as Segment operating income as a percentage of Net revenues. Climate Our Climate segment delivers energy-efficient solutions globally and includes Trane and American Standard Heating & Air Conditioning which provide heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems, and commercial and residential building services, parts, support and controls; and Thermo King transport temperature control solutions. On September 30, 2011 and November 30, 2011, we completed transactions to sell Hussmann to a newly-formed affiliate (Hussmann Parent) of private equity firm Clayton Dubilier & Rice, LLC (CD&R). As part of the deal terms we have an ongoing equity interest in Hussmann Parent, therefore operating results continue to be recorded within continuing operations. However, subsequent to the respective transaction dates our earnings from this equity interest are not reported in Segment operating income. During the year ended December 31, 2011, we recorded a pre-tax loss on sale and asset impairment charges related to the Hussmann divestiture totaling $ 646.9 million . These charges, as well as related adjustments recorded in 2012, have been excluded from Segment operating income within the Climate segment as management excludes these charges from Operating income when making operating decisions about the business. See Discontinued Operations and Divestitures within Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and also Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of our divested operations. 2011 Net revenues and Segment operating income for the Climate segment includes the operating results of the Hussmann Business and Branches prior to the sale. The operating results for the Hussmann Business and Branches are included in Net revenues and Segment operating income for the Climate segment for the year ended December 31, 2011 as follows: In millions 2011 Net revenues $ 818.5 Segment operating income $ 58.6 Segment results for the years ended December 31 were as follows: Dollar amounts in millions 2013 % change 2012 % change 2011 Net revenues $ 9,414.0 4.1% $ 9,042.5 8.7% $ 9,907.9 Segment operating income 930.2 13.8% 817.6 2.3% 837.1 Segment operating margin 9.9 % 9.0 % 8.4 % 2013 vs 2012 Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2013 increased by 4.1% or $ 371.5 million , compared with the same period of 2012 , which primarily resulted from the following: Volume/product mix 3.5 % Pricing 0.8 % Currency exchange rates (0.2 )% Total 4.1 % Our Trane commercial HVAC business continues to be impacted by weakness in the worldwide commercial building markets. Trane commercial HVAC revenues increased due to improvements in both equipment and parts, services and solutions markets. Trane residential HVAC revenues increased due to increased volume in all equipment categories. These improvements were slightly offset by a continued mix shift to lower SEER units. Net revenues in our transport businesses increased driven by improvements in the Americas and Europe. Segment operating margin improved to 9.9% for the year ended December 31, 2013 , compared to 9.0% for the same period of 2012 . The improvement was primarily driven by productivity benefits in excess of other inflation (0.8%), pricing improvements in excess of material inflation (0.6%) and favorable volume/product mix (0.2%). These improvements were partially offset by increased investment and restructure spending (0.7). 27 Table of Contents 2012 vs 2011 Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2012 decreased by 8.7% or $ 865.4 million , compared with the same period of 2011 , which primarily resulted from the following: Pricing 1.3 % Volume/product mix (0.5 )% Currency exchange rates (1.2 )% Hussmann (8.3 )% Total (8.7 )% Our Trane commercial HVAC business was impacted by weakness in the worldwide commercial building markets. Trane commercial HVAC revenues increased as growth within our parts, services and solutions markets offset declines in equipment and systems in Europe and Asia. Trane residential HVAC revenues increased due to improved activity levels in both the new residential construction and replacement markets. These improvements were slightly offset by a continued mix shift to lower SEER units. Net revenues in our transport businesses decreased driven by declines in sea-going container revenues. Growth in the Americas was more than offset by declines in Europe. Segment operating margin improved to 9.0% for the year ended December 31, 2012 , compared to 8.4% for the same period of 2011 . The improvements due to pricing improvements in excess of material inflation (1.3%) and productivity benefits in excess of other inflation (0.8%), were partially offset by unfavorable volume/product mix (0.9%), increased investment and restructure spending (0.5%), and unfavorable currency impacts (0.2%). Industrial Our Industrial segment delivers products and services that enhance energy efficiency, productivity and operations. It includes Ingersoll Rand compressed air systems and services, power tools, material handling systems, ARO fluid management equipment, as well as Club Car golf, utility and rough terrain vehicles. Segment results for the years ended December 31 were as follows: Dollar amounts in millions 2013 % change 2012 % change 2011 Net revenues $ 2,936.5 (0.3 )% $ 2,945.8 3.3 % $ 2,852.9 Segment operating income 456.0 % 455.8 9.7 % 415.5 Segment operating margin 15.5 % 15.5 % 14.6 % 2013 vs 2012 Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2013 decreased by 0.3% or $ 9.3 million , compared with the same period of 2012 , which primarily resulted from the following: Pricing 0.6 % Currency exchange rates 0.3 % Volume/product mix (1.2 )% Total (0.3 )% Air and Productivity revenues decreased due to declines in equipment sales, partially offset by growth in parts, service and solutions. Club Car revenues increased due to growth in both the golf car and utility vehicle markets. Segment operating margin remained flat at 15.5% for the year end December 31, 2013 .and 2012. Productivity benefits in excess of other inflation (1.1%) were offset by increased investment and restructuring spending ($0.7%) and unfavorable volume/product mix (0.4%). 2012 vs 2011 Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2012 increased by 3.3% , or $ 92.9 million , compared with the same period of 2011 , which primarily resulted from the following: Volume/product mix 3.9 % Pricing 1.7 % Currency exchange rates (2.3 )% Total 3.3 % 28 Table of Contents We experienced growth within our Air and Productivity business related to increased volume in the Americas. The growth in the Americas was primarily driven by improved air compressors sales. Club Car revenues increased due to improved pricing and growth in the golf car and utility vehicle markets. Segment operating margin improved to 15.5% for the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to 14.6% , for the same period of 2011 . The improvement was primarily driven by productivity benefits in excess of other inflation (2.1%), pricing improvements in excess of material inflation (0.8%). These improvements were partially offset by increased investment and restructuring spending (1.9%) and unfavorable currency impacts (0.2%). Discontinued Operations and Divestitures Discontinued Operations The components of discontinued operations for the years ended December 31 are as follows: In millions 2013 2012 2011 Net revenues $ 1,889.9 $ 2,046.6 $ 2,093.4 Pre-tax earnings (loss) from operations 84.7 379.5 355.7 Pre-tax gain (loss) on sale 2.3 (57.7 ) Tax benefit (expense) (71.4 ) (129.8 ) (71.9 ) Discontinued operations, net of tax $ 13.3 $ 252.0 $ 226.1 Discontinued operations by business for the years ended December 31 are as follows: In millions 2013 2012 2011 Allegion spin-off, net of tax $ 12.4 $ 254.2 $ 275.7 Other discontinued operations, net of tax 0.9 (2.2 ) (49.6 ) Discontinued operations, net of tax $ 13.3 $ 252.0 $ 226.1 Allegion Spin-Off On December 1, 2013, (the Distribution Date) we completed the spin-off of our commercial and residential security businesses, now under the name of Allegion, plc (Allegion), to our shareholders (the spin-off). On the Distribution Date, each of our shareholders of record as of the close of business on November 22, 2013 (the Record Date) received one ordinary share of Allegion for every three Ingersoll-Rand plc ordinary shares held as of the Record Date. Allegion is now an independent public company trading under the symbol ALLE on the New York Stock Exchange. Net revenues and after-tax earnings of Allegion for the year ended December 31 were as follows: In millions 2013 2012 2011 Net revenues $ 1,889.9 $ 2,046.6 $ 2,021.2 After-tax earnings (loss) from operations $ 12.4 $ 254.2 $ 275.7 * Included in After-tax earnings (loss) from operations for the year ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 are spin costs of $128.0 million and $5.7 million , respectively, and tax charges related to enacting the spin-off. Also, the 2013 results include a 111.4 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge. For a further discussion, see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 29 Table of Contents The components of Allegion assets and liabilities recorded as held for spin-off on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2012 are as follows: In millions December 31, 2012 Assets Current assets $ 726.1 Property, plant and equipment, net 226.5 Goodwill 646.3 Intangible assets, net 150.5 Other assets and deferred income taxes 68.0 Assets held for spin-off 1,817.4 Liabilities Current liabilities $ 362.9 Noncurrent liabilities 168.9 Liabilities held for spin-off $ 531.8 In November 2013, prior to the spin-off, the commercial and residential security businesses borrowed $1,274.2 million . The proceeds of the borrowing remained with the Company. On December 1, 2013 we made a distribution of $(0.5) million to the Company's shareholders in connection with the spin-off of Allegion. The distribution included $1,953.7 million of assets, $1,974.2 million of liabilities, $61.1 million of accumulated other comprehensive loss and $41.1 million of noncontrolling interest. Other Discontinued Operations The components of other discontinued operations for the years ended December 31 were as follows: In millions 2013 2012 2011 Retained costs, net of tax $ 0.9 $ (16.2 ) $ (34.8 ) Net gain (loss) on disposals, net of tax 14.0 (14.8 ) Discontinued operations, net of tax $ 0.9 $ (2.2 ) $ (49.6 ) On November 30, 2007, we completed the sale of our Bobcat, Utility Equipment and Attachments businesses (collectively, Compact Equipment) to Doosan Infracore for gross proceeds of approximately $ 4.9 billion , subject to post-closing purchase price adjustments. Compact Equipment manufactured and sold compact equipment, including skid-steer loaders, compact track loaders, mini-excavators and telescopic tool handlers; portable air compressors, generators and light towers; general-purpose light construction equipment; and attachments. We were in dispute regarding post-closing matters with Doosan Infracore. During the second quarter of 2011, we collected approximately $ 48.3 million of our outstanding receivable from Doosan Infracore related to certain purchase price adjustments. During the second quarter of 2012, Doosan Infracore paid the Company a total of $ 46.5 million to settle the outstanding receivable and remaining disputed post-closing matters. Other discontinued operations, net of tax from previously sold businesses is mainly related to postretirement benefits, product liability, worker's compensation, and legal costs (mostly asbestos-related) and tax effects of post-closing purchase price adjustments. Divested Operations Hussmann Divestiture On September 30, 2011, we completed a transaction to sell our Hussmann refrigerated display case business to a newly-formed affiliate (Hussmann Parent) of private equity firm Clayton Dubilier & Rice, LLC (CD&R). This transaction included the equipment business and certain of the service branches in the U.S. and Canada, and the equipment, service and installation businesses in Mexico, Chile, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan (Hussmann Business). The final transaction allowed Hussmann Parent the option to acquire the remaining North American Hussmann service and installation branches (Hussmann Branches). Hussmann Parent completed the acquisition of the Hussmann Branches on November 30, 2011. The Hussmann Business and Branches, which are reported as part of the Climate segment, manufacture, market, distribute, install, and service refrigerated display merchandising equipment, refrigeration systems, over the counter parts, and other commercial and industrial refrigeration applications. The Hussmann Business divestiture was originally announced on April 21, 2011 and met the criteria for classification as held for sale treatment in accordance with GAAP during the first quarter of 2011. During the third quarter of 2011, we negotiated the final 30 Table of Contents transaction to sell the Hussmann Business and Branches to CD&R in exchange for $ 370 million in cash, subject to purchase price adjustments, and common stock of Hussmann Parent, such that following the sale, CD&R would own cumulative convertible participating preferred stock of Hussmann Parent, initially representing 60% of the outstanding capital stock (on an as-converted basis) of Hussmann Parent, and we would own all of the common stock, initially representing the remaining 40% of the outstanding capital stock (on an as-converted basis) of Hussmann Parent. Our ownership of common stock of Hussmann Parent represents significant continuing involvement. Therefore, the results of the Hussmann Business and Branches are included in continuing operations for all periods presented. Based on these terms, we recorded a total pre-tax loss on sale/asset impairment charge of $ 646.9 million during the full year of 2011. Results for the Hussmann Business and Branches for the year ended December 31, 2011 are as follows: In millions 2011* Net revenues $ 818.5 Gain (loss) on sale/asset impairment (646.9 ) ** Net earnings (loss) attributable to Ingersoll-Rand plc (513.1 ) Diluted earnings (loss) per share attributable to Ingersoll-Rand plc ordinary shareholders: (1.51 ) * Results represent the operating results of Hussmann Business and Branches through their respective divestiture transaction dates. ** Included in Gain (loss) on sale/asset impairment for the year ended December 31, 2011 are transaction costs of $ 12.2 million . Hussmann Parent is required to pay a quarterly preferred dividend payment to CD&R in the form of cash or additional preferred shares. Our ownership percentage as of December 31, 2013 was 37.2% . Our ownership interest in Hussmann Parent is reported using the equity method of accounting subsequent to September 30, 2011. Our equity investment in the Hussmann Parent is reported within Other noncurrent assets and the related equity earnings reported in Other, net within Net earnings. Liquidity and Capital Resources We earn a significant amount of our operating income in jurisdictions where it is deemed to be permanently reinvested. Our most promin ent jurisdiction of operation is the U.S. Other than as discussed below, we currently do not intend nor foresee a need to repatriate funds to the U.S., and no provision for U.S. income taxes has been made with respect to such earnings. We expect existing cash and cash equivalents available to the U.S., the cash generated by our U.S. operations, our committed credit lines as well as our expected ability to access the capital and debt markets will be sufficient to fund our U.S. operating and capital needs for at least the next twelve months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. In addition, we expect existing non-U.S. cash and cash equivalents and the cash generated by our non-U.S. operations will be sufficient to fund our non-U.S. operating and capital needs for at least the next twelve months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. Should we require more capital in the U.S. than is generated by our U.S. operations, and we determine that repatriation of non-U.S. cash is necessary, such amounts would be subject to U.S. federal income taxes. As a result of the Allegion spin-off and certain internal restructurings, the Company believes it is advantageous to fully repay an intercompany debt obligation between two of its subsidiaries. In order to facilitate the repayment of this intercompany debt, in the fourth quarter of 2013, the Company decided to change its permanent reinvestment assertion as it relates to approximately $740 million of earnings primarily related to subsidiaries in Hong Kong, Australia and Canada. The Company has recorded the tax effects of this change in the fourth quarter of 2013, which resulted in a charge of approximately $51 million. Except where otherwise noted, the Company continues with its permanent reinvestment assertion on its remaining unremitted earnings. For a further discussion, see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. During 2013, we repurchased 20.8 million shares for $ 1.2 billion , excluding commissions, under our current share repurchase program. These repurchases were accounted for as a reduction of Ordinary shares and Capital in excess of par value as they were canceled upon repurchase. In February 2014, we announced an increase in our quarterly share dividend from $0.21 to $0.25 per share beginning with our March 2014 payment. The dividend is payable March 31, 2014 to shareholders of record on March 14, 2014. In February 2014, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1.5 billion of our ordinary shares under a new share repurchase program upon completion of the current share repurchase program. The new share repurchase program is expected to begin in the second quarter of 2014. We expect our available cash flow, committed credit lines and access to the capital markets will be sufficient to fund the increased dividend and share repurchases. 31 Table of Contents Liquidity The following table contains several key measures to gauge our financial condition and liquidity at the periods ended December 31: In millions 2013 2012 2011 Cash and cash equivalents $ 1,937.2 $ 708.4 $ 987.0 Short-term borrowings and current maturities of long-term debt 367.7 962.9 761.9 Long-term debt 3,153.5 2,266.5 2,875.8 Total debt 3,521.2 3,229.4 3,637.7 Total Ingersoll-Rand plc shareholders equity 7,068.9 7,147.8 6,924.3 Total equity 7,131.3 7,229.3 7,012.4 Debt-to-total capital ratio 33.1 % 30.9 % 34.2 % Short-term borrowings and current maturities of long-term debt at December 31 consisted of the following: In millions 2013 2012 Debentures with put feature $ 343.0 $ 343.0 6.000% Senior notes due 2013 600.0 Other current maturities of long-term debt 8.0 10.0 Other short-term borrowings 16.7 9.9 Total $ 367.7 $ 962.9 Commercial Paper Program The maximum aggregate amount of unsecured commercial paper notes available to be issued, on a private placement basis, under the commercial paper program is $ 2 billion as of December 31, 2013 . Under the commercial paper program, Ingersoll-Rand Global Holding Company Limited (IR-Global), may issue notes from time to time, and the proceeds of the financing will be used for general corporate purposes. Each of IR-Ireland, Ingersoll-Rand Company Limited (IR-Limited), and Ingersoll-Rand International Holding Limited (IR-International) has provided an irrevocable and unconditional guarantee for the notes issued under the commercial paper program. We had no commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012 . Debentures with Put Feature At December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012 , we had outstanding $343.0 million and $ 343.0 million , respectively, of fixed rate debentures which only require early repayment at the option of the holder. These debentures contain a put feature that the holders may exercise on each anniversary of the issuance date, subject to a notice requirement. If exercised, we are obligated to repay in whole or in part, at the holder option, the outstanding principal amount (plus accrued and unpaid interest) of the debentures held by the holder. If these options are not exercised, the final maturity dates would range between 2027 and 2028 . Holders of these debentures had the option to exercise the put feature on $ 37.2 million of the outstanding debentures in February 2013, subject to the notice requirement. No exercises were made. Holders of the remaining $ 305.8 million of the outstanding debentures had the option to exercise the put feature, subject to the notice requirement, on the remaining $ 305.8 million in outstanding debentures in November 2013. No material exercises were made. Holders of these debentures had the option to exercise the put feature on $37.2 million of the outstanding debentures in February 2014, subject to the notice requirement. No notifications were received. Based on our cash flow forecast and access to the capital markets, we believe we will have sufficient liquidity to repay any amounts exercised as a result of the put features. Senior Notes due 2019, 2023, and 2043 In June 2013, we issued $1.55 billion principal amount of Senior Notes in three tranches through our wholly-owned subsidiary, IR-Global pursuant to Rule 144A of the Securities Act. The tranches consist of $350 million of 2.875% Senior Notes due in 2019, $700 million of 4.250% Senior Notes due in 2023, and $500 million of 5.750% Senior Notes due in 2043. In connection with the issuance of each series of notes, IR-Global, the Guarantors and the initial purchasers of the notes entered into a Registration Rights Agreement. Each Registration Rights Agreement requires IR-Global and the Guarantors to use their commercially reasonable efforts to execute an effective exchange offer registration statement with the SEC no later than 365 days after the closing date of the notes offering and to complete an exchange offer within 30 business days of such effective date. If a registration default occurs additional interest shall accrue on the notes. The proceeds from these notes were used to fund the July 2013 redemption of $600 million of 6.000% Senior Notes due 2013 and $655 million of 9.500% Senior Notes due 2014 and to fund expenses related to the spin-off of the commercial and residential security businesses, with any remaining proceeds to be used for general corporate purposes. 32 Table of Contents In July 2013, we fully redeemed the outstanding principal amount of $600 million of our 6.000% Senior Notes due 2013 and $655 million of our 9.500% Senior Notes due 2014, resulting in $45.6 million of redemption premium expense, which was recorded in the third quarter of 2013 in Interest expense. Exchangeable Senior Notes Due 2012 In April 2009, we issued $ 345 million of 4.5% Exchangeable Senior Notes (the Notes) through our wholly-owned subsidiary, IR-Global. We settled all remaining outstanding Notes during 2012. As a result, we paid $ 357.0 million in cash and issued 10.8 million ordinary shares to settle the principal, interest and equity portion of the Notes. Other As of December 31, 2013, we have a a 4-year, $1.0 billion revolving credit facility maturing on May 20, 2015 and a 5-year, $ 1.0 billion revolving credit facility maturing on March 15, 2017 , through our wholly-owned subsidiary, IR-Global. IR-Ireland, IR-Limited and IR-International have each provided an irrevocable and unconditional guarantee for these credit facilities. During 2013, the credit facilities were modified to include IR-New Jersey as a guarantor. The total committed revolving credit facilities of $ 2.0 billion are unused and provide support for our commercial paper program as well as for other general corporate purposes. In addition, other available non-U.S. lines of credit were $ 907.3 million , of which $ 660.0 million was unused at December 31, 2013 . These lines provide support for bank guarantees, letters of credit and other general corporate purposes. Pension Plans Our investment objective in managing defined benefit plan assets is to ensure that all present and future benefit obligations are met as they come due. We seek to achieve this goal while trying to mitigate volatility in plan funded status, contribution and expense by better matching the characteristics of the plan assets to that of the plan liabilities. We use a dynamic approach to asset allocation whereby a plan's allocation to fixed income assets increases progressively over time towards an ultimate target of 90% as a plan moves toward full funding. We monitor plan funded status and asset allocation regularly in addition to investment manager performance. We monitor the impact of market conditions on our defined benefit plans on a regular basis. None of our defined benefit pension plans have experienced a significant impact on their liquidity due to the volatility in the markets. For further details on pension plan activity, see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Cash Flows The following table reflects the major categories of cash flows for the years ended December 31, respectively. For additional details, please see the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in the Consolidated Financial Statements. In millions 2013 2012 2011 Operating cash flow provided by (used in) continuing operations $ 877.7 $ 868.1 $ 786.3 Investing cash flow provided by (used in) continuing operations (213.2 ) (128.2 ) 229.8 Financing cash flow provided by (used in) continuing operations 354.1 (1,295.7 ) (1,239.8 ) Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was $ 877.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared with $ 868.1 million in 2012 . Operating cash flows for 2013 reflect consistent earnings from continuing operations after taking into account spin-related tax charges with no cash impact in 2013 and favorable changes in working capital management. Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was $ 868.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 compared with $ 786.3 million in 2011 . Operating cash flows for 2012 and 2011 reflect consistent working capital levels and consistent earnings from continuing operations after taking into account the non-cash loss on sale/asset impairment charges related to the Hussmann divestiture. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was $ 213.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared with $ 128.2 million in 2012 . The change in investing activities is primarily attributable to increased capital expenditures and decreased net proceeds from business dispositions and equity investments in 2013 compared to 2012. Net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was $ 128.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2012 compared with net cash provided by investing activities from continuing operations of $ 229.8 million in 2011 . The change in investing activities is primarily attributable to decreased net proceeds from business dispositions and sale of property, plant, and equipment in 2012 compared to 2011, partially offset by a $44.3 million dividend from the Company's equity investment in Hussmann Parent in 2012. During 2011, the Company received net proceeds from business dispositions of $400.3 million related to the sale of the 33 Table of Contents Hussmann Business and Branches and the collection of proceeds for purchase price adjustments on the sale of Doosan Infracore. During 2011, we also received proceeds from the sale of assets from a restructured business in China. Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities from continuing operations during the year ended December 31, 2013 was $ 354.1 million , compared with net cash used in financing activities from continuing operations of $ 1,295.7 million in 2012 . The change in financing activities is primarily related to net proceeds from refinancing of our long term debt in 2013 and a transfer of $1,274.2 million from Allegion in connection with the spin-off , partially offset by increased repurchase of ordinary shares in 2013. Net cash used in financing activities from continuing operations during the year ended December 31, 2012 was $ 1,295.7 million , compared with $ 1,239.8 million during 2011 . The change in financing activities is primarily related to the settlement of the Exchangeable Senior Notes and increased dividend payments during 2012, partially offset by decreased share repurchases and increased proceeds from shares issued under incentive plans in 2012. Capital Resources Based on historical performance and current expectations, we believe our cash and cash equivalents balance, the cash generated from our operations, our committed credit lines and our expected ability to access capital markets will satisfy our working capital needs, capital expenditures, share repurchase programs, upcoming debt maturities, and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations for the foreseeable future. Capital expenditures were $ 242.2 million , $ 243.1 million and $ 217.1 million for 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , respectively. Our investments continue to improve manufacturing productivity, reduce costs and provide environmental enhancements and advanced technologies for existing facilities. The capital expenditure program for 2014 is estimated to be approximately $250 million, including amounts approved in prior periods. Many of these projects are subject to review and cancellation at our option without incurring substantial charges. For financial market risk impacting the Company, see Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk. Capitalization In addition to cash on hand and operating cash flow, we maintain significant credit availability under our Commercial Paper Program. Our ability to borrow at a cost-effective rate under the Commercial Paper Program is contingent upon maintaining an investment-grade credit rating. As of December 31, 2013 , our credit ratings were as follows: Short-term Long-term Moody P-2 Baa2 Standard and Poor A-2 BBB The credit ratings set forth above are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal by the assigning rating organization. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Our public debt does not contain financial covenants and our revolving credit lines have a debt-to-total capital covenant of 65%. As of December 31, 2013 , our debt-to-total capital ratio was significantly beneath this limit. Guarantees Subsequent to our reorganization as an Irish plc, IR-Ireland and IR-Limited guaranteed fully and unconditionally the outstanding public debt of IR-International, IR-Global and IR-New Jersey. During 2013, IR-Global and IR-International public outstanding indentures were modified to include IR-New Jersey as a co-obligor. 34 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations by required payment periods, in millions: Less than 1 year 1 - 3 years 3 - 5 years More than 5 years Total Short-term debt $ 16.7 $ $ $ $ 16.7 Long-term debt 351.0 * 517.2 765.4 1,877.3 3,510.9 Interest payments on long-term debt 194.3 344.4 314.8 1,531.3 2,384.8 Purchase obligations 954.0 954.0 Operating leases 111.6 149.2 71.6 60.7 393.1 Total contractual cash obligations $ 1,627.6 $ 1,010.8 $ 1,151.8 $ 3,469.3 $ 7,259.5 * Includes $343 million of debt redeemable at the option of the holder. The scheduled maturities of these bonds range between 2027 and 2028. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Future expected obligations under our pension and postretirement benefit plans, income taxes, environmental, asbestos-related, and product liability matters have not been included in the contractual cash obligations table above. Pensions At December 31, 2013 , we had net obligations of $ 554.0 million , which consist of noncurrent pension assets of $ 4.3 million and current and non-current pension benefit liabilities of $ 558.3 million . It is our objective to contribute to the pension plans to ensure adequate funds are available in the plans to make benefit payments to plan participants and beneficiaries when required. We currently project that we will contribute approximately $ 154.1 million to our plans worldwide in 2014 . Because the timing and amounts of long-term funding requirements for pension obligations are uncertain, they have been excluded from the preceding table. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions At December 31, 2013 , we had postretirement benefit obligations of $ 713.3 million . We fund postretirement benefit costs principally on a pay-as-you-go basis as medical costs are incurred by covered retiree populations. Benefit payments, which are net of expected plan participant contributions and Medicare Part D subsidy, are expected to be approximately $ 66.6 million in 2014 . Because the timing and amounts of long-term funding requirements for postretirement obligations are uncertain, they have been excluded from the preceding table. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Income Taxes At December 31, 2013 , we have total unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions of $ 363.3 million and $ 71.9 million of related accrued interest and penalties, net of tax. The liability has been excluded from the preceding table as we are unable to reasonably estimate the amount and period in which these liabilities might be paid. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding matters relating to income taxes, including unrecognized tax benefits and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) tax disputes. Contingent Liabilities We are involved in various litigations, claims and administrative proceedings, including those related to environmental, asbestos-related, and product liability matters. We believe that these liabilities are subject to the uncertainties inherent in estimating future costs for contingent liabilities, and will likely be resolved over an extended period of time. Because the timing and amounts of potential future cash flows are uncertain, they have been excluded from the preceding table. See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. See Note 8 and Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on matters affecting our liquidity. Critical Accounting Policies Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations are based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with those accounting principles requires management to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions based on the relevant information available at the end of each period. These estimates and assumptions have a significant effect on reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenue and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities because they result primarily from the need to make estimates and assumptions on matters that are inherently uncertain. Actual results may differ from estimates. If updated information or actual amounts are different from previous estimates, the revisions are included in our results for the period in which they become known. The following is a summary of certain accounting estimates and assumptions made by management that we consider critical. 35 Table of Contents Allowance for doubtful accounts We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable which represents our best estimate of probable loss inherent in our accounts receivable portfolio. This estimate is based upon our two step policy that results in the total recorded allowance for doubtful accounts. The first step is to create a specific reserve for significant accounts as to which the customer's ability to satisfy their financial obligation to the Company is in doubt due to circumstances such as bankruptcy, deteriorating operating results or financial position. In these circumstances, management uses its judgment to record an allowance based on the best estimate of probable loss, factoring in such considerations as the market value of collateral, if applicable. The second step is to record a portfolio reserve based on the aging of the outstanding accounts receivable portfolio and the Company's historical experience with our end markets, customer base and products. Actual results could differ from those estimates. These estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically, and the effects of changes, if any, are reflected in the statement of operations in the period that they are determined. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets We have significant goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets on our balance sheet related to acquisitions. Our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested and reviewed annually during the fourth quarter for impairment or when there is a significant change in events or circumstances that indicate that the fair value of an asset is more likely than not less than the carrying amount of the asset. Recoverability of goodwill is measured at the reporting unit level and begins with a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test included in U.S. GAAP. For those reporting units where it is required, the first step compares the carrying amount of the reporting unit to its estimated fair value. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is not necessary. To the extent that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, a second step is performed, wherein the reporting unit's carrying value of goodwill is compared to the implied fair value of goodwill. To the extent that the carrying value exceeds the implied fair value, impairment exists and must be recognized. As quoted market prices are not available for our reporting units, the calculation of their estimated fair value in step one is based on two valuation techniques, a discounted cash flow model (income approach) and a market adjusted multiple of earnings and revenues (market approach), with each method being equally weighted in the calculation. We believe an equal weighting of both approaches is appropriate. The income approach relies on the Company's estimates of future cash flows and explicitly addresses factors such as timing, growth and margins, with due consideration given to forecasting risk. The market approach reflects the market's expectations for future growth and risk, with adjustments to account for differences between the guideline publicly traded companies and the subject reporting units. In step 2, the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination. The estimated fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit (including any unrecognized intangible assets) as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit, as determined in the first step of the goodwill impairment test, was the price paid to acquire that reporting unit. Recoverability of other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives is first assessed using a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. This assessment is used as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to calculate the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset. For those indefinite-lived assets where it is required, a fair value is determined on a relief from royalty methodology (income approach) which is based on the implied royalty paid, at an appropriate discount rate, to license the use of an asset rather than owning the asset. The present value of the after-tax cost savings (i.e. royalty relief) indicates the estimated fair value of the asset. Any excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value is recognized as an impairment loss equal to that excess. The determination of the estimated fair value and the implied fair value of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets requires us to make assumptions about estimated cash flows, including profit margins, long-term forecasts, discount rates and terminal growth rates. We developed these assumptions based on the market and geographic risks unique to each reporting unit. 2013 Impairment Test For our annual impairment testing performed during the fourth quarter of 2013, we concluded it was necessary to calculate the fair value for each of the reporting units and indefinite-lived intangibles. Based on the results of these calculations, we determined that the fair value of the reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets exceeded their respective carrying values. The estimates of fair value are based on the best information available as of the date of the assessment, which primarily incorporates management assumptions about expected future cash flows. 36 Table of Contents Goodwill - Under the income approach, we assumed a forecasted cash flow period of five years with discount rates ranging from 10.0% to 15.5% , near term growth rates ranging from (0.2)% to 8.7% and terminal growth rates ranging from 3.0% to 4.0% . Under the market approach, we used an adjusted multiple ranging from 7.2 to 9.8 of projected earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) and 0.9 to 2.4 of projected revenues based on the market information of comparable companies. Additionally, we compared the estimated aggregate fair value of our reporting units to our overall market capitalization. For all reporting units, the excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value (expressed as a percentage of carrying value) was a minimum of 15%. A significant increase in the discount rate, decrease in the long-term growth rate, or substantial reductions in our end markets and volume assumptions could have a negative impact on the estimated fair value of these reporting units. In our 2012 Form 10-K, we disclosed a Security Technologies reporting unit whose excess estimated fair value over carrying value was less than 15%. As a result of the spin-off, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2013, this reporting unit is now presented within discontinued operations. Please see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of goodwill impairment charges related to discontinued operations. Other Indefinite-lived intangible assets - In testing our other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, we assumed forecasted revenues for a period of five years with discount rates ranging from 10.5% to 12.0%, terminal growth rate of 3.0%, and royalty rates ranging from 3.0% to 4.5%. For all tradenames, the excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value (expressed as a percentage of carrying value) was a minimum of 15%. A significant increase in the discount rate, decrease in the long-term growth rate, decrease in the royalty rate or substantial reductions in our end markets and volume assumptions could have a negative impact on the estimated fair values of any of our tradenames. 2012 Impairment Test For our annual impairment testing performed during the fourth quarter of 2012, we concluded it was necessary to calculate the fair value for each of the reporting units and indefinite-lived intangibles. Based on the results of these calculations, we determined that the fair value of the reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets exceeded their respective carrying values. The estimates of fair value are based on the best information available as of the date of the assessment, which primarily incorporates management assumptions about expected future cash flows. Goodwill - Under the income approach, we assumed a forecasted cash flow period of five years with discount rates ranging from 11.0% to 15.5% , near term growth rates ranging from (3.5)% to 14.5% and terminal growth rates ranging from 2.5% to 4.0% . Under the market approach, we used an adjusted multiple ranging from 6.6 to 9.2 of projected earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) and 0.8 to 1.8 of projected revenues based on the market information of comparable companies. Additionally, we compared the estimated aggregate fair value of our reporting units to our overall market capitalization. For all reporting units except one, the excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value (expressed as a percentage of carrying value) was a minimum of 15% . The reporting unit with a percentage of carrying value less than 15%, reported within the Climate segment, exceeded its carrying value by 14.4% . This reporting unit had goodwill of approximately $ 599 million at December 31, 2012. A significant increase in the discount rate, decrease in the long-term growth rate, or substantial reductions in our end markets and volume assumptions could have a negative impact on the estimated fair value of these reporting units. Other Indefinite-lived intangible assets - In testing our other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, we assumed forecasted revenues for a period of five years with discount rates ranging from 12.0% to 12.5%, terminal growth rates ranging from 2.5% to 3.0%, and royalty rates ranging from 3.0% to 4.0%. The fair values of our Trane and American Standard tradenames exceeded their respective carrying amounts by less than 15%. The two tradenames exceeded their carrying value by 10.5% and 13.0%, respectively. The carrying values of these tradenames are approximately $2,497 million and $105 million, respectively, at December 31, 2012. A significant increase in the discount rate, decrease in the long-term growth rate, decrease in the royalty rate or substantial reductions in our end markets and volume assumptions could have a negative impact on the estimated fair values of any of our tradenames. Long-lived assets and finite-lived intangibles Long-lived assets and finite-lived intangibles are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable. Assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows can be generated. Impairment in the carrying value of an asset would be recognized whenever anticipated future undiscounted cash flows from an asset are less than its carrying value. The impairment is measured as the amount by which the carrying 37 Table of Contents value exceeds the fair value of the asset as determined by an estimate of discounted cash flows. We believe that our use of estimates and assumptions are reasonable and comply with generally accepted accounting principles. Changes in business conditions could potentially require future adjustments to these valuations. Loss contingencies Liabilities are recorded for various contingencies arising in the normal course of business, including litigation and administrative proceedings, environmental and asbestos matters and product liability, product warranty, worker compensation and other claims. We have recorded reserves in the financial statements related to these matters, which are developed using input derived from actuarial estimates and historical and anticipated experience data depending on the nature of the reserve, and in certain instances with consultation of legal counsel, internal and external consultants and engineers. Subject to the uncertainties inherent in estimating future costs for these types of liabilities, we believe our estimated reserves are reasonable and do not believe the final determination of the liabilities with respect to these matters would have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or cash flows for any year. Asbestos matters Certain of our wholly-owned subsidiaries are named as defendants in asbestos-related lawsuits in state and federal courts. We record a liability for our actual and anticipated future claims as well as an asset for anticipated insurance settlements. Asbestos related defense costs are excluded from the asbestos claims liability and are recorded separately as services are incurred. Although we were neither a manufacturer nor producer of asbestos, some of our formerly manufactured components from third party suppliers utilized asbestos-related components. As a result, we record certain income and expenses associated with our asbestos liabilities and corresponding insurance recoveries within discontinued operations, net of tax, as they relate to previously divested businesses, except for amounts associated with Trane U.S. Inc. asbestos liabilities and corresponding insurance recoveries which are recorded within continuing operations. Refer to Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details of asbestos-related matters. Revenue recognition Revenue is recognized and earned when all of the following criteria are satisfied: (a) persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists; (b) the price is fixed or determinable; (c) collectability is reasonably assured; and (d) delivery has occurred or service has been rendered. Delivery generally occurs when the title and the risks and rewards of ownership have substantially transferred to the customer. Both the persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement and fixed or determinable price criteria are deemed to be satisfied upon receipt of an executed and legally binding sales agreement or contract that clearly defines the terms and conditions of the transaction including the respective obligations of the parties. If the defined terms and conditions allow variability in all or a component of the price, revenue is not recognized until such time that the price becomes fixed or determinable. At the point of sale, the Company validates that existence of an enforceable claim that requires payment within a reasonable amount of time and assesses the collectability of that claim. If collectability is not deemed to be reasonably assured, then revenue recognition is deferred until such time that collectability becomes probable or cash is received. Delivery is not considered to have occurred until the customer has taken title and assumed the risks and rewards of ownership. Service and installation revenue are recognized when earned. In some instances, customer acceptance provisions are included in sales arrangements to give the buyer the ability to ensure the delivered product or service meets the criteria established in the order. In these instances, revenue recognition is deferred until the acceptance terms specified in the arrangement are fulfilled through customer acceptance or a demonstration that established criteria have been satisfied. If uncertainty exists about customer acceptance, revenue is not recognized until acceptance has occurred. We offer various sales incentive programs to our customers, dealers, and distributors. Sales incentive programs do not preclude revenue recognition, but do require an accrual for the Company's best estimate of expected activity. Examples of the sales incentives that are accrued for as a contra receivable and sales deduction at the point of sale include, but are not limited to, discounts (i.e. net 30 type), coupons, and rebates where the customer does not have to provide any additional requirements to receive the discount. Sales returns and customer disputes involving a question of quantity or price are also accounted for as a reduction in revenue and a contra receivable. At December 31, 2013 and 2012, the Company had a customer claim accrual (contra receivable) of $1.7 million and $2.1 million , respectively. All other incentives or incentive programs where the customer is required to reach a certain sales level, remain a customer for a certain period of time, provide a rebate form or is subject to additional requirements are accounted for as a reduction of revenue and establishment of a liability. At December 31, 2013 and 2012, the Company had a sales incentive accrual of $80.1 million and $62.2 million , respectively. Each of these accruals represents the best estimate the Company expects to pay related to previously sold units. These estimates are reviewed regularly for accuracy. If updated information or actual amounts are different from previous estimates, the revisions are included in our results for the period in which they become known. Historically, the aggregate differences, if any, between our estimates and actual amounts in any year have not had a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company enters into maintenance and extended warranty contracts with customers. Revenue related to these services is recognized on a straight-line basis over the life of the contract, unless sufficient historical evidence indicates that the cost of providing these services is incurred on an other than straight-line basis. In these circumstances, revenue is recognized over the contract period in proportion to the costs expected to be incurred in performing the service. 38 Table of Contents The Company, primarily through its Climate segment, provides equipment (e.g. HVAC, controls), integrated solutions, and installation designed to customer specifications through construction-type contracts. The term of these types of contracts is typically less than one year, but can be as long as three years. Revenues related to these contracts are recognized using the percentage-of-completion method in accordance with GAAP. This measure of progress toward completion, utilized to recognize sales and profits, is based on the proportion of actual cost incurred to date as compared to the total estimate of contract costs at completion. The timing of revenue recognition often differs from the invoicing schedule to the customer, with revenue recognition in advance of customer invoicing recorded to unbilled accounts receivable and invoicing in advance of revenue recognition recorded to deferred revenue. At December 31, 2013 , all recorded receivables (billed and unbilled) are due within one year. The Company re-evaluates its contract estimates periodically and reflects changes in estimates in the current period using the cumulative catch-up method. These periodic reviews have not historically resulted in significant adjustments. If estimated contract costs are in excess of contract revenues, then the excess costs are accrued. We enter into sales arrangements that contain multiple elements, such as equipment, installation and service revenue. For multiple element arrangements, each element is evaluated to determine the separate units of accounting. The total arrangement consideration is then allocated to the separate units of accounting based on their relative selling price at the inception of the arrangement. The relative selling price is determined using vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE) of selling price, if it exists; otherwise, third-party evidence (TPE) of selling price is used. If neither VSOE nor TPE of selling price exists for a deliverable, a best estimate of the selling price is developed for that deliverable. The Company primarily utilizes VSOE to determine its relative selling price. The Company recognizes revenue for delivered elements when the delivered item has stand-alone value to the customer, the basic revenue recognition criteria have been met, and only customary refund or return rights related to the delivered elements exist. Income taxes Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, applying enacted tax rates expected to be in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. We recognize future tax benefits, such as net operating losses and non-U.S. tax credits, to the extent that realizing these benefits is considered in our judgment to be more likely than not. We regularly review the recoverability of our deferred tax assets considering our historic profitability, projected future taxable income, timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and the feasibility of our tax planning strategies. Where appropriate, we record a valuation allowance with respect to a future tax benefit. The provision for income taxes involves a significant amount of management judgment regarding interpretation of relevant facts and laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Future changes in applicable laws, projected levels of taxable income, and tax planning could change the effective tax rate and tax balances recorded by us. In addition, tax authorities periodically review income tax returns filed by us and can raise issues regarding our filing positions, timing and amount of income or deductions, and the allocation of income among the jurisdictions in which we operate. A significant period of time may elapse between the filing of an income tax return and the ultimate resolution of an issue raised by a revenue authority with respect to that return. We believe that we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable resolution of these matters. We will adjust our estimate if significant events so dictate. To the extent that the ultimate results differ from our original or adjusted estimates, the effect will be recorded in the provision for income taxes in the period that the matter is finally resolved. Employee benefit plans We provide a range of benefits to eligible employees and retirees, including pensions, postretirement and postemployment benefits. Determining the cost associated with such benefits is dependent on various actuarial assumptions including discount rates, expected return on plan assets, compensation increases, employee mortality, turnover rates and healthcare cost trend rates. Actuarial valuations are performed to determine expense in accordance with GAAP. Actual results may differ from the actuarial assumptions and are generally accumulated and amortized into earnings over future periods. We review our actuarial assumptions at each measurement date and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends, if appropriate. The discount rate, the rate of compensation increase and the expected long-term rates of return on plan assets are determined as of each measurement date. A discount rate reflects a rate at which pension benefits could be effectively settled. Discount rates for all plans are established using hypothetical yield curves based on the yields of corporate bonds rated AA quality. Spot rates are developed from the yield curve and used to discount future benefit payments. The rate of compensation increase is dependent on expected future compensation levels. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of returns expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for the benefits included in the projected benefit obligation. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on what is achievable given the plan investment policy, the types of assets held and the target asset allocation. The expected long-term rate of return is determined as of each measurement date. We believe that the assumptions utilized in recording our obligations under our plans are reasonable based on input from our actuaries, outside investment advisors and information as to assumptions used by plan sponsors. 39 Table of Contents Changes in any of the assumptions can have an impact on the net periodic pension cost or postretirement benefit cost. Estimated sensitivities to the expected 2014 net periodic pension cost of a 0.25% rate decline in the two basic assumptions are as follows: the decline in the discount rate would increase expense by approximately $5.0 million and the decline in the estimated return on assets would increase expense by approximately $6.8 million. A 0.25% rate decrease in the discount rate for postretirement benefits would decrease expected 2014 net periodic postretirement benefit cost by $0.5 million and a 1.0% increase in the healthcare cost trend rate would increase the service and interest cost by approximately $1.2 million.
