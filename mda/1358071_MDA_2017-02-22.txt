Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion is intended to assist you in understanding our business and results of operations together with our present financial condition. This section should be read in conjunction with our historical consolidated financial statements and notes, as well as the selected historical consolidated financial data included elsewhere in this report. Certain statements in our discussion below are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. We caution that a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those implied or expressed by the forward-looking statements. Please see Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements. Overview We are an independent oil and natural gas company engaged in the acquisition, development, exploration and production of oil and natural gas properties. Our core operations are primarily focused in the Permian Basin of southeast New Mexico and west Texas. Concho legacy in the Permian Basin provides us a deep understanding of operating and geological trends. We are actively applying new technologies, such as extended length lateral drilling and enhanced completion techniques, throughout our four core operating areas: the Northern Delaware Basin, the Southern Delaware Basin, the Midland Basin and the New Mexico Shelf. Oil comprised 59.5 percent of our 720.0 MMBoe of estimated proved reserves at December 31, 2016 and 61.4 percent of our 55.1 MMBoe of production for 2016. We seek to operate the wells in which we own an interest, and we operated wells that accounted for 91.9 percent of our proved developed producing reserves and 79.0 percent of our 7,858 gross wells at December 31, 2016. By controlling operations, we are able to more effectively manage the cost and timing of exploration and development of our properties, including the drilling and stimulation methods used. 46 Financial and Operating Performance Our financial and operating performance for 2016 included the following highlights: Net loss was $ 1.5 billion ($(10.85) per diluted share) as compared to net income of $65.9 million ($ 0.54 per diluted share) in 2015. The decrease was primarily due to: $1.5 billion in impairments of long-lived assets during 2016, primarily attributable to properties in our New Mexico Shelf area, as compared to $60.5 million in non-cash impairment charges in 2015 ; $1.1 billion change in (gain) loss on derivatives due to a $368.7 million loss on derivatives during 2016, as compared to a $699.8 million gain on derivatives during 2015; $168.6 million decrease in oil and natural gas revenues as a result of a 14 percent decrease in commodity price realizations per Boe (excluding the effects of derivative activities), partially offset by a 5 percent increase in production; $56.4 million loss on extinguishment of debt related to the early redemption of our 7.0% unsecured senior notes due 2021 (the 7.0% Notes ) in September 2016 and early extinguishment of our 6.5% Notes in December 2016; and $18.6 million increase in exploration and abandonment expense primarily due to leasehold abandonments in 2016 as compared to 2015; partially offset by: $907.5 million change in our income tax (expense) benefit due to the loss before income taxes during 2016, as compared to income before income taxes during 2015; $171.4 million change in (gain) loss on disposition of assets, net primarily due to our February 2016 asset divestiture ; $90.1 million decrease in oil and natural gas production expense, primarily due to implementation of operational cost efficiencies, an overall decrease in the cost of goods and services and lower production taxes as a result of reduced revenues; and $56.0 million decrease in depreciation, depletion and amortization expense, primarily due to slightly lower depletion rate per Boe period over period. Average daily sales volumes increased by 5 percent from 143,256 Boe per day during 2015 to 150,511 Boe per day during 2016. The increase is primarily attributable to our successful drilling and completion efforts during 2015 and 2016 and the Reliance Acquisition, which was completed in October 2016 . Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by approximately $146.0 million to $1,384.4 million for 2016, as compared to $1,530.4 m illion in 2015, primarily due to a decrease in oil and natural gas revenues and negative variances in working capital changes, partially offset by decreased production expenses, changes related to cash income taxes and decreased cash interest expense. Cash decreased by approximately $175.3 million during 2016 primarily as a result of cash consideration paid for the Reliance Acquisition, cash consideration paid related to our asset acquisition that closed in March 2016, cash paid to redeem the 7.0% Notes, cash paid to extinguish the 6.5% Notes and capital expenditures for properties, partially offset by the proceeds from our August 2016 equity offering, proceeds from the issuance of our 4.375% Notes, our divestiture that closed in February 2016 and operating cash flows. 47 Commodity Prices Our results of operations are heavily influenced by commodity prices. Commodity prices may fluctuate widely in response to (i) relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids, (ii) market uncertainty and (iii) a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control. Factors that may impact future commodity prices, including the price of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids, include, but are not limited to: continuing economic uncertainty worldwide; political and economic developments in oil and natural gas producing regions, including Africa, South America and the Middle East; the extent to which members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other oil exporting nations are able to influence global oil supply levels; technological advances affecting energy consumption and energy supply; domestic and foreign governmental regulations, including limits on the United States ability to export crude oil, and taxation; the level of global inventories; the proximity, capacity, cost and availability of pipelines and other transportation facilities, as well as the availability of commodity processing and gathering and refining capacity; risks related to the concentration of our operations in the Permian Basin of Southeast New Mexico and West Texas and the level of commodity inventory in the Permian Basin; the quality of the oil we produce; the overall global demand for oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids; the domestic and foreign supply of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids; political and economic events that directly or indirectly impact the relative strength or weakness of the United States dollar, on which oil prices are benchmarked globally, against foreign currencies; the effect of energy conservation efforts; the price and availability of alternative fuels; and overall North American oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids supply and demand fundamentals, including: the United States economy, weather conditions, and liquefied natural gas deliveries to and exports from the United States. Although we cannot predict the occurrence of events that may affect future commodity prices or the degree to which these prices will be affected, the prices for any commodity that we produce will generally approximate current market prices in the geographic region of the production. From time to time, we expect that we may economically hedge a portion of our commodity price risk to mitigate the impact of price volatility on our business. See Notes 8 and 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information regarding our commodity derivative positions at December 31, 2016 and additional derivative contracts entered into subsequent to December 31, 2016, respectively. 48 Oil and natural gas prices have been subject to significant fluctuations during the past several years. The average oil and natural gas prices were lower during 2016 compared to 2015. The following table sets forth the average NYMEX oil and natural gas prices for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, as well as the high and low NYMEX prices for the same periods: Years Ended December 31, 2016 2015 2014 Average NYMEX prices: Oil (Bbl) $ 43.42 $ 48.84 $ 92.94 Natural gas (MMBtu) $ 2.56 $ 2.63 $ 4.27 High and Low NYMEX prices: Oil (Bbl): High $ 54.06 $ 61.43 $ 107.26 Low $ 26.21 $ 34.73 $ 53.27 Natural gas (MMBtu): High $ 3.93 $ 3.23 $ 6.15 Low $ 1.64 $ 1.76 $ 2.89 Further, the NYMEX oil price and NYMEX natural gas price reached highs and lows of $53.99 and $50.82 per Bbl and $3.72 and $2.83 per MMBtu, respectively, during the period from January 1, 2017 to February 17, 2017. At February 17, 2017, the NYMEX oil price and NYMEX natural gas price were $53.40 per Bbl and $2.83 per MMBtu, respectively. Over the past three years, approximately half of our total natural gas revenues have been derived from the value of the natural gas liquids contained in our natural gas, with the remaining portion coming from the value of the dry natural gas residue. The average Mont Belvieu price for a blended barrel of natural gas liquids was $18.08 per Bbl and $17.80 per Bbl during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 49 Recent Events 2017 capital budget . In February 2017, we announced our updated 2017 capital budget, excluding acquisitions, of approximately $1.8 billion with expected capital spending to range between $1.6 billion and $1.8 billion. Approximately 90 percent of capital will be directed to drilling and completion activity. Our 2017 capital program is expected to continue focusing on extended length lateral drilling. Our 2017 capital budget, based on our current expectations of commodity prices and costs, is expected to be within our cash flows. Our budget could change depending on numerous factors, including commodity prices, leverage metrics and industry conditions. ACC divestiture. In January 2017, we and our joint venture partner entered into separate agreements to sell 100 percent of our respective ownership interests in ACC for a combined total of $1.215 billion. After adjustments for debt and working capital, we received net cash proceeds from the sale of approximately $802.8 million. Our net investment in ACC was approximately $128.7 million at December 31, 2016. The transaction closed in February 2017. Northern Delaware Basin acquisition. In November 2016, we announced an acquisition of approximately 16,400 net acres in the Northern Delaware Basin for approximately $430.0 million. As consideration for the acquisition, we agreed to issue to the seller approximately 2.2 million shares of our common stock and $150.0 million in cash. In January 2017, we closed on a portion of the acquisition and expect to close on the remainder during the first half of 2017. Senior notes . In December 2016, we issued $600 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.375% senior notes due 2025 at par, for which we received net proceeds of approximately $592.1 million. We used the net proceeds from the offering to fund the satisfaction and discharge of our obligations under the indenture of the $600 million outstanding principal amount of our 6.5% Notes at a price equal to 103.25 percent of par. The early extinguishment price included the make-whole premium as determined in accordance with the indenture governing the 6.5% Notes. In December 2016, we also paid interest of approximately $19.6 million on the 6.5% Notes through January 16, 2017. We recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt related to the 6.5% Notes of approximately $28.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This amount includes $19.5 million associated with the make-whole premium paid for the early extinguishment of the notes, approximately $7.3 million of unamortized deferred loan costs and approximately $1.9 million of additional interest on the 6.5% Notes through January 16, 2017, which was paid in December 2016. Reliance Acquisition. In October 2016, we completed the Reliance Acquisition. As consideration for the acquisition, we paid approximately $1.2 billion in cash and issued to the seller approximately 3.9 million shares of common stock with an approximate value of $0.5 billion. 50 Derivative Financial Instruments Derivative financial instrument exposure. At December 31, 2016 , the fair value of our financial derivatives was a net liability of $ 174.4 million. All of our counterparties to these financial derivatives are parties to our credit facility and have their outstanding debt commitments and derivative exposures collateralized pursuant to our credit facility. At December 31, 2016 , under the terms of our financial derivative instruments and their collateralization under our credit facility, we do not have exposure to potential margin calls on our financial derivative instruments. We currently have no reason to believe that our counterparties to these commodity derivative contracts are not financially viable. Under the terms of our credit facility, certain events could occur that would cause the obligations under our credit facility to no longer be secured by our oil and natural gas properties. In this circumstance, we have certain agreements in place with our derivative counterparties that would regulate collateral related to derivative transactions. See Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information. Our credit facility does not allow us to offset amounts we may owe a lender against amounts we may be owed related to our financial instruments with such party. New commodity derivative contracts. After December 31, 2016, we entered into the following additional oil price swaps to hedge additional amounts of our estimated future production: First Second Third Fourth Quarter Quarter Quarter Quarter Total Oil Swaps: (a) 2017: Volume (Bbl) 403,000 1,360,000 1,044,000 868,000 3,675,000 Price per Bbl $ 55.32 $ 55.20 $ 55.36 $ 55.56 $ 55.34 2018: Volume (Bbl) 736,000 652,000 580,000 523,000 2,491,000 Price per Bbl $ 55.47 $ 55.48 $ 55.54 $ 55.61 $ 55.52 2019: Volume (Bbl) 2,355,000 2,253,000 2,163,000 2,083,000 8,854,000 Price per Bbl $ 55.15 $ 55.11 $ 55.14 $ 55.16 $ 55.14 (a) The index prices for the oil price swaps are based on the NYMEX WTI monthly average futures price. 51 Results of Operations The following table sets forth summary information concerning our production and operating data for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. The actual historical data in this table excludes results from the Reliance Acquisition for periods prior to October 2016. Because of normal production declines, increased or decreased drilling activities, fluctuations in commodity prices and the effects of acquisitions or divestitures, the historical information presented below should not be interpreted as being indicative of future results. Years Ended December 31, 2016 2015 2014 Production and operating data: Net production volumes: Oil (MBbl) 33,840 34,457 26,319 Natural gas (MMcf) 127,481 106,987 87,336 Total (MBoe) 55,087 52,288 40,875 Average daily production volumes: Oil (Bbl) 92,459 94,403 72,107 Natural gas (Mcf) 348,309 293,115 239,277 Total (Boe) 150,511 143,256 111,987 Average prices per unit: Oil, without derivatives (Bbl) $ 39.90 $ 44.69 $ 83.17 Oil, with derivatives (Bbl) (a) $ 57.90 $ 62.03 $ 86.07 Natural gas, without derivatives (Mcf) $ 2.23 $ 2.46 $ 5.39 Natural gas, with derivatives (Mcf) (a) $ 2.36 $ 2.80 $ 5.34 Total, without derivatives (Boe) $ 29.68 $ 34.49 $ 65.08 Total, with derivatives (Boe) (a) $ 41.03 $ 46.60 $ 66.84 Operating costs and expenses per Boe: Lease operating expenses and workover costs $ 5.81 $ 7.46 $ 8.05 Oil and natural gas taxes $ 2.38 $ 2.90 $ 5.12 Depreciation, depletion and amortization $ 21.19 $ 23.40 $ 23.97 General and administrative $ 4.09 $ 4.42 $ 4.99 (a) Includes the effect of net cash receipts from (payments on) derivatives: Years Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2016 2015 2014 Net cash receipts from (payments on) derivatives: Oil derivatives $ 608,847 $ 597,297 $ 76,335 Natural gas derivatives 16,403 35,619 (4,352) Total $ 625,250 $ 632,916 $ 71,983 The presentation of average prices with derivatives is a result of including the net cash receipts from (payments on) commodity derivatives that are presented in our statements of cash flows. This presentation of average prices with derivatives is a means by which to reflect the actual cash performance of our commodity derivatives for the respective periods and presents oil and natural gas prices with derivatives in a manner consistent with the presentation generally used by the investment community. 52 The following table presents selected production data for the fields which represent greater than 15 percent of our total proved reserves at December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014: Year Ended December 31, 2016 2015 2014 Production: South Basin Wolfcamp Bone Spring: Oil (MBbl) 10,461 9,742 6,024 Natural gas (MMcf) 55,793 36,895 25,447 Total (MBoe) 19,760 15,891 10,265 Yeso: Oil (MBbl) 7,047 6,986 6,929 Natural gas (MMcf) 27,322 26,833 27,409 Total (MBoe) 11,601 11,458 11,497 Wolfberry West: Oil (MBbl) 5,703 (a) (a) Natural gas (MMcf) 20,942 (a) (a) Total (MBoe) 9,193 (a) (a) (a) Represented less than 15% of the Company's total proved reserves for the year indicated. 53 Year Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015 Oil and natural gas revenues. Revenue from oil and natural gas operations was $1,635.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 , a decrease of $168.6 million (9 percent ) from $1,803.6 million for 2015 . This decrease was primarily due to the decrease in realized oil and natural gas prices partially offset by an increase in natural gas production. Specific factors affecting oil and natural gas revenues include the following: total oil production was 33,840 MBbl for the year ended December 31, 2016 , a decrease of 617 MBbl (1.8 percent ) from 34,457 MBbl for 2015 ; average realized oil price (excluding the effects of derivative activities) was $39.90 per Bbl during the year ended December 31, 2016 , a decrease of 10.7 percent from $44.69 per Bbl during 2015. For the year ended December 31, 2016 , our crude oil price differential relative to NYMEX was $(3.52) per Bbl, or a realization of approximately 91.9 percent, as compared to a crude oil price differential relative to NYMEX of $(4.15) per Bbl, or a realization of approximately 91.5 percent, for 2015. We incur fixed deductions from the posted Midland oil price based on the location of our oil within the Permian Basin. Additionally, the basis differential between the location of Midland, Texas and Cushing, Oklahoma (NYMEX pricing location) for our oil directly impacts our realized oil price. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 , the average market basis differential between WTI-Midland and WTI-Cushing was a price reduction of $0.15 per Bbl and $0.41 per Bbl, respectively; total natural gas production was 127,481 MMcf for the year ended December 31, 2016 , an increase of 20,494 MMcf (19.2 percent ) from 106,987 MMcf for 2015 ; and average realized natural gas price (excluding the effects of derivative activities) was $2.23 per Mcf during the year ended December 31, 2016 , a decrease of 9.3 percent from $2.46 per Mcf during 2015 . For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 , we realized approximately 87.1 percent and 93.5 percent, respectively, of the average NYMEX natural gas prices for the respective periods. Factors contributing to the decrease in our realized gas price (excluding the effects of derivatives) as a percentage of NYMEX during the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to 2015 were (i) a decrease in the posted regional natural gas prices on which we are paid while the NYMEX natural gas price decreased at a lesser rate and (ii) increased deductions and fees from the regional natural gas price, comparatively. Over the past three years, approximately half of our total natural gas revenues have been derived from the value of the natural gas liquids contained in our natural gas, with the remaining portion coming from the value of the dry natural gas residue. The average Mont Belvieu price for a blended barrel of natural gas liquids was $18.08 per Bbl and $17.80 per Bbl during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 54 Production expenses. The following table provides the components of our total oil and natural gas production costs for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015: Years Ended December 31, 2016 2015 Per Per (in thousands, except per unit amounts) Amount Boe Amount Boe Lease operating expenses $ 300,797 $ 5.46 $ 362,114 $ 6.93 Workover costs 19,057 0.35 27,590 0.53 Taxes: Ad valorem 14,017 0.25 22,921 0.44 Production 117,433 2.13 128,734 2.46 Total oil and natural gas production expenses $ 451,304 $ 8.19 $ 541,359 $ 10.36 Among the cost components of production expenses, we have some control over lease operating expenses and workover costs on properties we operate, but production and ad valorem taxes are related to commodity prices. Lease operating expenses were $300.8 million ($5.46 per Boe) for the year ended December 31, 2016 , which was a decrease of $61.3 million (17 percent) from $362.1 million ($6.93 per Boe) for the year ended December 31, 2015 . The decrease in lease operating expenses was primarily due to (i) implementation of operational cost efficiencies and (ii) an overall decrease in the cost of goods and services. The decrease in lease operating expenses per Boe was primarily due to the reduction in lease operating expenses noted above coupled with a slight increase in production period over period. Workover expenses were approximately $19.1 million and $27.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease was primarily related to less overall activity during 2016 as compared to 2015. Production taxes per unit of production were $2.13 per Boe during the year ended December 31, 2016 , a decrease of 13 percent from $2.46 per Boe during 2015 . The decrease was directly related to the decrease in oil and natural gas prices. Over the same period, our average realized prices per Boe (excluding the effects of derivatives) decreased 14 percent. Exploration and abandonments expense. The following table provides a breakdown of our exploration and abandonments expense for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015: Years Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2016 2015 Geological and geophysical $ 8,441 $ 9,694 Exploratory dry hole costs 6,791 9,205 Leasehold abandonments 59,830 34,532 Other 2,392 5,416 Total exploration and abandonments $ 77,454 $ 58,847 Our geological and geophysical expense for the periods presented above primarily consists of the costs of acquiring and processing geophysical data and core analysis. Our exploratory dry hole costs during the year ended December 31, 2016 were primarily related to an uneconomic well in our Northern Delaware Basin core area that was attempting to establish commercial production through testing of multiple zones. Our exploratory dry hole costs during the year ended December 31, 2015 were primarily related to (i) an uneconomic well in our Southern Delaware Basin core area that was attempting to establish production in an unconventional zone for the area and (ii) expensing an unsuccessful well, which we did not operate, that was located in our New Mexico Shelf core area. 55 During the year ended December 31, 2016, we recognized leasehold abandonment expense of approximately $59.8 million primarily related to (i) drilling locations in our Northern Delaware Basin and New Mexico Shelf core areas which, based on multiple factors, are no longer likely to be drilled, (ii) acreage in our Northern Delaware Basin and New Mexico Shelf core areas where we have no future development plans and (iii) expiring acreage primarily located in our Northern Delaware Basin and Southern Delaware Basin core areas. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we recognized leasehold abandonment expense of approximately $34.5 million primarily related to expired and abandoned acreage in our Northern Delaware Basin core area where we currently have no intent to drill. Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense. The following table provides components of our depreciation, depletion and amortization expense for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015: Years Ended December 31, 2016 2015 Per Per (in thousands, except per unit amounts) Amount Boe Amount Boe Depletion of proved oil and natural gas properties $ 1,145,165 $ 20.79 $ 1,203,469 $ 23.02 Depreciation of other property and equipment 20,582 0.37 18,323 0.35 Amortization of intangible assets - operating rights 1,461 0.03 1,461 0.03 Total depletion, depreciation and amortization $ 1,167,208 $ 21.19 $ 1,223,253 $ 23.40 Oil price used to estimate proved oil reserves at period end $ 39.25 $ 46.79 Natural gas price used to estimate proved natural gas reserves at period end $ 2.48 $ 2.59 Depletion of proved oil and natural gas properties was $1,145.2 million ($20.79 per Boe) for the year ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of $58.3 million (5 percent) from $1,203.5 million ($23.02 per Boe) for 2015. The decrease in depletion expense was primarily due to a lower depletion rate per Boe period over period partially offset by an increase in production. The decrease in depletion expense per Boe period over period was primarily due to (i) a non-cash impairment charge of approximately $1.5 billion recorded in the first quarter of 2016 and (ii) an overall increase in proved reserves period over period primarily caused by our successful exploratory drilling program, the Reliance Acquisition and reductions in future estimated lease operating expenses, partially offset by decreased proved reserves caused by (i) reclassification of proved undeveloped reserves to unproved reserves because they are no longer expected to be developed within five years of their initial recording and (ii) lower commodity prices. The increase in depreciation expense was primarily associated with additional other property and equipment related to buildings and other items. Impairments of long-lived assets. We periodically review our long-lived assets to be held and used, including proved oil and natural gas properties and their integrated assets, whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable, for instance when there are declines in commodity prices or well performance. We review our oil and natural gas properties by depletion base. An impairment loss is indicated if the sum of the expected undiscounted future net cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the assets. If the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows are less than the carrying amount of our assets, we recognize an impairment loss for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset. We calculate the expected undiscounted future net cash flows of our long-lived assets and their integrated assets using management assumptions and expectations of (i) commodity prices, which are based on the NYMEX strip, (ii) pricing adjustments for differentials, (iii) production costs, (iv) capital expenditures, (v) production volumes, (vi) estimated proved reserves and risk-adjusted probable and possible reserves, and (vii) prevailing market rates of income and expenses from integrated assets. At December 31, 2016, our estimates of commodity prices for purposes of determining undiscounted future cash flows, which are based on the NYMEX strip, ranged from a 2017 price of $56.19 per barrel of oil to a 2024 price of $57.41 per barrel of oil. Similarly, natural gas prices ranged from a 2017 price of $3.61 per Mcf of natural gas decreasing to a 2020 price of $2.88 per Mcf of natural gas partially recovering to a 2024 price of $3.38 per Mcf of natural gas. Commodity prices for this purpose were held flat after 2024. 56 We calculate the estimated fair values of our long-lived assets and their integrated assets using a discounted future cash flow model. Fair value assumptions associated with the calculation of discounted future net cash flows include (i) market estimates of commodity prices, (ii) pricing adjustments for differentials, (iii) production costs, (iv) capital expenditures, (v) production volumes, (vi) estimated proved reserves and risk-adjusted probable and possible reserves, (vii) prevailing market rates of income and expenses from integrated assets and (viii) discount rate. The expected future net cash flows were discounted using an annual rate of 10 percent to determine fair value. During the three months ended March 31, 2016, NYMEX strip prices declined as compared to December 31, 2015, and as a result the carrying amount of our Yeso field in our New Mexico Shelf core area exceeded the expected undiscounted future net cash flows resulting in a non-cash charge against earnings of approximately $1.5 billion. The Yeso field, as compared to our other fields not previously impaired, had significant proved reserves upon acquisition, which required a higher valuation than a field more exploratory in nature that has a higher risk factor adjustment in the fair value estimate. Our estimates of commodity prices for purposes of determining the estimated fair value at March 31, 2016 ranged from a 2016 price of $41.26 per barrel of oil and $2.26 per Mcf of natural gas to a 2022 price of $66.33 per barrel of oil and $3.56 per Mcf of natural gas. Commodity prices for this purpose were held flat after 2022. We recognized a non-cash charge against earnings of approximately $60.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as a result of the carrying amount of certain of our long-lived assets and their integrated assets being less than their expected undiscounted future net cash flows, which was primarily attributable to properties in our eastern Midland Basin area. It is reasonably possible that the estimate of undiscounted future net cash flows of our long-lived assets may change in the future resulting in the need to impair carrying values. The primary factors that may affect estimates of future net cash flows are (i) commodity futures prices, (ii) increases or decreases in production and capital costs, (iii) future reserve volume adjustments, both positive and negative, to proved reserves and appropriate risk-adjusted probable and possible reserves, (iv) results of future drilling activities and (v) prevailing market rates of income and expenses from integrated assets. If the oil and natural gas prices used in this analysis would have been approximately 10 percent lower as of December 31, 2016 with no other changes in capital costs, operating costs, price differentials, or reserve volumes, no impairment would be indicated. General and administrative expenses. The following table provides components of our general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015: Years Ended December 31, 2016 2015 Per Per (in thousands, except per unit amounts) Amount Boe Amount Boe General and administrative expenses $ 183,500 $ 3.33 $ 186,880 $ 3.58 Less: Operating fee reimbursements (16,862) (0.31) (19,219) (0.37) Non-cash stock-based compensation 58,927 1.07 63,073 1.21 Total general and administrative expenses $ 225,565 $ 4.09 $ 230,734 $ 4.42 General and administrative expenses were approximately $225.6 million ($4.09 per Boe) for the year ended December 31, 2016 , a decrease of $5.1 million (2 percent) from $230.7 million ($4.42 per Boe) for 2015 . The decrease in non-cash stock-based compensation was primarily due to an increase in forfeiture estimates. The decrease in total general and administrative expenses per Boe was primarily due to the reduction in non-cash stock-based compensation costs noted above coupled with a slight increase in production period over period. We receive fees for the operation of jointly-owned oil and natural gas properties during the drilling and production phases and record such reimbursements as reductions of general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. We earned reimbursements of $16.9 million and $19.2 million during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease in reimbursements was primarily due to decreased drilling and completion activity during 2016 and a higher average working interest in our wells drilled in 2016 as compared to 2015, partially offset by increased reimbursements attributable to more wells operated in 2016 as compared to 2015. 57 Gain (loss) on derivatives. The following table sets forth the gain (loss) on derivatives for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015: Years Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2016 2015 Gain (loss) on derivatives: Oil derivatives $ (337,175) $ 675,303 Natural gas derivatives (31,509) 24,449 Total $ (368,684) $ 699,752 The following table represents our net cash receipts from derivatives for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015: Years Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2016 2015 Net cash receipts from derivatives: Oil derivatives $ 608,847 $ 597,297 Natural gas derivatives 16,403 35,619 Total $ 625,250 $ 632,916 Our earnings are affected by the changes in value of our derivatives portfolio between periods and the related cash settlements of those derivatives, which could be significant. To the extent the future commodity price outlook declines between measurement periods, we will have mark-to-market gains, while to the extent future commodity price outlook increases between measurement periods, we will have mark-to-market losses. See Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information regarding significant judgments made in classifying financial instruments in the fair value hierarchy. Gain (loss) on disposition of assets, net. During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we recognized a gain on disposition of assets of approximately $117.6 million and a loss on disposition of assets of approximately $53.8 million, respectively. In February 2016 , we sold certain assets in our Northern Delaware Basin core area for proceeds of approximately $292.0 million and recognized a pre-tax gain of approximately $110.1 million. In December 2015 , we completed an acreage exchange with Clayton Williams Energy, Inc. that consolidated acres into a concentrated, operated position in our Southern Delaware Basin core area. We recognized a loss on disposition of assets of approximately $50.0 million related to the acreage exchange. 58 Interest expense. The following table sets forth interest expense, weighted average interest rates and weighted average debt balances for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015: Years Ended December 31, (dollars in thousands) 2016 2015 Interest expense, as reported $ 203,518 $ 215,384 Capitalized interest 252 4,913 Interest expense, excluding impact of capitalized interest $ 203,770 $ 220,297 Weighted average interest rate - credit facility - 2.4% Weighted average interest rate - senior notes 5.9% 5.9% Total weighted average interest rate 5.9% 5.8% Weighted average credit facility balance $ - $ 195,225 Weighted average senior notes balance 3,181,667 3,350,000 Total weighted average debt balance $ 3,181,667 $ 3,545,225 The decrease in the weighted average debt balance for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to 2015 was due to the repayment of our credit facility using a portion of the proceeds from our October 2015 equity offering and, to a lesser extent, the early redemption of the $600 million outstanding principal amount of our 7.0% Notes. The decrease in interest expense was due to the overall decrease in the weighted average debt balance partially offset by a reduction in capitalized interest period over period. Loss on extinguishment of debt. We recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $56.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 . This amount includes (i) $19.5 million associated with the make-whole premium paid for the early extinguishment of the 6.5% Notes in December 2016, approximately $7.3 million of related unamortized deferred loan costs and approximately $1.9 million of additional interest on the 6.5% Notes through January 16, 2017, which was paid in December 2016; and (ii) $21.0 million associated with the make-whole premium paid for the early redemption of the 7.0% Notes in September 2016 and approximately $6.7 million of related unamortized deferred loan costs. Income tax provisions. We recorded an income tax benefit of $876.1 million and income tax expense of $31.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The shift in our income tax provision is primarily due to a significant pre-tax book loss in 2016 as compared to pre-tax book income in 2015. The effective income tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were 37.5 percent and 32.3 percent, respectively. We evaluate changes to our industry, production, market conditions and changes in our forecasted drilling plan by tax jurisdiction. Our material state tax jurisdictions include Texas and New Mexico. In October 2016, we purchased Texas-based assets in the Reliance Acquisition for approximately $1.7 billion, which caused a shift in our projected future apportionment from New Mexico to Texas, which has a lower statutory state tax rate than New Mexico. As such, we recognized an overall state deferred tax benefit of $20.9 million and $9.0 million for 2016 and 2015, respectively. 59 Year Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014 Oil and natural gas revenues. Revenue from oil and natural gas operations was $1,803.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, a decrease of $856.5 million (32 percent) from $2,660.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in realized oil and natural gas prices, offset partially by increased production due to our successful drilling efforts during 2014 and 2015. Specific factors affecting oil and natural gas revenues include the following: total oil production was 34,457 MBbl for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of 8,138 MBbl (31 percent) from 26,319 MBbl for the year ended December 31, 2014; average realized oil price (excluding the effects of derivative activities) was $44.69 per Bbl during the year ended December 31, 2015, a decrease of 46.3 percent from $83.17 per Bbl during the year ended December 31, 2014. For the year ended December 31, 2015, our crude oil price differential relative to NYMEX was $(4.15) per Bbl, or a realization of approximately 91.5 percent, as compared to a crude oil price differential relative to NYMEX of $(9.77) per Bbl, or a realization of approximately 89.5 percent, for 2014. The basis differential between the location of Midland, Texas and Cushing, Oklahoma (NYMEX pricing location) for our oil has a direct effect on our realized oil price. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the market basis differential between WTI-Midland and WTI-Cushing (sweet barrel) was a price reduction of $0.41 per Bbl and $6.91 per Bbl, respectively; total natural gas production was 106,987 MMcf for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of 19,651 MMcf (23 percent) from 87,336 MMcf for the year ended December 31, 2014; and average realized natural gas price (excluding the effects of derivative activities) was $2.46 per Mcf during the year ended December 31, 2015, a decrease of 54.4 percent from $5.39 per Mcf during the year ended December 31, 2014. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we realized approximately 93.5 percent and 126.2 percent, respectively, of the average NYMEX natural gas prices for the respective periods. Our total natural gas revenues are derived from the value of the natural gas liquids, with the remaining portion coming from the value of the dry natural gas residue. In the past, our liquids-rich natural gas stream and the related value of the natural gas liquids being included in our natural gas revenues resulted in our realized natural gas price (excluding the effects of derivatives) being greater than the related NYMEX natural gas price. However, during the year ended December 31, 2015, our realized natural gas price (excluding the effects of derivatives) fell below the related NYMEX natural gas price primarily due to the average Mont Belvieu price for a blended barrel of natural gas liquids decreasing to $17.80 per Bbl, as compared to $34.58 per Bbl during the year ended December 31, 2014. During the fourth quarter of 2015, winter weather events across southeast New Mexico had an impact on our production and drilling operations. We experienced power outages, heavy icing and facility freeze-ups across our New Mexico Shelf and Northern Delaware Basin core areas. We estimate that these weather events negatively impacted production for the quarter ended December 31, 2015 by approximately 4.6 MBoepd. Our operations were back to pre-weather levels during mid-January 2016. Additionally, a third-party natural gas processing plant located in the Northern Delaware Basin became inoperable following an explosion in early December 2015. We estimate that this event negatively impacted production for the quarter ended December 31, 2015 by approximately 1.5 MBoepd. We do not expect the plant to be back to full capacity until sometime during the second quarter of 2016. Heavy rainfall and flooding during the latter part of September 2014 disrupted our operations, primarily in southeast New Mexico, causing shut-in production, road closures and drilling and completion delays. We estimate this weather-related downtime negatively impacted production for the quarter ended December 31, 2014 by approximately 1.6 MBoepd. We estimate that during the quarter ended December 31, 2014 approximately $1.7 million of repairs was due to this event. 60 Production expenses. The following table provides the components of our total oil and natural gas production costs for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014: Years Ended December 31, 2015 2014 Per Per (in thousands, except per unit amounts) Amount Boe Amount Boe Lease operating expenses $ 362,114 $ 6.93 $ 310,284 $ 7.59 Workover costs 27,590 0.53 18,967 0.46 Taxes: Ad valorem 22,921 0.44 20,775 0.51 Production 128,734 2.46 188,348 4.61 Total oil and natural gas production expenses $ 541,359 $ 10.36 $ 538,374 $ 13.17 Among the cost components of production expenses, we have some control over lease operating expenses and workover costs on properties we operate, but production and ad valorem taxes are related to commodity prices. Lease operating expenses were $362.1 million ($6.93 per Boe) for the year ended December 31, 2015, which was an increase of $51.8 million (17 percent) from $310.3 million ($7.59 per Boe) for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in lease operating expenses was primarily due to increased production associated with our wells successfully drilled and completed in 2014 and 2015. The decrease in lease operating expenses per Boe was primarily due to increased production efficiencies resulting in higher volume wells successfully drilled and completed during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. Workover expenses were approximately $27.6 million and $19.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The increase was primarily related to a higher volume of workovers performed on electrical submersible pumps in the Northern Delaware Basin area where they were utilized more in 2015 as compared to 2014. Production taxes per unit of production were $2.46 per Boe during the year ended December 31, 2015, a decrease of 47 percent from $4.61 per Boe during the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease was directly related to the decrease in oil and natural gas prices. Over the same period, our average realized prices per Boe (excluding the effects of derivatives) decreased 47 percent. Exploration and abandonments expense. The following table provides a breakdown of our exploration and abandonments expense for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014: Years Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2015 2014 Geological and geophysical $ 9,694 $ 19,268 Exploratory dry hole costs 9,205 44,180 Leasehold abandonments 34,532 217,326 Other 5,416 4,047 Total exploration and abandonments $ 58,847 $ 284,821 Our geological and geophysical expense for the periods presented above primarily consists of the costs of acquiring and processing geophysical data and core analysis. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we acquired geological and geophysical data related to our Northern Delaware Basin acreage. Our exploratory dry hole costs during the year ended December 31, 2015 were primarily related to (i) an uneconomic well in our Northern Delaware Basin area that was attempting to establish production in an unconventional zone for the area and (ii) expensing an unsuccessful well, which we did not operate, that was located in our New Mexico Shelf area. 61 During the year ended December 31, 2015, we recognized leasehold abandonment expense of approximately $34.5 million primarily related to expired and abandoned acreage in our Northern Delaware Basin area where we currently have no intent to drill. During the fourth quarter of 2014, we completed our assessment of our activity in the outer limits of our Southern Delaware Basin acreage position. Based on our analysis and marginal results of our exploratory wells on this acreage, we have no further plans to invest in this position. Accordingly, we recognized approximately $32.7 million in exploratory dry hole costs and approximately $96.4 million in leasehold abandonments in 2014. In addition to the $32.7 million in exploratory dry holes, we recognized approximately $6.3 million in dry hole costs related to two unsuccessful wells in our New Mexico Shelf area that encountered mechanical issues during drilling and one Northern Delaware Basin well targeting the Brushy Canyon horizon that was testing the outer limits of our acreage. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we recognized leasehold abandonment expense of approximately $217.3 million primarily related to (i) the Northern Delaware Basin abandonment discussed above and (ii) an $86.0 million charge related to properties in our Midland Basin core area that, based on our historical results and our estimate of reduced future commodity price, we have no future intent to drill based on expected low rates of return. The remaining abandonment charges during 2014 are associated with expiring acreage and acreage determined to be outside of our economically productive reservoirs. Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense. The following table provides components of our depreciation, depletion and amortization expense for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014: Years Ended December 31, 2015 2014 Per Per (in thousands, except per unit amounts) Amount Boe Amount Boe Depletion of proved oil and natural gas properties $ 1,203,469 $ 23.02 $ 960,931 $ 23.51 Depreciation of other property and equipment 18,323 0.35 17,348 0.42 Amortization of intangible asset - operating rights 1,461 0.03 1,461 0.04 Total depletion, depreciation and amortization $ 1,223,253 $ 23.40 $ 979,740 $ 23.97 Oil price used to estimate proved oil reserves at period end $ 46.79 $ 91.48 Natural gas price used to estimate proved natural gas reserves at period end $ 2.59 $ 4.35 Depletion of proved oil and natural gas properties was $1,203.5 million ($23.02 per Boe) for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $242.6 million (25 percent) from $960.9 million ($23.51 per Boe) for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in depletion expense was primarily due to increased production associated with new wells that were successfully drilled and completed in 2014 and 2015. The decrease in depletion expense per Boe period over period was primarily due to a reduction in the net book value of our oil and natural gas properties due to non-cash impairment charges of approximately $431.7 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2014 and increased reserves supported by (i) one or more reliable technologies and (ii) our successful exploratory drilling program, partially offset by decreased proved reserves primarily as a result of lower commodity prices. The increase in depreciation expense was primarily associated with additional other property and equipment related to buildings and other items. Impairments of long-lived assets. We periodically review our long-lived assets to be held and used, including proved oil and natural gas properties and their integrated assets, whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable, for instance when there are declines in commodity prices or well performance. We review our oil and natural gas properties by depletion base or by individual well for those wells not constituting part of a depletion base. An impairment loss is indicated if the sum of the expected undiscounted future net cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the assets. If the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows are less than the carrying amount of our assets, we recognize an impairment loss for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset. 62 We calculate the expected undiscounted future net cash flows of our long-lived assets and their integrated assets using management assumptions and expectations of (i) commodity prices, which are based on the NYMEX strip, (ii) pricing adjustments for differentials, (iii) production costs, (iv) capital expenditures, (v) production volumes, (vi) proved reserves and risk-adjusted probable and possible reserves, and (vii) other sources of income and expenses from integrated assets. We calculate the estimated fair values of our long-lived assets and their integrated assets using a discounted future cash flow model. Fair value assumptions associated with the calculation of discounted future net cash flows include (i) market estimates of commodity prices, (ii) pricing adjustments for differentials, (iii) production costs, (iv) capital expenditures, (v) production volumes, (vi) estimated proved reserves and risk-adjusted probable and possible reserves, (vii) prevailing market rates of income and expenses from integrated assets and (viii) discount rate. We discount the future net cash flows using a market-based weighted average cost of capital rate determined appropriate at the time. As a result of the carrying amount of certain of our long-lived assets and their integrated assets being less than their expected undiscounted future net cash flows, we recognized a non-cash charge against earnings for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeded the estimated fair value of the assets. For the year ended December 31, 2015, this amount was approximately $60.5 million and was primarily attributable to properties in our eastern Midland Basin area. As a result of the carrying amount of certain of our long-lived assets being less than their expected undiscounted future net cash flows, we recognized a non-cash charge against earnings of $447.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2014, which was primarily attributable to (i) non-core properties in our Northern Delaware Basin area, (ii) properties producing from the Grayburg San Andres reservoir in our New Mexico Shelf area and (iii) properties producing from the Canyon and Wolfcamp reservoirs primarily in Irion and Glasscock counties in our Midland Basin core area. General and administrative expenses. The following table provides components of our general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014: Years Ended December 31, 2015 2014 Per Per (in thousands, except per unit amounts) Amount Boe Amount Boe General and administrative expenses $ 186,880 $ 3.58 $ 175,934 $ 4.30 Less: Operating fee reimbursements (19,219) (0.37) (18,903) (0.46) Non-cash stock-based compensation 63,073 1.21 47,130 1.15 Total general and administrative expenses $ 230,734 $ 4.42 $ 204,161 $ 4.99 General and administrative expenses were approximately $230.7 million ($4.42 per Boe) for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $26.5 million (13 percent) from $204.2 million ($4.99 per Boe) for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase in the number of employees and related personnel expenses. The increase in non-cash stock-based compensation was primarily due to performance units granted during January 2015. Due to lower commodity prices and a reduction in activity, we began to slow our hiring rate during 2015. The decrease in total general and administrative expenses per Boe was primarily due to increased production from our wells successfully drilled and completed in 2014 and 2015, partially offset by an increase in the number of employees and related personnel expenses in order to manage our activities. We receive fees for the operation of jointly-owned oil and natural gas properties during the drilling and production phases and record such reimbursements as reductions of general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. We earned reimbursements of $19.2 million and $18.9 million during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. 63 Gain (loss) on derivatives. The following table sets forth the gain on derivatives for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014: Years Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2015 2014 Gain on derivatives: Oil derivatives $ 675,303 $ 869,421 Natural gas derivatives 24,449 21,496 Total $ 699,752 $ 890,917 The following table represents our net cash receipts from (payments on) derivatives for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014: Years Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2015 2014 Net cash receipts from (payments on) derivatives: Oil derivatives $ 597,297 $ 76,335 Natural gas derivatives 35,619 (4,352) Total $ 632,916 $ 71,983 Our earnings are affected by the changes in value of our derivatives portfolio between periods and the related cash settlements of those derivatives, which could be significant. To the extent the future commodity price outlook declines between measurement periods, we will have mark-to-market gains, while to the extent future commodity price outlook increases between measurement periods, we will have mark-to-market losses. See Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information regarding significant judgments made in classifying financial instruments in the fair value hierarchy. Gain (loss) on disposition of assets, net. In December 2015, we completed an acreage exchange with Clayton Williams Energy, Inc. that consolidated acres into a concentrated, operated position in our Southern Delaware Basin core area. We recognized a loss on disposition of assets of approximately $50.0 million related to the acreage exchange. 64 Interest expense. The following table sets forth interest expense, weighted average interest rates and weighted average debt balances for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014: Years Ended December 31, (dollars in thousands) 2015 2014 Interest expense $ 215,384 $ 216,661 Capitalized interest 4,913 2,282 Interest expense, excluding impact of capitalized interest $ 220,297 $ 218,943 Weighted average interest rate - credit facility 2.4% 2.4% Weighted average interest rate - senior notes 5.9% 5.9% Total weighted average interest rate 5.8% 5.8% Weighted average credit facility balance $ 195,225 $ 144,966 Weighted average senior notes balance 3,350,000 3,350,000 Total weighted average debt balance $ 3,545,225 $ 3,494,966 The increase in the weighted average debt balance during the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the corresponding period in 2014 was due to 2015 capital expenditures in excess of our cash flows, primarily related to our drilling program and acquisitions, offset in part by cash received from our March 2015 and October 2015 equity offerings. Loss on extinguishment of debt. In May 2014, we amended and restated our credit facility. We recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $4.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, representing the proportional amount of unamortized deferred loan costs associated with banks with lesser commitments in the amended credit facility syndicate. Income tax provisions. We recorded income tax expense of $31.4 million and $317.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The effective income tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were 32.3 percent and 37.1 percent, respectively. We evaluate changes to our industry, production, market conditions and changes in our forecasted drilling plan by tax jurisdiction. As such, we recognized an overall deferred tax benefit of $9.0 million and $7.9 million for 2015 and 2014, respectively. This deferred tax benefit recorded in 2015, was the primary driver for our lower effective tax rate as compared to 2014. 65 Capital Commitments, Capital Resources and Liquidity Capital commitments. Our primary needs for cash are development, exploration and acquisition of oil and natural gas assets, payment of contractual obligations and working capital obligations. Funding for these cash needs may be provided by any combination of internally-generated cash flow, financing under our credit facility, proceeds from the disposition of assets or alternative financing sources, as discussed in Capital resources below. Oil and natural gas properties. Our costs incurred on oil and natural gas properties, excluding acquisitions and asset retirement obligations, during the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 totaled $1.1 billion, $1.8 billion and $2.5 billion, respectively. The decrease is primarily related to our intent to adjust our capital spending to be within our cash flow, excluding unbudgeted acquisitions. The primary reason for the differences in the costs incurred and cash flow expenditures was our issuance of approximately 2.2 million shares of common stock related to our March 2016 acquisition, our issuance of approximately 3.9 million shares of common stock related to our Reliance Acquisition and timing of payments. The 2016 expenditures were primarily funded in part from (i) cash flows from operations, (ii) proceeds from our February 2016 divestiture, (iii) our issuance of approximately 2.2 million shares of common stock related to our March 2016 acquisition, (iv) proceeds from our August 2016 equity offering and (v) our issuance of approximately 3.9 million shares of common stock related to our Reliance Acquisition . 2017 capital budget . In February 2017, we announced our updated 2017 capital budget, excluding acquisitions, of approximately $1.8 billion with expected capital spending to range between $1.6 billion and $1.8 billion. Approximately 90 percent of capital will be directed to drilling and completion activity. Our 2017 capital program is expected to continue focusing on extended length lateral drilling. Our 2017 capital budget, based on our current expectations of commodity prices and costs, is expected to be within our cash flows. However, if we were to outspend our cash flows, we believe we could use our (i) cash on hand, (ii) credit facility and (iii) other financing sources to fund any cash flow deficits. The actual amount and timing of our expenditures may differ materially from our estimates as a result of, among other things, actual drilling results, the timing of expenditures by third parties on projects that we do not operate, the costs of drilling rigs and other services and equipment, regulatory, technological and competitive developments, commodity prices, leverage metrics and industry conditions. In addition, under certain circumstances, we may consider increasing, decreasing or reallocating our capital spending plans. Other than the customary purchase of leasehold acreage, our capital budgets are exclusive of acquisitions. We do not have a specific acquisition budget, since the timing and size of acquisitions are difficult to forecast. We evaluate opportunities to purchase or sell oil and natural gas properties in the marketplace and could participate as a buyer or seller of properties at various times. We seek to acquire oil and natural gas properties that provide opportunities for the addition of reserves and production through a combination of development, high-potential exploration and control of operations that will allow us to apply our operating expertise. Acquisitions. The following table reflects o ur expenditures for acquisitions of proved and unproved properties for the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014: Years Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2016 2015 2014 Property acquisition costs: Proved $ 981,855 $ 57,190 $ 99,362 Unproved 1,154,423 206,214 292,363 Total property acquisition costs (a) $ 2,136,278 $ 263,404 $ 391,725 (a) Included in the property acquisition costs above are budgeted unproved leasehold acreage acquisitions of $30.4 million, $69.1 million and $89.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2016, our unbudgeted acquisitions are primarily comprised of approximately $2.1 billion of property acquisition costs related to our March and October 2016 acquisitions. 66 Contractual obligations.

(g) We lease vehicles, equipment and office facilities under non-cancellable operating leases. ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ 67 Off-balance sheet arrangements. Currently, we do not have any material off-balance sheet arrangements. Capital resources. Our primary sources of liquidity have been cash flows generated from (i) operating activities , (ii) borrowings under our credit facility and (iii) proceeds from bond and equity offerings. In February 2017, we announced our updated 2017 capital budget, excluding acquisitions, of approximately $1.8 billion with expected capital spending to range between $1.6 billion and $1.8 billion. Approximately 90 percent of capital will be directed to drilling and completion activity. Our 2017 capital program is expected to continue focusing on extended length lateral drilling. Our 2017 capital budget, based on our current expectations of commodity prices and costs, is expected to be within our cash flows. However, if we were to outspend our cash flows, we believe we could use our (i) cash on hand, (ii) credit facility and (iii) other financing sources to fund any cash flow deficits. The actual amount and timing of our expenditures may differ materially from our estimates as a result of, among other things, actual drilling results, the timing of expenditures by third parties on projects that we do not operate, the costs of drilling rigs and other services and equipment, regulatory, technological and competitive developments, commodity prices, leverage metrics and industry conditions. In addition, under certain circumstances, we may consider increasing, decreasing or reallocating our capital spending plans. The following table summarizes our net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014: Years Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2016 2015 2014 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,384,448 $ 1,530,421 $ 1,745,770 Net cash used in investing activities (2,224,656) (2,602,641) (2,617,979) Net cash provided by financing activities 664,919 1,300,749 872,209 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ (175,289) $ 228,529 $ - Cash flow from operating activities. The decrease in operating cash flows during the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to 2015 was primarily due to (i) a decrease in oil and natural gas revenues of approximately $168.6 million and (ii) approximately $95.2 million of negative variances in operating assets and liabilities, partially offset by (i) approximately $90.1 million decrease in cash production expense, (ii) an increase in operating cash flow of approximately $13.4 million due to a cash tax benefit of approximately $11.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to cash tax expense of approximately $1.7 million during 2015 and (iii) a decrease in cash interest expense of approximately $11.8 million. The decrease in operating cash flows during the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily due to (i) a decrease in oil and natural gas revenues of approximately $856.6 million and (ii) a cash increase in general and administrative expense of approximately $10.6 million, offset in part by (i) approximately $632.9 million of receipts from derivatives during 2015 compared to receipts of approximately $72.0 million during 2014, (ii) approximately $78.6 million of positive variances in operating assets and liabilities and (iii) a decrease in cash tax expense of approximately $19.9 million. Our net cash provided by operating activities included a reduction of approximately $60.1 million, a benefit of approximately $35.1 million and a reduction of approximately $43.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 , respectively, associated with changes in operating assets and liabilities. Changes in operating assets and liabilities adjust for the timing of receipts and payments of actual cash. Cash flow used in investing activities. During the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we invested approximately $2.4 billion, $2.4 billion and $2.6 billion, respectively, for capital expenditures on oil and natural gas properties and acquisitions. The primary reason for the differences in the costs incurred and cash flow expenditures is the timing of payments. The 2016 expenditures were funded in part from (i) proceeds from our February 2016 divestiture, (ii) our issuance of approximately 2.2 million shares of common stock related to our March 2016 acquisition, (iii) proceeds from our August 2016 equity offering and (iv) our issuance of approximately 3.9 million shares of common stock related to our Reliance Acquisition. The 2015 and 2014 expenditures were funded in part from borrowings under our credit facility and our equity offerings in 2014 and 2015. 68 Cash flows used in investing activities decreased during the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to 2015, primarily due to (i) proceeds from the disposition of assets of approximately $332.0 million during 2016, (ii) a decrease of approximately $46.5 million in amounts invested in oil and natural gas properties from 2015 to 2016, (iii) contributions to our equity method investments of approximately $55.8 million during 2016 compared to contributions of approximately $91.3 million during 2015 and (iv) approximately $60.7 million invested in other property and equipment during 2016 compared to approximately $67.7 million in 2015, partially offset by a 2016 cash outflow for funds held in escrow of $43.0 million related to our January 2017 asset acquisition. Cash flows used in investing activities decreased during the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014, primarily due to a decrease of approximately $111.2 million in amounts invested in oil and natural gas properties from 2014 to 2015, partially offset by (i) contributions to our equity method investments of approximately $91.3 million during 2015 compared to contributions of approximately $30.1 million during 2014 and (ii) approximately $67.7 million invested in other property and equipment during 2015 compared to approximately $34.3 million in 2014. Cash flow from financing activities. Below is a description of our financing activities. During 2016, 2015 and 2014 we completed the following significant capital markets activities: In December 2016, we issued $600 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.375% senior notes due 2025 at par, for which we received net proceeds of approximately $592.1 million. We used the net proceeds from the offering to fund the satisfaction and discharge of our obligations under the indenture of the $600 million outstanding principal amount of our 6.5% Notes at a price equal to 103.25 percent of par. The early extinguishment price included the make-whole premium of $19.5 million. In September 2016, we redeemed the $600 million outstanding principal amount of our 7.0% Notes at a price equal to 103.5 percent of par. The redemption price included the make-whole premium for the early redemption of $21.0 million. In August 2016, we issued approximately 10.4 million shares of our common stock in a public offering at $130.90 per share and received net proceeds of approximately $1.3 billion. We used a portion of the net proceeds to finance part of the cash portion of the purchase price for the Reliance Acquisition and to fund part of the early redemption of the 7.0% Notes, and the remainder for general corporate purposes. In October 2015, we issued approximately 8.9 million shares of our common stock in a public offering at $92.50 per share and received net proceeds of approximately $794.2 million. We used a portion of the net proceeds from this offering to repay all outstanding borrowings under our credit facility and used the remainder for general corporate purposes and for funding of our 2016 acquisitions. In March 2015, we issued 6.9 million shares of our common stock in a public offering at $107.49 per share and received net proceeds of approximately $741.5 million. We used a portion of the net proceeds from this offering to repay all outstanding borrowings under our credit facility and the remainder for general corporate purposes. In May 2014, we issued approximately 7.5 million shares of our common stock in a public offering at $129.00 per share and received net proceeds of approximately $932.0 million. We used a portion of the net proceeds from this offering to repay all outstanding borrowings under our credit facility and used the remainder for general corporate purposes, including funding our drilling program and capital commitments associated with the midstream joint venture. At December 31, 2016, we had unused commitments on our credit facility of $2.5 billion . The maturity date of the credit facility is May 9, 2019. Advances on our credit facility bear interest, at our option, based on (i) the prime rate of JPMorgan Chase Bank ( JPM Prime Rate ) (3.75 percent at December 31, 2016 ) or (ii) a Eurodollar rate (substantially equal to the LIBOR). The credit facility interest rates of Eurodollar rate advances and JPM Prime Rate advances varied, with interest margins ranging from 125 to 225 basis points and 25 to 125 basis points, respectively, per annum depending on the debt balance outstanding on our credit facility. Under our current credit facility, we pay commitment fees on the unused portion of the available commitment ranging from 30 to 37.5 basis points per annum, depending on utilization of the borrowing base. 69 In conducting our business, we may utilize various financing sources, including the issuance of (i) fixed and floating rate debt, (ii) convertible securities, (iii) preferred stock, (iv) common stock and (v) other securities. Over the last three years, we have demonstrated our use of capital markets by issuing senior unsecured debt and common stock. There are no assurances that we can access capital markets in the future to obtain additional funding, if needed, and at what cost and terms. We may also sell assets and issue securities in exchange for oil and natural gas assets or interests in oil and natural gas companies. Additional securities may be of a class senior to common stock with respect to such matters as dividends and liquidation rights and may also have other rights and preferences as determined from time-to-time by our board of directors. Utilization of some of these financing sources may require approval from the lenders under our credit facility. Liquidity. Our principal sources of liquidity are cash on hand and available borrowing capacity under our credit facility. At December 31, 2016, we had approximately $53.3 million of cash on hand. Subsequent to December 31, 2016, our cash position will be increased by our disposition of ACC for approximately $802.8 million and reduced by our Northern Delaware Basin acquisition for approximately $107.0 million, resulting in a net increase of $695.8 million. At December 31, 2016 , our commitments from our bank group were $2.5 billion. We expect we will maintain our $2.5 billion in commitments until our next scheduled redetermination in May 2017. At December 31, 2016 , our borrowing base was $2.8 billion. There is no assurance that our borrowing base will not be reduced, which could affect our liquidity. Upon a subsequent redetermination, our borrowing base could be substantially reduced. We may from time to time seek to retire or purchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases and/or exchanges for other debt or equity securities, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material. Debt ratings . We receive debt credit ratings from S&P Global Ratings ( S&P ) and Moody Investors Service, Inc. ( Moody ), which are subject to regular reviews. S&P corporate rating for us is BB+ with a positive outlook. Moody corporate rating for us is Ba1 with a stable outlook. S&P and Moody consider many factors in determining our ratings including: the industry in which we operate, production growth opportunities, liquidity, debt levels and asset and reserve mix. A reduction in our debt ratings could negatively affect our ability to obtain additional financing or the interest rate, fees and other terms associated with such additional financing. A downgrade in our credit ratings could negatively impact our costs of capital and our ability to effectively execute aspects of our strategy. Further, a downgrade in our credit ratings could affect our ability to raise debt in the public debt markets, and the cost of any new debt could be much higher than our outstanding debt. These and other impacts of a downgrade in our credit ratings could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. As of the filing of this Annual Report, no changes in our credit ratings have occurred since December 31, 2016 ; however, we cannot be assured that our credit ratings will not be downgraded in the future. Book capitalization and current ratio . Our net book capitalization at December 31, 2016 was $10.2 billion, consisting of $ 0.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents, debt of $ 2.7 b illion and stockholders equity of $ 7.6 billion. Our net book capitalization at December 31, 2015 was $10.0 billion, consisting of $ 0.2 billion of cash and cash equivalents, debt of $ 3.3 b illion and stockholders equity of $ 6.9 billion. Our ratio of net debt to net book capitalization was 26 percent and 31 percent at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 0.73 to 1.0 at December 31, 2016 as compared to 2.20 to 1.0 at December 31, 2015. Inflation and changes in prices. Our revenues, the value of our assets, and our ability to obtain bank financing or additional capital on attractive terms have been and will continue to be affected by changes in commodity prices and the costs to produce our reserves. Commodity prices are subject to significant fluctuations that we are unable to control or predict. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we received an average of $39.90 per barrel of oil and $2.23 per Mcf of natural gas before consideration of commodity derivative contracts compared to $44.69 and $83.17 per barrel of oil and $2.46 and $5.39 per Mcf of natural gas in the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Although certain of our costs are affected by general inflation, inflation does not normally have a significant effect on our business. 70 Critical Accounting Policies and Practices Our historical consolidated financial statements and related notes to consolidated financial statements contain information that is pertinent to our management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations. Preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires that our management make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. However, the accounting principles used by us generally do not change our reported cash flows or liquidity. Interpretation of the existing rules must be done and judgments made on how the specifics of a given rule apply to us. In management opinion, the more significant reporting areas impacted by management judgments and estimates are the choice of accounting method for oil and natural gas activities, oil and natural gas reserve estimation, asset retirement obligations, impairment of long-lived assets, valuation of stock-based compensation, valuation of business combinations, valuation of financial derivative instruments and income taxes. Management judgments and estimates in these areas are based on information available from both internal and external sources, including engineers, geologists and historical experience in similar matters. Actual results could differ from the estimates as additional information becomes known. Successful Efforts Method of Accounting We utilize the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and natural gas exploration and development activities. Under this method, exploration expenses, including geological and geophysical costs, lease rentals and exploratory dry holes, are charged against income as incurred. Costs of successful wells and related production equipment, undeveloped leases and developmental dry holes are capitalized. Exploratory drilling costs are initially capitalized, but are charged to expense if and when the well is determined not to have found proved reserves. Generally, a gain or loss is recognized when producing fields are sold. This accounting method may yield significantly different results than the full cost method of accounting. The application of the successful efforts method of accounting requires management judgment to determine the proper designation of wells as either developmental or exploratory, which will ultimately determine the proper accounting treatment of costs of dry holes. Once a well is drilled, the determination that proved reserves have been discovered may take considerable time, and requires both judgment and application of industry experience. The evaluation of oil and natural gas leasehold acquisition costs included in unproved properties requires management judgment to estimate the fair value of such properties. Drilling activities in an area by other companies may also effectively condemn our leasehold positions. Non-producing properties consist of undeveloped leasehold costs and costs associated with the purchase of certain proved undeveloped reserves. Individually significant non-producing properties or projects are periodically assessed for impairment of value by considering future drilling plans, the results of exploration activities, commodity price outlooks, planned future sales or expiration of all or a portion of such projects. Depletion of capitalized drilling and development costs of oil and natural gas properties is computed using the unit-of-production method on total estimated proved developed oil and natural gas reserves. Depletion of producing leaseholds is based on the unit-of-production method using our total estimated proved reserves. In arriving at rates under the unit-of-production method, the quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas are established based on estimates made by our geologists and engineers and independent engineers. Service properties, equipment and other assets are depreciated using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives of two to 39 years. Upon sale or retirement of depreciable or depletable property, the cost and related accumulated depreciation and depletion are eliminated from the accounts and the resulting gain or loss is recognized. 71 Oil and Natural Gas Reserves and Standardized Measure of Discounted Net Future Cash Flows This report presents estimates of our proved reserves as of December 31, 2016, which have been prepared and presented in accordance with SEC guidelines. The pricing that was used for estimates of our reserves as of December 31, 2016 was based on an unweighted average twelve month WTI posted price of $39.25 per Bbl for oil and a Henry Hub spot natural gas price of $2.48 per MMBtu for natural gas. Our independent engineers and technical staff prepare the estimates of our oil and natural gas reserves and associated future net cash flows. Even though our independent engineers and technical staff are knowledgeable and follow authoritative guidelines for estimating reserves, they must make a number of subjective assumptions based on professional judgments in developing the reserve estimates. Reserve estimates are updated at least annually and consider recent production levels and other technical information about each field. Periodic revisions to the estimated reserves and future net cash flows may be necessary as a result of a number of factors, including reservoir performance, new drilling, oil and natural gas prices, cost changes, technological advances, new geological or geophysical data, or other economic factors. We cannot predict the amounts or timing of future reserve revisions. If such revisions are significant, they could significantly alter future depletion and result in impairment of long-lived assets that may be material. It should not be assumed that the Standardized Measure included in this report as of December 31, 2016 is the current market value of our estimated proved reserves. In accordance with SEC requirements, we based the 2016 Standardized Measure on a 12-month average of commodity prices on the first day of the month and prevailing costs on the date of the estimate. Actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs utilized in the estimate. See Item 1A. Risk Factors and Item 2. Properties for additional information regarding estimates of proved reserves. Our estimates of proved reserves materially impact depletion expense. If the estimates of proved reserves decline, the rate at which we record depletion expense will increase, reducing future earnings. Such a decline may result from lower commodity prices, which may make it uneconomical to drill for and produce higher cost fields. In addition, a decline in proved reserve estimates may impact the outcome of our assessment of our proved properties for impairment. Asset Retirement Obligations There are legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets that result from the acquisition, construction, development and the normal operation of a long-lived asset. The primary impact of this relates to oil and natural gas wells on which we have a legal obligation to plug and abandon. We record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred and, generally, a corresponding increase in the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. The determination of the fair value of the liability requires us to make numerous judgments and estimates, including judgments and estimates related to future costs to plug and abandon wells, future inflation rates and estimated lives of the related assets. When the judgments used to estimate the initial fair value of the asset retirement obligation change, an adjustment is recorded to both the obligation and the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets All of our long-lived assets are monitored for potential impairment when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may be greater than management estimates of its future net cash flows, including cash flows from proved reserves, risk-adjusted probable and possible reserves, and integrated assets. If the carrying value of the long-lived assets exceeds the sum of estimated undiscounted future net cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value of the assets. The evaluations involve a significant amount of judgment since the results are based on estimated future events, such as future sales prices for oil and natural gas, future costs to produce these products, estimates of future oil and natural gas reserves to be recovered and the timing thereof, the economic and regulatory climates, cash flows from integrated assets and other factors. The need to test an asset for impairment may result from significant declines in sales prices or downward revisions in estimated quantities of oil and natural gas reserves. Any assets held for sale are reviewed for impairment when we approve the plan to sell. Estimates of anticipated sales prices are highly judgmental and subject to material revision in future periods. Because of the uncertainty inherent in these factors, we cannot predict when or if future impairment charges will be recorded. At December 31, 2016, the Company estimates of commodity prices for purposes of determining undiscounted future cash flows, which are based on the NYMEX strip, ranged from a 2017 price of $56.19 per barrel of oil to a 2024 price of $57.41 per barrel of oil. Similarly, gas prices ranged from a 2017 price of $3.61 per Mcf of natural gas decreasing to a 2020 price of $2.88 per Mcf partially recovering to a 2024 price of $3.38 per Mcf of natural gas. Commodity prices for this purpose were held flat after 2024. 72 Valuation of Stock-Based Compensation In accordance with GAAP, we calculate the fair value of stock-based compensation using various valuation methods. The valuation methods require the use of estimates to derive the inputs necessary to determine fair value. We utilize (a) the Black-Scholes option pricing model to measure the fair value of stock options, (b) the average of the high and low stock price on the date of grant for the fair value of restricted stock awards and (c) the Monte Carlo simulation method for the fair value of performance unit awards. The significant assumptions used in these models include expected volatility, expected term, risk-free interest rate, forfeiture rate, and the probability of meeting performance targets. Each of these valuation methods were chosen as management believes they give the best estimate of fair value for the respective stock-based awards. See Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for information regarding our stock-based compensation. Valuation of Business Combinations In connection with a purchase business combination, the acquiring company must record assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on fair values as of the acquisition date. Deferred taxes must be recorded for any differences between the assigned values and tax bases of assets and liabilities. Any excess of purchase price over amounts assigned to assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. The amount of goodwill recorded in any particular business combination can vary significantly depending upon the value attributed to assets acquired and liabilities assumed. In estimating the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, we make various assumptions. The most significant assumptions related to the estimated fair values assigned to proved and unproved oil and natural gas properties and integrated assets. To estimate the fair values of these properties, we utilize estimates of oil and natural gas reserves. We make future price assumptions to apply to the estimated reserves quantities acquired and estimate future operating and development costs to arrive at estimates of future net cash flows. For estimated proved reserves, the future net cash flows were discounted using a market-based weighted average cost of capital rates determined appropriate at the time of the acquisition. The market-based weighted average cost of capital rates are subject to additional project-specific risking factors. To estimate the fair value of unproved, we apply risk-weighting factors of the future net cash flows of unproved reserves, or we may evaluate acreage values through recent market transactions in the area. Estimated fair values assigned to assets acquired can have a significant effect on results of operations in the future. A higher fair value assigned to a property results in a higher depletion expense, which results in lower net earnings. Fair values are based on estimates of future commodity prices, reserves quantities, operating expenses and development costs. This increases the likelihood of impairment if future commodity prices or reserves quantities are lower than those originally used to determine fair value or if future operating expenses or development costs are higher than those originally used to determine fair value. Impairment would have no effect on cash flows but would result in a decrease in net income for the period in which the impairment is recorded. Valuation of Nonmonetary Exchanges In connection with a nonmonetary exchange, we must record assets received based on the fair value of assets surrendered. Any resulting difference between the fair value of the assets surrendered and their carrying value is recorded as a gain or loss in the consolidated statement of operations. In estimating the fair values of assets surrendered, we make various assumptions. The most significant assumptions are related to the estimated fair values assigned to proved and unproved oil and natural gas properties, similar to our valuation of the fair value of oil and natural gas assets acquired a business combination. Estimated fair values assigned to assets exchanged can have a significant effect on results of operations. A lower fair value assigned to a property disposed may result in a higher loss, which affects net earnings. Fair values are based on estimates of future commodity prices, reserves quantities, operating expenses and development costs. This increases the likelihood of impairment if future commodity prices or reserves quantities are lower than those originally used to determine fair value or if future operating expenses or development costs are higher than those originally used to determine fair value. Impairment would have no effect on cash flows but would result in a decrease in net income for the period in which the impairment is recorded. Valuation of Financial Derivative Instruments 73 In order to reduce commodity price uncertainty and increase cash flow predictability relating to the marketing of our oil and natural gas, we enter into commodity price hedging arrangements with respect to a portion of our expected production. In addition, we have used derivative instruments in connection with acquisitions and certain price-sensitive projects. Management exercises significant judgment in determining the types of instruments to be used, production volumes to be hedged, prices at which to hedge and the counterparties creditworthiness. All derivative instruments are reflected at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets. Our open commodity derivative instruments were in a net liability position with a fair value of $174.4 million at December 31, 2016. In order to determine the fair value at the end of each reporting period, we compute discounted cash flows for the duration of each commodity derivative instrument using the terms of the related contract. Inputs consist of published forward commodity price curves as of the date of the estimate. We compare these prices to the price parameters contained in our hedge contracts to determine estimated future cash inflows or outflows. We then discount the cash inflows or outflows using a combination of published LIBOR rates and Eurodollar futures rates. The fair values of our commodity derivative assets and liabilities include a measure of credit risk based on average published yields by credit rating. In addition, for collars, we estimate the option value of the contract floors and ceilings using an option pricing model which takes into account market volatility, market prices and contract parameters. Changes in the fair values of our commodity derivative instruments have a significant impact on our net income because we follow mark-to-market accounting and recognize all gains and losses on such instruments in earnings in the period in which they occur. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we reported a $368.7 million loss on commodity derivative instruments. We compare our estimates of the fair values of our commodity derivative instruments with those provided by our counterparties. There have been no significant differences. Income Taxes Our provision for income taxes includes both federal and state taxes in jurisdictions in which we operate. We estimate our overall tax rate using a combination of the federal tax rate and a blend of enacted state tax rates. Acquisitions or dispositions of assets and changes in drilling plan by tax jurisdiction could change the apportionment of our state taxes, which would impact our overall tax rate. Our federal and state income tax returns are generally not prepared or filed before the consolidated financial statements are prepared; therefore, we estimate the tax basis of our assets and liabilities, which are based on numerous judgments and assumptions inherent in the determination of future taxable income, at the end of each period as well as the effects of tax rate changes and tax credits. Adjustments related to these estimates are recorded in our tax provision in the period in which we finalize our income tax returns. Material changes to our tax accruals may occur in the future based on audits, changes in legislation or resolution of pending matters. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which outlines a new, single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. This new revenue recognition model provides a five-step analysis in determining when and how revenue is recognized. The new model will require revenue recognition to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration a company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date, which deferred the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year. That new standard is now effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. We expect to use the modified retrospective method to adopt the standard, meaning the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard will be recognized in the most current period presented in the financial statements. We are substantially complete with our internal evaluation of the adoption of this standard and do not expect this new guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which supersedes current lease guidance. The new lease standard requires all leases with a term greater than one year to be recognized on the balance sheet while maintaining substantially similar classifications for finance and operating leases. Lease expense recognition on the income 74 statement will be effectively unchanged. This guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018 and early adoption is permitted. We do not plan to early adopt the standard. We enter into lease agreements to support our operations. These agreements are for leases on assets such as office space, vehicles, field services and well equipment and drilling rigs. We are currently in the process of reviewing all contracts that could be applicable to this new guidance. We believe this new guidance will have a moderate impact to our consolidated balance sheet due to the recognition of lease-related assets and liabilities that were not previously recognized. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation Stock Compensations (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-based Payment Accounting, which changes the accounting and presentation for share-based payment arrangements in the following areas: (i) recognition in the statement of operations of excess tax benefits and deficiencies; (ii) cash flow presentation of excess tax benefits and deficiencies; (iii) minimum statutory withholding thresholds and the classification on the cash flow statement of the withheld amounts; and (iv) an accounting policy election to recognize forfeitures as they occur. This guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and early adoption is permitted. We will adopt ASU No. 2016-09 during the first quarter of 2017. The adoption will not have a material impact on prior period consolidated financial statements. We will elect to account for forfeitures of share-based payments as they occur. As of December 31, 2016, we had not recorded compensation expense of approximately $8.2 million for our forfeiture estimate. We will prospectively classify excess tax benefits and deficiencies as operating activities on the consolidated statement of cash flows and will prospectively record as a discrete item in our income tax provision in the consolidated income statement. We will also recognize all excess tax benefits not previously realized, which totaled approximately $4.7 million as of December 31, 2016. Upon adoption, we will record a cumulative-effect adjustment, which will decrease retained earnings by approximately $0.5 million, increase additional paid-in capital by approximately $8.2 million, and decrease net deferred income taxes by approximately $7.7 million. In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which replaces the current incurred loss methodology for recognizing credit losses with an expected loss methodology. This new methodology requires that a financial asset measured at amortized cost be presented at the net amount expected to be collected. This standard is intended to provide more timely decision-useful information about the expected credit losses on financial instruments. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and early adoption is allowed as early as fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. We do not believe this new guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 75
