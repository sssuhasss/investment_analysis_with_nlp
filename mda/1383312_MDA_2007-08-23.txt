Our operations outsourcing solutions allow brokers of all sizes to outsource certain administrative functions relating to clearing and settlement to us, from order entry to trade matching and settlement, while maintaining their ability to finance and capitalize their business. -35- Table of Contents SEPARATION OF BROADRIDGE FROM ADP The spin-off of Broadridge by ADP became effective on March 30, 2007 through a distribution of 100% of the common stock of the Company to the holders of record of ADP common stock (the Distribution ). The Distribution was effected pursuant to a separation and distribution agreement by which ADP contributed to the Company the subsidiaries that operated its brokerage services business. ADP distributed all of the shares of Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. as a dividend on ADP common stock on March 30, 2007 to all shareholders of record as of March 23, 2007. In connection with the spin-off, we made a cash payment to ADP on March 30, 2007 of $690.0 million which was financed through borrowings under $1,190.0 million of credit facilities that were entered into on March 29, 2007. The payment is reflected as a dividend to ADP in Stockholders Equity. A significant portion of the expenses to effect the separation were incurred by ADP, such as investment banking fees, related outside legal and accounting fees, office move costs, costs to separate information systems and temporary consulting costs. Broadridge incurred separation costs that have a future benefit to the Company, including stock compensation expense relating to the Distribution and other items such as relocation expenses associated with hiring senior management positions new to the Company, and the temporary labor costs incurred to develop ongoing processes for operating on a stand-alone basis. FACTORS AFFECTING COMPARABILITY OF FINANCIAL RESULTS Historical ADP Cost Allocations Compared to Broadridge as a Stand-alone Entity Our historical Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial statements present the consolidated and combined financial position and results of operations of the former brokerage services business of ADP. The Combined Financial Statements for periods prior to the Distribution include allocated costs for facilities, functions and services used by the brokerage services business at shared ADP sites and costs for certain functions and services performed by centralized ADP organizations and directly charged to the brokerage services business based on usage. Our management believes these allocation methods are reasonable. However, it is likely that as a stand-alone entity, our costs for the same services will be higher, for the following reasons: Size and influence of ADP . We generally benefited from the size of ADP in negotiating many of our overhead costs and were able to leverage the ADP business as a whole, including the Employer Services business from which ADP derives a majority of its total revenues, in obtaining favorable pricing. ADP is a larger company than we are with extensive resources. As a stand-alone company, we no longer have this advantage. Shared corporate overhead . As the brokerage services business of ADP, our ultimate management was the management of ADP. Moreover, ADP performed all of the public company obligations, including: compensation of management and directors; corporate investor relations staff, office space and personnel; annual meetings of stockholders; board of directors and committee meetings; Exchange Act annual, quarterly and current report preparation and filing, including reports to stockholders; SEC and stock exchange corporate governance compliance, including Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 Section 404 internal control over financial reporting compliance; -36- Table of Contents stock exchange listing fees and transfer agent fees; and directors and officers insurance. As an independent public company, we will be responsible for these services and bear all of these expenses directly. The historical allocation of ADP expenses to us may be significantly less than the actual costs we will incur as an independent company. For the period from the date of Distribution to June 30, 2007, the Company incurred approximately $8.0 million in public company related expenses. ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES From time to time, we make acquisitions and divestitures for strategic reasons. In fiscal year 2005, we acquired the U.S. Clearing and BrokerDealer Services businesses of Bank of America Corporation for approximately $344.2 million, net of cash acquired. This acquisition resulted in the creation of our Clearing and Outsourcing Solutions segment which enables us to provide trade execution, clearing and settlement services, asset management, customer financing services, including margin lending, securities borrowing to facilitate customer short selling activity and operations outsourcing services for a variety of clearing and custody-related functions. BORROWINGS On March 29, 2007, the Company entered into a $1,190.0 million senior unsecured credit facility, consisting of a $440.0 million five-year term loan facility, a $500.0 million five-year revolving credit facility and a $250.0 million one-year revolving credit facility. On March 29, 2007, the Company borrowed $440.0 million under the five-year term loan facility and $250.0 million under the one-year revolving credit facility. The proceeds received in connection with the $690.0 million of borrowings were paid to ADP on March 30, 2007 as a dividend. These credit facilities are subject to covenants, including financial covenants consisting of a leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio. At June 30, 2007, the Company was in compliance with the financial covenants of this credit facility. On June 29, 2007, the Company repaid $70.0 million of the five-year term loan facility. The one-year revolving credit facility was cancelled upon repayment on May 29, 2007 with the net proceeds from the issuance of unsecured Senior Notes due June 2017 and cash. The Senior Notes are unsecured obligations of Broadridge and rank equally in right of payment with other unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of Broadridge. Please refer to Note 12 Borrowings to our Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements under Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a more detailed discussion. BASIS OF PRESENTATION The Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial statements present the consolidated and combined financial position and results of operation of the Company as a separate, stand-alone entity subsequent to the Distribution, presented along with the historical operations of the brokerage services business on a combined basis which were operated as part of ADP prior to the Distribution. These financial statements include the entities in which the Company directly or indirectly has a controlling financial interest and various entities in which the Company has investments recorded under the cost and equity methods of accounting. The Company combined results of operations, financial position and cash flows for periods prior to the Distribution, may not be indicative of its future performance and do not necessarily reflect what its results of operations, financial position and cash flows would have been had the Company operated as a separate, stand-alone entity during the periods presented, including changes in its operations and capitalization as a result of the separation from ADP. In particular, interest expense and corporate overhead costs will be higher than they were in the past. In addition, the Consolidated and Combined Statements of Earnings include a trademark royalty fee charged by ADP to the Company based on revenues for licensing fees associated with the use of the ADP trademark. As of March 30, 2007, such royalties are no longer charged to the Company. In presenting the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements, management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and related disclosures. Estimates, by their nature, are based on judgment and available information. Accordingly, actual results could differ from those estimates. In management opinion, the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements contain all normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of results reported. The results of operations reported for the periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for subsequent periods. -37- Table of Contents The Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for periods prior to the Distribution include costs for facilities, functions and services used by the Company at shared ADP sites and costs for certain functions and services performed by centralized ADP organizations and directly charged to the Company based on usage. Following the separation from ADP, the Company performs these functions using internal resources or purchased services, certain of which are provided by ADP during a transitional period pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement. See Note 18 to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements for a detailed description of the Company transactions with ADP subsequent to the Distribution. The expenses allocated to the Company for these services are not necessarily indicative of the expenses that would have been incurred if the Company had been a separate, independent entity and had otherwise managed these functions. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. We continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the financial statements. The estimates are based on historical experience and are believed to be reasonable. Actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates made by management. Certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below. Goodwill . We review the carrying value of all our goodwill in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board, ( FASB ) Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ( SFAS ) No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets , by comparing the carrying value of our reporting units to their fair values. We are required to perform this comparison at least annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate possible impairment. When determining fair value, we utilize a discounted future cash flow approach using various assumptions, including projections of revenues based on assumed long-term growth rates, estimated costs and appropriate discount rates based on the particular business weighted average cost of capital. The principal factors used in the discounted cash flow analysis requiring judgment are the projected future operating cash flows, the weighted average cost of capital and the terminal value growth rate assumptions. The weighted average cost of capital takes into account the relative weights of each component of our consolidated capital structure (equity and debt). Our estimates of long-term growth and costs are based on historical data, various internal estimates and a variety of external sources, and are developed as part of our routine, long-range planning process. Changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in goodwill impairments in future periods. We had $480.2 million of goodwill as of June 30, 2007. Given the significance of our goodwill, an adverse change to the fair value could result in an impairment charge, which could be material to our earnings. A 10% change in our estimates of projected future operating cash flows, discount rates or terminal value growth rates used in our calculations of the fair values of the reporting units would have no impact on the reported value of our goodwill. Income Taxes . We account for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, which establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes. The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity financial statements or tax returns. Judgment is required in addressing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns (e.g., realization of deferred tax assets, changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof). In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. A change in the assessment of the outcomes of such matters could materially impact our combined financial statements. As of June 30, 2007, we had estimated foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $25.4 million of which $4.6 million expires in years 2009 through 2014, and $20.8 million which has an indefinite utilization period. In addition, we have estimated U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards of a U.S. subsidiary which is not included in our consolidated tax return of approximately $0.5 million as of June 30, 2007 and U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $22.9 million which expire in 2023 through 2027. We have recorded valuation allowances of $21.9 million and $19.8 million at June 30, 2007 and 2006, respectively, because we do not believe that it is more likely than not that we will be able to utilize the deferred tax assets attributable to the net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards of certain subsidiaries to offset future taxable earnings. -38- Table of Contents Share-based Payments . SFAS No. 123R , Share-Based Payment, requires the measurement of stock-based compensation expense based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant. We determine the fair value of stock options issued by using a binomial option-pricing model. The binomial option-pricing model considers a range of assumptions related to volatility, dividend yield, risk-free interest rate and employee exercise behavior. Expected volatilities utilized in the binomial option-pricing model are based on a combination of implied market volatilities, historical volatility of our stock price and other factors. Similarly, the dividend yield is based on historical experience and expected future changes. The risk-free rate is derived from the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The binomial option-pricing model also incorporates exercise and forfeiture assumptions based on an analysis of historical data. The expected life of the stock option grants is derived from the output of the binomial model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. Determining these assumptions are subjective and complex, and therefore, a change in the assumptions utilized could impact the calculation of the fair value of our stock options. Prior to July 1, 2005, ADP, our former parent company, followed Accounting Principles Board Opinion 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees ( APB No. 25 ), and related interpretations. Under APB No. 25, stock-based compensation expense was not recognized related to our stock option program and employee stock purchase plan, as all options granted under the stock option program had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant and with respect to the employee stock purchase plan, the discount did not exceed fifteen percent. A hypothetical change of five percentage points applied to the volatility assumption used to determine the fair value of the fiscal year 2007 stock option grants would result in approximately a $0.4 million change in total pretax stock-based compensation expense for the fiscal year 2007 grants, which would be amortized over the five year graded vesting period. A hypothetical change of one year in the expected life assumption used to determine the fair value of the fiscal year 2007 stock option grants would result in approximately a $0.3 million change in the total pretax stock-based compensation expense for the fiscal year 2007 grants, which would be amortized over the five year graded vesting period. A hypothetical change of one percentage point in the forfeiture rate assumption used for the fiscal year 2007 stock option grants would result in approximately a $0.1 million change in the total pretax stock-based compensation expense for the fiscal year 2007 grants, which would be amortized over the five year graded vesting period. A hypothetical one-half percentage point change in the dividend yield assumption used to determine the fair value of the fiscal year 2007 stock option grants would result in approximately a $0.2 million change in the total pretax stock-based compensation expense for the fiscal year 2007 grants, which would be amortized over the five year graded vesting period. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussions of Analysis of Consolidated and Combined Operations and Analysis of Reportable Segments refers to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2007 compared to fiscal year ended 2006 and the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 compared to fiscal year ended 2005. The Analysis of Consolidated and Combined Operations should be read in conjunction with the Analysis of Reportable Segments, which provides more detailed discussions concerning certain components of the Consolidated and Combined Results of Operations. ANALYSIS OF CONSOLIDATED AND COMBINED OPERATIONS Fiscal 2007 Compared to Fiscal 2006 The table below presents consolidated and combined statement of operations data for the fiscal years ended June 30 and the dollar and percentage changes between periods: -39- Table of Contents Years Ended June 30, 2007 2006 Change ($) (%) (in millions, except for per share amounts) Net revenues $ 2,137.9 $ 1,933.3 $ 204.6 10.6 % Cost of net revenues 1,588.1 1,433.0 155.1 10.8 % Selling, general and administrative expenses 216.7 195.9 20.8 10.6 % Other expenses, net 12.3 1.7 10.6 NM * Total expenses 1,817.1 1,630.6 186.5 11.4 % Earnings from continuing operations before provision for income taxes 320.8 302.7 18.1 6.0 % Margin 15.0 % 15.7 % -0.7 pts Provision for income taxes 123.7 122.2 1.5 1.2 % Effective tax rate 38.6 % 40.4 % -1.8 pts Net earnings from continuing operations $ 197.1 $ 180.5 $ 16.6 9.2 % Basic and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations $ 1.42 $ 1.30 $ 0.12 9.2 % * Not Meaningful Total Net Revenues . Our consolidated and combined net revenues for fiscal year 2007 were $2,137.9 million, an increase of $204.6 million or 10.6%, compared to $1,933.3 million for fiscal year 2006. The increase reflects net revenue growth in our three business segments, primarily driven by internal growth and to a lesser degree by net new business. Investor Communication Solutions net revenues increased $154.2 million, or 11.1%, Securities Processing Solutions net revenues increased $20.9 million, or 4.4% and Clearing and Outsourcing Solutions net revenues increased $13.2 million, or 16.4%. The growth in our net revenues was also favorably impacted by $6.5 million due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Total Expenses . Our consolidated and combined total expenses for fiscal year 2007 were $1,817.1 million, an increase of $186.5 million, or 11.4%, compared to $1,630.6 million for fiscal year 2006. The increase in our consolidated and combined total expenses reflects higher revenue generating service activity, as well as incremental public company expenses of $ 8.0 million and one-time transition costs of $14.0 million. Cost of net revenues increased by $155.1 million, or 10.8%, for fiscal year 2007, due to higher net revenues in our three business segments and one-time transition costs of $4.0 million. The increase was primarily attributable to higher cost of net revenues in our Investor Communications Solutions of $125.6 million, or 11.7%, of which $80.6 million represents an increase in distribution costs, Securities Processing Solutions of $8.9 million and in Clearing and Outsourcing Solutions of $0.6 million. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $20.8 million, or 10.6%. The increase reflects expenses incurred for the period from the date of Distribution to June 30, 2007 for $ 8.0 million in incremental public company expenses and one-time transition costs of $10.0 million. Other expenses, net increased $10.6 million due to interest expense associated with our borrowings. Earnings from Continuing Operations before Provision for Income Taxes . Earnings from continuing operations before provision for income taxes for fiscal year 2007 were $320.8 million, an increase of $18.1 million, or 6.0 %, compared to $302.7 million for fiscal year 2006 and are attributable to higher net revenues and expenses, as discussed above. Overall margin decreased from 15.7% to 15.0% for fiscal year 2007 as compared to fiscal year 2006. Excluding one-time transition costs of $14.0 million, fiscal year margin were flat when compared to fiscal year 2006. Provision for Income Taxes . Our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2007 was 38.6%, compared to 40.4% for fiscal year 2006. The decrease in the effective tax rate is attributable to a favorable mix of income among tax jurisdictions, a lower effective U.S. state income tax rate and the impact of a decrease in the amount of operating losses for which there is no tax benefit for fiscal year 2007 compared to fiscal year 2006. Net Earnings from Continuing Operations and Basic and Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations . Net earnings for fiscal year 2007 were $197.1 million, an increase of $16.6 million, or 9.2%, compared -40- Table of Contents to $180.5 million for fiscal year 2006. The higher net earnings from continuing operations reflects increased net revenues, partially offset by increased expenses, and a lower effective tax rate, as described above. Basic and diluted EPS from continuing operations increased 9.2%, to $1.42 for fiscal year 2007. Fiscal Year 2006 Compared to Fiscal Year 2005 The table below presents combined statement of operations data for the fiscal years ended June 30, the dollar and percentage changes between periods: Years Ended June 30, 2006 2005 Change ($) (%) (in millions, except for per share amounts) Net revenues $ 1,933.3 $ 1,717.1 $ 216.2 12.6 % Cost of net revenues 1,433.0 1,273.2 159.8 12.6 % Selling, general and administrative expenses 195.9 168.5 27.4 16.3 % Other expenses, net 1.7 1.5 0.2 13.3 % Total expenses 1,630.6 1,443.2 187.4 13.0 % Earnings from continuing operations before provision for income taxes 302.7 273.9 28.8 10.5 % Margin 15.7 % 16.0 % -0.3 pts Provision for income taxes 122.2 107.5 14.7 13.7 % Effective tax rate 40.4 % 39.3 % 1.1 pts Net earnings from continuing operations $ 180.5 $ 166.4 $ 14.1 8.5 % Basic and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations $ 1.30 $ 1.20 $ 0.10 8.3 % Total Net Revenues . Our combined net revenues for fiscal year 2006 were $1,933.3 million, an increase of $216.2 million, or 12.6%, compared to $1,717.1 million in fiscal year 2005. The increase was due to higher net revenues in Investor Communication Solutions of $175.9 million, or 14.5%, an increase in Securities Processing Solutions of $14.8 million, or 3.2%, and an increase in Clearing and Outsourcing Solutions of $19.1 million, or 31.1%. Our net revenue growth was also favorably impacted by $9.1 million due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Total Expenses . Our combined total expenses for fiscal year 2006 were $1,630.6 million, an increase of $187.4 million, or 13.0%, compared to $1,443.2 million for fiscal year 2005. The increase in our combined total expenses was due to the inclusion of stock-based compensation expenses in our results of operations in fiscal year 2005 associated with the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) and increased cost of net revenues related to higher revenue-generating service activity. Total stock-based compensation expense included in continuing operations increased $22.4 million, to $24.6 million, in fiscal year 2006 from $2.2 million in fiscal year 2005 due to the recording of expenses for our stock option program and employee stock purchase plan. Cost of net revenues for fiscal year 2006 increased by $159.8 million, or 12.6% due to increases in net revenues in our three business segments and higher stock-based compensation of $14.8 million. The increase in cost of net revenues was mostly attributable to higher Investor Communication Solutions cost of net revenues of $132.6 million, or 14.1%, of which $78.8 million represented distribution costs, an increase in the Securities Processing Solutions cost of net revenues of $9.2 million, or 3.3%, and the increase in the Clearing and Outsourcing Solutions cost of net revenues of $16.3 million, or 25.1%. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $27.4 million, or 16.3%, due to the increase in stock-based compensation expense of $7.6 million in fiscal year 2006, and higher compensation costs associated with our continued investment in our sales personnel to drive revenue growth. -41- Table of Contents Earnings from Continuing Operations before Provision for Income Taxes . Earnings from continuing operations before provision for income taxes for fiscal year 2006 were $302.7 million, an increase of $28.8 million, or 10.5%, compared to $273.9 million during fiscal year 2005 due to the higher net revenues, as discussed above. Overall margin decreased by 0.3 percentage points to 15.7%. Although we were able to leverage our expense levels with the increasing revenues and thereby improve margins on our services, these improved margins were offset by the increase in our stock compensation expenses of $22.4 million due to the recording of stock-based compensation expense associated with our stock option program and employee stock purchase plan during fiscal year 2006. Provision for Income Taxes . Our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2006 was 40.4%, as compared to 39.3% for fiscal year 2005. The increase in the effective tax rate was attributable to the expensing of non-deductible components of stock-based compensation programs and a favorable tax settlement for fiscal year 2005, partially offset by the impact of a decrease in the amount of operating losses for which no tax benefit is provided for fiscal year 2006 compared to fiscal year 2005. Net Earnings from Continuing Operation and Basic and Diluted Earnings per Share . Net earnings from continuing operations during fiscal year 2006 were $180.5 million, an increase of $14.1 million, or 8.5%, compared to $166.4 million during fiscal year 2005. The increase in net earnings from continuing operations was due to higher net revenues, partially offset by the additional expense associated with stock-based compensation and a higher effective tax rate, as described above. Basic and diluted EPS from continuing operations increased 8.3%, to $1.30 for fiscal year 2006. ANALYSIS OF REPORTABLE SEGMENTS Investor Communication Solutions, Securities Processing Solutions and Clearing and Outsourcing Solutions are the Company reportable segments. The primary components of Other are the elimination of inter-segment revenues and profits, certain unallocated expenses and interest expense. Foreign exchange differences are a reconciling item between the actual foreign exchange rates and fiscal year 2007 budgeted foreign exchange rates. Reportable segment net revenues and earnings from continuing operations before provision for income taxes for prior years have been adjusted to reflect updated fiscal year 2007 budgeted foreign exchange rates for fiscal years 2006 and 2005. This adjustment is eliminated in consolidation and as such represents a reconciling difference to net revenues and earnings from continuing operations before provision for income taxes. Certain corporate expenses, as well as certain centrally managed expenses, are allocated based upon budgeted amounts. Because the Company compensates the management of its various businesses on, among other factors, segment profit, the Company may elect to record certain segment related expense items of an unusual or non-recurring nature in consolidation rather than reflect such items in segment profit. Beginning in January 2007, the Company changed its methodology for charging the Clearing and Outsourcing Solutions segment for services provided by the Company other segments. The Clearing and Outsourcing Solutions segment is charged for services based on the other segments cost of providing such services. Prior to January 2007, the Clearing and Outsourcing Solutions segment was billed for these services on a mark-up basis with the other segments recording revenue for the amount of these billings. Processing and distributing proxy materials and annual reports to investors in equity securities and mutual funds comprises a large portion of our Investor Communication Solutions business. We process and distribute the greatest number of proxy materials and annual reports during our fourth fiscal quarter (the second quarter of the calendar year). The recurring periodic activity of this business is linked to significant filing deadlines imposed by law on public reporting companies and mutual funds. Historically this has caused our revenue, operating income, net income and cash flows from operating activities to be higher in our fourth fiscal quarter than in any other quarter. The seasonality of our revenue makes it difficult to estimate future operating results based on the results of any specific quarter and could affect an investor ability to compare our financial condition and results of operations on a quarter-by-quarter basis. -42- Table of Contents Net Revenues Years Ended June 30, Change 2007 vs. 2006 2006 vs. 2005 2007 2006 2005 $ % $ % (in millions) Investor Communication Solutions $ 1,545.4 $ 1,391.2 $ 1,215.3 $ 154.2 11.1 % $ 175.9 14.5 % Securities Processing Solutions 497.1 476.2 461.4 20.9 4.4 % 14.8 3.2 % Clearing and Outsourcing Solutions 93.8 80.6 61.5 13.2 16.4 % 19.1 31.1 % Other (7.0 ) (16.8 ) (14.1 ) 9.8 58.3 % (2.7 ) -19.1 % Reconciling item: Foreign exchange 8.6 2.1 (7.0 ) 6.5 NM * 9.1 ND ** Total net revenues $ 2,137.9 $ 1,933.3 $ 1,717.1 $ 204.6 10.6 % $ 216.2 12.6 % * Not Meaningful ** Not Determinable Earnings from Continuing Operations before Provision for Income Taxes Years Ended June 30, Change 2007 vs. 2006 2006 vs. 2005 2007 2006 2005 $ % $ % (in millions) Investor Communication Solutions $ 226.7 $ 204.9 $ 176.3 $ 21.8 10.6 % $ 28.6 16.2 % Securities Processing Solutions 139.7 129.7 128.8 10.0 7.7 % 0.9 0.7 % Clearing and Outsourcing Solutions (11.9 ) (25.0 ) (20.7 ) 13.1 52.4 % (4.3 ) -20.8 % Other (36.4 ) (8.0 ) (7.2 ) (28.4 ) NM * (0.8 ) -11.1 % Reconciling item: Foreign exchange 2.7 1.1 (3.3 ) 1.6 145.5 % 4.4 ND ** Earnings from continuing operations before provision for income taxes $ 320.8 $ 302.7 $ 273.9 $ 18.1 6.0 % $ 28.8 10.5 % * Not Meaningful ** Not Determinable Investor Communication Solutions Fiscal Year 2007 Compared to Fiscal Year 2006 Net Revenues. Investor Communication Solutions net revenues for fiscal year 2007 were $1,545.4 million, an increase of $154.2 million, or 11.1%, compared to $1,391.2 million for fiscal year 2006. Contributing to the 11.1% revenue increase were internal growth of 10.9% and acquisitions of 0.7%, partially offset by net new business losses of 0.5%. Fiscal year 2007 net revenues from our proxy and interim communications services grew primarily due to higher event-driven activity related to equity mergers/contest and mutual fund proxies and interim communications. Our fulfillment services and transaction reporting services revenues increased due to higher volumes processed from our existing client base and acquisitions. Other communication services growth is attributable to nonrecurring activity related to corporate actions distributions driven by internal growth. Distribution revenue was $817.1 million for fiscal year 2007, an increase of 12.5%, compared to $726.4 million for fiscal year 2006. The increase in distribution revenue was driven by higher volumes and to lesser extent, higher rates due to an increase in the United States Postal Services postage rates. Our number of pieces processed increased 11.4% from 1,047.0 million pieces in fiscal year 2006 to 1,166.8 million pieces for fiscal year 2007. Stock record growth, which is a measure of how many stockholders own a security compared to the prior year and a key factor in the number of pieces processed, was 0% in fiscal year 2007. -43- Table of Contents Earnings from Continuing Operations before Provision for Income Taxes . Earnings from continuing operations before provision for income taxes for fiscal year 2007 were $226.7 million, an increase of $21.8 million, or 10.6%, compared to $204.9 million for fiscal year 2006. Margin was 14.7%, the same as fiscal year 2006. Fiscal Year 2006 Compared to Fiscal Year 2005 Net Revenues. Investor Communication Solutions net revenues for fiscal year 2006 were $1,391.2 million, an increase of $175.9 million, or 14.5%, compared to $1,215.3 million for fiscal year 2005. Contributing to the 14.5% revenue growth were internal growth of 10.9% and new business growth of 3.6%. The increase in fiscal year 2006 proxy and interim communications activity resulted from higher mutual fund meeting activity and other required mutual fund communications. Our fulfillment services revenues increased due to higher volume from our existing client base. Our transaction reporting services revenues increased due to new business growth in our monthly statement and trade confirmation services. Other communication services growth reflects increased print pass-through services. Distribution revenue was $726.4 million for fiscal year 2006, an increase of $80.6 million or 12.5%, compared to $645.8 million for fiscal year 2005. The increase was due to higher volumes of our proxy and interim communications services revenues. The number of pieces processed increased 5.3%, from 994.6 million pieces for fiscal year 2005 to 1,047.0 million pieces for fiscal year 2006. Stock record growth increased 4% in fiscal year 2006. Earnings from Continuing Operations before Provision for Income Taxes . Earnings from continuing operations before provision for income taxes for fiscal year 2006 were $204.9 million, an increase of $28.6 million, or 16.2%, compared to $176.3 million for fiscal year 2005. The increase was primarily due to the revenue growth in our investor communication activities. Additionally, earnings from continuing operations before provision for income taxes were favorably affected by our overall cost containment measures. Securities Processing Solutions Fiscal Year 2007 Compared to Fiscal Year 2006 Net Revenues . Securities Processing Solutions net revenues for fiscal year 2007 were $497.1 million, an increase of $20.9 million, or 4.4%, compared to $476.2 million for fiscal year 2006. The increase was due to $6.4 million in internal growth from our existing client base in both our domestic equity and fixed income trade processing and $14.5 million in net new business. Earnings from Continuing Operations before Provision for Income Taxes . Earnings from continuing operations before provision for income taxes for fiscal year 2007 were $139.7 million, an increase of $10.0 million, or 7.7%, compared to $129.7 million for fiscal year 2006. The margin increase of 0.9 percentage points was attributable to favorable product mix, partially offset by the change in methodology, beginning in January 2007, for charging the Clearing and Outsourcing Solutions segment for services provided by the Securities Processing Solutions at cost. Fiscal Year 2006 Compared to Fiscal Year 2005 Net Revenues. Securities Processing Solutions net revenues for fiscal year 2006 were $476.2 million, an increase of $14.8 million, or 3.2%, compared to $461.4 million for fiscal year 2005. The increase was primarily due to internal growth from our existing client base in Canada of $9.5 million and new business growth of $18.9 million, partially offset by losses of $15.8 million due to industry consolidation and compression of trading activity. -44- Table of Contents Earnings from Continuing Operations before Provision for Income Taxes. Earnings from continuing operations before provision for income taxes for fiscal year 2006 were $129.7 million, an increase of $0.9 million, or 0.7%, compared to $128.8 million for fiscal year 2005. This increase was due to higher revenues as discussed above, partially offset by higher expenses as a result of the timing of new client implementation activities. Clearing and Outsourcing Solutions Fiscal Year 2007 Compared to Fiscal Year 2006 Net Revenues . Clearing and Outsourcing Solutions net revenues were $93.8 million for fiscal year 2007, an increase of $13.2 million, or 16.4%, compared to $80.6 million for fiscal year 2006. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to new outsourcing business of $6.7 million and higher net interest income of $5.4 million, as average margin balances for fiscal year 2007 were $687.7 million as compared with $617.0 million for fiscal year 2006. The average number of trades cleared per day for fiscal year 2007 was 33,600 as compared with 20,000 for fiscal year 2006. Loss from Continuing Operations before Provision for Income Taxes . Loss from continuing operations before provision for income taxes was $11.9 million for fiscal year 2007, a decrease of $13.1 million, or 52.4%, compared to a loss of $25.0 million for fiscal year 2006. The improvement was primarily due to higher net revenues, as expenses of $105.7 million were comparable to fiscal year 2006 due to scalability. Beginning in January 2007, the Company changed its methodology for charging the Clearing and Outsourcing Solutions segment for services provided by the Company other segments. The Clearing and Outsourcing Solutions segment is charged for services based on the other segments cost of providing such services. Prior to January 2007, the Clearing and Outsourcing Solutions segment was billed for these services on a mark-up basis with the other segments recording revenue for the amount of these billings. The following table summarizes the amounts charged to the Clearing and Outsourcing Solutions segment by the Company other segments for the fiscal years 2007 and 2006. The amounts billed by the other segments and recorded as cost of net revenues by the Clearing and Outsourcing Solutions segment were as follows: Years Ended June 30, 2007 2006 Change ($) (%) (in millions) Investor Communication Solutions $ 3.4 $ 4.5 $ (1.1 ) -24.4 % Securities Processing Solutions 8.1 12.4 (4.3 ) -34.7 % Total expenses $ 11.5 $ 16.9 $ (5.4 ) -32.0 % Fiscal Year 2006 Compared to Fiscal Year 2005 Net Revenues . Clearing and Outsourcing Solutions net revenues were $80.6 million for fiscal year 2006, an increase of $19.1 million, or 31.1%, compared to $61.5 million for the period from its acquisition date of November 1, 2004 through June 30, 2005. Fiscal year 2006 net revenues decreased as compared with annualized fiscal year 2005 net revenues due to the de-conversion of two correspondent clearing clients during fiscal year 2005, partially offset by the increase from new business growth of $16.0 million in outsourcing activity in fiscal year 2006. Average margin balances were $617.0 million during fiscal year 2006 and $955.0 million during the period from its acquisition date of November 1, 2004 through June 30, 2005. The average number of trades cleared per day during fiscal year 2006 was 20,000 trades as compared with 23,000 trades for the period from its acquisition date of November 1, 2004 through June 30, 2005. -45- Table of Contents Loss from Continuing Operations before Provision for Income Taxes . Loss from continuing operations before provision for income taxes was $25.0 million for fiscal year 2006 as compared with $20.7 million for the period from its acquisition date of November 1, 2004 through June 30, 2005. The loss for fiscal year 2006 was lower than the annualized loss from the eight months of fiscal year 2005 due to the efforts to reduce operational costs in order to align the cost structure of the business to current revenue levels. The decrease was primarily due to continued integration and transition expenses, which decreased in the second half of fiscal year 2006, compared to the second half of fiscal year 2005, and higher compensation costs to support the start up of new Clearing and Outsourcing Solutions clients. Other The primary components of Other net revenues are the elimination of inter-segment revenues. The primary components of Other earnings from continuing operations before provision for income taxes are certain unallocated expenses and other expenses, net. Total other expenses, net were $36.4 million for fiscal year 2007, an increase of $28.4 million compared to fiscal year 2006. The increase reflects $10.6 million in interest expense associated with our borrowings and one-time transition costs of $14.0 million. FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES At June 30, 2007, cash and cash equivalents were $88.6 million and Stockholders Equity was $531.1 million. At June 30, 2007, working capital was $531.4 million compared to $415.6 million at June 30, 2006. On March 29, 2007, the Company entered into a $1,190.0 million credit facility, consisting of a $440.0 million five-year term loan, a $500.0 million five-year revolving credit facility and a $250.0 million one-year revolving credit facility. On March 29, 2007, the Company drew down fully on the $440.0 million five-year term loan facility and the $250.0 million one-year revolving credit facility. The proceeds received in connection with the $690.0 million of borrowings were paid to ADP on March 30, 2007 as a dividend. On June 29, 2007, the Company repaid $70.0 million of the five-year term loan facility. The one-year revolving credit facility was cancelled upon repayment on May 29, 2007 with the net proceeds from the issuance of unsecured Senior Notes due June 2017 and cash. The terms of the Notes are governed by an indenture, dated as of May 29, 2007, by and between Broadridge and U.S. Bank National Association. The Senior Notes are unsecured obligations of Broadridge and rank equally in right of payment with other unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of Broadridge. Interest is payable semiannually on June 1 and December 1 each year based on a fixed per annum rate equal to 6.125%. Based upon current and anticipated levels of operation, we believe that our cash on hand and cash flow from operations, combined with borrowings available under the credit facility, will be sufficient to enable us to meet our current and anticipated cash operating requirements, capital expenditures and working capital needs. Please refer to Note 13 Regulatory Requirements to our Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the discussion of cash flows used in financing activities in the following section for further discussion of our financing activities. Cash Flows The cash flows from operating and financing activities for our Clearing and Outsourcing Solutions segment differ from that of our other businesses. Broker-dealer and customer margin activities and transactions require the Company to obtain financing from both internal and external sources. Additionally, regulations associated with the broker-dealer industry require cash or securities to be segregated for the exclusive benefit of customers in certain circumstances based on regulatory calculations driven by customers balances. As a result, management analyzes cash flows provided from operating and financing activities of the Clearing and Outsourcing Solutions segment separately from all other businesses. -46- Table of Contents Net cash flows (used in) provided by operating activities were as follows: Years Ended June 30, 2007 2006 Change ($) (%) (in millions) Net cash flows provided by operating activities for all business excluding the Clearing and Outsourcing Solutions Segment $ 298.2 $ 305.4 $ (7.2 ) -2.4 % Net cash flows (used in) provided by operating activities for the Clearing and Outsourcing Solutions Segment (137.7 ) 120.7 (258.4 ) NM * Net cash flows provided by operating activities, as reported $ 160.5 $ 426.1 $ (265.6 ) -62.3 % * Not Meaningful Net cash flows provided by operating activities for all businesses, excluding the Clearing and Outsourcing Solutions segment, were $298.2 million for fiscal year 2007, a decrease of $7.2 million, compared to $305.4 million for fiscal year 2006. The decrease in operating cash flows was primarily attributable to higher trade accounts receivable, partially offset by an increase in accrued expenses. Net cash flows used in operating activities for the Clearing and Outsourcing Solutions segment were $137.7 million for fiscal year 2007 compared to cash flows provided by operating activities of $120.7 million for fiscal year 2006. At June 30, 2005, the Clearing and Outsourcing Solutions segment had a regulatory deposit reserve requirement of $176.8 million, which was released the following week, resulting in a cash inflow of $176.8 million. There was no similar reserve at June 30, 2006. During fiscal year 2007, receivables from customers and broker-dealers, primarily in the form of margin loans, increased $291.6 million. Such loans were partially funded with additional cash from customer and broker-dealer accounts which increased $218.8 million. Net cash outflows for fiscal year 2007 from these transactions were $72.8 million. The remaining increase in margin loans was funded with external financing, as described below. Additionally, at June 30, 2007, the Clearing and Outsourcing Solutions segment had a regulatory deposit reserve of $25.9 million, which resulted in a cash outflow of $25.9 million. Subsequent to June 30, 2007, that reserve was released. Net cash flows used in investing activities were as follows: Years Ended June 30, 2007 2006 Change ($) (%) (in millions) Net cash flows used in investing activities for all business excluding the Clearing and Outsourcing Solutions Segment $ (37.2 ) $ (18.2 ) $ (19.0 ) -104.4 % Net cash flows used in investing activities for the Clearing and Outsourcing Solutions Segment (0.7 ) (2.6 ) 1.9 73.1 % Net cash flows used in investing activities, as reported $ (37.9 ) $ (20.8 ) $ (17.1 ) -82.2 % Net cash flows used in investing activities for all businesses for fiscal year 2007 totaled $37.9 million compared to $20.8 million for the comparable period in the prior year. This decrease was primarily due to net proceeds of $12.4 million received from Bank of America related to the acquisition of its U.S. Clearing and Broker-Dealer Services division and proceeds from the sale of the Company Investor Communication Solutions financial print business of $7.5 million in fiscal year 2006, partially offset by lower capital expenditures in fiscal year 2007 of $2.8 million. -47- Table of Contents Net cash flows used in financing activities were as follows: Years Ended June 30, 2007 2006 Change ($) (%) (in millions) Net cash flows used in financing activities for all business excluding the Clearing and Outsourcing Solutions Segment $ (212.9 ) $ (276.4 ) $ 63.5 23.0 % Net cash flows provided by (used in) financing activities for the Clearing and Outsourcing Solutions Segment 128.9 (111.5 ) 240.4 ND * Net cash flows used in financing activities, as reported $ (84.0 ) $ (387.9 ) $ 303.9 78.3 % * Not Determinable Net cash flows used in financing activities for all businesses, excluding the Clearing and Outsourcing Solutions segment, were $212.9 million for fiscal year 2007, an increase of $63.5 million, compared to $276.4 million for fiscal year 2006. This improvement was attributable to net proceeds the Company received in connection with its offering of the Senior Notes and net proceeds from its credit facilities, partially offset by payments to our former ADP affiliated companies. Net cash flows provided by financing activities for the Clearing and Outsourcing Solutions segment were $128.9 million for the fiscal year 2007 compared to cash flows used in financing activities of $111.5 million for fiscal year 2006. The $128.9 million provided in fiscal year 2007 was utilized to fund customer and non-customer margin activity, as well as regulatory deposit reserves, as described above. The $111.5 million usage for fiscal year 2006 includes a net return of $116.0 million previously borrowed from ADP, which was used to fund the $176.8 million reserve described above. Income Taxes Prior to the Distribution, the Company taxable income was included in separate income tax returns filed with the appropriate taxing jurisdictions, except for U.S. federal and certain state and foreign jurisdictions in which the Company taxable income is included in the income tax returns of ADP or an ADP affiliate. Subsequent to the Distribution, the Company files its own U.S. federal, state and foreign returns. The provision for income taxes is computed as if the Company filed on a combined stand-alone or separate tax return basis, as applicable. The provision for income taxes does not reflect the Company inclusion in the tax returns of ADP or an ADP affiliate. Certain income taxes of the Company were paid by ADP or an ADP affiliate on behalf of the Company. The payment of income taxes by ADP or an ADP affiliate on behalf of the Company is recorded within ADP Net Investment on the Consolidated and Combined Balance Sheets. The Company, headquartered in the United States of America, is routinely examined by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the IRS ) as part of the IRS U.S. federal income tax audit of ADP and is also routinely examined by the tax authorities in the U.S. states and foreign countries in which it conducts business. The tax years under audit examination vary by tax jurisdiction. With respect to U.S. federal income taxes, the Company was a member of the ADP U.S. federal income tax consolidated group through March 30, 2007. As a member of the ADP U.S. federal income tax consolidation, the Company is included in any IRS examination of ADP for periods up to and including March 30, 2007. ADP and the Company are currently under IRS audit for the years ended June 30, 1998 through the year ended June 30, 2002 which is expected to be substantially completed in fiscal year 2008. In addition, the IRS is conducting an examination of fiscal year 2003 through 2007. As a member of the ADP U.S. federal income tax consolidated group and pursuant to a tax allocation agreement between the Company and ADP, the U.S. federal income tax payable of the Company for the period ended March 30, 2007, will be assumed by ADP. In addition, any items of income or expense successfully challenged by the IRS attributable to the business operations of the Company for tax periods ended March 30, 2007 or earlier, will be tax liabilities assumed by ADP. Correspondingly, any items of income or expense attributable to the business operations of the Company for tax periods ended March 30, 2007 or earlier, which are settled favorably with the IRS by ADP will remain with ADP. Accordingly, the Company has not established any tax reserves or tax assets with respect to U.S. federal income taxes for the tax period ended March 30, 2007. -48- Table of Contents The tax allocation agreement between the Company and ADP also extends to the Company U.S. state income tax and most foreign income tax liabilities and tax assets. Thus, for any foreign or U.S. state income tax liabilities or tax assets relating to tax periods ended March 30, 2007 or earlier attributable to the Company business operations, depending on the tax jurisdiction, ADP will either make payments directly to the appropriate tax authorities or reimburse the Company for tax payments the Company made to the tax authorities that related to tax liabilities subject to the tax allocation agreement to the extent that such tax liabilities are in excess of amounts provided for in respect of such income taxes on the Consolidated and Combined Balance Sheet of the Company including the Notes thereto, as of June 30, 2007. Similarly, to the extent that there are any tax refunds attributable to the Company business operations in a particular tax jurisdiction for the period ended March 30, 2007 or earlier, ADP will either receive such refund directly from the appropriate tax authorities or receive reimbursement from the Company for the refund received by the Company that is subject to the tax allocation agreement. The Company regularly considers the likelihood of assessments in each of the jurisdictions resulting from examinations. To the extent the Company determines it has potential tax assessment in particular tax jurisdictions and that such assessments are not covered by the tax allocation agreement, the Company has established tax reserves which it believes are adequate in relation to the potential assessments. Once established, reserves are adjusted when there is more information available, when an event occurs necessitating a change to the reserves or the statute of limitations for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position has expired. The resolution of tax matters should not have a material effect on the combined financial condition of the Company, on the Company Consolidated Statements of Earnings for a particular future period or on the Company effective tax rate. Defined Benefit Pension Plans Prior to the spin-off, certain employees of the Company were covered by ADP domestic defined benefit plans. In addition, certain employees of the Company were part of ADP Supplemental Officer Retirement Plan ( ADP SORP ). The ADP SORP is a defined benefit plan pursuant to which ADP will pay supplemental pension benefits to certain key officers upon retirement based upon the officers years of service and compensation. Liabilities and assets related to these plans remain with ADP. Domestic pension expense allocated to the Company for the years ended June 30, 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $3.5 million, $3.0 million and $2.3 million, respectively. ADP SORP expense allocated to the Company for the years ended June 30, 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $0.2 million, $0.5 million and $0.3 million, respectively. The Company Board of Directors approved a Broadridge sponsored Supplemental Officer Retirement Plan ( Broadridge SORP ). The Broadridge SORP is a defined benefit plan pursuant to which the Company will pay supplemental pension benefits to certain key officers upon retirement based upon the officers years of service and compensation. The amount charged to expense for the Broadridge SORP was $0.2 million in the year ended June 30, 2007. Broadridge does not sponsor any other defined benefit plans. Broadridge management believes the ADP SORP and the Broadridge SORP are not material to the Company Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our contractual obligations to third parties as of June 30, 2007 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods: Payments Due by Period Total Less than 1 Year 1-3 Years 4-5 Years After 5 Years (in millions) Long-term debt (1) $ 617.7 $ $ $ 370.0 $ 247.7 Short-term borrowings(2) 109.2 109.2 Operating lease and software licenses(3) 162.9 41.2 104.5 17.2 Purchase obligations(4) 477.8 101.3 376.5 Total $ 1,367.6 $ 251.7 $ 481.0 $ 387.2 $ 247.7 (1) These amounts represent the principal repayments of long-term debt and are included on our Consolidated and Combined Balance Sheets. As of June 30, 2007, we had $617.7 million of outstanding debt consisting of $370.0 million of a term loan facility and $247.7 million in Senior Notes. See Notes 12 and 13 to our Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements under Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information about our debt and related matters. Excludes future cash payments related to interest expense as the term loan facility is variable rate and the interest payments will ultimately be determined by the rates in effect during each period. -49- Table of Contents (2) Short-term borrowings include a loan payable under an unsecured, uncommitted overnight bank credit facility. Excludes payments related to interest. See Note 12 to our Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements under Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. (3) Included in these amounts are various facilities and equipment leases and software license agreements. We enter into operating leases in the normal course of business relating to facilities and equipment, as well as the licensing of software. The majority of our lease agreements have fixed payment terms based on the passage of time. Certain facility and equipment leases require payment of maintenance and real estate taxes and contain escalation provisions based on future adjustments in price indices. Our future operating lease obligations could change if we exit certain contracts and if we enter into additional operating lease agreements. (4) Purchase obligations primarily relate to payments to ADP related to a data center outsourcing services agreement entered into prior to Distribution and purchase and maintenance agreements on our software, equipment and other assets. See Note 18 to our Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements under Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. Related Party Transactions Prior to our separation from ADP, the Company entered into a transition services agreement with ADP to provide for an orderly transition to being an independent company. Among the principal services to be provided to us by ADP are operational and administrative infrastructure-related services such as accounts payable processing, procurement support and human resources administrative services. The agreement will expire and services under it will cease on March 30, 2008 or sooner in the event the Company no longer requires such services. For the period from the date of Distribution to June 30, 2007, the Company recorded $0.4 million of expenses in the Consolidated and Combined Statements of Income related to these services. ADP and the Company entered into a number of commercial service agreements pursuant to which ADP and the Company are providing services to each other. Services provided by ADP to the Company include human resources, payroll and benefits administration services provided by ADP in the ordinary course of its business to third party entities on terms and conditions management believes will be similar to those the Company could obtain from other providers of these services. For the period from the date of Distribution to June 30, 2007, the Company recorded $0.5 million of expenses in the Consolidated and Combined Statements of Income related to these agreements. Services provided by the Company to ADP include providing fulfillment and other services that the Company provides in the ordinary course of its business to third parties on terms and conditions it believes will be similar to those available to other third parties. For the period from the date of Distribution to June 30, 2007, the Company recorded $4.4 million of revenue in the Consolidated and Combined Statements of Income related to these agreements. The Company entered into a data center outsourcing services agreement with ADP prior to the Distribution under which ADP provides the Company with data center services consistent with the services provided to the Company immediately prior to the Distribution, provided that the operation of the data center is the sole responsibility of ADP. Among the principal services provided by the data center are information technology services and service delivery network services. The agreement with ADP provides for increasing volumes and the addition of new services over the term. Under the agreement, ADP is responsible for hosting the mainframe, midrange, open systems, and networks. Additionally, systems engineering, network engineering, hardware engineering, network operations, data center operations, application change management, and data center disaster recovery services are managed by ADP. The agreement will expire on June 30, 2012. For the period from the date of Distribution to June 30, 2007, the Company recorded $27.5 million of expenses in the Consolidated and Combined Statements of Earnings related to this agreement. -50- Table of Contents Other Commercial Commitments At June 30, 2007, Ridge had a loan payable of $109.2 million under an unsecured, uncommitted overnight bank credit facility. Borrowings on this credit facility bear interest at the effective federal funds rate plus 37.5 basis points. In addition, immediately prior to the separation from ADP, certain of the Company foreign subsidiaries established unsecured, uncommitted lines of credit with banks. These lines of credit bear interest LIBOR plus 250 basis points. As of June 30, 2007, there were no outstanding borrowings under these lines of credit. Significant Non-Cash Transactions On July 1, 2006 the Company transferred at net book value $3.0 million of equipment and $21.0 million of software and software licenses to ADP. This transfer was related to the consolidation of our data center with ADP data center. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements It is not the Company business practice to enter into off-balance sheet arrangements. However, the Company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates that could impact its financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The Company manages its exposure to these market risks through its regular operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. The Company uses derivative financial instruments as risk management tools and not for trading purposes. The Company was not a party to any derivative financial instruments at June 30, 2007. In the normal course of business, the Company also enters into contracts in which it makes representations and warranties that relate to the performance of the Company products and services. The Company does not expect any material losses related to such representations and warranties.
