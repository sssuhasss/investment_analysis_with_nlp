Through television, film, digital media, live events, merchandise and solutions, our brands connect with diverse, young and young at heart audiences in more than 180 countries. We operate through two reportable segments: Media Networks and Filmed Entertainment . Our measure of segment performance is adjusted operating income. We define adjusted operating income for our segments as operating income, before equity-based compensation and certain other items identified as affecting comparability, when applicable. Equity-based compensation is excluded from our segment measure of performance since it is set and approved by the Compensation Committee of Viacom Board of Directors in consultation with corporate executive management, and is included as a component of consolidated adjusted operating income. Media Networks Our Media Networks segment provides entertainment content, services and related branded products for consumers in targeted demographics attractive to advertisers, content distributors and retailers. We create, acquire, distribute and sell programming and other content for our audiences worldwide, distributed through cable, satellite and broadband services, on linear, streaming, on-demand and transactional bases, for viewing on a wide range of devices such as televisions, PCs, tablets, smartphones and other connected devices. The Media Networks segment also delivers advertising and marketing services under our advanced marketing solutions portfolio, which both utilizes advanced addressable video inventory to allow dynamic ad insertion and advanced targeting, and provides our marketing partners with a variety of consulting and creative services and associated activations. The Media Networks segment also licenses its brands and properties for consumer products and recreation experiences, produces live events and creates original programming for third party distributors. 35 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) Globally, our Media Networks segment reaches approximately 4.4 billion cumulative television subscribers in more than 180 countries and 46 languages, via 314 locally programmed and operated television channels, including our multimedia brands Nickelodeon, MTV, BET, Comedy Central, Paramount Network, Nick Jr., VH1, TV Land, CMT and Logo. Outside of the United States (the U.S. ), Viacom International Media Networks ( VIMN ) operates the international extensions of our multimedia brands and our program services created specifically for international audiences, such as British public service broadcaster Channel 5 and Milkshake! in the United Kingdom ( UK ), Televisi n Federal S.A. ( Telefe ) in Argentina, Colors in India and Paramount Channel. In fiscal year 2018, our Media Networks segment launched 9 new channels, including in the UK, Japan, Italy and Portugal. Cumulative television subscribers is an aggregation of the total subscribers to (or viewers of, in the case of our free-to-air channels) each Viacom owned-and-operated, joint venture and licensee channel. Our Media Networks segment generates revenues in three categories: (i) the sale of advertising and marketing services, (ii) affiliate fees from distributors of our programming and program services and (iii) ancillary activities such as consumer products. Advertising Revenues Our Media Networks segment generates revenues from the sale of advertising and from marketing services. Our advertising revenues generally depend on the number of viewers and viewership demographics. Demand and pricing for our advertising depend on the attractiveness of our offerings to advertisers, viewership, and overall market conditions. We also drive additional demand for our advertising services through integrated sales of multi-platform advertising and marketing opportunities and through our integrated marketing services, providing unique branded content and custom sponsorship opportunities to our advertisers. Our advertising revenues may be affected by the strength of advertising markets and general economic conditions, and may fluctuate depending on the success of our programming, as measured by viewership, at any given time. Measured viewership may vary based on the success of our programming (due to, among other things, the timing of new episodes related to our popular programming and the performance of competing programs and other entertainment alternatives), the platforms on which our programming is available, and variations related to the methods used by third parties to measure viewership. Advertising revenues may also fluctuate due to the timing of holidays and significant programming events such as awards shows and premieres. Typically, advertising revenues are highest in the first quarter of our fiscal year. We continue to expand our product offerings to enable our customers and partners to better target and more broadly activate their advertising campaigns. Our Advanced Marketing Solutions portfolio consists of two main categories - Addressable Video and Brand Solutions. Addressable Video consists of pools of inventory that we are aggregating and enabling within both multichannel video programming distributor ( MVPD ) and over-the-top ( OTT ) environments, to allow for advanced targeting to fulfill the demand for next generation video ad products. Brand Solutions consists of a bundle of consulting, creative services, and media activation. Affiliate Revenues Our affiliate revenues are generated through fees from distributors of our programming and program services, such as cable television operators, direct-to-home satellite television operators, mobile networks, subscription video-on-demand ( SVOD ) and other OTT services. Our agreements with multichannel television service providers are generally multi-year carriage agreements with set rate increases. The amount of fees we receive is generally a function of the number of subscribers and the rates we receive per subscriber. Expirations of these affiliate agreements are staggered. Under SVOD and other similar OTT agreements, we make certain programs available for distribution on one or more dates, and our revenue under these OTT agreements is recognized when the content has been delivered by us and is available for use by the licensee; therefore, revenue will fluctuate depending on the timing of when programming is delivered and made available throughout the license period. Ancillary Revenues Our Media Networks ancillary revenues are principally derived from (i) our consumer products activities, which include licensing our brands and intellectual property, as well as creation and publishing of interactive games across various platforms (including mobile devices, PCs and consoles), (ii) recreation experiences and live events, (iii) viewing of our programming on a transactional basis through transactional video-on-demand ( TVOD ) and through electronic sell-through services and the sale of DVDs and Blu-ray discs and (iv) television syndication of our content. Our ancillary revenues vary based on consumer spending, the popularity of our programming and intellectual property, and the volume of content available during a particular period. Media Networks segment expenses consist of operating expenses, selling, general and administrative ( SG&A ) expenses and depreciation and amortization. 36 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) Operating expenses are comprised of costs related to original and acquired programming, including programming amortization, expenses associated with the distribution of home entertainment products and consumer products licensing, participations and residuals, royalties, marketing services expenses and other costs of sales. SG&A expenses consist primarily of employee compensation, marketing, research and professional service fees and facility and occupancy costs. Depreciation and amortization expenses reflect depreciation of fixed assets, including transponders financed under capital leases, and amortization of finite-lived intangible assets. Filmed Entertainment Our Filmed Entertainment segment develops, produces, finances, acquires and distributes films, television programming and other entertainment content through its Paramount Pictures, Paramount Players, Paramount Animation and Paramount Television divisions, in various markets and media worldwide. It partners on various projects with key Viacom brands, including Nickelodeon Movies, MTV Films and BET Films. Films produced, acquired and/or distributed by the Filmed Entertainment segment are generally first exhibited theatrically in domestic and/or international markets and then released in various markets through airlines and hotels, electronic sell-through, DVDs and Blu-ray discs, TVOD, pay television, SVOD, cable and free television. Paramount Television draws on Paramount extensive library of film properties and develops original programming for television and digital platforms. Producing, marketing and distributing films and television programming can involve significant costs and the timing of a film release can cause our financial results to vary. For example, marketing costs are generally incurred before and throughout the theatrical release of a film and, to a lesser extent, other distribution windows, and are expensed as incurred. As a result, we typically incur losses with respect to a particular film prior to and during the film theatrical exhibition, and recoupment of investment as well as profitability for the film may not be realized until well after its theatrical release. Therefore, the results of the Filmed Entertainment segment can be volatile as films work their way through the various distribution windows. Our Filmed Entertainment segment generates revenues in four categories: (i) the release and/or distribution of films theatrically, (ii) the release and/or distribution of film and television product through home entertainment, (iii) the licensing of film and television product to television and digital platforms and (iv) other ancillary activities. Theatrical Revenues Paramount generates revenues worldwide from the theatrical distribution of films, primarily from audience ticket sales. Each film is a separate and distinct product with its revenues, and ultimate profitability, dependent upon many factors, among which domestic and international audience response is of fundamental importance. Theatrical revenues may also be affected by the number, timing and mix of releases and competitive offerings in any given period, consumer tastes and consumption habits, and overall economic conditions, including trends in discretionary spending. The theatrical success of a film is a significant factor in determining the revenues it is likely to generate in home entertainment markets and licensing arrangements for television and other platforms. Revenues from theatrical film releases tend to be cyclical with increases in the summer months during our fourth quarter. Home Entertainment Revenues Home entertainment revenues are derived from the worldwide sales and distribution of DVDs and Blu-ray discs relating to the films released theatrically by Paramount and programming of other Viacom brands such as Nickelodeon, MTV, Comedy Central and BET, as well as certain acquired films and content distributed on behalf of third parties such as CBS Corporation ( CBS ). Home entertainment revenues are also derived from the viewing of our films on a transactional basis through TVOD and electronic sell-through services around the world, for a fee and/or on a revenue-sharing basis. Our home entertainment revenues may be affected by the number, timing and mix of releases and competitive offerings in any given period, consumer tastes and consumption habits, the prominence given by distributors and retailers to our releases compared to those of our competitors, and overall economic conditions, including trends in discretionary spending. Licensing Revenues Paramount generates fees by licensing, around the world on a territory-by-territory basis, films and television programs produced, acquired or distributed by Paramount, for a fee or on a revenue sharing basis, to SVOD, pay and basic cable television, free television and free video-on-demand services. Revenue from the licensing of film and television exhibition rights is recognized upon availability for airing by the licensee and will fluctuate depending on the number and mix of available titles in any given territory. 37 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) Ancillary Revenues Paramount generates ancillary revenues by providing production and facilities services to third parties, primarily at Paramount studio lot. Paramount also generates ancillary revenues by licensing its brands for consumer products, themed restaurants, hotels and resorts, live stage plays, film clips and theme parks and other location-based entertainment projects. Filmed Entertainment segment expenses consist of operating expenses, SG&A expenses and depreciation and amortization. Operating expenses principally include the amortization of costs of our released feature films and television programming (including participations and residuals), print and advertising expenses and other distribution costs. SG&A expenses include employee compensation, facility and occupancy costs, professional service fees and other overhead costs. Depreciation and amortization expense principally consists of depreciation of fixed assets. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Our summary of consolidated results of operations are presented below for the years ended September 30, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 . 2018 vs. 2017 2017 vs. 2016 Year Ended September 30, Better/(Worse) Better/(Worse) (in millions, except per share amounts) 2018 2017 2016 $ % $ % GAAP Revenues $ 12,943 $ 13,263 $ 12,488 $ (320 ) (2 )% $ 775 6 % Operating income 2,570 2,489 2,526 81 3 (37 ) (1 ) Net earnings from continuing operations attributable to Viacom 1,688 1,871 1,436 (183 ) (10 ) 435 30 Diluted EPS from continuing operations 4.19 4.67 3.61 (0.48 ) (10 ) 1.06 29 Non-GAAP* Adjusted operating income $ 2,795 $ 2,743 $ 2,732 $ 52 2 % $ 11 % Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations attributable to Viacom 1,659 1,511 1,465 148 10 46 3 Adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations 4.12 3.77 3.68 0.35 9 0.09 2 * See Factors Affecting Comparability section below for a reconciliation of our reported results to our adjusted results, which are calculated on a non-GAAP basis. Factors Affecting Comparability The Consolidated Financial Statements reflect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows reported in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ). Our results have been affected by certain items identified as affecting comparability. Accordingly, when applicable, we use non-GAAP measures such as consolidated adjusted operating income, adjusted earnings from continuing operations before provision for income taxes, adjusted provision for income taxes, adjusted net earnings from continuing operations attributable to Viacom and adjusted diluted earnings per share ( EPS ) from continuing operations, among other measures, to evaluate our actual operating performance and for planning and forecasting of future periods. We believe that the adjusted results provide relevant and useful information for investors because they clarify our actual operating performance, make it easier to compare our results with those of other companies and allow investors to review performance in the same way as our management. Since these are not measures of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP, they should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, operating income, earnings from continuing operations before provision for income taxes, provision for income taxes, net earnings from continuing operations attributable to Viacom and diluted EPS from continuing operations as indicators of operating performance and they may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. The following tables reconcile our reported results (GAAP) to our adjusted results (non-GAAP) for the years ended September 30, 2018 , 2017 and 2016 . The tax impacts included in the tables below have been calculated using the rates applicable to the adjustments presented. 38 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) 2018 Year Ended September 30, 2018 (in millions, except per share amounts) Operating Income Earnings from Continuing Operations Before Provision for Income Taxes Provision for Income Taxes Net Earnings from Continuing Operations Attributable to Viacom Diluted EPS from Continuing Operations Reported results (GAAP) $ 2,570 $ 1,997 $ 269 $ 1,688 $ 4.19 Factors Affecting Comparability: Restructuring and related costs 225 225 55 170 0.42 Gain on asset sale (16 ) (16 ) (0.04 ) Gain on extinguishment of debt (25 ) (6 ) (19 ) (0.05 ) Investment impairment 46 10 36 0.09 Discrete tax benefit 200 (200 ) (0.49 ) Adjusted results (Non-GAAP) $ 2,795 $ 2,227 $ 528 $ 1,659 $ 4.12 Restructuring and related costs : During 2018, we launched a program of cost transformation initiatives to improve our margins, including an organizational realignment of support functions across Media Networks , new sourcing and procurement policies, real estate consolidation and technology enhancements.

Discrete tax benefit : The net discrete tax benefit was principally related to a tax accounting method change granted by the Internal Revenue Service, the release of tax reserves with respect to certain effectively settled tax positions and the recognition of capital loss carryforwards, partially offset by a reduction in qualified production activity tax benefits as a result of retroactively reenacted legislation. YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018 vs. 2017 Consolidated Results of Operations Revenues Worldwide revenues decreased $320 million , or 2% , to $12.943 billion in the year ended September 30, 2018 .

Income Taxes The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Act ) was enacted on December 22, 2017. The currently relevant provisions of the Act provide for a reduction of the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% and a transition tax to be levied on the deemed repatriation of indefinitely reinvested earnings of international subsidiaries. As a result of these factors, as well as our fiscal year-end, the federal statutory tax rate decreased from 35% to a prorated rate of 24.5% for fiscal 2018. While the Act includes many provisions, those applicable to Viacom will be phased in and will not have full effect until fiscal 2019. Our effective income tax rate was 13.5% in the year ended September 30, 2018 . The net discrete tax benefit of $200 million , taken together with the discrete tax impact of the other factors affecting comparability, reduced the effective income tax rate by 10.2 percentage points.

Net Earnings from Continuing Operations Attributable to Viacom Net earnings from continuing operations attributable to Viacom decreased $183 million , or 10% , to $1.688 billion in the year ended September 30, 2018 , due to the after-tax impact of gains on asset sales in the prior year, partially offset by lapping the prior year programming charge. Excluding the items discussed in Factors Affecting Comparability , adjusted net earnings from continuing operations attributable to Viacom increased $148 million , or 10% , to $1.659 billion in the year ended September 30, 2018 , driven by the impact of the Act and the increase in adjusted operating income. Diluted Earnings Per Share from Continuing Operations Diluted EPS from continuing operations decreased $0.48 per diluted share to $4.19 in the year ended September 30, 2018 , reflecting the impact of net earnings. Excluding the items discussed in Factors Affecting Comparability , adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations increased $0.35 per diluted share to $4.12 . Foreign exchange had an unfavorable $ 0.02 impact on diluted and adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations. Segment Results of Operations Transactions between reportable segments are accounted for as third-party arrangements for the purposes of presenting segment results of operations.

We have access to external financing sources such as our revolving credit facility and the capital markets. Our principal uses of cash from operations include the creation of new programming and film content, acquisitions of third-party content, interest and income tax payments. We also use cash for the repayment of debt, quarterly cash dividends, capital expenditures and acquisitions of businesses. The Media Networks segment consistently generates a significant percentage of our cash flow from operating activities. Advertising is generally purchased by large media buying agencies and our affiliate revenues are earned from cable and direct-to-home satellite television operators and other distributors. The Filmed Entertainment segment operational results and ability to generate cash flow from operations substantially depend on the number and timing of films and television series in development and production, the level and timing of print and advertising costs, and the public response to our theatrical film and home entertainment releases. In general, our segments require relatively low levels of capital expenditures in relation to our annual cash flow from operations. This contributes to our ability to generate cash flow for future investment in our content and business operations, which we expect to be able to maintain over time. We use commercial paper borrowings, backstopped by our credit facility, and the credit facility to fund short-term domestic liquidity needs principally driven by the timing of our domestic operating cash flows. Our cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.557 billion as of September 30, 2018 , of which $671 million was held by our foreign subsidiaries. As a result of the enactment of the Act, the Company recorded $81 million of provisional transition tax on $999 million of previously indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings and repatriated substantially all of these earnings to the U.S. during the fiscal year. We do not currently have plans to repatriate any undistributed international cash not subject to the transition tax. Should we require additional capital in the U.S., we could elect to repatriate these additional funds or access external financing, but repatriating these funds could result in approximately $90 million to $110 million of U.S. tax. Cash from earnings of our international subsidiaries generated after December 31, 2017 can be repatriated to the U.S. without incremental U.S. federal tax under the Act. We believe that our cash flows from operating activities together with our credit facility provide us with adequate resources to fund our anticipated ongoing cash requirements. We anticipate that future debt maturities will be funded with cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operating activities and future access to capital markets, including our credit facility. We may continue to access external financing from time to time depending on our cash requirements, assessments of current and anticipated market conditions and after-tax cost of capital. Our access to capital markets can be impacted by factors outside our control, including economic conditions; however, we believe that our strong cash flows and balance sheet, our credit facility and our credit rating will provide us with adequate access to funding given our expected cash needs. Any new borrowing cost would be affected by market conditions and short and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to access capital markets on terms and conditions that will be favorable to us. Cash Flows Cash and cash equivalents were $1.557 billion as of September 30, 2018 , which increased $168 million compared with September 30, 2017 . The following tables include information driving the change in cash and cash equivalents and a reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities (GAAP) to free cash flow and operating free cash flow (non-GAAP). We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures. We define operating free cash flow as free cash flow, excluding the impact of the cash premium on the extinguishment of debt, as applicable. Free cash flow and operating free cash flow are non-GAAP measures. Management believes the use of these measures provides investors with an important perspective on, in the case of free cash flow, our liquidity, including our ability to service debt and make investments in our businesses, and, in the case of operating free cash flow, our liquidity from ongoing activities. 49 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) Change in cash and cash equivalents (in millions) Year Ended September 30, Better/(Worse) $ 2018 2017 2016 2018 vs. 2017 2017 vs. 2016 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,822 $ 1,672 $ 1,371 $ 150 $ 301 Net cash provided by/(used in) investing activities (224 ) 329 (299 ) (553 ) 628 Net cash used in financing activities (1,410 ) (1,011 ) (1,173 ) (399 ) 162 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (20 ) 20 (26 ) (40 ) 46 Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ 168 $ 1,010 $ (127 ) $ (842 ) $ 1,137 Reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow and operating free cash flow Net cash provided by operating activities (GAAP) $ 1,822 $ 1,672 $ 1,371 $ 150 $ 301 Capital expenditures (178 ) (195 ) (172 ) 17 (23 ) Free cash flow (Non-GAAP) 1,644 1,477 1,199 167 278 Debt retirement premium 33 (33 ) 33 Operating free cash flow (Non-GAAP) $ 1,644 $ 1,510 $ 1,199 $ 134 $ 311 Operating Activities Cash provided by operating activities was $1.822 billion in 2018 , an increase of $150 million compared with 2017 , primarily reflecting lower income taxes and interest payments, partially offset by an increase in payments associated with film and television production. See Note 17 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding income tax payments. Cash provided by operating activities was $1.672 billion in 2017 , an increase of $301 million compared with 2016 , primarily reflecting lower film production spend, partially offset by other unfavorable working capital requirements, including higher income tax payments.

Cash used in financing activities was $1.011 billion in 2017 , principally reflecting net payments of $783 million from debt transactions and dividend payments of $319 million, partially offset by stock option exercise proceeds of $172 million. Cash used in financing activities was $1.173 billion in 2016 , primarily driven by dividend payments of $635 million , debt repayments of $368 million and the settlement of share repurchases totaling $100 million. 50 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) Capital Resources Capital Structure and Debt Our debt outstanding as of September 30, 2018 and 2017 is as follows: Debt (in millions) September 30, 2018 2017 Notes and debentures $ 10,052 $ 11,065 Capital leases and other obligations 30 54 Total debt $ 10,082 $ 11,119 In 2018, we redeemed $1.039 billion of senior notes and debentures for a redemption price of $1.000 billion. As a result, we recognized a net pre-tax extinguishment gain of $25 million, which included $14 million of unamortized debt costs and transaction fees. Our 5.875% Junior subordinated debentures due February 2057 and 6.250% Junior subordinated debentures due February 2057 accrue interest at the stated fixed rates until February 28, 2022 and February 28, 2027, respectively, collectively the Junior Subordinated Debentures , on which dates the rates will switch to floating rates based on three-month LIBOR plus 3.895% and 3.899%, respectively, reset quarterly. The Junior Subordinated Debentures can be called by us at any time after the expiration of the fixed-rate period. The outstanding principal amount of each of the Junior Subordinated Debentures was $650 million as of September 30, 2018. The subordination, interest deferral option and extended term of the Junior Subordinated Debentures provide significant credit protection measures for senior creditors and, as a result of these features, the debentures received a 50% equity credit by S&P and Fitch, and a 25% equity credit by Moody s. The interest rate payable on our 2.250% Senior notes due February 2022 and 3.450% Senior notes due October 2026, collectively the Senior Notes , will be subject to adjustment from time to time if Moody Investors Services, Inc. or S&P Global Ratings downgrades (or downgrades and subsequently upgrades) the credit rating assigned to the Senior Notes. The interest rate on these Senior Notes would increase by 0.25% upon each credit agency downgrade up to a maximum of 2.00%, and would similarly be decreased for subsequent upgrades. The outstanding principal amount of our 2.250% Senior notes due February 2022 and 3.450% Senior notes due October 2026 was $103 million and $479 million as of September 30, 2018, respectively. Our outstanding notes and debentures provide for certain covenant packages typical for an investment grade company. There is an acceleration trigger for the majority of the notes and debentures in the event of a change in control under specified circumstances coupled with ratings downgrades due to the change in control, as well as certain optional redemption provisions for our junior debentures. At September 30, 2018 and 2017 , the total unamortized discount and issuance fees and expenses related to our outstanding notes and debentures was $431 million and $457 million , respectively. Credit Facility : At September 30, 2018 and 2017 , there were no amounts outstanding under our $2.5 billion revolving credit facility due November 2019. The average credit facility amount outstanding for the twelve months ending September 30, 2018 was $42 million, which had a weighted average interest rate of 2.74%. The credit facility is used for general corporate purposes and to support commercial paper outstanding, if any. The borrowing rate under the credit facility is LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 1.25% to 2.25% based on our current public debt rating. The credit facility has one principal financial covenant that requires our interest coverage for the most recent four consecutive fiscal quarters to be at least 3.0x, which we met as of September 30, 2018 . Commercial Paper : At September 30, 2018 and 2017 , there was no commercial paper outstanding. The average commercial paper outstanding for the twelve months ending September 30, 2018 was $683 million, which had a weighted average interest rate of 2.25%. Stock Repurchase Program : During 2018 and 2017 , we did not repurchase any shares of Class B common stock. During 2016 , we repurchased 2.1 million shares under the program for an aggregate price of $100 million . There is $4.9 billion of remaining capacity under our $20.0 billion stock repurchase program. 51 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) Commitments and Contingencies Our commitments primarily consist of programming and talent commitments, operating and capital lease arrangements, and purchase obligations for goods and services. These arrangements result from our normal course of business and represent obligations that may be payable over several years. See Note 11 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Additionally, we are subject to a redeemable put option (see Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements). Guarantees : In the course of our business, we both provide and receive the benefit of indemnities that are intended to allocate certain risks associated with business transactions. Similarly, we may remain contingently liable for various obligations of a business that has been divested in the event that a third party does not live up to its obligations under an indemnification agreement. Leases - We have certain indemnification obligations with respect to leases primarily associated with the previously discontinued operations of Famous Players Inc. ( Famous Players ). In addition, we have certain indemnities provided by the acquirer of Famous Players. Other - We have indemnification obligations with respect to letters of credit and surety bonds primarily used as security against non-performance in the normal course of business. Film Financing Arrangements : From time to time we enter into film or television programming (collectively referred to as film ) financing arrangements that involve the sale of a partial copyright interest in a film to third-party investors. Since the investors typically have the risks and rewards of ownership proportionate to their ownership in the film, we generally record the amounts received for the sale of copyright interest as a reduction of the cost of the film and related cash flows are reflected in net cash flow from operating activities. We also enter into collaborative arrangements with other studios to jointly finance and distribute films ( co-financing arrangements ), under which each partner is responsible for distribution of the film in specific territories or distribution windows. The partners share in the profits and losses of the films under these arrangements are included within participations expense under the individual-film-forecast-computation method. Contractual Obligations Our contractual obligations include amounts reflected on our balance sheet, as well as off-balance sheet arrangements. At September 30, 2018 , our significant contractual obligations, including payments due for the next five fiscal years and thereafter, were as follows: Contractual Obligations (in millions) Total 2019 2020-2021 2022-2023 Thereafter Off-balance Sheet Arrangements Programming and talent commitments (1) $ 2,001 $ 759 $ 833 $ 334 $ 75 Operating leases (2) 1,686 176 426 294 790 Purchase obligations (3) 1,050 578 386 70 16 On-Balance Sheet Arrangements Capital lease obligations (4) $ 34 $ 19 $ 14 $ $ 1 Debt 10,483 550 752 2,331 6,850 Interest payments (5) 9,415 518 950 867 7,080 Other long-term obligations (6) 2,412 1,391 846 169 6 (1) Programming and talent commitments include $1.569 billion relating to media networks programming and $432 million for talent contracts. (2) Operating leases include long-term non-cancelable operating lease commitments for office space, equipment, transponders, studio facilities and vehicles. (3) Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including open purchase orders. (4) Capital lease obligations include capital leases for satellite transponders. (5) Interest payments on our junior subordinated debentures subsequent to the expiration of their fixed-rate periods have been included based on their current fixed rates. (6) Other long-term obligations principally consist of participations, residuals and programming obligations for content that is available for airing. The table above does not include payments which may result from our defined benefit pension plans of $402 million , unrecognized tax benefits of $200 million , including interest and penalties, interest payments to be made under our credit facility and for commercial paper outstanding, $246 million of redeemable noncontrolling interest and lease indemnification obligations of approximately $141 million . The amount and timing of payments with respect to these items are subject to a number of uncertainties such that we are unable to make sufficiently reliable estimations of future payments. 52 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) MARKET RISK We are exposed to market risk related to foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. We use or expect to use derivative financial instruments to modify exposure to risks from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. In accordance with our policy, we do not use derivative instruments unless there is an underlying exposure, and we do not hold or enter into financial instruments for speculative trading purposes. Foreign Exchange Risk We conduct business in various countries outside the U.S., resulting in exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates when translating from the foreign local currency to the U.S. Dollar. We use foreign currency forward contracts to economically hedge anticipated cash flows and foreign currency balances in such currencies as the British Pound, the Euro, the Canadian Dollar, the Australian Dollar, the Japanese Yen and the Brazilian Real. We also enter into forward contracts to hedge future production costs and programming obligations. The change in fair value of non-designated foreign exchange contracts is included in current period earnings as part of Other items, net in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. We manage the use of foreign exchange derivatives centrally. At September 30, 2018 and 2017 , the notional value of all foreign exchange contracts was $642 million and $869 million , respectively. In 2018 , $345 million related to future production costs and $297 million related to our foreign currency balances. In 2017 , $582 million related to future production costs and $287 million related to our foreign currency balances. Interest Rate Risk A portion of our interest expense is exposed to movements in short-term rates. A 1% change to the weighted average interest rate on commercial paper and credit facility amounts outstanding in 2018 would increase or decrease interest expense by approximately $7 million . Also, interest expense for future long-term debt issues is exposed to movements in long-term rates. Interest rate hedges may be used to modify both of these exposures at our discretion. There were no interest rate hedges outstanding at September 30, 2018 and 2017 . Viacom has issued notes and debentures that, at September 30, 2018 , had an outstanding balance of $10.1 billion and an estimated fair value of $10.5 billion . A 1% increase or decrease in the level of interest rates would decrease or increase the fair value of the notes and debentures by approximately $800 million and $900 million , respectively. Credit Risk We continually monitor our positions with, and credit quality of, our customers and the financial institutions that are counterparties to our financial instrument agreements. We are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonpayment by our customers and nonperformance by the counterparties to our financial instrument agreements. However, we do not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties to our financial instrument agreements and we believe our allowance for doubtful accounts is sufficient to cover any anticipated nonpayment by our customers. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, which are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. The result of these evaluations forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amount of expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Our critical accounting policies are those that are considered by management to require significant judgment and use of estimates and that could have a significant impact on our financial statements. An understanding of our critical accounting policies is necessary to analyze our financial results. Our critical accounting policies include our accounting for film and television production costs, acquired programming rights, revenue recognition, income taxes and goodwill. The risks and uncertainties involved in applying our critical accounting policies are provided below. Unless otherwise noted, we applied our critical accounting policies and estimation methods consistently in all material respects and for all periods presented, and have discussed such policies with our Audit Committee. For a summary of our significant accounting policies see Note 2 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. 53 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) Film and Television Production Costs We capitalize feature film and television production costs, on a title-specific basis, as Inventory, net in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We use an individual-film-forecast-computation method to amortize original production costs and to accrue estimated liabilities for residuals and participations over the applicable title life cycle based upon the ratio of current period to estimated remaining total gross revenues ( ultimate revenues ) for each title. The estimate of ultimate revenues impacts the timing of amortization and accrual of participations and residuals. Our estimate of ultimate revenues for feature films includes revenues from all sources that are estimated to be earned within 10 years from the date of a film initial theatrical release. For acquired film libraries, our estimate of ultimate revenues is for a period within 20 years from the date of acquisition. Prior to the release of feature films, we estimate ultimate revenues based on the historical performance of similar content and pre-release market research (including test market screenings), as well as incorporating factors of the content itself, including, but not limited to, the expected number of theaters and markets in which the original content will be released, the genre of the original content and the past box office performance of the lead actors and actresses. We believe the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of ultimate revenues for films intended for theatrical release is theatrical exhibition, as subsequent markets have historically exhibited a high correlation to theatrical performance. Upon a film initial release, we update our estimate of ultimate revenues based on expected future and actual results. Our estimates of revenues from succeeding windows and markets are revised based on historical relationships to theatrical performance and an analysis of current market trends. We also review and revise estimates of ultimate revenue and participation costs as of each reporting date to reflect the most current available information. If estimates for a film are revised, the difference between amortization expense determined using the new estimate and any amounts previously expensed during that fiscal year are charged or credited to our Consolidated Statement of Earnings in the quarter in which the estimates are revised. The most sensitive factor affecting our estimates for films subsequent to their initial release is the extent of home entertainment sales achieved. In addition to theatrical performance, home entertainment sales vary based on a variety of factors including demand for our titles, the volume and quality of competing products, marketing and promotional strategies, as well as economic conditions. Ultimate revenues for episodic television programming are limited to the amount of contracted revenue. Accordingly, television production costs in excess of the amount of contracted revenue are expensed as incurred. For original programming broadcast on our networks, capitalized original programming costs are amortized utilizing an individual-film-forecast-computation method over the applicable title ultimate revenues based on genre and historical experience, beginning with the month of initial exhibition. The most sensitive factor affecting ultimate revenues is ratings, which are an indication of audience acceptance and directly impact the level of advertising revenues we will be able to generate during the airing of the programming. Poor ratings may result in effective abandonment of a program, which would result in the immediate write-off of any unamortized production costs. If we believe that the release of our content will not be or has not been favorably received, then we would assess whether the fair value of such content is less than the unamortized portion of its capitalized costs and, if need be, recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the unamortized capitalized costs exceed the fair value. We utilize the individual-film-forecast-computation method (adjusted to incorporate revenue and related costs, including future exploitation costs, if any, expected to occur in periods beyond 10 years from the date of a film initial release) to develop the cash flows which are subsequently discounted to compute the fair value of a title that is being assessed for impairment. The discount rate utilized takes into account the time value of money as well as a risk premium. The risk premium reflects the uncertainties of realizing the expected cash flows of a title which is impacted by the title position within its product life cycle. Acquired Programming Rights Costs incurred in acquiring program rights, including advances, are capitalized and amortized to operating expenses over the license period or projected useful life of the programming, if shorter, commencing upon availability, based on estimated future airings. Program rights and the related liabilities are recorded at the commencement of the licensing period when the cost of the programming is known or reasonably determinable, the program material has been accepted and the programming is available for airing. If initial airings are expected to generate higher revenues an accelerated method of amortization is used. Determining factors used in estimating the useful life of programming include the expected number of future airings, which may differ from the contracted number of airings, the length of the license period and expected future revenues to be generated from the programming. The cost basis of acquired programming is the capitalized cost of each program and is equal to the cost of the programming pursuant to the license agreement less the cumulative amortization recorded for the program. Capitalized costs of rights to program materials are reported in our Consolidated Balance Sheets at the lower of unamortized cost or estimated net realizable value. We evaluate net realizable value of acquired rights programming on a daypart basis. A daypart is defined as an aggregation of programs broadcast during a particular time of day or an aggregation of programs of a similar type. We 54 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) aggregate similar programming based on the specific demographic targeted by each respective program service. Net realizable value is determined by estimating advertising revenues to be derived from the future airing of the programming within the daypart as well as an allocation of affiliate revenues to programming. An impairment charge may be necessary if our estimates of future cash flows of similar programming are insufficient or if programming is abandoned. Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned. We consider revenue realized or realizable and earned when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. Determining whether some or all of these criteria have been met involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report. This includes the evaluation of multiple element arrangements for bundled advertising sales and content licenses, which involves allocating the consideration among individual deliverables within the bundled arrangement. Multiple-Element Arrangements We enter into arrangements which involve multiple revenue-generating activities. In accounting for multiple-element arrangements, judgment is exercised in identifying the separate elements of the transaction and in determining the value of these elements. Advertising revenues are principally generated from the sale of advertising time comprised of multiple commercial units. Each advertising spot comprises a deliverable for accounting purposes. Consideration for these arrangements is allocated among the individual advertising spots based on relative fair value using Viacom-specific prices. Subscription video-on-demand and other OTT arrangements include certain programs made available to distributors on one or more dates for a fixed fee. Consideration for such arrangements is allocated among the programs based on relative fair value using stand alone selling price, where available, or management best estimate considering viewing performance and other factors. Gross versus Net Revenue We earn and recognize revenues under distribution and outsourced agency agreements. In such cases, determining whether revenue should be reported on a gross or net basis is based on management assessment of who our customer is in the transaction. To the extent the end consumer is our customer, we act as the principal in a transaction and revenues earned from the end user are reported on a gross basis. This determination involves judgment and is based on an evaluation of the facts and circumstances of the terms of an arrangement. Revenue Allowances In accordance with the accounting guidance related to revenue recognition when a right of return exists, revenue allowances are recorded to adjust amounts originally invoiced to the estimated net realizable value of a particular product. Upon the sale of DVDs and Blu-ray discs to wholesalers and retailers, we record a reduction of revenue for the impact of estimated future returns, rebates and other incentives ( estimated returns ). In determining estimated returns, we consider numerous sources of qualitative and quantitative evidence including forecasted sales data, customers rights of return, units shipped and units remaining at retail, historical return rates for similar product, current economic trends, competitive environment, promotions and sales strategies. Forecasted sales data is determined by comparing a particular release to product that has similar characteristics where applicable, such as franchise, genre, box office levels and release patterns, using regression analysis, decay rates and other tools. Based on the results of this analysis and the sales strategies to be used for the release, we reserve an appropriate percentage of each dollar of product revenue on a title taking into consideration the qualitative and quantitative factors described above. Forecasted sales data is reviewed and updated throughout each quarter and is consistent with the projections of ultimate revenues used in applying the individual-film-forecast-computation method to amortize our film costs. Accordingly, a change in forecasted sales affects both the revenue allowance and related expenses. Actual sell-through data is reviewed as it becomes available against the forecasted sales data to ensure that estimates continue to be consistent with actual sales performance. Our estimate of future returns affects reported revenue and operating income. If we underestimate the impact of future returns in a particular period, then we may record less revenue and related expenses in later periods when returns exceed the estimated amounts. If we overestimate the impact of future returns in a particular period, then we may record additional revenue and related expenses in later periods when returns are less than estimated. An incremental change of 1-percentage point in our estimated sales returns rate (i.e., provisions for returns divided by gross sales of related product) for DVDs and Blu-ray 55 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) products would have a $6 million impact on our total revenue for the year ended September 30, 2018 . This revenue impact would be partially offset by a corresponding impact on related expenses depending on the margin associated with a specific film and other factors. Income Taxes Significant judgment is required in determining our annual provision for income taxes and evaluating our income tax positions. Our tax rates are impacted by the tax laws, regulations and policies in federal, state, local and international territories where our businesses operate. In determining our income tax provisions on a jurisdiction basis, we are required to make judgments on the need to record deferred tax assets and liabilities, including the realizability of deferred tax assets. A valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is established if it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized. In evaluating uncertain tax positions, we make determinations of the application of complex tax rules, regulations and practices. We evaluate our uncertain tax positions quarterly based on many factors including, but not limited to, new facts, changes in tax law and interpretations, as well as information received from regulators. A change in any one of these factors could change our evaluation of an existing uncertain tax position, resulting in the recognition of an additional charge or benefit to our income tax provision in the period and may result in fluctuations in our effective income tax rate. Additionally, our income tax returns are routinely audited and settlements of issues raised in these audits sometimes affect our income tax provisions. The resolution of audit issues and income tax positions taken may take extended periods of time due to the length of examinations by tax authorities and the possible extension of statutes of limitations. A 1-percentage point change in our effective income tax rate would result in additional income tax expense of approximately $20 million for the year ended September 30, 2018 . Goodwill In 2017, the Company reporting units, for purposes of goodwill impairment testing, were Global Entertainment Group, Nickelodeon Group, BET Networks and Paramount. During the fourth quarter of 2018, we reassessed our reporting units due to certain business, managerial and financial reporting changes to further integrate Media Networks brands. To determine our reporting units, we evaluate the components one level below the operating segment level and we aggregate the components if they have similar economic characteristics. As a result of the assessment, we concluded that our reporting units have changed. As such, as of September 30, 2018, our reporting units were Media Networks ($10.0 billion of goodwill) and Paramount ($1.6 billion of goodwill). We test goodwill for impairment on August 31 of each year and have elected to perform a qualitative assessment test for our reporting units in 2018. We performed this qualitative assessment on our previous reporting units in connection with the change described above, as well as on our newly identified reporting units, as part of our annual goodwill assessment. The qualitative test is an evaluation, based on the weight of evidence, of the significance of all identified events and circumstances in the context of determining whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. A qualitative assessment includes, but is not limited to, consideration of the results of our most recent quantitative impairment test, performed in 2017, consideration of macroeconomic conditions and industry and market conditions. Based on our assessments, we concluded that it is not more likely than not that goodwill is impaired. Therefore, performing a quantitative impairment test was not considered necessary. A quantitative goodwill impairment test, when performed, requires estimating fair value of a reporting unit based on a discounted cash flow analysis. A discounted cash flow analysis requires us to make various judgmental assumptions, including assumptions about the timing and amount of future cash flows, growth rates and discount rates. Given the inherent uncertainty in determining these assumptions, actual results may differ from those used in our valuations. 56 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) OTHER MATTERS Related Parties In the ordinary course of business we enter into transactions with related parties, including National Amusements, Inc. ( National Amusements ), CBS, their respective subsidiaries and affiliates and companies that we account for under the equity method of accounting. See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for details regarding the related party transactions and their impact on the Financial Statements. Agreements with CBS Corporation In connection with our separation from CBS, effective as of January 1, 2006 (the separation ), we and CBS entered into a Separation Agreement, a Transition Services Agreement and a Tax Matters Agreement, as well as certain other agreements to govern the terms of the separation and certain of the ongoing relationships between CBS and us after the separation. These related party arrangements are more fully described below. Pursuant to the Separation Agreement, each company is obligated to indemnify the other company and the other company officers, directors and employees for any losses arising out of its failure to perform or discharge any of the liabilities it assumed pursuant to the Separation Agreement, including with respect to certain legal matters, its businesses as conducted as of the date of the separation and its breaches of shared contracts. Subject to limited exceptions, the Separation Agreement provides that none of Viacom, any subsidiary of Viacom or any person that is controlled by Viacom after the separation will own or acquire an interest in a radio or television broadcast station, television broadcast network or daily newspaper, if such ownership or acquisition would (i) cause CBS, any subsidiary of CBS or any entity controlled by CBS after the date of the separation to be in violation of U.S. federal laws limiting the ownership or control of radio broadcast stations, television broadcast stations and/or television broadcast networks or (ii) limit in any manner at any time under such laws CBS ability to acquire additional interests in a radio or television broadcast station and/or television broadcast network. These restrictions will terminate when none of Mr. Redstone, National Amusements, NAIRI Inc. or any of their successors, assigns or transferees are deemed to have interests in both CBS and Viacom that are attributable under applicable U.S. federal laws. The Separation Agreement also provides that neither Viacom, any subsidiary of Viacom or any person controlled by Viacom nor CBS, any subsidiary of CBS or any person controlled by CBS will acquire any asset, enter into any agreement or accept or agree to any condition that purports to bind, or subjects to a legal order, the other company, its subsidiaries or any person it controls without such other party written consent.
