BUSINESS OVERVIEW Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company or Air Products) serves technology, energy, industrial, and healthcare customers globally with a unique portfolio of products, services, and solutions that include atmospheric gases, process and specialty gases, performance materials, equipment, and services. Geographically diverse, with operations in over 40 countries, the Company has sales of $9.0 billion, assets of $13.5 billion, and a worldwide workforce of approximately 18,300 employees. The Company organizes its operations into four reportable business segments: Merchant Gases, Tonnage Gases, Electronics and Performance Materials, and Equipment and Energy. 2010 IN SUMMARY In 2010, the Company emerged from the recession and delivered strong growth and productivity. Sales increased 9% and underlying sales increased 8%, due to strong volume growth as the economic environment improved. These results were driven by a significant recovery in the Electronics and Performance Materials segment and new investments and contracts in the Tonnage Gases segment. Operating income increased due to improved performance across all business segments. The Company delivered significant improvements in 2010 as a result of actions taken to lower costs and position the Company for success coming out of the global recession. These actions included the completion of the Company global cost reduction plans and Electronics business restructuring. Additionally, the Company repositioned its manufacturing centers, continued to leverage the SAP system, and further utilized its shared service centers. These actions contributed to increased productivity and improved operating results. 18 Table of Contents In February 2010, the Company commenced a tender offer to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Airgas, Inc. (Airgas). Airgas is the largest packaged industrial gases distributor in the U.S. Its fiscal year 2010 annual revenues were $3.9 and its total assets as of 31 March 2010 were $4.5. The current offer price is $65.50 per share. At this price, the total value of the transaction would be approximately $7.4 billion, including $5.7 billion of equity and $1.7 billon of assumed debt. The offer and withdrawal rights are scheduled to expire on 3 December 2010, unless further extended. Highlights for 2010 Sales of $9,026.0 increased 9%, or $769.8. Underlying business increased 8%, primarily due to higher volumes in the Electronics and Performance Materials and Tonnage Gases segments. Operating income of $1,389.0 increased 64%, or $542.7. On a non-GAAP basis, operating income of $1,485.0 increased 25%, or $300.4, primarily due to higher volumes, lower costs, and favorable currency and foreign exchange, partially offset by reduced pricing. Income from continuing operations of $1,029.1 increased 61%, or $389.2, and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $4.74 increased 58%, or $1.74. On a non-GAAP basis, income from continuing operations of $1,089.2 increased 26%, or $223.0, and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $5.02 increased 24%, or $.96. A summary table of changes in diluted earnings per share is presented below. The Company increased the quarterly dividend from $.45 to $.49 per share. This represents the 28th consecutive year that the Company has increased its dividend payment. For a discussion of the challenges, risks, and opportunities on which management is focused, refer to the Company 2011 Outlook discussions provided throughout the Management Discussion and Analysis that follows.

The Company anticipates global manufacturing growth of 3% 4% in 2011, with stronger growth in Asia and more gradual recoveries in the U.S. and Europe. The Company expects the U.S. will have positive growth of 3% 4% in manufacturing. Europe should increase about 1% 2% and Asia, led by China, is expected to continue as the strongest region, growing at 6% 7%. Looking forward, the Company expects volume growth to be the key factor in driving earnings improvement in 2011. Earnings should benefit from new plant onstreams in 2010 and 2011, along with the loading of existing assets. These volume gains will be partially offset by higher pension expense next year, as a result of a decline in the discount rates from September 2009 to September 2010 and lower expected asset returns. Based upon current rates, the Company does not expect currency to have a significant impact on 2011 earnings. The Company will continue to focus on cost control and will achieve benefits from the cost reduction efforts completed. If the proposed acquisition of Airgas is consummated in 2011, material impacts affecting most items in the Company consolidated financial statements are expected. In addition, projections, estimates and plans described in this Management Discussion and Analysis would be materially impacted. Except where noted, the Outlook discussions provided throughout the Management Discussion and Analysis do not include any impacts of the proposed transaction. Outlook by Segment Merchant Gases should benefit as capacity utilization of existing facilities continues to improve globally and as new demand develops, particularly in Asia. Global manufacturing growth, along with new technology applications should continue to increase demand which will drive the loading of facilities. Tonnage Gases is expected to benefit from the full-year loading of the 2010 new plant start-ups, along with several investments due to come onstream in 2011. In Electronics, the Company projects silicon growth of 5% 10% and slow, steady growth of the business with the newer photovoltaic (PV) and light-emitting diode (LED) businesses growing at higher rates. In the integrated circuit business, the Company is well positioned with the industry leaders that are starting up new fabrication plants and expanding capacity. The electronics equipment business should also grow in 2011 due to anticipated continued electronics industry capital spending. Growth is expected in Performance Materials as the Company leverages low cost production facilities in Asia. Additionally, Performance Materials continues to benefit from new product, market and application successes. Equipment and Energy results are expected to be comparable to 2010 levels. Two to three liquefied natural gas (LNG) orders are expected to be signed in 2011. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Discussion of Consolidated Results 2010 2009 2008 Sales $9,026.0 $8,256.2 $10,414.5 Operating income GAAP Basis 1,389.0 846.3 1,495.8 Operating income Non-GAAP Basis 1,485.0 1,184.6 1,522.1 Equity affiliates income 126.9 112.2 145.0 Sales % Change from Prior Year 2010 2009 Underlying business Volume 9 % (9 )% Price (1 )% 1 % Currency 1 % (6 )% Energy and raw material cost pass-through (7 )% Total Consolidated Sales Change 9 % (21 )% 20 Table of Contents 2010 vs. 2009 Sales of $9,026.0 increased 9%, or $769.8. Underlying business increased 8%, driven by volume increases in the Electronics and Performance Materials and Tonnage Gases segments, as the economic environment improved. These results were driven by a significant recovery in the Electronics and Performance Materials segment and new investments and contracts in the Tonnage Gases segment. 2009 vs. 2008 Sales of $8,256.2 decreased 21%, or $2,158.3. Underlying business declined 8%, due to lower volumes primarily in Electronics and Performance Materials, Merchant Gases, and Tonnage Gases. Volumes were impacted by the severity of the worldwide manufacturing downturn and a significant decline in silicon processed. Currency unfavorably impacted sales by 6%, due primarily to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against key European and Asian currencies. Lower energy and raw material contractual cost pass-through to customers reduced sales by 7%. Operating Income 2010 vs. 2009 Operating income of $1,389.0 increased 64%, or $542.7. On a non-GAAP basis, operating income of $1,485.0 increased 25%, or $300.4. Underlying business increased $275, primarily from higher volumes in the Electronics and Performance Materials and Tonnage Gases segments and lower costs, partially offset by reduced pricing. Favorable currency translation and foreign exchange impacts increased operating income by $25. 2009 vs. 2008 Operating income of $846.3 decreased 43%, or $649.5. On a non-GAAP basis, operating income of $1,184.6 decreased 22%, or $337.5. Underlying business declined $254, due primarily to lower volumes in the Merchant Gases, Electronics and Performance Materials, and Tonnage Gases segments. The volume declines of $490 were partially offset by favorable cost performance of $157 and improved pricing of $79. Unfavorable currency impacts lowered operating income by $113, reflecting the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against key European and Asian currencies. Operating income in 2008 included unfavorable impacts of $28 due to hurricanes and a fire at a production facility. Equity Affiliates Income 2010 vs. 2009 Income from equity affiliates of $126.9 increased $14.7, or 13%, primarily due to higher volumes. 2009 vs. 2008 Income from equity affiliates of $112.2 decreased $32.8, or 23%, primarily as a result of lower overall volumes and unfavorable currency. Additionally, 2008 results included favorable adjustments made to certain affiliates in Asia and the reversal of an antitrust fine. Selling and Administrative Expense (S&A) 2010 vs. 2009 S&A expense of $956.9 increased $13.5, or 1%, primarily due to higher incentive compensation costs, partially offset by improved productivity and the impact of the global cost reduction plan. S&A as a percent of sales decreased to 10.6% from 11.4%. 2009 vs. 2008 S&A expense of $943.4 decreased $147.0, or 13%. Underlying costs decreased 8%, primarily due to improved productivity as well as the impact of the global cost reduction plan, lower incentive compensation costs, and lower discretionary spending. This decrease was partially offset by inflation and higher bad debt expense. Favorable currency impacts, primarily the strengthening of the dollar against the Euro and Pound Sterling, decreased S&A by 6%. The acquisition of CryoService Limited in the third quarter of 2008 increased S&A by 1%. S&A as a percent of sales, increased to 11.4% from 10.5%, due principally to the impact of lower energy and raw material cost pass-through on sales. 21 Table of Contents 2011 Outlook S&A expense will increase in 2011 due to additional costs to support volume growth and the impacts of cost inflation. These increases will be partially offset by ongoing productivity initiatives. Research and Development (R&D) 2010 vs. 2009 R&D expense of $114.7 decreased 1%, or $1.6, primarily due to the impact of cost reduction actions. R&D as a percent of sales decreased to 1.3% from 1.4%. 2009 vs. 2008 R&D expense of $116.3 decreased $14.4, primarily due to the impact of cost reduction actions. R&D as a percent of sales increased to 1.4% from 1.3%. 2011 Outlook R&D expense is expected to be moderately higher in 2011. Global Cost Reduction Plan The 2009 results from continuing operations included a total charge of $298.2 ($200.3 after-tax, or $.94 per share) for the global cost reduction plan. In the first quarter of 2009, the Company announced the global cost reduction plan, designed to lower its cost structure and better align its businesses to reflect rapidly declining economic conditions around the world. The 2009 first-quarter results included a charge of $174.2 ($116.1 after-tax, or $.55 per share). In the third quarter 2009, due to the continuing slow economic recovery, the Company committed to additional actions associated with its global cost reduction plan that resulted in a charge of $124.0 ($84.2 after-tax, or $.39 per share). The total 2009 charge included $210.0 for severance and other benefits, including pension-related costs, associated with the elimination of approximately 2,550 positions from the Company global workforce. The remainder of this charge, $88.2, was for business exits and asset management actions. During 2010, the Company revised its estimate of the costs associated with the 2009 global cost reduction plan. The unfavorable impact of additional severance and other benefits was primarily offset by favorable variances related to completed business exits and asset management actions. These adjustments to the charge were excluded from segment operating profit and did not have a material impact on any individual segment. As of 30 September 2010, the planned actions associated with the global cost reduction plan were substantially completed, with the exception of certain benefit payments associated with a small number of position eliminations. In addition, as part of the asset management actions included in the plan, the Company anticipates completing the sale of a facility by the end of calendar year 2010. Refer to Note 5, Global Cost Reduction Plan, to the consolidated financial statements for additional details on this charge. Cost savings of approximately $155 were achieved through 2010. Beyond 2010, the Company expects annualized, ongoing savings of approximately $180, of which the majority is related to personnel costs. Acquisition-Related Costs In 2010, $96.0 ($60.1 after-tax, or $.28 per share) in expense was recognized related to the Airgas transaction and is included within acquisition-related costs on the consolidated income statement. Refer to Note 3, Airgas Transaction, to the consolidated financial statements for details of these costs. Customer Bankruptcy and Asset Actions On 6 January 2009, a customer of the Company who principally receives product from the Tonnage Gases segment began operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. As a result, the Company recognized a $22.2 ($13.9 after- tax, or $.07 per share) charge primarily for the write-off of certain receivables during the third quarter of 2009. Sales and operating income associated with this customer are not material to the Tonnage Gases segment results. In April 2010, the customer emerged from bankruptcy proceedings. The Company received a final settlement in the amount of $22.4, of which $16.0 was applied against the remaining outstanding receivables. Income of $6.4 ($4.0 after-tax, or $.02 per share) was recognized for the recovery of certain receivables that had been previously written off. This amount was recorded as a gain and is reflected within customer bankruptcy on the consolidated income statement. In the third quarter of 2009, the Company recorded a charge of $9.9 ($7.1 after-tax, or $.03 per share) for other asset actions which consisted of the closure of certain manufacturing facilities. This charge was reflected in cost of sales on the consolidated income statement. The 2009 customer bankruptcy charge combined with this asset write-down resulted in a total charge of $32.1 ($21.0 after-tax, or $.10 per share). 22 Table of Contents Pension Settlement The Company U.S. supplemental pension plan provides for a lump sum benefit payment option at the time of retirement, or for corporate officers, six months after the participant retirement date. The Company recognizes pension settlements when payments exceed the sum of the service and interest cost components of net periodic pension cost of the plan for the fiscal year. A settlement loss is recognized when the pension obligation is settled. The Company recognized $11.5, $10.7, and $30.3 of settlement charges in 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. Refer to Note 16, Retirement Benefits, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Other Income, Net Items recorded to other income arise from transactions and events not directly related to the principal income earning activities of the Company. The detail of other income is presented in Note 23, Supplemental Information, to the consolidated financial statements. 2010 vs. 2009 Other income of $38.7 increased $15.7, primarily due to a net gain on the sale of assets and favorable foreign exchange. Otherwise, no individual items were significant in comparison to the prior year. 2009 vs. 2008 Other income of $23.0 decreased by $2.8. Other income declined due to losses from asset sales in 2009 and unfavorable foreign exchange. Other income in 2008 included a loss related to fire damage at a production facility. No other items were individually significant in comparison to the prior year. Interest Expense 2010 2009 2008 Interest incurred $136.2 $143.8 $184.1 Less: Capitalized interest 14.3 21.9 22.1 Interest Expense $121.9 $121.9 $162.0 2010 vs. 2009 Interest incurred decreased $7.6. The decrease was driven by lower average interest rates on variable rate debt, partially offset by a higher average debt balance and the impact of a weaker dollar on the translation of foreign currency interest. The change in capitalized interest is driven by a decrease in project spending which qualified for capitalization. 2009 vs. 2008 Interest incurred decreased by $40.3. This decrease was primarily driven by lower average interest rates on variable rate debt. The impact of a stronger dollar on the translation of foreign currency interest was offset by a higher average debt balance. Capitalized interest was comparable to 2008 due to slightly higher project levels offset by lower average interest rates. 2011 Outlook The Company expects interest incurred to be modestly higher. This increase is expected to result from a higher average debt balance, higher fees on the Company committed credit facility, and slightly higher interest rates on variable rate debt. Effective Tax Rate The effective tax rate equals the income tax provision divided by income from continuing operations before taxes. Refer to Note 22, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements for details on factors affecting the effective tax rate. 2010 vs. 2009 On a GAAP basis, the effective tax rate was 24.4% and 22.1% in 2010 and 2009, respectively. On a non-GAAP basis, the effective tax rate was 25.2% and 25.3% in 2010 and 2009, respectively. 2009 vs. 2008 On a GAAP basis, the effective tax rate was 22.1% and 24.7% in 2009 and 2008, respectively. On a non-GAAP basis, the effective tax rate was 25.3% and 24.9% in 2009 and 2008, respectively. The effective tax rate was higher in 2009 due to lower tax credits and adjustments. 23 Table of Contents 2011 Outlook The Company expects the effective tax rate in 2011 to be approximately 25.0% to 26.0%. Discontinued Operations The U.S. Healthcare business, Polymer Emulsions business, and High Purity Process Chemicals (HPPC) business have been accounted for as discontinued operations. The results of operations of these businesses have been removed from the results of continuing operations for all periods presented. Refer to Note 6, Discontinued Operations, to the consolidated financial statements for additional details. U.S. Healthcare In July 2008, the Board of Directors authorized management to pursue the sale of the U.S. Healthcare business. In 2008, the Company recorded a total charge of $329.2 ($246.2 after-tax, or $1.12 per share) related to the impairment/write-down of the net carrying value of U.S. Healthcare business. In the first half of 2009, based on additional facts, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $48.7 ($30.9 after-tax, or $.15 per share), reflecting a revision in the estimated net realizable value of the business. Also, tax benefits of $25.5, or $.12 per share, were recorded to revise the estimated tax benefit associated with the total impairment charges recorded. During the third quarter of 2009, the Company sold more than half of its remaining U.S. Healthcare business for cash proceeds of $38.1. The Company recognized an after-tax gain of $.3 resulting from the sales combined with adjustments to net realizable value of the remaining businesses. During the fourth quarter of 2009, through a series of transactions, the Company sold its remaining U.S. Healthcare business for cash proceeds of $12.1. A net after-tax loss of $.7 was recognized. These transactions completed the disposal of the U.S. Healthcare business. The U.S. Healthcare business generated sales of $125.2 and $239.8, and a loss from operations, net of tax, of $3.4 and $259.4 in 2009 and 2008, respectively. The loss from operations in 2008 included an after-tax impairment charge of $237.0. Polymer Emulsions Business On 31 January 2008, the Company closed on the sale of its interest in its vinyl acetate ethylene (VAE) polymers joint ventures to Wacker Chemie AG, its long-time joint venture partner. As part of that agreement, the Company received Wacker Chemie AG interest in the Elkton, Md. and Piedmont, S.C. production facilities and their related businesses plus cash proceeds of $258.2. The Company recognized a gain on the sale of $89.5 ($57.7 after-tax, or $.26 per share). On 30 June 2008, the Company sold its Elkton, Md. and Piedmont, S.C. production facilities and the related North American atmospheric emulsions and global pressure sensitive adhesives businesses to Ashland, Inc. The Company recorded a gain of $30.5 ($18.5 after-tax, or $.08 per share) in connection with the sale, which included the recording of a retained environmental obligation associated with the Piedmont site. The sale of the Elkton and Piedmont facilities completed the disposal of the Company Polymer Emulsions business. The Polymer Emulsion business generated sales of $261.4 and income from operations, net of tax, of $16.7 in 2008. HPPC Business In 2008, the Company sold its HPPC business to KMG Chemicals, Inc. The sale closed on 31 December 2007, and a loss on the sale was recorded of $.5 ($.3 after-tax) in 2008. The HPPC business generated sales of $22.9 and income from operations, net of tax, of $.1 in 2008. Net Income 2010 vs. 2009 Net income was $1,029.1 compared to $631.3, and diluted earnings per share was $4.74 compared to $2.96. On a non-GAAP basis, net income was $1,089.2 compared to $857.6, and diluted earnings per share was $5.02 compared to $4.02. 2009 vs. 2008 Net income was $631.3 compared to $909.7, and diluted earnings per share was $2.96 compared to $4.15. On a non-GAAP basis, net income was $857.6 compared to $926.2, and diluted earnings per share was $4.02 compared to $4.23. 24 Table of Contents Segment Analysis Merchant Gases 2010 2009 2008 Sales $3,718.3 $3,610.6 $4,192.7 Operating income 729.4 661.2 789.5 Equity affiliates income 104.3 98.3 131.8 Merchant Gases Sales % Change from Prior Year 2010 2009 Underlying business Volume 2 % (9 )% Price (1 )% 4 % Currency 2 % (9 )% Total Merchant Gases Sales Change 3 % (14 )% 2010 vs. 2009 Sales of $3,718.3 increased by 3%, or $107.7. Sales increased 2% from favorable currency effects, due to a weaker U.S. dollar against key European and Asian currencies in the first half of the year. Underlying business increased 1% as volume increases, primarily in Asia, were partially offset by a decrease in pricing due to liquid hydrogen natural gas cost pass-through and unfavorable customer mix. In North America, sales were flat, as volume increases were offset by lower pricing and unfavorable customer mix. In Europe, sales were flat as favorable currency impacts were offset by lower pricing and unfavorable customer mix. In Asia, sales increased 20%, with volumes up 16% and a favorable currency impact of 4%. Volume increases were driven by steel, electronics and bulk hydrogen customers. Merchant Gases Operating Income Operating income of $729.4 increased 10%, or $68.2. The increase was primarily due to lower costs of $50, higher volumes of $32 and favorable currency of $8, partially offset by lower pricing and unfavorable customer mix of $22. The improved costs resulted from improved plant operating costs, distribution efficiency, and organizational restructuring benefits. Merchant Gases Equity Affiliates Income Merchant Gases equity affiliates income of $104.3 increased 6%, or $6.0. The increase was a result of higher volumes. 2009 vs. 2008 Merchant Gases Sales Sales of $3,610.6 decreased by 14%, or $582.1. Sales decreased 9% from unfavorable currency effects, driven primarily by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against key European and Asian currencies. Underlying sales declined 5%, with volumes down 9% and pricing up 4%. Volumes were weak across manufacturing end markets globally. Price increases implemented early in the year were effective, partially offsetting the decline in volume. The global recession significantly impacted manufacturing-related demand for Merchant industrial gases in every region. In North America, sales decreased 10%, with volumes down 14%. Higher pricing of 4% partially offset the decline in volumes. In Europe, sales decreased 17%, primarily due to unfavorable currency impacts of 13%. Underlying sales declined 4%, with volumes down 8% and pricing adding 4%. Stronger healthcare volumes partially offset the total volume decline. In Asia, sales declined 13%. Underlying sales were lower by 6%, with volumes declining 8% and pricing adding 2%. Currency unfavorably impacted sales by 7%. Merchant Gases Operating Income Operating income of $661.2 decreased 16%, or $128.3. The decline was due to reduced volumes of $234 and unfavorable currency impacts of $74. These declines were partially offset by improved pricing, net of variable costs, of $102 and improved cost performance of $78, primarily due to cost reduction efforts. 25 Table of Contents Merchant Gases Equity Affiliates Income Merchant Gases equity affiliates income of $98.3 decreased 25%, or $33.5. The decline was a result of lower overall volumes and unfavorable currency. Additionally, 2008 results included favorable adjustments made to certain affiliates in Asia and the reversal of an antitrust fine.

The reduced costs were a result of restructuring and productivity initiatives. 2009 vs. 2008 Electronics and Performance Materials Sales Sales of $1,582.2 declined 28%, or $627.1, as volumes declined 24%. Sales volumes declined significantly in the first half of 2009 and recovered sequentially in the second half. In Electronics, sales were down 35%, reflecting a significant global downturn in semiconductor and flat-panel capacity utilization and capital investment. In Performance Materials, sales were down 19% due to weaker demand across all end markets, partially offset by improved pricing. Electronics and Performance Materials Operating Income Operating income of $101.6 declined by 59%, or $144.3. Operating income declined from lower volumes of $202 as well as unfavorable pricing of $37. Lower pricing in Electronics was partially offset by higher pricing in Performance Materials. Favorable cost performance added $82, primarily due to cost reduction efforts. Results in 2008 included $15 of unfavorable impacts associated with a fire at a production facility. Equipment and Energy 2010 2009 2008 Sales $472.2 $489.8 $438.1 Operating income 67.3 42.2 38.9 2010 vs. 2009 Sales of $472.2 decreased 4%, or $17.6, due to lower air separation unit (ASU) sales. Operating income of $67.3 increased 59%, due to higher LNG heat exchanger activity, a gain on the sale of an asset, and lower project costs. The sales backlog for the Equipment business at 30 September 2010 was $274, compared to $239 at 30 September 2009. It is expected that approximately $250 of the backlog will be completed during 2011. 2009 vs. 2008 Sales of $489.8 increased by 12%, or $51.7, due to higher ASU activity. Operating income improved $3.3 from favorable cost performance and higher ASU sales, partially offset by lower LNG heat exchanger activity and unfavorable currency. The sales backlog for the Equipment business at 30 September 2009 was $239, compared to $399 at 30 September 2008. 27 Table of Contents Other Other operating income (loss) includes other expense and income that cannot be directly associated with the business segments, including foreign exchange gains and losses, interest income, and costs previously allocated to businesses now reported as discontinued operations. Also included are LIFO inventory adjustments, as the business segments use FIFO and the LIFO pool adjustments are not allocated to the business segments. Corporate general and administrative costs and research and development costs are fully allocated to the business segments. 2010 vs. 2009 Operating loss was $2.6 compared to $17.3, primarily due to favorable foreign exchange in the current year. No other individual items were significant in comparison to the prior year. 2009 vs. 2008 Operating loss of $17.3 decreased by $13.5. The decrease was primarily due to favorable LIFO inventory adjustments versus 2008. Unfavorable currency partially offset this decline. No other items were individually significant in comparison to the prior year. RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES The presentation of non-GAAP measures is intended to enhance the usefulness of financial information by providing measures which the Company management uses internally to evaluate the Company baseline performance on a comparable basis. Presented below are reconciliations of the reported GAAP results to the non-GAAP measures.

Cash flow from operations provided funding for the Company capital spending and dividend payments. The Company retained consistent access to commercial paper markets throughout the year. The Company cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities, as reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows, are summarized in the following table: 2010 2009 2008 Cash provided by (used for) Operating activities $1,522.4 $1,329.4 $1,658.8 Investing activities (1,056.5 ) (1,040.4 ) (919.8 ) Financing activities (579.7 ) 95.0 (677.7 ) Operating Activities 2010 vs. 2009 Net cash provided by operating activities increased $193.0, or 15%. The increase resulted from higher net income of $397.8 combined with the favorable impact of noncash adjustments to income of $191.2, partially offset by unfavorable changes in working capital of $396.0. Noncash adjustments include depreciation and amortization, impairment charges, deferred taxes, certain acquisition-related costs and share-based compensation cost. These adjustments also include changes in operating assets, such as noncurrent capital lease receivables, and liabilities which reflect timing differences between the receipt or disbursement of cash and their recognition in earnings. Favorable noncash adjustments to net income in 2010 primarily included the following: An increase in deferred income taxes of $148.5 due to pension funding and the utilization of foreign tax credits. Expense of $84.0 for the amortization of financing costs associated with the Airgas tender offer. A decrease in noncurrent capital lease receivables of $101.1. These favorable adjustments were partially offset by the impact of 2009 noncash impairment charges of $118.7 related to the global cost reduction plan and the discontinued U.S. Healthcare business. Changes in working capital increased cash used (negative cash flow variance) by $396.0 and included: A $301.5 negative cash flow variance due to higher trade receivables. The current year reflected a negative cash flow of $142.5 caused by rising sales, while the prior year reflected a positive cash flow of $159.0 resulting from a significant drop in sales. A $94.6 negative cash flow variance from inventories and contracts in progress primarily due to increased spending for inventory and projects to support higher business activity. 2009 vs. 2008 Net cash provided by operating activities decreased $329.4, or 20%. The decrease resulted from the reduction in net income of $278.4 combined with the unfavorable impact of noncash adjustments to income of $143.4, partially offset by favorable changes in working capital of $92.4. Net income in 2009 included noncash impairment charges of $118.7 related to the global cost reduction plan and the discontinued U.S. Healthcare business. In 2008, U.S. Healthcare noncash impairment charges totaling $314.8 were partially offset by gains of $105.9 on the sale of discontinued operations. Proceeds from the sale of assets and businesses are reflected as an investing activity. Changes in working capital decreased cash used (positive cash flow variance) by $92.4 and included: A $256.4 positive cash flow variance due to lower trade receivables as a result of lower sales. A $108.7 positive cash flow variance from other receivables due primarily to the recognition of a deferred tax asset in 2008 related to the U.S. Healthcare impairment charge. The recognition of this asset represented a use of cash in 2008. A $319.0 negative cash flow variance due to a higher use of cash for payables and accrued liabilities. This variance was due to a lower level of activity and the timing of payments. 30 Table of Contents Investing Activities 2010 vs. 2009 Cash used for investing increased $16.1, primarily due to: Capital expenditures for plant and equipment decreased by $148.2, consistent with the Company capital spending plan. The Company purchased approximately 1.5 million shares of Airgas stock for $69.6 prior to a tender offer as discussed in Note 3, Airgas Transaction, to the consolidated financial statements. Changes in restricted cash, due to lower project spending, resulted in a reduced source of cash of $53.4. The proceeds from the issuance of certain Industrial Revenue Bonds must be held in escrow until related project spending occurs and are classified as noncurrent assets in the consolidated balance sheet. The prior year included proceeds of $51.0 from the sale of the U.S. Healthcare business. 2009 vs. 2008 Cash used for investing increased $120.6, primarily from lower proceeds from the sale of discontinued operations of $372.0, partially offset by changes in restricted cash of $270.6. During 2009, the Company completed the sale of its U.S. Healthcare business, which generated proceeds of $51.0. In 2008, proceeds of $423.0 included the sales of the Polymer Emulsions and HPPC businesses. Decreases in the restricted cash balances, caused by project spending exceeding new bond proceeds, resulted in a source of cash of $87.0 in 2009. Activity in 2008 resulted in a use of cash of $183.6. Capital Expenditures Capital expenditures are detailed in the following table: 2010 2009 2008 Additions to plant and equipment $1,030.9 $1,179.1 $1,085.1 Acquisitions, less cash acquired 37.2 32.7 72.0 Short-term borrowings associated with SAGA acquisition ( A ) 60.9 Investments in and advances to unconsolidated affiliates 4.8 24.5 2.2 Capital Expenditures on a GAAP Basis $1,133.8 $1,236.3 $1,159.3 Capital lease expenditures ( B ) 122.6 238.6 195.7 Noncurrent liability related to purchase of shares from noncontrolling interests ( B ) 42.0 Capital Expenditures on a Non-GAAP Basis $1,298.4 $1,474.9 $1,355.0 (A) Noncash transaction. (B) The Company utilizes a non-GAAP measure in the computation of capital expenditures and includes spending associated with facilities accounted for as capital leases and purchases of noncontrolling interests. Certain contracts associated with facilities that are built to provide product to a specific customer are required to be accounted for as leases, and such spending is reflected as a use of cash within cash provided by operating activities. Additionally, the purchase of noncontrolling interests in a subsidiary is accounted for as an equity transaction and will be reflected as a financing activity in the consolidated statement of cash flows. Capital expenditures on a GAAP basis in 2010 totaled $1,133.8, compared to $1,236.3 in 2009, resulting in a reduction of $102.5. Additions to plant and equipment were largely in support of the Merchant Gases and Tonnage Gases businesses during both 2010 and 2009. Additions to plant and equipment also included support capital of a routine, ongoing nature, including expenditures for distribution equipment and facility improvements. Capital expenditures on a non-GAAP basis in 2010 totaled $1,298.4, compared to $1,474.9 in 2009. Capital lease expenditures of $122.6 decreased by $116.0, reflecting lower project spending. In 2009, capital lease expenditures of $238.6 increased $42.9 from 2008, reflecting higher project spending, primarily in North America Tonnage Gases. 2011 Outlook Excluding acquisitions, capital expenditures for new plant and equipment in 2011 on a GAAP basis are expected to be between $1,400 and $1,500, and on a non-GAAP basis are expected to be between $1,500 and $1,700. The non-GAAP capital expenditures include spending associated with facilities accounted for as capital leases which are expected to be between $100 and $200. The majority of spending is expected in the Tonnage Gases segment, with 31 Table of Contents approximately $1,000 associated with new plants. It is anticipated that capital expenditures will be funded principally with cash from continuing operations. In addition, the Company intends to continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities and investments in equity affiliates. Financing Activities 2010 vs. 2009 Cash used by financing activities increased $674.7, primarily due to: A decrease in long-term proceeds of $384.3. The prior year included proceeds of $400.0 from the issuance of a fixed-rate 4.375% 10-year senior note. An increase in payments on long-term debt of $353.5, resulting primarily from the repayment of a 250 Eurobond ($306.8). 2009 vs. 2008 Cash provided by financing activities increased $772.7, primarily as a result of share repurchases of $793.4 in 2008. In 2009, the Company did not purchase any of its outstanding shares. Financing and Capital Structure Capital needs in 2010 were satisfied primarily with cash from operations. At the end of 2010, total debt outstanding was $4.1 billion compared to $4.5 billion, and cash and cash items were $.4 billion compared to $.5 billion. Total debt at 30 September 2010 and 2009, expressed as a percentage of the sum of total debt and total equity, was 42.0% and 47.7%, respectively. Long-term debt proceeds of $226.2 included $85.0 from the issuance of Industrial Revenue Bonds. Refer to Note 15, Debt, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. In February 2010, the Company commenced a tender offer to acquire all outstanding common stock of Airgas as further discussed in Note 3, Airgas Transaction, to the consolidated financial statements. In connection with this tender offer, the Company has secured committed financing in the form of a $6.7 billion term loan credit facility. Borrowings under this credit facility will be available beginning on the date of the consummation of the tender offer, which must occur no later than 4 February 2011. All borrowings under this credit facility will mature on the date that is one year from the consummation of the tender offer. The credit facility agreement contains one financial covenant, a maximum leverage ratio, and other affirmative and negative covenants, including restrictions on liens and certain subsidiary indebtedness. It also requires mandatory commitment reduction/prepayment for certain capital market transactions and asset dispositions. Fees incurred to secure this credit facility have been deferred and are being amortized over the term of the arrangement. The Company has obtained the commitment of a number of commercial banks to lend money at market rates whenever needed. At 30 September 2009, the Company total multicurrency committed credit facility amounted to $1,450. On 8 July 2010, the Company replaced this facility with a new $2,000 multicurrency committed credit facility maturing on 8 July 2013. Facility fees were modified to reflect current market rates. The Company has one financial covenant associated with this new credit facility. The covenant indicates that the ratio of total debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) shall not exceed 3.0. This credit facility provides a source of liquidity and is used to support the issuance of commercial paper. No borrowings were outstanding under this commitment at the end of 2010. Additional commitments totaling $518.7 are maintained by the Company foreign subsidiaries, of which $345.2 was borrowed and outstanding at 30 September 2010. In 2007, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1,000 of the Company outstanding common stock. During 2010, the Company did not purchase any shares under this authorization. At 30 September 2010, $649.2 in share repurchase authorization remained. 2011 Outlook Exclusive of the potential Airgas transaction described above, the Company projects a limited need to access the long-term debt markets in 2011 due to its projected operating cash flows, modest debt maturities and available cash balance at the end of 2010. Should the Airgas transaction occur, the Company expects to fund this acquisition primarily with new debt financing. The Company expects that it will continue to be in compliance with all of its financial covenants. Also, the Company anticipates that it will continue to be able to access the commercial paper and other short-term debt markets. 32 Table of Contents Dividends On 18 March 2010, the Board of Directors increased the quarterly cash dividend from $.45 per share to $.49 per share. Dividends are declared by the Board of Directors and are usually paid during the sixth week after the close of the fiscal quarter. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS The Company is obligated to make future payments under various contracts, such as debt agreements, lease agreements, unconditional purchase obligations, and other long-term obligations. The following table summarizes these obligations of the Company as of 30 September 2010: Payments Due By Period Total 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Thereafter Long-term debt obligations Debt maturities $3,842 $182 $453 $335 $488 $444 $1,940 Contractual interest 698 122 109 93 72 58 244 Capital leases 11 2 2 2 1 1 3 Operating leases 190 50 38 28 18 13 43 Pension obligations 1,042 247 104 136 90 92 373 Unconditional purchase obligations 1,466 482 100 103 112 118 551 Other liabilities 103 61 42 Total Contractual Obligations $7,352 $1,146 $848 $697 $781 $726 $3,154 Long-Term Debt Obligations The long-term debt obligations include the maturity payments of long-term debt, including current portion, and the related contractual interest obligations. Refer to Note 15, Debt, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on long-term debt. Contractual interest is the interest the Company is contracted to pay on the long-term debt obligations without taking into account the interest impact of interest rate swaps related to any of this debt, which at current interest rates would slightly decrease contractual interest. The Company had $1,240 of long-term debt subject to variable interest rates at 30 September 2010, excluding fixed-rate debt that has been swapped to variable-rate debt. The rate assumed for the variable interest component of the contractual interest obligation was the rate in effect at 30 September 2010. Variable interest rates are primarily determined by interbank offer rates and by U.S. short-term tax-exempt interest rates. Leases Refer to Note 12, Leases, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on capital and operating leases. Pension Obligations The amounts in the table above represent the current estimated cash payments to be made by the Company that in total equal the recognized pension liabilities. Refer to Note 16, Retirement Benefits, to the consolidated financial statements. These payments are based upon the current valuation assumptions and regulatory environment. The total accrued liability for pension benefits is impacted by interest rates, plan demographics, actual return on plan assets, continuation or modification of benefits, and other factors. Such factors can significantly impact the amount of the liability and related contributions. Unconditional Purchase Obligations Most of the Company long-term unconditional purchase obligations relate to feedstock supply for numerous HyCO (hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and syngas) facilities. The price of feedstock supply is principally related to the price of natural gas. However, long-term take-or-pay sales contracts to HyCO customers are generally matched to the term of the feedstock supply obligations and provide recovery of price increases in the feedstock supply. Due to the matching of most long-term feedstock supply obligations to customer sales contracts, the Company does not believe these purchase obligations would have a material effect on its financial condition or results of operations. Refer to Note 17, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements. The above unconditional purchase obligations include other product supply commitments and also electric power and natural gas supply purchase obligations. In addition, purchase commitments to spend approximately $330 for additional plant and equipment are included in the unconditional purchase obligations in 2011. 33 Table of Contents The Company also purchases materials, energy, capital equipment, supplies, and services as part of the ordinary course of business under arrangements that are not unconditional purchase obligations. The majority of such purchases are for raw materials and energy, which are obtained under requirements-type contracts at market prices. In total, purchases by the Company approximate $6.3 billion annually, including the unconditional purchase obligations in the table above. Other Liabilities Other liabilities includes the obligation to purchase the remaining outstanding shares of the French SAGA group (SAGA) for a fixed price of 44.8, or approximately $61, and the obligation to purchase 25% of the remaining shares of CryoService Limited (CSL) for $42.0. In the second quarter of 2010, the Company entered into agreements that will enable it to acquire 100% of the outstanding shares of SAGA. Under the terms of these agreements, the Company purchased 51.47% of the shares in March 2010. The remaining shares are expected to be purchased by the end of calendar year 2010 for a fixed price of 44.8, or approximately $61, under a put and call option structure. At 30 September 2010, this structure was accounted for as a financing of the purchase of the remaining shares and reported within short-term borrowings on the consolidated balance sheet. Refer to Note 4, Business Combinations, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Additionally, in June 2010, the Company entered into agreements obligating it to purchase 25% of the remaining shares of CSL. The agreements require the consideration, which is based on a multiple of earnings formula, to be remitted in January 2012. At 30 September 2010, the liability amounted to $42.0 and has been reported in other noncurrent liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. Refer to Note 20, Noncontrolling Interests, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Income Tax Liabilities Noncurrent deferred income tax liabilities as of 30 September 2010 were $335.1. Refer to Note 22, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements. Tax liabilities related to uncertain tax positions as of 30 September 2010 were $233.7. These tax liabilities were not included in the Contractual Obligations table, as it is impractical to determine a cash impact by year. PENSION BENEFITS The Company and certain of its subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension plans that cover a substantial portion of its worldwide employees. The principal defined benefit pension plans the U.S. salaried pension plan and the U.K. pension plan were closed to new participants in 2005 and were replaced with defined contribution plans. The move to defined contribution plans has not had a material impact on retirement program cost levels or funding. Over the long run, however, the defined contribution plans are expected to reduce volatility of both expense and contributions. For 2010, the fair market value of pension plan assets for the Company defined benefit plans as of the measurement date increased to $2,711.6 from $2,251.0 in 2009. The projected benefit obligation for these plans as of the measurement date was $3,753.6 and $3,386.0 in 2010 and 2009, respectively. The increase in the obligation was due principally to a decrease in the weighted average discount rate used to measure future benefit obligations to 5.0% from 5.6%. Refer to Note 16, Retirement Benefits, to the consolidated financial statements for comprehensive and detailed disclosures on the Company postretirement benefits. Pension Expense 2010 2009 2008 Pension expense $109.0 $110.0 $127.0 Special terminations, settlements, and curtailments (included above) 14.8 43.8 31.5 Weighted average discount rate 5.6 % 7.1 % 6.1 % Weighted average expected rate of return on plan assets 8.2 % 8.3 % 8.8 % Weighted average expected rate of compensation increase 4.1 % 4.3 % 4.2 % 2010 vs. 2009 The increase in pension expense, net of special items, was primarily attributable to the 150 basis point decrease in the weighted average discount rate, resulting in higher amortization of actuarial losses. The increase was partially offset by a higher expected return on plan assets due to higher contributions. Expense in 2010 included $14.8 of special termination and settlement charges, of which $2.8 was related to the global cost reduction plan. 34 Table of Contents 2009 vs. 2008 The decrease in pension expense was primarily attributable to the 100 basis point increase in the weighted average discount rate. Expense in 2009 included $43.8 of special termination, settlement, and curtailment charges, of which $32.3 was related to the global cost reduction plan. 2011 Outlook Pension expense is estimated to be approximately $122 in 2011, an increase of $27.8 from 2010, net of special terminations and settlements. In 2011, pension expense will include approximately $94 for amortization of actuarial losses versus $66.8 in 2010. Actuarial losses of $294.8 were incurred in 2010, resulting primarily from lower discount rates. Actuarial gains/losses, in excess of certain thresholds, are amortized into pension expense over the average remaining service lives of the employees to the extent they are not offset by future gains or losses. Future changes in the discount rate and actual returns on plan assets, different from expected returns, would impact the actuarial gains/losses and resulting amortization in years beyond 2011. Pension Funding Pension funding includes both contributions to funded plans and benefit payments under unfunded plans. With respect to funded plans, the Company funding policy is that contributions, combined with appreciation and earnings, will be sufficient to pay benefits without creating unnecessary surpluses. In addition, the Company makes contributions to satisfy all legal funding requirements while managing its capacity to benefit from tax deductions attributable to plan contributions. The Company analyzes the liabilities and demographics of each plan, which help guide the level of contributions. During 2010 and 2009, the Company cash contributions to funded plans and benefit payments under unfunded plans were $406.6 and $184.8, respectively. The majority of the cash contributions were voluntary. Cash contributions to defined benefit plans, including benefit payments for unfunded plans, are estimated to be approximately $247 in 2011. Of this amount, $200 was contributed in October 2010. Actual future contributions will depend on future funding legislation, discount rates, investment performance, plan design, and various other factors. Refer to the Contractual Obligations discussion on page 33 for a projection of future contributions. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS The Company is subject to various environmental laws and regulations in the countries in which it has operations. Compliance with these laws and regulations results in higher capital expenditures and costs. From time to time, the Company is involved in proceedings under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (the federal Superfund law), similar state laws, and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) relating to the designation of certain sites for investigation and possible cleanup. The Company accounting policy for environmental expenditures is discussed in Note 1, Major Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements, and environmental loss contingencies are discussed in Note 17, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements. The amounts charged to income from continuing operations related to environmental matters totaled $31.6, $52.5, and $49.9 in 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. These amounts represent an estimate of expenses for compliance with environmental laws, remedial activities, and activities undertaken to meet internal Company standards. Future costs are not expected to be materially different from these amounts. The 2009 amount included a charge of $16.0 for the Paulsboro site. Refer to Note 17, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on this charge. The 2008 amount included revised cost estimates for several existing sites. Although precise amounts are difficult to determine, the Company estimates that in both 2010 and 2009, it spent approximately $6 on capital projects to control pollution. Capital expenditures to control pollution in future years are estimated to be approximately $6 in both 2011 and 2012. The Company accrues environmental investigatory and remediation costs for identified sites when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. The potential exposure for such costs is estimated to range from $87 to a reasonably possible upper exposure of $101. The consolidated balance sheets at 30 September 2010 and 2009 included an accrual of $87.0 and $95.0, respectively. The accrual for the environmental obligations relating to the Pace, Florida; Piedmont, South Carolina; and the Paulsboro, New Jersey facilities is included in these amounts. Refer to Note 17, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements for further details on these facilities. 35 Table of Contents Actual costs to be incurred at identified sites in future periods may vary from the estimates, given inherent uncertainties in evaluating environmental exposures. Subject to the imprecision in estimating future environmental costs, the Company does not expect that any sum it may have to pay in connection with environmental matters in excess of the amounts recorded or disclosed above would have a materially adverse impact on its financial position or results of operations in any one year. Some of the Company operations are within jurisdictions that have, or are developing, regulations governing emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG). These include existing and expanding coverage under the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme; mandatory reporting and reductions at manufacturing facilities in Alberta, Canada; and mandatory reporting and anticipated constraints on GHG emissions in California and Ontario. In the U.S., regional initiatives have been implemented that will regulate GHG emissions from fossil fuel-driven power plants, and some federal legislative proposals also focus on such power plants. As a large consumer of electric power, the Company could be impacted by increased costs that may arise from such regulatory controls. In addition, federal legislation has been introduced in the U.S. that would regulate GHG emissions from the Company hydrogen facilities and other operations, such as production of fluorinated gases manufactured by the Company. In addition, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has taken preliminary actions towards regulating GHG emissions. Increased public awareness and concern may result in more international, U.S. federal, and/or regional requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of GHG. The Company may incur costs related to GHG emissions from its hydrogen facilities and other operations such as fluorinated gases production. The Company believes it will be able to mitigate some of the potential costs through its contractual terms, but the lack of definitive legislation or regulatory requirements prevents accurate prediction of the long-term impact on the Company. Any legislation that limits or taxes GHG emissions from Company facilities could impact the Company growth by increasing its operating costs or reducing demand for certain of its products. Regulation of GHG may also produce new opportunities for the Company. The Company continues to develop technologies to help its facilities and its customers lower energy consumption, improve efficiency, and lower emissions. The Company is also developing a portfolio of technologies that capture carbon dioxide from power and chemical plants before it reaches the atmosphere, enable cleaner transportation fuels, and facilitate alternate fuel source development. In addition, the potential demand for clean coal and the Company carbon capture solutions could increase demand for oxygen, one of the Company main products, and the Company proprietary technology for delivering low-cost oxygen. OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS The Company has entered into certain guarantee agreements as discussed in Note 17, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements. The Company is not a primary beneficiary in any material variable interest entity. The Company does not have any derivative instruments indexed to its own stock. The Company off-balance sheet arrangements are not reasonably likely to have a material impact on financial condition, changes in financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS The Company principal related parties are equity affiliates operating primarily in the industrial gas business. The Company did not engage in any material transactions involving related parties that included terms or other aspects that differ from those which would be negotiated at arm length with clearly independent parties. INFLATION The consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP and do not fully reflect the impact of prior years inflation. While the U.S. inflation rate has been modest for several years, the Company operates in many countries that experience volatility in inflation and foreign exchange rates. The ability to pass on inflationary cost increases is an uncertainty due to general economic conditions and competitive situations. It is estimated that the cost of replacing the Company plant and equipment today is greater than its historical cost. Accordingly, depreciation expense would be greater if the expense were stated on a current cost basis. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Note 1, Major Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements describes the Company major accounting policies. Judgments and estimates of uncertainties are required in applying the Company accounting policies in many areas. However, application of the critical accounting policies discussed below requires 36 Table of Contents management significant judgments, often as the result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. If actual results were to differ materially from the estimates made, the reported results could be materially affected. The Company management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and estimates and related disclosures with its audit committee. Depreciable Lives of Plant and Equipment Net plant and equipment at 30 September 2010 totaled $7,051.3, and depreciation expense totaled $837.7 during 2010. Plant and equipment is recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method, which deducts equal amounts of the cost of each asset from earnings every year over its estimated economic useful life. Economic useful life is the duration of time an asset is expected to be productively employed by the Company, which may be less than its physical life. Assumptions on the following factors, among others, affect the determination of estimated economic useful life: wear and tear, obsolescence, technical standards, contract life, market demand, competitive position, raw material availability, and geographic location. The estimated economic useful life of an asset is monitored to determine its appropriateness, especially in light of changed business circumstances. For example, changes in technology, changes in the estimated future demand for products, or excessive wear and tear may result in a shorter estimated useful life than originally anticipated. In these cases, the Company would depreciate the remaining net book value over the new estimated remaining life, thereby increasing depreciation expense per year on a prospective basis. Likewise, if the estimated useful life is increased, the adjustment to the useful life decreases depreciation expense per year on a prospective basis. The Company has numerous long-term customer supply contracts, particularly in the gases on-site business within the Tonnage Gases segment. These contracts principally have initial contract terms of 15 to 20 years. There are also long-term customer supply contracts associated with the tonnage gases business within the Electronics and Performance Materials segment. These contracts principally have initial terms of 10 to 15 years. Depreciable lives of the production assets related to long-term contracts are matched to the contract lives. Extensions to the contract term of supply frequently occur prior to the expiration of the initial term. As contract terms are extended, the depreciable life of the remaining net book value of the production assets is adjusted to match the new contract term. The depreciable lives of production facilities within the Merchant Gases segment are principally 15 years. Customer contracts associated with products produced at these types of facilities typically have a much shorter term. The depreciable lives of production facilities within the Electronics and Performance Materials segment, where there is not an associated long-term supply agreement, range from 10 to 15 years. These depreciable lives have been determined based on historical experience combined with judgment on future assumptions such as technological advances, potential obsolescence, competitors actions, etc. Management monitors its assumptions and may potentially need to adjust depreciable life as circumstances change. A change in the depreciable life by one year for production facilities within the Merchant Gases and Electronics and Performance Materials segments for which there is not an associated long-term customer supply agreement would impact annual depreciation expense as summarized below: Decrease Life By 1 Year Increase Life By 1 Year Merchant Gases $19 $(14 ) Electronics and Performance Materials $15 $(12 ) Impairment of Long-Lived Assets Plant and Equipment Plant and equipment held for use is grouped for impairment testing at the lowest level for which there is identifiable cash flows. Impairment testing of the asset group occurs whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. Such circumstances would include a significant decrease in the market value of a long-lived asset grouping, a significant adverse change in the manner in which the asset grouping is being used or in its physical condition, a history of operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset grouping, or changes in the expected useful life of the long-lived assets. There were no such events or changes in circumstances that occurred during the reporting periods. If such circumstances are determined to exist, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by that asset group is compared to the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists. If an asset group is determined to be 37 Table of Contents impaired, the loss is measured based on the difference between the asset group fair value and its carrying value. An estimate of the asset group fair value is based on the discounted value of its estimated cash flows. Assets to be disposed of by sale are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. The assumptions underlying cash flow projections represent management best estimates at the time of the impairment review. Factors that management must estimate include industry and market conditions, sales volume and prices, costs to produce, inflation, etc. Changes in key assumptions or actual conditions that differ from estimates could result in an impairment charge. The Company uses reasonable and supportable assumptions when performing impairment reviews and cannot predict the occurrence of future events and circumstances that could result in impairment charges. Goodwill The acquisition method of accounting for business combinations currently requires the Company to make use of estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price paid for acquisitions to the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets. Goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of net assets of an acquired entity. Goodwill, including goodwill associated with equity affiliates of $60.2, was $974.8 as of 30 September 2010. The majority of the Company goodwill is assigned to reporting units within the Merchant Gases and Electronics and Performance Materials segments. Disclosures related to goodwill are included in Note 10, Goodwill, to the consolidated financial statements. The Company performs an impairment test annually in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year. In addition, goodwill would be tested more frequently if changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events indicated that potential impairment exists. The impairment test requires the Company to compare the fair value of business reporting units to carrying value, including assigned goodwill. The Company has designated its reporting units for goodwill impairment testing as one level below the operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and whose operating results are reviewed by segment managers regularly. Currently, the Company has four business segments and fifteen reporting units. Reporting units are primarily based on products and geographic locations within each business segment. In the fourth quarter of 2010, the Company conducted the required annual test of goodwill for impairment. The Company determined that the fair value of each of the reporting units substantially exceeded its carrying value, and therefore there were no indications of impairment. The Company primarily uses an income approach valuation model, representing the present value of future cash flows, to determine fair value of a reporting unit. The Company valuation model uses a five-year growth period for the business and an estimated exit trading multiple. Management has determined the income approach valuation model represents the most appropriate valuation methodology due to the capital intensive nature of the business, long-term contractual nature of the business, relatively consistent cash flows generated by the Company reporting units, and limited comparables within the industry. The principal assumptions utilized in the Company income approach valuation model include revenue growth rate, operating profit margins, discount rate, and exit multiple. Revenue growth rate and operating profit assumptions are consistent with those utilized in the Company operating plan and long-term financial planning process. The discount rate assumption is calculated based upon an estimated weighted-average cost of capital which includes factors such as the risk-free rate of return, cost of debt, and expected equity premiums. The exit multiple is determined from comparable industry transactions. Also, the expected cash flows consider the customer attrition rate assumption, which is based on historical experience and current and future expected market conditions. Management judgment is required in the determination of each assumption utilized in the valuation model, and actual results could differ from the estimates. Intangible Assets Intangible assets at 30 September 2010 totaled $285.7 and consisted primarily of customer relationships, purchased patents, and technology. The Company has no acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives. Intangible assets are tested for impairment as part of the long-lived asset grouping impairment tests. Impairment testing of the asset group occurs whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. See impairment discussion above under Plant and Equipment for a description of how impairment losses are determined. Equity Investments Investments in and advances to equity affiliates totaled $912.8 at 30 September 2010. The majority of the Company investments are non-publicly traded ventures with other companies in the industrial gas business. Summarized 38 Table of Contents financial information of equity affiliates is included in Note 8, Summarized Financial Information of Equity Affiliates, to the consolidated financial statements. Equity investments are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment may not be recoverable. In the event that a decline in fair value of an investment occurs, and the decline in value is considered to be other than temporary, an impairment loss would be recognized. Management estimate of fair value of an investment is based on estimated discounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the investee. Changes in key assumptions about the financial condition of an investee or actual conditions that differ from estimates could result in an impairment charge. Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities measured using the enacted tax rate. At 30 September 2010, accrued income taxes and deferred tax liabilities amounted to $73.6 and $335.1, respectively. Tax liabilities related to uncertain tax positions as of 30 September 2010 were $233.7. Current and noncurrent deferred tax assets equaled $209.6 at 30 September 2010. Income tax expense was $339.5 for the year ended 30 September 2010. Management judgment is required in determining income tax expense and the related balance sheet amounts. Judgments are required concerning the ultimate outcome of tax contingencies and the realization of deferred tax assets. Actual income taxes paid may vary from estimates, depending upon changes in income tax laws, actual results of operations, and the final audit of tax returns by taxing authorities. Tax assessments may arise several years after tax returns have been filed. The Company believes that its recorded tax liabilities adequately provide for the probable outcome of these assessments. Deferred tax assets are recorded for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. However, when there are not sufficient sources of future taxable income to realize the benefit of the operating losses or tax credit carryforwards, these deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance. A valuation allowance is recognized if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is considered more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The factors used to assess the likelihood of realization include forecasted future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize or renew net deferred tax assets in order to avoid the potential loss of future tax benefits. The effect of a change in the valuation allowance is reported in the current period tax expense. A 1% point increase/decrease in the Company effective tax rate would have decreased/increased net income by approximately $14. Pension Benefits The amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements for pension benefits under the defined benefit plans are determined on an actuarial basis utilizing numerous assumptions. The discussion that follows provides information on the significant assumptions and expense associated with the defined benefit plans. Actuarial models are used in calculating the pension expense and liability related to the various defined benefit plans. These models have an underlying assumption that the employees render service over their service lives on a relatively consistent basis; therefore, the expense of benefits earned should follow a similar pattern. Several assumptions and statistical variables are used in the models to calculate the expense and liability related to the plans. The Company determines assumptions about the discount rate, the expected rate of return on plan assets, and the rate of compensation increase. Note 16, Retirement Benefits, to the consolidated financial statements includes disclosure of these rates on a weighted-average basis for both the domestic and international plans. The actuarial models also use assumptions about demographic factors such as retirement age, mortality, and turnover rates. The Company believes the actuarial assumptions are reasonable. However, actual results could vary materially from these actuarial assumptions due to economic events and different rates of retirement, mortality, and turnover. One of the critical assumptions used in the actuarial models is the discount rate. This rate reflects the prevailing market rate for high-quality, fixed-income debt instruments with maturities corresponding to the expected duration of the benefit obligations on the annual measurement date for each of the various plans. The rate is used to discount the future cash flows of benefit obligations back to the measurement date. For the U.S. plans, the timing and amount of expected benefit cash flows are matched with an interest rate curve applicable to the returns of high quality corporate bonds over the expected benefit payment period to determine an overall effective discount rate. In making this 39 Table of Contents determination, the Company considers the yields on the Citigroup Pension Discount Curve and the Citigroup Above Median Pension Discount Curve, the general movement of interest rates, and the changes in those rates from one period to the next. This rate can change from year-to-year based on market conditions that affect corporate bond yields. A higher discount rate decreases the present value of the benefit obligations and results in lower pension expense. A 50 basis point increase/decrease in the discount rate decreases/increases pension expense by approximately $23 per year. The expected rate of return on plan assets represents the average rate of return to be earned by plan assets over the period that the benefits included in the benefit obligation are to be paid. The expected return on plan assets assumption is based on an estimated weighted average of long-term returns of major asset classes. In determining asset class returns, the Company takes into account long-term returns of major asset classes, historical performance of plan assets, and related value of active management, as well as the current interest rate environment. Asset allocation is determined by an asset/liability study that takes into account plan demographics, asset returns, and acceptable levels of risk. Lower returns on the plan assets result in higher pension expense. A 50 basis point increase/decrease in the estimated rate of return on plan assets decreases/increases pension expense by approximately $14 per year. The Company uses a market-related valuation method for recognizing investment gains or losses. Investment gains or losses are the difference between the expected and actual return based on the market-related value of assets. This method recognizes investment gains or losses over a five-year period from the year in which they occur, which reduces year-to-year volatility. Expense in future periods will be impacted as gains or losses are recognized in the market-related value of assets over the five-year period. The expected rate of compensation increase is another key assumption. The Company determines this rate based on review of the underlying long-term salary increase trend characteristic of labor markets and historical experience, as well as comparison to peer companies. A 50 basis point increase/decrease in the expected rate of compensation increases/decreases pension expense by approximately $12 per year. Loss Contingencies In the normal course of business the Company encounters contingencies, i.e., situations involving varying degrees of uncertainty as to the outcome and effect on the Company. The Company accrues a liability for loss contingencies when it is considered probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. When only a range of possible loss can be established, the most probable amount in the range is accrued. If no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount within the range, the minimum amount in the range is accrued. Contingencies include those associated with litigation and environmental matters for which the Company accounting policy is discussed in Note 1, Major Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements, and particulars are provided in Note 17, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements. Significant judgment is required in both determining probability and whether the amount of loss associated with a contingency can be reasonably estimated. These determinations are made based on the best available information at the time. As additional information becomes available, the Company reassesses probability and estimates of loss contingencies. Revisions in the estimates associated with loss contingencies could have a significant impact on the Company results of operations in the period in which an accrual for loss contingencies is recorded or adjusted. For example, due to the inherent uncertainties related to environmental exposures, a significant increase to environmental liabilities could occur if a new site is designated, the scope of remediation is increased, or the Company proportionate share is increased. Similarly, a future charge for regulatory fines or damage awards associated with litigation could have a significant impact on the Company net income in the period in which it is recorded. NEW ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE See Note 2, New Accounting Guidance, to the consolidated financial statements for information concerning the Company implementation and impact of new accounting guidance. 40 Table of Contents FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This Management Discussion and Analysis contains forward-looking statements within the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including projections, plans, estimates and expectations regarding future operations, financial performance, costs and capital expenditures, projects, and applications and technologies.
