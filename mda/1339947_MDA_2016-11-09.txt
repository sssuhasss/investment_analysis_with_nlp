We operate through two reporting segments: Media Networks and Filmed Entertainment . Our measure of segment performance is adjusted operating income. We define adjusted operating income for our segments as operating income, before equity-based compensation and certain other items identified as affecting comparability, when applicable. Equity-based compensation is excluded from our segment measure of performance since it is set and approved by the Compensation Committee of Viacom Board of Directors in consultation with corporate executive management, and is included as a component of consolidated adjusted operating income. Media Networks Our Media Networks segment, which includes brands such as Nickelodeon, Comedy Central, MTV, VH1, SPIKE, BET, CMT, TV Land, Nick at Nite, Nick Jr., Channel 5 (in the United Kingdom), Logo, Nicktoons, TeenNick and Paramount Channel, provides entertainment content and related branded products for consumers in targeted demographics attractive to advertisers, content distributors and retailers. Media Networks also operates branded experiences including channels on streaming services and social media platforms such as DIRECTV NOW and Snapchat Discover. On October 31, 2016, we announced the establishment of our Global Entertainment Group as a new brand group to combine Viacom International Media Networks, our former Music & Entertainment Group, as well as TV Land and CMT (which had previously been part of our Kids & Family Group). We also announced that our former Kids & Family Group would be reestablished as the Nickelodeon Group. We create, acquire and distribute programming and other content for our audiences across multiple platforms, which allows our audiences to engage and interact with our content in a variety of ways: through cable and satellite distribution; through over-the-top ( OTT ) services, such as subscription video-on-demand ( SVOD ); on connected televisions, PCs, tablets, smartphones and other connected devices; using apps, browsers and other interfaces; and through a variety of social media platforms. Our Media Networks segment generates advertising, affiliate and ancillary revenues. 34 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) Advertising Revenues Advertising revenues are generated from the sale of advertising and from marketing services. Demand and pricing for our advertising depend on the attractiveness of our offerings to advertisers, viewership, and overall market conditions. We also drive additional demand through: integrated sales of multi-platform advertising and marketing opportunities; our integrated marketing services, which provide unique branded entertainment and custom sponsorship opportunities to our advertisers; and our continued investment in proprietary data platforms and advanced analytics, such as Viacom Vantage and Viacom Echo, that enable our customers to better target and measure the impact of their advertising. Our advertising revenues may be affected by the strength of advertising markets and general economic conditions, and may fluctuate depending on the success and availability of our programming, as measured by viewership, at any given time. Measured viewership may vary due to the success and availability of our programming, the timing of availability of new episodes of popular programming, and the performance of competing programs and other entertainment alternatives for viewers, as well as variations related to the methods used by third parties to measure viewership. Advertising revenues may also fluctuate due to seasonal variations, the timing of holidays and significant programming events such as awards shows and premieres. Typically, advertising revenues are highest in the first and fourth quarters of our fiscal year. Affiliate Revenues Affiliate revenues are generated through affiliate fees from distributors of our programming and program services, such as cable television operators, direct-to-home satellite television operators, Internet distributors, mobile networks and SVOD and other OTT services. Our agreements with multichannel television service providers are generally multi-year carriage agreements with set rate increases. The amount of the fees we receive is generally a function of the number of subscribers and the rates we receive per subscriber. Expirations of these affiliate agreements are staggered. Under SVOD and other OTT agreements, we make multiple programs available for distribution on one or more dates. Our revenue under these OTT agreements is recognized upon the availability of the programs licensed and therefore revenue will fluctuate depending on the timing of when programming is made available throughout the license period. Ancillary Revenues Ancillary revenues are principally derived from (i) consumer products, which includes licensing our brands and intellectual property, creation and publishing of interactive games across various platforms (including mobile, PC and console), and recreation experiences, (ii) viewing of our programming through download-to-own and download-to-rent services and the sale of DVDs and Blu-Ray discs and (iii) television syndication. Our ancillary revenues vary based on consumer spending, the popularity of our programming, volume of content available during a particular period and acceptance of our or our partners products. Media Networks segment expenses consist of operating expenses, selling, general and administrative ( SG&A ) expenses and depreciation and amortization. Operating expenses are comprised of costs related to original and acquired programming, including programming amortization, expenses associated with the distribution of home entertainment products and consumer products licensing, participations and residuals, integrated marketing expenses and other costs of sales. SG&A expenses consist primarily of employee compensation, marketing, research and professional service fees and facility and occupancy costs. Depreciation and amortization expenses reflect depreciation of fixed assets, including transponders financed under capital leases, and amortization of finite-lived intangible assets. Filmed Entertainment Our Filmed Entertainment segment produces, finances, acquires and distributes motion pictures, television programming and other entertainment content under the Paramount Pictures, Paramount Animation, Nickelodeon Movies, MTV Films and Paramount Television brands. Paramount Television develops, finances and produces programming for television and other platforms. Paramount distributes motion pictures theatrically and through download-to-own, DVDs and Blu-ray discs, transactional video-on-demand ( TVOD ), SVOD, pay, basic cable and free television and other platforms and devices in the United States ( U.S. ) and internationally for itself and for third parties. Our Filmed Entertainment segment generates theatrical, home entertainment, licensing and ancillary revenues. Theatrical Revenues Theatrical revenues are generated worldwide from the theatrical release and distribution of motion pictures. Paramount releases films theatrically in domestic and international markets and generates revenues from audience ticket sales. Each motion picture 35 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) is a separate and distinct product with its revenues, and ultimate profitability, dependent upon many factors, among which audience response, domestically and internationally, is of fundamental importance. Theatrical revenues may be also affected by the number, timing and mix of competitive releases in any given period, consumer tastes and consumption habits, and overall economic conditions, including trends in discretionary spending. The theatrical success of a motion picture is a significant factor in determining the revenues it is likely to generate in home entertainment markets and licensing arrangements for television and other platforms. Revenues from motion picture theatrical releases tend to be cyclical with increases around the holidays that fall during the first quarter of our fiscal year, and in the summer months during our fourth quarter. Home Entertainment Revenues Home entertainment revenues are derived from the worldwide sales and distribution of DVDs and Blu-ray discs relating to the motion pictures released theatrically by Paramount or other Viacom brands such as Nickelodeon, MTV, Comedy Central and BET, as well as certain acquired films and content distributed on behalf of third parties such as CBS. Home entertainment revenues are also derived from the viewing of our films through TVOD and download-to-own services around the world, for a fee and/or on a revenue sharing basis. Our home entertainment revenues may be affected by the number, timing and mix of releases in any given period, consumer tastes and consumption habits, the prominence given by distributors and retailers to our releases compared to those of our competitors, and overall economic conditions, including trends in discretionary spending. The mix of our revenues from home entertainment activities continues to shift away from physical products toward consumption through various platforms and apps. Licensing Revenues Licensing revenues are revenues from films and television programs produced, acquired and distributed by Paramount that are licensed around the world on a territory by territory basis, for a fee or on a revenue sharing basis, to SVOD, pay and basic cable television, free television and free video-on-demand services. Revenue from the licensing of film and television exhibition rights is recognized upon availability for airing by the licensee and will fluctuate depending on the number and mix of available titles in any given territory. Ancillary Revenues Ancillary revenues are generated by providing production and facilities services to third parties, primarily at Paramount studio lot. Paramount also generates ancillary revenues by licensing its brands for consumer products, themed restaurants, hotels and resorts, live stage plays, film clips and theme parks. Filmed Entertainment segment expenses consist of operating expenses, SG&A expenses and depreciation and amortization. Operating expenses principally include the amortization of costs of our released feature films and television programming (including participations and residuals), print and advertising expenses and other distribution costs. We incur marketing costs before and throughout the theatrical release of a film and, to a lesser extent, other distribution windows. Such costs are incurred to generate public interest in our films and are expensed as incurred; therefore, we typically incur losses with respect to a particular film prior to and during the film theatrical exhibition and profitability may not be realized until well after a film theatrical release. Therefore, the results of the Filmed Entertainment segment can be volatile as films work their way through the various distribution windows. SG&A expenses include employee compensation, facility and occupancy costs, professional service fees and other overhead costs. Depreciation and amortization expense principally consists of depreciation of fixed assets. 36 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Our summary consolidated results of operations are presented below for the years ended September 30, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 . 2016 vs. 2015 2015 vs. 2014 Year Ended September 30, Better/(Worse) Better/(Worse) (in millions, except per share amounts) 2016 2015 2014 $ % $ % GAAP Revenues $ 12,488 $ 13,268 $ 13,783 $ (780 ) (6 )% $ (515 ) (4 )% Operating income 2,526 3,112 4,082 (586 ) (19 ) (970 ) (24 ) Net earnings from continuing operations attributable to Viacom 1,436 1,922 2,392 (486 ) (25 ) (470 ) (20 ) Diluted EPS from continuing operations 3.61 4.73 5.43 (1.12 ) (24 ) (0.70 ) (13 ) Non-GAAP* Adjusted operating income $ 2,732 $ 3,920 $ 4,125 $ (1,188 ) (30 )% $ (205 ) (5 )% Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations attributable to Viacom 1,465 2,210 2,376 (745 ) (34 ) (166 ) (7 ) Adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations 3.68 5.44 5.40 (1.76 ) (32 ) 0.04 1 * See Factors Affecting Comparability section below for a reconciliation of our reported results to our adjusted results, which are calculated on a non-GAAP basis. Factors Affecting Comparability The Consolidated Financial Statements reflect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows reported in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ). Our results have been affected by certain items identified as affecting comparability. Accordingly, when applicable, we use consolidated adjusted operating income, adjusted earnings from continuing operations before provision for income taxes, adjusted provision for income taxes, adjusted net earnings from continuing operations attributable to Viacom and adjusted diluted earnings per share ( EPS ) from continuing operations, among other measures, to evaluate our actual operating performance and for planning and forecasting of future periods. We believe that the adjusted results provide relevant and useful information for investors because they clarify our actual operating performance, make it easier to compare our results with those of other companies and allow investors to review performance in the same way as our management. Since these are not measures of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP, they should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, operating income, earnings from continuing operations before provision for income taxes, provision for income taxes, net earnings from continuing operations attributable to Viacom and diluted EPS from continuing operations as indicators of operating performance and they may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. The following tables reconcile our reported results (GAAP) to our adjusted results (non-GAAP) for the three years ended September 30, 2016 . The tax impacts included in the tables below have been calculated using the rates applicable to the adjustments presented. 37 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) 2016 Year Ended September 30, 2016 (in millions, except per share amounts) Operating Income Earnings from Continuing Operations Before Provision for Income Taxes Provision for Income Taxes Net Earnings from Continuing Operations Attributable to Viacom Diluted EPS from Continuing Operations Reported results (GAAP) $ 2,526 $ 1,990 $ 519 $ 1,436 $ 3.61 Factors Affecting Comparability: Restructuring 206 206 75 131 0.33 Discrete tax benefit 102 (102 ) (0.26 ) Adjusted results (Non-GAAP) $ 2,732 $ 2,196 $ 696 $ 1,465 $ 3.68 Restructuring charge : We recognized a pre-tax restructuring charge of $206 million in connection with the separation of certain senior executives. The restructuring charge includes the cost of separation payments of $138 million and the acceleration of equity-based compensation expense of $68 million. See Note 14 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Discrete tax benefit : The net discrete tax benefit is principally related to a tax accounting method change granted by the Internal Revenue Service, the release of tax reserves with respect to certain effectively settled tax positions and the recognition of capital loss carryforwards, partially offset by a reduction in qualified production activity tax benefits as a result of retroactively reenacted legislation. 2015 Year Ended September 30, 2015 (in millions, except per share amounts) Operating Income Earnings from Continuing Operations Before Provision for Income Taxes Provision for Income Taxes Net Earnings from Continuing Operations Attributable to Viacom Diluted EPS from Continuing Operations Reported results (GAAP) $ 3,112 $ 2,503 $ 501 $ 1,922 $ 4.73 Factors Affecting Comparability: Restructuring and programming charges 784 784 264 520 1.28 Loss on pension settlement 24 24 9 15 0.04 Loss on extinguishment of debt 18 7 11 0.03 Discrete tax benefit 258 (258 ) (0.64 ) Adjusted results (Non-GAAP) $ 3,920 $ 3,329 $ 1,039 $ 2,210 $ 5.44 Restructuring and programming charges : We recognized pre-tax charges of $784 million, reflecting $578 million of programming charges and a $206 million restructuring charge associated with workforce reductions. See Note 14 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Loss on pension settlement : The pre-tax non-cash charge of $24 million was driven by the settlement of pension benefits of certain participants of our funded pension plan. Loss on extinguishment of debt : In September 2015, we redeemed $550 million of the total $918 million outstanding of our 6.250% Senior Notes due April 2016, at a redemption price equal to the sum of the principal amount and a make-whole amount, together totaling $568 million, and accrued interest of $14 million. As a result of the redemption, we recognized a pre-tax extinguishment loss of $18 million. Discrete tax benefit : During 2015, we reorganized certain non-U.S. subsidiaries in order to facilitate a more efficient movement of non-U.S. cash and to support the expansion of key areas for growth internationally. The net discrete tax benefit was principally related to excess foreign tax credits attributable to a taxable repatriation of non-U.S. earnings from reorganized entities and the release of tax reserves with respect to certain effectively settled tax positions. 38 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) 2014 Year Ended September 30, 2014 (in millions, except per share amounts) Operating Income Earnings from Continuing Operations Before Provision for Income Taxes Provision for Income Taxes Net Earnings from Continuing Operations Attributable to Viacom Diluted EPS from Continuing Operations Reported results (GAAP) $ 4,082 $ 3,514 $ 1,050 $ 2,392 $ 5.43 Factors Affecting Comparability: Asset impairment 43 43 17 26 0.06 Loss on extinguishment of debt 11 4 7 0.02 Discrete tax benefit 49 (49 ) (0.11 ) Adjusted results (Non-GAAP) $ 4,125 $ 3,568 $ 1,120 $ 2,376 $ 5.40 Asset impairment : As a result of strategic decisions made by us resulting in channel realignment in several international markets, we recorded a non-cash pre-tax impairment charge of $43 million related to an international trade name at Media Networks . Loss on extinguishment of debt : In April 2014, we redeemed all $600 million of our outstanding 4.375% Senior Notes due September 2014 at a redemption price equal to the sum of the principal amount and a make-whole amount, together totaling $611 million, and accrued and unpaid interest of $1 million. As a result of the redemption, we recognized a pre-tax extinguishment loss of $11 million . Discrete tax benefit : The net discrete tax benefit was principally related to the reversal of deferred taxes on earnings deemed permanently reinvested and the recognition of capital loss carryforwards . YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 vs. 2015 Consolidated Results of Operations Revenues Worldwide revenues decreased $780 million , or 6% , to $12.488 billion in the year ended September 30, 2016 .

Expenses Total expenses decreased $194 million , or 2% , to $9.962 billion in the year ended September 30, 2016 . The decrease in expenses results from a comparison with the $784 million of restructuring and programming charges and $24 million loss on pension settlement in the prior year, partially offset by higher segment expenses and a restructuring charge of $206 million in the current year. Filmed Entertainment expenses increased $335 million , or 12% , driven by higher operating expenses. Media Networks expenses increased $111 million , or 2% , principally driven by SG&A expenses. Operating Operating expenses decreased $184 million , or 3% , to $6.684 billion in the year ended September 30, 2016 . The decrease in operating expenses results from a comparison with the $578 million programming charge in the prior year, partially offset by higher Filmed Entertainment operating expenses. Selling, General and Administrative SG&A expenses decreased $9 million to $2.851 billion in the year ended September 30, 2016 . The decrease in SG&A expenses reflects a decline in Filmed Entertainment SG&A expenses of $50 million , or 14% , and a comparison with the $24 million loss on pension settlement in the prior year, partially offset by an increase of Media Networks SG&A expenses of $91 million , or 4% . Operating Income Operating income decreased $586 million , or 19% to $2.526 billion in the year ended September 30, 2016 , reflecting the operating results discussed above.

Media Networks adjusted operating income decreased $659 million , or 16% , to $3.484 billion , primarily reflecting revenue declines and increased 39 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) expenses. Filmed Entertainment adjusted operating results decreased $556 million , reflecting the underperformance of current year films and an impairment charge related to the expected performance of an unreleased film. In addition, corporate expenses decreased $22 million , or 9% , principally due to lower employee-related costs partially offset by expenses resulting from corporate governance matters. Income Taxes Our effective income tax rate was 26.1% in the year ended September 30, 2016 . The net discrete tax benefit of $102 million , taken together with the tax impact of restructuring, reduced the effective income tax rate by 5.6 percentage points. Excluding the impact of discrete tax items, our adjusted effective income tax rate was 31.7% in 2016 . Our effective income tax rate was 20.0% in the year ended September 30, 2015 . The net discrete tax benefit of $258 million , taken together with the other factors affecting comparability discussed above, reduced the effective income tax rate by 11.2 percentage points. Excluding the impact of discrete tax items, our adjusted effective income tax rate was 31.2% in 2015 . Net Earnings from Continuing Operations Attributable to Viacom Net earnings from continuing operations attributable to Viacom decreased $486 million , or 25% , to $1.436 billion in the year ended September 30, 2016 , principally due to the decline in tax-effected operating income described above, partially offset by lower interest expense, foreign exchange losses and net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests. Excluding the items discussed in Factors Affecting Comparability , adjusted net earnings from continuing operations attributable to Viacom decreased $745 million , or 34% , to $1.465 billion in the year ended September 30, 2016 . Diluted Earnings Per Share from Continuing Operations Diluted EPS from continuing operations decreased $1.12 per diluted share to $3.61 in the year ended September 30, 2016 , reflecting the impact of net earnings. Excluding the items discussed in Factors Affecting Comparability , adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations decreased $1.76 per diluted share to $3.68 . Foreign exchange had an unfavorable $0.05 impact on diluted and adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations. Segment Results of Operations Transactions between reportable segments are accounted for as third-party arrangements for the purposes of presenting segment results of operations. Typical intersegment transactions include the purchase of advertising by the Filmed Entertainment segment on Media Networks properties and the purchase of Filmed Entertainment feature films exhibition rights by Media Networks .

Domestic advertising revenues decreased 5% . While pricing increased, softer ratings and reduced unit loads at certain of our networks contributed to lower audience delivery, reducing impressions and associated revenue. International advertising revenues were substantially flat. Excluding foreign exchange, which had a 9-percentage point unfavorable impact, international advertising revenues increased 9%, driven by growth in Europe. Affiliate Worldwide affiliate revenues decreased $352 million , or 7% , to $4.556 billion in the year ended September 30, 2016 . Domestic affiliate revenues decreased 9% , principally reflecting a difficult comparison to the prior year which included higher revenues from SVOD and other OTT arrangements. Excluding the impact from the timing of product available under SVOD and other OTT arrangements, domestic affiliate revenues declined in the low-single digits, due to a modest decline in subscribers and the impact of rate equalization due to the consolidation of certain distributor agreements, partially offset by rate increases across the remaining subscriber base. International revenues increased 3% . Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, which had a 7-percentage point unfavorable impact, international affiliate revenues increased 10%, driven by new channel launches, increased subscribers, rate increases and the completion of certain SVOD and other OTT arrangements. Ancillary Worldwide ancillary revenues increased $2 million to $577 million in the year ended September 30, 2016 . Domestic ancillary revenues decreased 6% , principally reflecting lower television syndication revenue. International ancillary revenues increased 9% .

Foreign exchange had a 4-percentage point unfavorable impact on international home entertainment revenues. Licensing Licensing revenues increased $120 million , or 12% , to $1.100 billion in the year ended September 30, 2016 , primarily driven by SVOD licensing fees. Domestic and international licensing revenues increased 11% and 13% , respectively. Ancillary Ancillary revenues decreased $17 million , or 9% , to $174 million in the year ended September 30, 2016 . Domestic ancillary revenues remained flat, while international ancillary revenues decreased 30% principally due to lower merchandising revenues from Transformers: Age of Extinction .

Distribution and other costs, principally print and advertising expenses, increased $225 million , or 24% , primarily driven by higher marketing costs for our current year film slate. Film costs increased $163 million , or 11% , including a $115 million impairment charge related to the expected performance of an unreleased film and higher television production costs. Selling, General and Administrative SG&A expenses decreased $50 million , or 14% , to $319 million in the year ended September 30, 2016 , principally driven by lower employee costs, including 8-percentage points of benefit from our 2015 restructuring and other discretionary cost decreases. Adjusted Operating Income/(Loss) Adjusted operating loss was $445 million in the year ended September 30, 2016 , compared with adjusted operating income of $111 million in 2015 . The decline in results reflects the underperformance of current year films, such as Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows and Zoolander 2 , as well as the impairment charge discussed above. We expect to generate an adjusted operating loss in the Filmed Entertainment segment for the quarter ended December 31, 2016, principally reflecting print and advertising expenses associated with our upcoming fiscal 2017 theatrical releases. YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2015 vs. 2014 Consolidated Results of Operations Revenues Worldwide revenues decreased $515 million , or 4% , to $13.268 billion in the year ended September 30, 2015 . Excluding an unfavorable 2% impact of foreign exchange, revenues declined 2%. Media Networks revenues increased $319 million , or 3% , principally reflecting higher affiliate and advertising revenues.

Net Earnings from Continuing Operations Attributable to Viacom Net earnings from continuing operations attributable to Viacom decreased $470 million , or 20% , to $1.922 billion in the year ended September 30, 2015 , principally due to the decline in tax-effected adjusted operating income described above, an increase in interest expense, reflecting higher levels of debt outstanding, and foreign currency exchange losses, partially offset by higher income from equity in net earnings of investee companies. Excluding the items discussed in Factors Affecting Comparability , adjusted net earnings from continuing operations attributable to Viacom decreased $166 million , or 7% , to $2.210 billion in the year ended September 30, 2015 . Diluted Earnings Per Share from Continuing Operations Diluted EPS from continuing operations decreased $0.70 per diluted share to $4.73 in the year ended September 30, 2015 , reflecting lower net earnings partially offset by the impact of fewer outstanding shares. Excluding the items discussed in Factors Affecting Comparability , adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations increased $0.04 per diluted share to $5.44 , reflecting the impact of fewer outstanding shares, partially offset by lower adjusted net earnings. Foreign exchange had an unfavorable $0.14 impact on diluted and adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations. Segment Results of Operations Transactions between reportable segments are accounted for as third-party arrangements for the purposes of presenting segment results of operations.

Theatrical Worldwide theatrical revenues decreased $368 million , or 30% , to $841 million in the year ended September 30, 2015 . Revenues from our current year releases were lower by $422 million due to the mix of releases, partially offset by higher carryover revenues of $54 million from prior year releases, principally from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles . Significant current year releases included Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation, Terminator: Genisys, The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water , Interstellar and Selma , while the prior year included Transformers: Age of Extinction , Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Noah.

Film costs decreased $227 million , or 14% , reflecting lower participation costs. Selling, General and Administrative SG&A expenses decreased $56 million , or 13% , to $369 million in the year ended September 30, 2015 , principally driven by lower employee costs, including lower incentive compensation and 3-percentage points of benefit from restructuring activities, as previously described in the Factors Affecting Comparability section. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization decreased $11 million , or 17% , driven by a decline in amortization expense associated with an intangible asset becoming fully amortized in the prior year. Adjusted Operating Income Adjusted operating income was $111 million in the year ended September 30, 2015 , compared with $205 million in 2014 , principally reflecting lower contributions from films in release across the distribution windows and the benefit from the sale of certain distribution rights in the prior year. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Liquidity Sources and Uses of Cash Our primary source of liquidity is cash provided through the operations of our businesses. We have access to external financing sources such as our $2.5 billion five-year revolving credit facility and the capital markets. Our principal uses of cash from operations include the creation of new programming and film content, acquisitions of third-party content, and interest and income tax payments. We also use cash for the repayment of debt, quarterly cash dividends, capital expenditures and acquisitions of businesses, as well as discretionary share repurchases under our stock repurchase program, as deemed appropriate. The Media Networks segment consistently generates a significant percentage of our cash flow from operating activities. Advertising is generally purchased by large media buying agencies and our affiliate revenues are earned from cable and satellite television operators and other distributors. The Filmed Entertainment segment operational results and ability to generate cash flow from operations substantially depend on the number and timing of films and television series in development and production, the level and timing of print and advertising costs and the public response to our theatrical film and home entertainment releases. In general, our segments require relatively low levels of capital expenditures in relation to our annual cash flow from operations. This contributes to our ability to generate cash flow for future investment in our content and business operations, which we expect to be able to maintain over time. We use commercial paper borrowings, backstopped by our credit facility, and the credit facility to fund short-term domestic liquidity needs principally driven by the timing of our domestic operating cash flows. Our cash and cash equivalents totaled $379 million as of September 30, 2016 , of which $265 million was held by our foreign subsidiaries and is substantially all deemed permanently reinvested in our foreign operations. While we currently do not intend or foresee a need for repatriating funds held in our foreign subsidiaries, should we require additional capital in the U.S., we could elect to repatriate these funds or access external financing. Repatriating funds could result in a higher effective tax rate and cash taxes paid. We believe that our cash flows from operating activities together with our credit facility provide us with adequate resources to fund our anticipated ongoing cash requirements. We anticipate that future debt maturities will be funded with cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operating activities and future access to capital markets, including our credit facility. We may continue to access external financing from time to time depending on our cash requirements, assessments of current and anticipated market conditions and after-tax cost of capital. Our access to capital markets can be impacted by factors outside our control, including economic conditions; however, we believe that our strong cash flows and balance sheet, our credit facility and our credit rating will provide us with adequate access to funding given our expected cash needs. Any new borrowing cost would be affected by market conditions and short and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent rating 47 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) agencies, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to access capital markets on terms and conditions that will be favorable to us. Cash Flows The net change in cash and cash equivalents for each of the years ended September 30, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 is detailed below: Cash Flows (in millions) Year Ended September 30, 2016 2015 2014 Cash provided by operations $ 1,371 $ 2,313 $ 2,597 Net cash flow used in investing activities (299 ) (257 ) (855 ) Net cash flow used in financing activities (1,173 ) (2,477 ) (3,100 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (26 ) (73 ) (45 ) Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ (127 ) $ (494 ) $ (1,403 ) Operating Activities Cash provided by operations was $1.371 billion in 2016 , a decrease of $942 million compared with 2015 , reflecting the impact from lower net earnings, higher film and television production spending and unfavorable working capital requirements. Cash provided by operations was $2.313 billion in 2015 , a decrease of $284 million compared with 2014 . The decrease primarily reflects an increase in programming spending, partially offset by lower income tax payments. See Note 17 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding income tax payments. Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities was $299 million in 2016 , principally reflecting capital expenditures and contributions made into grantor trusts in connection with the separation of certain senior executives. See Note 14 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Cash used in investing activities was $257 million in 2015 , principally reflecting capital expenditures and our investment in Prism TV Private Limited. Cash used in investing activities was $855 million in 2014 , principally reflecting the purchase price for the acquisition of Channel 5 and capital expenditures. Financing Activities Cash used in financing activities was $1.173 billion in 2016 , primarily driven by dividend payments of $635 million , debt repayments of $368 million and the settlement of share repurchases totaling $100 million . Cash used in financing activities was $2.477 billion in 2015 , driven by the settlement of share repurchases totaling $1.548 billion , dividend payments of $564 million and net payments of $410 million from debt transactions. Proceeds of $990 million from the issuance of senior notes and debentures with an aggregate face value of $1.0 billion were more than offset by debt repayments of $1.400 billion . Cash used in financing activities was $3.100 billion in 2014 , driven by the settlement of share repurchases totaling $3.529 billion and dividend payments of $541 million , partially offset by net proceeds of $884 million from debt transactions. Proceeds of $1.484 billion from the issuance of senior notes and debentures with an aggregate face value of $1.5 billion were partially offset by the debt extinguishment payment of $600 million. In September 2016, we decreased our quarterly dividend to $0.20 per share of Class A and Class B common stock from $0.40 per share, beginning with the dividend paid on October 3, 2016. 48 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) Capital Resources Capital Structure and Debt Our debt outstanding as of September 30, 2016 and 2015 is as follows: Debt (in millions) September 30, 2016 2015 Senior notes and debentures $ 11,793 $ 12,142 Capital leases and other obligations 120 143 Total debt $ 11,913 $ 12,285 Senior Notes and Debentures In the third quarter of fiscal 2016, we repaid the $368 million aggregate principal amount of our 6.250% Senior Notes due April 2016. Our outstanding senior notes and debentures provide for certain covenant packages typical for an investment grade company. There is one acceleration trigger for certain of the senior notes and debentures in the event of a change in control under certain specified circumstances coupled with ratings downgrades due to the change in control. At September 30, 2016 and 2015 , the total unamortized discount and issuance fees and expenses related to the fixed rate senior notes and debentures was $459 million and $478 million , respectively. On October 4, 2016, we issued a total of $1.3 billion of senior notes as follows: $400 million in aggregate principal amount of 2.250% senior notes due 2022 at a price equal to 99.692% of the principal amount (the 2022 Senior Notes ); and $900 million in aggregate principal amount of 3.450% senior notes due 2026 at a price equal to 99.481% of the principal amount (the 2026 Senior Notes and, together with the 2022 Senior Notes, the Senior Notes ). The interest rate payable on the Senior Notes will be subject to adjustment from time to time if Moody Investors Services, Inc. or S&P Global Ratings downgrades (or downgrades and subsequently upgrades) the credit rating assigned to the Senior Notes. The interest rate on the Senior Notes would increase by 0.25% upon each credit agency downgrade up to a maximum of 2.00%, and would similarly be decreased for subsequent upgrades. The proceeds, net of the discount and other issuance fees and expenses, from the issuance of the Senior Notes were $1.285 billion . We intend to use the net proceeds for the repayment of outstanding senior notes, as detailed below, and borrowings under our commercial paper program, and, to the extent that any proceeds remain, for general corporate purposes. In October 2016, we delivered notices of redemption to redeem all $400 million of our outstanding 2.500% senior notes due December 2016 and all $500 million of our outstanding 3.500% senior notes due April 2017. The redemption is expected to take place on November 14, 2016. Credit Facility : At September 30, 2016 and 2015 , there were no amounts outstanding under our $2.5 billion revolving credit facility due November 2019. The average credit facility amount outstanding for the twelve months ending September 30, 2016 was $261 million, which had a weighted average interest rate of 1.30%. The credit facility is used for general corporate purposes and to support commercial paper outstanding, if any. The borrowing rate under the credit facility is LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 1.25% to 2.25% based on our current public debt rating. The credit facility has one principal financial covenant that requires our interest coverage for the most recent four consecutive fiscal quarters to be at least 3.0x, which we met as of September 30, 2016 . Commercial Paper : At September 30, 2016 and 2015 , there was no commercial paper outstanding. The average commercial paper outstanding for the twelve months ending September 30, 2016 was $1.3 billion, which had a weighted average interest rate of 0.96%. Stock Repurchase Program : During 2016 , we repurchased 2.1 million shares of Class B common stock for an aggregate price of $100 million , leaving $ 4.9 billion of remaining capacity under our $20.0 billion stock repurchase program. During 2015 and 2014 , we repurchased 21.1 million and 40.7 million shares under the program for an aggregate price of $1.5 billion and $3.4 billion , respectively. 49 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) Commitments and Contingencies Our commitments primarily consist of programming and talent commitments, operating and capital lease arrangements, and purchase obligations for goods and services. These arrangements result from our normal course of business and represent obligations that may be payable over several years. Additionally, we are subject to a redeemable put option (see Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements). Guarantees : In the course of our business, we both provide and receive the benefit of indemnities that are intended to allocate certain risks associated with business transactions. Similarly, we may remain contingently liable for various obligations of a business that has been divested in the event that a third party does not live up to its obligations under an indemnification agreement. See Note 11 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Leases - We have certain indemnification obligations with respect to leases primarily associated with the previously discontinued operations of Famous Players Inc. ( Famous Players ). In addition, we have certain indemnities provided by the acquirer of Famous Players. Other - We have indemnification obligations with respect to letters of credit and surety bonds primarily used as security against non-performance in the normal course of business. Legal Matters : See Note 11 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding legal matters. Film Financing Arrangements : From time to time we enter into film financing arrangements that involve the sale of a partial copyright interest in a film to third-party investors. Since the investors typically have the risks and rewards of ownership proportionate to their ownership in the film, we generally record the amounts received for the sale of copyright interest as a reduction of the cost of the film and related cash flows are reflected in net cash flow from operating activities. We also enter into collaborative arrangements with other studios to jointly finance and distribute theatrical productions ( co-financing arrangements ). A co-financing arrangement typically involves joint ownership of the film asset with each partner responsible for distribution of the film in specific territories. The partners share in the profits and losses of the film in accordance with their respective ownership interest. Contractual Obligations Our contractual obligations include amounts reflected on our balance sheet, as well as off-balance sheet arrangements. At September 30, 2016 , our significant contractual obligations, including payments due for the next five fiscal years and thereafter, were as follows: Contractual Obligations (in millions) Total 1 year 2-3 years 4-5 years After 5 years Off-balance Sheet Arrangements Programming and talent commitments (1) $ 1,550 $ 717 $ 677 $ 135 $ 21 Operating leases (2) 1,768 228 303 275 962 Purchase obligations (3) 1,211 532 383 233 63 On-Balance Sheet Arrangements Capital lease obligations (4) $ 80 $ 21 $ 43 $ 15 $ 1 Debt 12,252 900 1,950 900 8,502 Interest payments 8,360 553 1,002 869 5,936 Other long-term obligations (5) 2,162 1,493 580 89 (1) Programming and talent commitments include $1.191 billion relating to media networks programming and $359 million for talent contracts. (2) Operating leases include long-term non-cancelable operating lease commitments for office space, equipment, transponders, studio facilities and vehicles. (3) Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including open purchase orders. (4) Capital lease obligations include capital leases for satellite transponders. (5) Other long-term obligations principally consist of participations, residuals and programming obligations for content that is available for airing. Note: The table above does not include $1.3 billion principal amount of payments with respect to the Senior Notes issued on October 4, 2016. Interest payments for the Senior Notes total approximately $360 million through maturity. The table above does not include payments which may result from our defined benefit pension plans of $504 million , unrecognized tax benefits of $201 million , including interest and penalties, interest payments to be made under our credit facility and for commercial paper outstanding, $211 million of redeemable noncontrolling interest and lease indemnification obligations of approximately $230 million . The amount and timing of payments with respect to these items are subject to a number of uncertainties such that we are unable to make sufficiently reliable estimations of future payments. 50 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) MARKET RISK We are exposed to market risk related to foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. We use or expect to use derivative financial instruments to modify exposure to risks from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. In accordance with our policy, we do not use derivative instruments unless there is an underlying exposure, and we do not hold or enter into financial instruments for speculative trading purposes. Foreign Exchange Risk We conduct business in various countries outside the U.S., resulting in exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates when translating from the foreign local currency to the U.S. Dollar. We use foreign currency forward contracts to economically hedge anticipated cash flows and foreign currency balances in such currencies as the British Pound, the Euro, the Brazilian Real, the Japanese Yen, the Australian Dollar, the Singapore Dollar and the Canadian Dollar. We also enter into forward contracts to hedge future production costs or programming obligations. The change in fair value of non-designated foreign exchange contracts is included in current period earnings as part of Other items, net in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. We manage the use of foreign exchange derivatives centrally. At September 30, 2016 and 2015 , the notional value of all foreign exchange contracts was $1.149 billion and $1.040 billion , respectively. In 2016 , $874 million related to our foreign currency balances and $275 million related to future production costs. In 2015 , $769 million related to our foreign currency balances and $271 million related to future production costs. Interest Rate Risk A portion of our interest expense is exposed to movements in short-term rates. A 1% change to the weighted average interest rate on commercial paper and credit facility amounts outstanding in 2016 would increase or decrease interest expense by approximately $16 million. Also, interest expense for future long-term debt issues is exposed to movements in long-term rates. Interest rate hedges may be used to modify both of these exposures at our discretion. There were no interest rates hedges outstanding at September 30, 2016 and 2015 . Viacom has issued senior notes and debentures that, at September 30, 2016 , had an outstanding balance of $11.8 billion and an estimated fair value of $12.8 billion . A 1% increase or decrease in the level of interest rates would decrease or increase the fair value of the senior notes and debentures by approximately $962 million and $1.133 billion , respectively. Credit Risk We continually monitor our positions with, and credit quality of, our customers and the financial institutions that are counterparties to our financial instrument agreements. We are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonpayment by our customers and nonperformance by the counterparties to our financial instrument agreements. However, we do not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties to our financial instrument agreements and we believe our allowance for doubtful accounts is sufficient to cover any anticipated nonpayment by our customers. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, which are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. The result of these evaluations forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amount of expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Our critical accounting policies are those that are considered by management to require significant judgment and use of estimates and that could have a significant impact on our financial statements. An understanding of our critical accounting policies is necessary to analyze our financial results. Our critical accounting policies include our accounting for film and television production costs, acquired programming rights, revenue recognition, income taxes and goodwill and other intangible assets. The risks and uncertainties involved in applying our critical accounting policies are provided below. Unless otherwise noted, we applied our critical accounting policies and estimation methods consistently in all material respects and for all periods presented, and have discussed such policies with our Audit Committee. For a summary of our significant accounting policies see Note 2 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. 51 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) Film and Television Production Costs We capitalize feature film and television production costs, on a title-specific basis, as Inventory, net in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We use an individual-film-forecast-computation method to amortize original production costs and to accrue estimated liabilities for residuals and participations over the applicable title life cycle based upon the ratio of current period to estimated remaining total gross revenues ( ultimate revenues ) for each title. The estimate of ultimate revenues impacts the timing of amortization and accrual of residuals and participations. Our estimate of ultimate revenues for feature films includes revenues from all sources that are estimated to be earned within 10 years from the date of a film initial theatrical release. For acquired film libraries, our estimate of ultimate revenues is for a period within 20 years from the date of acquisition. For feature films, prior to release we estimate ultimate revenues based on the historical performance of similar content and pre-release market research (including test market screenings), as well as incorporating factors of the content itself, including, but not limited to, the expected number of theaters and markets in which the original content will be released, the genre of the original content and the past box office performance of the lead actors and actresses. We believe the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of ultimate revenues for films intended for theatrical release is domestic theatrical exhibition, as subsequent markets have historically exhibited a high correlation to domestic theatrical performance. Upon a film initial release we update our estimate of ultimate revenues based on expected future and actual results. Our estimates of revenues from succeeding windows and markets are revised based on historical relationships to domestic theatrical performance and an analysis of current market trends. We also review and revise estimates of ultimate revenue and participation costs as of each reporting date to reflect the most current available information. If estimates for a film are revised, the difference between amortization expense determined using the new estimate and any amounts previously expensed during that fiscal year are charged or credited to our Consolidated Statement of Earnings in the quarter in which the estimates are revised. The most sensitive factor affecting our estimates for films subsequent to their initial release is the extent of home entertainment sales achieved. In addition to theatrical performance, home entertainment sales vary based on a variety of factors including demand for our titles, the volume and quality of competing products, marketing and promotional strategies, as well as economic conditions. Ultimate revenues for television programming are limited to the amount of contracted revenue. Accordingly, television production costs in excess of the amount of contracted revenue are expensed as incurred. For original programming broadcast on our networks, capitalized original programming costs are amortized utilizing an individual-film-forecast-computation method over the applicable title ultimate revenues based on genre and historical experience, beginning with the month of initial exhibition. The most sensitive factor affecting ultimate revenues is ratings, which are an indication of audience acceptance and directly impact the level of advertising revenues we will be able to generate during the airing of the programming. Poor ratings may result in abandonment of a program, which would require the immediate write-off of any unamortized production costs. If we believe that the release of our content will not be or has not been favorably received, then we would assess whether the fair value of such content is less than the unamortized portion of its capitalized costs and, if need be, recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the unamortized capitalized costs exceed the fair value. We utilize the individual-film-forecast-computation method (adjusted to incorporate revenue and related costs, including future exploitation costs, if any, expected to occur in periods beyond 10 years from the date of a film initial release) to develop the cash flows which are subsequently discounted to compute the fair value of a title that is being assessed for impairment. The discount rate utilized takes into account the time value of money as well as a risk premium. The risk premium reflects the uncertainties of realizing the expected cash flows of a title which is impacted by the title position within its product life cycle. Acquired Programming Rights Costs incurred in acquiring program rights, including advances, are capitalized and amortized to operating expenses over the license period or projected useful life of the programming, if shorter, commencing upon availability, based on estimated future airings. Program rights and the related liabilities are recorded at the commencement of the licensing period when the cost of the programming is known or reasonably determinable, the program material has been accepted and the programming is available for airing. If initial airings are expected to generate higher revenues an accelerated method of amortization is used. Determining factors used in estimating the useful life of programming include the expected number of future airings, which may differ from the contracted number of airings, the length of the license period and expected future revenues to be generated from the programming. The cost basis of acquired programming is the capitalized cost of each program and is equal to the cost of the programming pursuant to the license agreement less the cumulative amortization recorded for the program. Capitalized costs of rights to program materials are reported in our Consolidated Balance Sheets at the lower of unamortized cost or estimated net realizable value. We evaluate net realizable value of acquired rights programming on a daypart basis. A daypart is defined as an aggregation of programs broadcast during a particular time of day or an aggregation of programs of a similar type. We 52 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) aggregate similar programming based on the specific demographic targeted by each respective program service. Net realizable value is determined by estimating advertising revenues to be derived from the future airing of the programming within the daypart as well as an allocation of affiliate revenues to programming. An impairment charge may be necessary if our estimates of future cash flows of similar programming are insufficient or if programming is abandoned. Revenue Recognition Multiple-Element Arrangements We enter into arrangements under which we perform multiple revenue-generating activities. We must allocate consideration to separate units of account in the arrangement, which could impact the timing of revenue recognition. Advertising revenues are principally generated from the sale of advertising time comprised of multiple commercial units. Each advertising spot comprises a deliverable for accounting purposes. Consideration for these arrangements is allocated among the individual advertising spots based on relative fair value using Viacom-specific prices. SVOD and other OTT arrangements include multiple programs made available to distributors on one or more dates for a fixed fee. Consideration for such arrangements is allocated among the programs based on relative fair value using management best estimate considering viewing performance and other factors. Gross versus Net Revenue We earn and recognize revenues as a distributor on behalf of third parties and through outsourced agency agreements. In such cases, determining whether revenue should be reported on a gross or net basis is based on management assessment of who our customer is in the transaction. To the extent the end consumer is our customer, we act as the principal in a transaction and revenues earned from the end user are reported on a gross basis. This determination involves judgment and is based on an evaluation of the facts and circumstances of the terms of an arrangement. Revenue Allowances In accordance with the accounting guidance related to revenue recognition when a right of return exists, revenue allowances are recorded to adjust amounts originally invoiced to the estimated net realizable value of a particular product. Upon the sale of DVDs and Blu-ray discs to wholesalers and retailers, we record a reduction of revenue for the impact of estimated future returns, rebates and other incentives ( estimated returns ). In determining estimated returns, we consider numerous sources of qualitative and quantitative evidence including forecasted sales data, customers rights of return, units shipped and units remaining at retail, historical return rates for similar product, current economic trends, competitive environment, promotions and sales strategies. Forecasted sales data is determined by comparing a particular release to product that has similar characteristics where applicable, such as franchise, genre, box office levels and release patterns, using regression analysis, decay rates and other tools. Based on the results of this analysis and the sales strategies to be used for the release, we reserve an appropriate percentage of each dollar of product revenue on a title taking into consideration the qualitative and quantitative factors described above. Forecasted sales data is reviewed and updated throughout each quarter and is consistent with the projections of ultimate revenues used in applying the individual-film-forecast-computation method to amortize our film costs. Accordingly, a change in forecasted sales affects both the revenue allowance and related expenses. Actual sell-through data is reviewed as it becomes available against the forecasted sales data to ensure that estimates continue to be consistent with actual sales performance. Our estimate of future returns affects reported revenue and operating income. If we underestimate the impact of future returns in a particular period, then we may record less revenue and related expenses in later periods when returns exceed the estimated amounts. If we overestimate the impact of future returns in a particular period, then we may record additional revenue and related expenses in later periods when returns are less than estimated. An incremental change of 1% in our estimated sales returns rate (i.e., provisions for returns divided by gross sales of related product) for DVDs and Blu-ray products would have a $9 million impact on our total revenue for the year ended September 30, 2016 . This revenue impact would be partially offset by a corresponding impact on related expenses depending on the margin associated with a specific film and other factors. Income Taxes Significant judgment is required in determining our annual provision for income taxes and evaluating our income tax positions. Our tax rates are impacted by the tax laws, regulations and policies in federal, state and local and international territories where our businesses operate. Changes to these laws and regulations and uncertainty generated by the prospect of future tax legislation may also affect our income tax positions, in addition to other factors, including our global mix of earnings, acquisitions and dispositions, as well as the tax characteristics of our income. In determining our income tax provisions on a jurisdiction basis, 53 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) we are required to make judgments on the need to record deferred tax assets and liabilities, including the realizability of deferred tax assets. A valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is established if it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized. In evaluating uncertain tax positions, we make determinations of the application of complex tax rules, regulations and practices. We evaluate our uncertain tax positions quarterly based on many factors including, but not limited to, new facts, changes in tax law and information received from regulators. A change in any one of these factors could change our evaluation of an existing uncertain tax position, resulting in the recognition of an additional charge or benefit to our income tax provision in the period and may result in fluctuations in our effective income tax rate. Additionally, our income tax returns are routinely audited and settlements of issues raised in these audits sometimes affect our income tax provisions. The resolution of audit issues and income tax positions taken may take extended periods of time due to the length of examinations by tax authorities and the possible extension of statutes of limitations. A 1% change in our effective income tax rate would result in additional income tax expense of approximately $20 million for the year ended September 30, 2016 . We permanently reinvest the earnings of substantially all of our foreign subsidiaries outside the U.S. We do not provide for U.S. taxes on earnings of our foreign subsidiaries for which the earnings are permanently reinvested. Goodwill Goodwill at September 30, 2016 relates to our reporting units Music & Entertainment ($3.5 billion), Kids & Family ($3.6 billion), BET Networks ($2.7 billion) and Paramount ($1.6 billion). We test goodwill for impairment on August 31 of each year and have elected to perform a qualitative goodwill impairment test for all reporting units in 2016. The qualitative test is an evaluation, based on the weight of evidence, of the significance of all identified events and circumstances in the context of determining whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. A qualitative assessment includes, but is not limited to, consideration of the results of our most recent quantitative impairment test, consideration of macroeconomic conditions and industry and market conditions. Based on this assessment, we concluded that it is not more likely than not that goodwill is impaired. Therefore, performing a quantitative impairment test was not considered necessary. A quantitative goodwill impairment test, when performed, requires estimating fair value of a reporting unit based on a discounted cash flow analysis. A discounted cash flow analysis requires us to make various judgmental assumptions, including assumptions about the timing and amount of future cash flows, growth rates and discount rates. Given the inherent uncertainty in determining these assumptions, actual results may differ from those used in our valuations. Finite-Lived Intangible Assets We evaluate whether there has been an impairment of finite-lived intangible assets if a triggering event indicates that an impairment may exist. The impairment test employed for finite-lived intangible assets (e.g., broadcast license, trade names and customer lists), which is performed at the lowest level of cash flows associated with the asset, first requires a comparison of undiscounted future cash flows against the carrying value of the asset. If the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted cash flows, the asset would be written down to its fair value. Significant judgments in this area involve determining whether a triggering event has occurred, the determination of the cash flows for the assets involved and the discount rate to be applied in determining fair value. OTHER MATTERS Related Parties In the ordinary course of business we enter into transactions with related parties, including National Amusements, Inc. ( National Amusements ), CBS, their respective subsidiaries and affiliates, and companies that we account for under the equity method of accounting. See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for details regarding the related party transactions and their impact on the Financial Statements. On September 29, 2016, our Board of Directors received a letter from National Amusements requesting that our Board explore a potential combination of Viacom and CBS. Subsequently, the Board formed a special committee of independent directors to consider the request from National Amusements and any proposed transaction, and the special committee has hired independent legal and financial advisers. 54 Table of Contents Management Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (continued) Agreements with CBS Corporation In connection with our separation from CBS, effective as of January 1, 2006 (the separation ), we and CBS entered into a Separation Agreement, a Transition Services Agreement and a Tax Matters Agreement, as well as certain other agreements to govern the terms of the separation and certain of the ongoing relationships between CBS and us after the separation. These related party arrangements are more fully described below. Pursuant to the Separation Agreement, each company is obligated to indemnify the other company and the other company officers, directors and employees for any losses arising out of its failure to perform or discharge any of the liabilities it assumed pursuant to the Separation Agreement, including with respect to certain legal matters, its businesses as conducted as of the date of the separation and its breaches of shared contracts. Subject to limited exceptions, the Separation Agreement provides that none of Viacom, any subsidiary of Viacom or any person that is controlled by Viacom after the separation will own or acquire an interest in a radio or television broadcast station, television broadcast network or daily newspaper, if such ownership or acquisition would (i) cause CBS, any subsidiary of CBS or any entity controlled by CBS after the date of the separation to be in violation of U.S. federal laws limiting the ownership or control of radio broadcast stations, television broadcast stations and/or television broadcast networks or (ii) limit in any manner at any time under such laws CBS ability to acquire additional interests in a radio or television broadcast station and/or television broadcast network. These restrictions will terminate when none of Mr. Redstone, National Amusements, NAIRI Inc. or any of their successors, assigns or transferees are deemed to have interests in both CBS and Viacom that are attributable under applicable U.S. federal laws. The Separation Agreement also provides that neither Viacom, any subsidiary of Viacom or any person controlled by Viacom nor CBS, any subsidiary of CBS or any person controlled by CBS will acquire any asset, enter into any agreement or accept or agree to any condition that purports to bind, or subjects to a legal order, the other company, its subsidiaries or any person it controls without such other party written consent.
