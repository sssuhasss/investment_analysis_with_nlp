Business, Item 1A. Risk Factors, Item 6. Selected Financial Data and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations includes various forward-looking statements concerning trends or events potentially affecting our business. You can identify our forward-looking statements by words such as anticipate, believe, estimate, expect, forecast, goal, intend, plan, predict, project, seek, target, could, may, should, would, "will" or other similar expressions that convey the uncertainty of future events or outcomes. In accordance with safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, these statements are accompanied by cautionary language identifying important factors, though not necessarily all such factors, which could cause future outcomes to differ materially from those set forth in forward-looking statements. Corporate Overview We are an independent petroleum refining, marketing and transportation company. We currently own and operate seven refineries, all located in the United States, with an aggregate crude oil refining capacity of approximately 1.7 mmbpcd. Our refineries supply refined products to resellers and consumers within our market areas, including the Midwest, Gulf Coast and Southeast regions of the United States. We distribute refined products to our customers through one of the largest private domestic fleets of inland petroleum product barges, one of the largest terminal operations in the United States, and a combination of MPC-owned and third-party-owned trucking and rail assets. As of December 31, 2013 , we owned, leased or had ownership interests in approximately 8,300 miles of crude oil and refined product pipelines to deliver crude oil to our refineries and other locations and refined products to wholesale and retail market areas. We are one of the largest petroleum pipeline companies in the United States on the basis of total volumes delivered. Our operations consist of three reportable operating segments: Refining & Marketing; Speedway; and Pipeline Transportation. Each of these segments is organized and managed based upon the nature of the products and services they offer. See Item 1. Business for additional information on our segments. Refining & Marketing refines crude oil and other feedstocks at our seven refineries in the Gulf Coast and Midwest regions of the United States, purchases ethanol and refined products for resale and distributes refined products through various means, including barges, terminals and trucks that we own or operate. We sell refined products to wholesale marketing customers domestically and internationally, buyers on the spot market, our Speedway business segment and to independent entrepreneurs who operate Marathon retail outlets; Speedway sells transportation fuels and convenience products in the retail market in the Midwest, primarily through Speedway convenience stores; and Pipeline Transportation transports crude oil and other feedstocks to our refineries and other locations, delivers refined products to wholesale and retail market areas and includes the aggregated operations of MPLX and MPC retained pipeline assets and investments. The Spinoff and Basis of Presentation On May 25, 2011, the Marathon Oil board of directors approved the spinoff of its RM&T Business into an independent, publicly traded company, MPC, through the distribution of MPC common stock to the stockholders of Marathon Oil common stock. In accordance with a separation and distribution agreement between Marathon Oil and MPC, the distribution of MPC common stock was made on June 30, 2011, with Marathon Oil stockholders receiving one share of MPC common stock for every two shares of Marathon Oil common stock held. Following the Spinoff, Marathon Oil retained no ownership interest in MPC, and each company had separate public ownership, boards of directors and management. On July 1, 2011, our common stock began trading regular-way on the NYSE under the ticker symbol MPC. Prior to the Spinoff on June 30, 2011, our results of operations and cash flows consisted of the RM&T Business, which represented a combined reporting entity. Subsequent to the Spinoff, our results of operations and cash flows consist of consolidated MPC activities. All significant intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated. The consolidated statements of income for periods prior to the Spinoff include expense allocations for certain corporate functions historically performed by the Marathon Oil Companies, including allocations of general corporate expenses related to executive oversight, accounting, treasury, tax, legal, procurement and information technology. Those allocations were based primarily on specific identification, headcount or computer utilization. Our management believes the assumptions underlying the consolidated financial statements, including the assumptions regarding allocating general corporate expenses from the Marathon Oil Companies, are reasonable. However, the consolidated financial statements do not include all of the actual expenses that would have been incurred had we been a stand-alone company during those periods presented prior to the Spinoff and may not reflect our consolidated results of operations and cash flows had we been a stand-alone company during the periods presented. Actual 36 Table of Contents costs that would have been incurred if we had been a stand-alone company would depend on multiple factors, including organizational structure and strategic decisions made in various areas, including information technology and infrastructure. Subsequent to the Spinoff, we are performing these functions using internal resources or services provided by third parties, certain of which were provided by the Marathon Oil Companies during a transition period pursuant to a transition services agreement, which terminated June 30, 2012. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 7 . Executive Summary Net income attributable to MPC was $2.11 billion , or $6.64 per diluted share, in 2013 compared to $3.39 billion , or $9.89 per diluted share, in 2012 . The decrease was primarily due to our Refining & Marketing segment, which generated income from operations of $3.21 billion in 2013 compared to $5.10 billion in 2012 . The decrease in Refining & Marketing segment income from operations was primarily due to narrower crude oil differentials and lower net product price realizations, partially offset by higher refinery throughput and sales volumes . Our Speedway segment generated income from operations of $375 million for 2013 compared to $310 million for 2012 . The increase was primarily due to higher gasoline and distillate gross margins and a higher merchandise gross margin, partially offset by higher operating expenses related to an increase in the number of convenience stores . During 2013, Speedway acquired nine convenience stores located in Tennessee, western Indiana and western Pennsylvania, which expanded Speedway's marketing area by two additional states. In 2012, Speedway acquired 97 convenience stores located in Indiana, Ohio and northern Kentucky. These acquisitions support our strategic initiative to increase Speedway segment sales and complement our existing network of assets. Our Pipeline Transportation segment generated income from operations of $210 million for 2013 compared to $216 million for 2012 . The decrease primarily reflects higher operating expenses and depreciation and lower pipeline affiliate income, partially offset by higher transportation revenue. The higher expenses and revenues were primarily attributable to the formation of MPLX. On February 1, 2013, we acquired from BP the 451,000 barrel per calendar day refinery in Texas City, Texas, three intrastate natural gas liquid pipelines originating at the refinery, four light product terminals, branded-jobber marketing contract assignments for the supply of approximately 1,200 branded sites, a 1,040 megawatt electric cogeneration facility and a 50 mbpd allocation of space on the Colonial Pipeline. We refer to these assets as the Galveston Bay Refinery and Related Assets. We paid $1.49 billion for these assets, which included $935 million for inventory. Pursuant to the purchase and sale agreement, we may also be required to pay BP a contingent earnout of up to an additional $700 million over six years, subject to certain conditions. These assets are part of our Refining & Marketing and Pipeline Transportation segments. Our financial results and operating statistics for all periods prior to the acquisition do not include amounts for the Galveston Bay Refinery and Related Assets. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 5 for additional information on the acquisition of these assets. In 2012, we completed a $2.2 billion (excluding capitalized interest) heavy oil upgrading and expansion project at our Detroit refinery. This project increased the refinery heavy crude oil refining capacity from 20 mbpcd to 100 mbpcd, allowing it to process more heavy, sour crude oils, including Canadian bitumen blends, which have historically traded at a significant discount to light sweet crude oil. We also continued to optimize our refineries in 2013, increasing their combined crude oil refining capacity by 15 mbpcd. On August 1, 2013 , we acquired from Mitsui & Co. (U.S.A.), Inc. its interests in three ethanol companies for $75 million . Under the purchase agreement, we acquired an additional 24 percent interest in TACE, bringing our ownership interest to 60 percent ; a 34 percent interest in TAEI, which holds a 50 percent ownership in TAME, bringing our direct and indirect ownership interest in TAME to 67 percent ; and a 40 percent interest in TAAE, which owns an ethanol production facility in Albion, Michigan. On October 1, 2013, our ownership interest in TAAE increased to 43 percent as a result of TAAE acquiring one of the owner's interest. We hold a noncontrolling interest in each of these entities and account for them using the equity method of accounting since the minority owners have substantive participating rights. In 2012, we formed MPLX, a master limited partnership, to own, operate, develop and acquire pipelines and other midstream assets related to the transportation and storage of crude oil, refined products and other hydrocarbon-based products. On October 31, 2012, MPLX completed its initial public offering of 19.9 million common units, which represented the sale by us of a 26.4 percent interest in MPLX. We currently own a 73.6 percent interest in MPLX, including the two percent general partner interest, and we consolidate this entity for financial reporting purposes since we have a controlling financial interest. 37 Table of Contents Headquartered in Findlay, Ohio, MPLX assets as of December 31, 2013 consist of a 56 percent general partner interest in Pipe Line Holdings, which owns a network of common carrier crude oil and product pipeline systems and associated storage assets in the Midwest and Gulf Coast regions of the United States, and a 100 percent interest in a butane storage cavern in West Virginia. We own the remaining 44 percent limited partner interest in Pipe Line Holdings. The financial results and operating statistics in this section include 100 percent of these assets for all time periods presented. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 4 for additional information on MPLX. On February 27, 2014, we announced that an additional 13 percent of Pipe Line Holdings will be sold to MPLX effective March 1, 2014 for $310 million . Subsequent to this transaction, MPLX will own a 69 percent general partner interest in Pipe Line Holdings and we will own a 31 percent limited partner interest. MPLX intends to finance this transaction with $40 million of cash on-hand and by borrowing $270 million on its revolving credit agreement. In 2013, we agreed with Enbridge Energy Partners, L.P. ("Enbridge") to serve as an anchor shipper for the Sandpiper pipeline, which will run from Beaver Lodge, North Dakota to Superior, Wisconsin and is targeted to be operational in early 2016. We also agreed to fund 37.5 percent of the construction of the Sandpiper pipeline project, which is currently estimated to cost $2.6 billion, of which approximately $1.0 billion is our share. We made initial contributions of $24 million in 2013. In exchange for our commitment to be an anchor shipper and our investment in the project, we will earn an approximate 27 percent equity interest in Enbridge's North Dakota System when the Sandpiper pipeline is placed into service. Enbridge's North Dakota System currently includes approximately 240 miles of crude oil gathering pipelines connected to a transportation pipeline that is approximately 730 miles long. We will also have the option to increase our ownership interest to approximately 30 percent through additional investments in future system improvements. In 2012, we agreed to be the anchor shipper on Enbridge Inc.'s proposed Southern Access Extension pipeline, which will run from Flanagan, Ill. to Patoka, Ill. As a result of that commitment, we obtained the option to acquire a 25 percent equity interest in the pipeline. In conjunction with our commitment to the Sandpiper pipeline project, our option for equity interest in the Southern Access Extension pipeline increased an additional 10 percent to a total of 35 percent. The Southern Access Extension pipeline is expected to be operational in 2015 and we estimate our option for equity interest to cost approximately $250 million. In 2013, we completed projects to develop infrastructure that facilitates transportation of hydrocarbon liquids production from the Utica Shale in eastern Ohio and western Pennsylvania. The project with Harvest Pipeline Company increased our truck unloading capacity by 24,000 barrels per day and a separate project increased our barge loading capacity to up to 50,000 barrels per day at our Wellsville, Ohio terminal. On February 1, 2012, we announced that our board of directors authorized a share repurchase plan, enabling us to purchase up to $2.0 billion of MPC common stock over a two-year period. On January 30, 2013, we announced that our board of directors approved an additional $2.0 billion share repurchase authorization to expire in December 2014 . On September 26, 2013, we announced that our board of directors approved an additional $2.0 billion share repurchase authorization through September 2015 , resulting in $6.0 billion of total share repurchase authorizations since February 1, 2012. We paid $2.79 billion in 2013 and $1.35 billion in 2012 to repurchase shares. As of December 31, 2013 , we had total outstanding repurchase authorizations of $1.86 billion . As of December 31, 2013 , we had cash and cash equivalents of $2.29 billion and no borrowings or letters of credit outstanding under our $2.5 billion revolving credit agreement or $1.3 billion trade receivables securitization facility or MPLX $500 million revolving credit agreement. The above discussion includes forward-looking statements that relate to our expectations with respect to the anticipated sale of an additional 13 percent interest in Pipe Line Holdings to MPLX, the Sandpiper pipeline project, the Southern Access Extension pipeline project and the share repurchase authorizations. Factors that could affect the sale of an additional 13 percent interest in Pipe Line Holdings to MPLX include, but are not limited to, the satisfaction of customary closing conditions. Factors that could affect the Sandpiper and Southern Access Extension pipeline projects include, but are not limited to, availability of materials and labor, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, delays in obtaining or conditions imposed by necessary government and third-party approvals and other risks customarily associated with construction projects. Factors that could affect the share repurchase authorizations and the timing of any repurchases include, but are not limited to, business conditions, availability of liquidity and the market price of our common stock. These factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. 38 Table of Contents Overview of Segments Refining & Marketing Refining & Marketing segment income from operations depends largely on our Refining & Marketing gross margin and refinery throughputs. Our Refining & Marketing gross margin is the difference between the prices of refined products sold and the costs of crude oil and other charge and blendstocks refined, including the costs to transport these inputs to our refineries and the costs of purchased products. The crack spread is a measure of the difference between market prices for refined products and crude oil, commonly used by the industry as a proxy for the refining margin. Crack spreads can fluctuate significantly, particularly when prices of refined products do not move in the same relationship as the cost of crude oil. As a performance benchmark and a comparison with other industry participants, we calculate Midwest (Chicago) and U.S. Gulf Coast ( USGC ) crack spreads that we believe most closely track our operations and slate of products. Light Louisiana Sweet crude oil ("LLS") prices and a 6-3-2-1 ratio of products (6 barrels of LLS crude oil producing 3 barrels of unleaded regular gasoline, 2 barrels of ultra-low sulfur diesel and 1 barrel of 3 percent residual fuel oil) are used for these crack-spread calculations. Our refineries can process significant amounts of sour crude oil, which typically can be purchased at a discount to sweet crude oil. The amount of this discount, the sweet/sour differential, can vary significantly, causing our Refining & Marketing gross margin to differ from crack spreads based on sweet crude oil. In general, a larger sweet/sour differential will enhance our Refining & Marketing gross margin. Historically, West Texas Intermediate crude oil ("WTI") has traded at prices similar to LLS. During 2012 and 2011, WTI traded at prices significantly less than LLS, which favorably impacted our Refining & Marketing gross margin. Logistical constraints in the U.S. mid-continent markets and other market factors acted to keep the price of WTI from rising with the prices of crude oil produced in other regions. However, the differential between WTI and LLS significantly narrowed during 2013 due to a variety of domestic and international market conditions along with changes in logistical infrastructure. Future crude oil differentials will be dependent on a variety of market and economic factors. The following table provides sensitivities showing an estimated change in annual net income due to potential changes in market conditions. (In millions, after-tax) LLS 6-3-2-1 crack spread sensitivity (a) (per $1.00/barrel change) $ 450 Sweet/sour differential sensitivity (b) (per $1.00/barrel change) 200 LLS-WTI differential sensitivity (c) (per $1.00/barrel change) 85 Natural gas price sensitivity (per $1.00/million British thermal unit change) 125 (a) Weighted 38% Chicago and 62% USGC LLS 6-3-2-1 crack spreads and assumes all other differentials and pricing relationships remain unchanged. (b) LLS (prompt) - [delivered cost of sour crude oil: Arab Light, Kuwait, Maya, Western Canadian Select and Mars]. (c) Assumes 20% of crude oil throughput volumes are WTI-based domestic crude oil. In addition to the market changes indicated by the crack spreads, the sweet/sour differential and the discount of WTI to LLS, our Refining & Marketing gross margin is impacted by factors such as: the types of crude oil and other charge and blendstocks processed; our refinery yields; the selling prices realized for refined products; the impact of commodity derivative instruments used to hedge price risk; and the cost of products purchased for resale. 39 Table of Contents Refining & Marketing segment income from operations is also affected by changes in refinery direct operating costs, which include turnaround and major maintenance, depreciation and amortization and other manufacturing expenses. Changes in manufacturing costs are primarily driven by the cost of energy used by our refineries, including purchased natural gas, and the level of maintenance costs. Planned major maintenance activities, or turnarounds, requiring temporary shutdown of certain refinery operating units, are periodically performed at each refinery. The following table lists the refineries that had significant planned turnaround and major maintenance activities for each of the last three years. Year Refinery 2013 Canton, Catlettsburg, Galveston Bay, Garyville and Robinson 2012 Catlettsburg, Detroit, Garyville and Robinson 2011 Canton and Catlettsburg The table below sets forth the location and daily crude oil refining capacity of each of our refineries at December 31 of each year.

Speedway Our retail marketing gross margin for gasoline and distillate, which is the price paid by consumers less the cost of refined products, including transportation, consumer excise taxes and bankcard processing fees, impacts the Speedway segment profitability. Numerous factors impact gasoline and distillate demand throughout the year, including local competition, seasonal demand fluctuations, the available wholesale supply, the level of economic activity in our marketing areas and weather conditions. Gasoline demand in PADD 2 is estimated to have grown by more than one percent in 2013 after coming in flat in 2012. Strong economic growth in the second half of 2013, lower prices and a rebound in manufacturing activity supported demand. More normal winter temperatures in early 2013, compared to a relatively warm 2012, and a surge in manufacturing contributed to an estimated two percent growth in PADD 2 distillate demand. Market demand increases for gasoline and distillate generally increase the product margin we can realize. The gross margin on merchandise sold at convenience stores historically has been less volatile and has contributed substantially to Speedway's gross margin. Approximately two-thirds of Speedway gross margin was derived from merchandise sales in 2013 . Speedway's convenience stores offer a wide variety of merchandise, including prepared foods, beverages and non-food items. Pipeline Transportation The profitability of our pipeline transportation operations primarily depends on tariff rates and the volumes shipped through the pipelines. A majority of the crude oil and refined product shipments on our common carrier pipelines serve our Refining & Marketing segment. In 2012, new transportation services agreements were entered into between MPC and MPLX, which resulted in higher tariff rates. The volume of crude oil that we transport is directly affected by the supply of, and refiner demand for, crude oil in the markets served directly by our crude oil pipelines. Key factors in this supply and demand balance are the production levels of crude oil by producers in various regions or fields, the availability and cost of alternative modes of transportation, the volumes of crude oil processed at refineries and refinery and transportation system maintenance levels. The volume of refined products that we transport is directly affected by the production levels of, and user demand for, refined products in the markets served by our refined product pipelines. In most of our markets, demand for gasoline and distillate peaks during the summer driving season, which extends from May through September of each year, and declines during the fall and winter months. As with crude oil, other transportation alternatives and system maintenance levels influence refined product movements. 40 Table of Contents Results of Operations Years Ended December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012 Consolidated Results of Operations (In millions) 2013 2012 Variance Revenues and other income: Sales and other operating revenues (including consumer excise taxes) $ 100,152 $ 82,235 $ 17,917 Sales to related parties 8 8 Income from equity method investments 36 26 10 Net gain on disposal of assets 6 177 (171 ) Other income 52 46 6 Total revenues and other income 100,254 82,492 17,762 Costs and expenses: Cost of revenues (excludes items below) 87,401 68,668 18,733 Purchases from related parties 357 280 77 Consumer excise taxes 6,263 5,709 554 Depreciation and amortization 1,220 995 225 Selling, general and administrative expenses 1,248 1,223 25 Other taxes 340 270 70 Total costs and expenses 96,829 77,145 19,684 Income from operations 3,425 5,347 (1,922 ) Related party net interest and other financial income 1 (1 ) Net interest and other financial income (costs) (179 ) (110 ) (69 ) Income before income taxes 3,246 5,238 (1,992 ) Provision for income taxes 1,113 1,845 (732 ) Net income 2,133 3,393 (1,260 ) Less net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 21 4 17 Net income attributable to MPC $ 2,112 $ 3,389 $ (1,277 ) Net income attributable to MPC decreased $1.28 billion in 2013 compared to 2012 , primarily due to a decrease in our Refining & Marketing segment income from operations of $1.89 billion in 2013 compared to 2012 . The decrease in Refining & Marketing segment income from operations was primarily due to narrower crude oil differentials and lower net product price realizations, partially offset by higher refinery throughput and sales volumes . Sales and other operating revenues (including consumer excise taxes) increased $17.92 billion in 2013 compared to 2012 , primarily due to higher refined product sales volumes, which increased to 2,086 mbpd in 2013 from 1,618 mbpd in 2012 . The higher sales volumes are primarily associated with the acquisition of the Galveston Bay refinery in February 2013. This impact was partially offset by a decrease in refined product selling prices. Income from equity method investments increased $10 million in 2013 compared to 2012 , primarily due to an increase in income from our ethanol investments of $34 million, partially offset by a decrease in income from our investment in LOOP LLC ("LOOP") of $17 million. The increase in income from ethanol investments was primarily due to lower corn prices in 2013 compared to 2012 and the acquisition of interests in TAAE, TACE and TAEI in 2013. LOOP experienced lower operating revenues in 2013 compared to 2012 due to changing crude patterns and lower storage revenues. Net gain on disposal of assets decreased $171 million in 2013 compared to 2012 , primarily due to the absence of a $171 million gain recognized in the third quarter of 2012 associated with the settlement agreement with the buyer of our Minnesota assets. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 6 for additional information on the Minnesota assets sale and subsequent settlement agreement with the buyer. 41 Table of Contents Other income increased $6 million in 2013 compared to 2012 , primarily due to an increase in sales of RINs and dividends received from a pipeline affiliate, partially offset by the absence of $12 million of dividends received from our preferred equity interest in the buyer of our Minnesota assets during the third quarter of 2012. Cost of revenues increased $18.73 billion in 2013 compared to 2012 , primarily due to an increase in purchased crude oil volumes in the Refining & Marketing segment. Crude oil volumes increased 33 percent in 2013 compared to 2012 , primarily associated with the Galveston Bay refinery acquired in February 2013. Purchases from related parties increased $77 million in 2013 compared to 2012 , primarily due to higher ethanol volumes purchased from our ethanol investments, partially offset by lower ethanol prices and decreases in purchases from pipeline affiliates, including Centennial Pipeline LLC ("Centennial"), in 2013 . Consumer excise taxes increased $554 million in 2013 compared to 2012 , primarily due to an increase in refined product sales volumes related to the Galveston Bay refinery acquired in February 2013. Depreciation and amortization increased $225 million in 2013 compared to 2012 , primarily due to the completion of the heavy oil upgrading and expansion project at our Detroit, Michigan refinery in late 2012 and our acquisition of the Galveston Bay Refinery and Related Assets in February 2013. Other taxes increased $70 million in 2013 compared to 2012 , primarily due to increases in personal property taxes of $41 million, payroll taxes of $21 million and sales and use tax expense of $13 million. These increases were attributable to a number of factors including the completion of the heavy oil upgrading and expansion project at our Detroit refinery, the acquisition of the Galveston Bay Refinery and Related Assets and Speedway acquisition of 97 convenience stores in 2012. Net interest and other financial costs increased $69 million in 2013 compared to 2012 , primarily reflecting a decrease in capitalized interest in 2013 due to the completion of the Detroit refinery heavy oil upgrading and expansion project in late 2012. We capitalized interest of $28 million in 2013 compared to $101 million in 2012 . Provision for income taxes decreased $732 million in 2013 compared to 2012 , primarily due to the $1.99 billion decrease in income before income taxes in 2013 . The effective tax rate of 34 percent in 2013 is less than the U.S. statutory rate of 35 percent primarily due to certain permanent benefit differences, including the domestic manufacturing deduction, partially offset by state and local tax expense. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 12 for further details. Segment Results Revenues are summarized by segment in the following table.

Intersegment refined product sales volumes were 2.98 billion gallons in 2013 compared to 2.73 billion gallons in 2012 , with the increased volumes primarily due to an increase in Speedway gasoline and distillate sales volume. Speedway segment revenues increased $232 million in 2013 compared to 2012 , primarily due to higher gasoline and distillate sales volumes, partially offset by lower gasoline and distillate selling prices, which averaged $3.45 per gallon in 2013 compared to $3.54 per gallon in 2012 . The Speedway segment also had higher merchandise sales. The increases in gasoline and distillate sales volumes and merchandise sales primarily resulted from the acquisitions of convenience stores in 2013 and 2012 . Pipeline Transportation segment revenue increased $78 million in 2013 compared to 2012 , primarily due to higher average tariffs received on the volumes of crude oil and products shipped, higher crude oil throughput volumes and an increase in storage fees and other revenue.

(b) Calculation utilizes USGC 3% residual fuel oil price as a proxy for Chicago 3% residual fuel oil price. (c) Blended Chicago/USGC crack spread is 38% / 62% in 2013 and 52% / 48% in 2012 based on MPC refining capacity by region in each period. (d) LLS (prompt) - [delivered cost of sour crude oil: Arab Light, Kuwait, Maya, Western Canadian Select and Mars]. Refining & Marketing segment income from operations decreased $1.89 billion in 2013 from 2012 , primarily due to narrower crude oil differentials and lower net product price realizations, partially offset by higher refinery throughput and sales volumes . The sweet/sour crude oil differential narrowed by $3.94 per barrel and the LLS-WTI crude oil differential narrowed by $8.19 per barrel in 2013 compared to 2012 , which we estimate had negative impacts on segment income of $1.21 billion and $998 million , respectively. We estimate the lower net product price realizations had a negative impact on segment income of $593 million . Total refinery throughputs increased 439 mbpd in 2013 compared to 2012 , primarily due to the Galveston Bay refinery, which we acquired on February 1, 2013. We estimate higher refinery throughput volumes had a positive impact of $2.01 billion based on the Chicago and USGC LLS 6-3-2-1 blended crack spread, LLS-WTI crude oil differential and sweet/sour crude oil differential. However, we also had higher refinery direct operating costs primarily due to the addition of the Galveston Bay refinery. The following table summarizes our refinery throughputs for 2013 and 2012 . 2013 2012 Refinery throughputs ( thousands of barrels per day ): Crude oil refined 1,589 1,195 Other charge and blendstocks 213 168 Total 1,802 1,363 Sour crude oil throughput percent 53 53 WTI-priced crude oil throughput percent 21 28 The following table includes certain key operating statistics for the Refining & Marketing segment for 2013 and 2012 . 2013 2012 Refining & Marketing gross margin (dollars per barrel) (a) $ 13.24 $ 17.85 Refinery direct operating costs (dollars per barrel): (b) Planned turnaround and major maintenance $ 1.20 $ 1.00 Depreciation and amortization 1.36 1.44 Other manufacturing (c) 4.14 3.15 Total $ 6.70 $ 5.59 (a) Sales revenue less cost of refinery inputs and purchased products, divided by total refinery throughputs. Starting in the fourth quarter of 2013, direct operating costs are no longer included in the Refining & Marketing gross margin and the gross margin is calculated based on total refinery throughput. The 2012 gross margin has been recalculated to reflect a consistent approach. (b) Per barrel of total refinery throughputs. (c) Includes utilities, labor, routine maintenance and other operating costs. 44 Table of Contents Refinery direct operating costs increased $1.11 per barrel of total refinery throughputs in 2013 compared to 2012 , which includes an increase in other manufacturing costs of $0.99 per barrel. The increase in other manufacturing costs was primarily attributable to the addition of the Galveston Bay refinery, which had higher operating costs per barrel of throughput than the average of our other six refineries. We purchase RINs to satisfy a portion of our Renewable Fuel Standard ( RFS2 ) compliance. Our cost of purchasing RINs increased to $264 million in 2013 from $105 million in 2012 , primarily due to higher ethanol and biomass-based diesel RIN prices. Speedway segment income from operations increased $65 million in 2013 compared to 2012 , primarily due to higher gasoline and distillate gross margins and a higher merchandise gross margin, partially offset by higher operating expenses related to an increase in the number of convenience stores . The following table includes certain key operating statistics for the Speedway segment for 2013 and 2012 . 2013 2012 Convenience stores at period-end 1,478 1,464 Gasoline & distillate sales (millions of gallons) 3,146 3,027 Gasoline & distillate gross margin (dollars per gallon) (a) $ 0.1441 $ 0.1318 Merchandise sales (in millions) $ 3,135 $ 3,058 Merchandise gross margin (in millions) $ 825 $ 795 Same store gasoline sales volume (period over period) 0.5 % (0.8 )% Same store merchandise sales (period over period) (b) 4.3 % 7.0 % (a) The price paid by consumers less the cost of refined products, including transportation, consumer excise taxes and bankcard processing fees, divided by gasoline and distillate sales volume. (b) Excludes cigarettes. Pipeline Transportation segment income from operations decreased $6 million in 2013 compared to 2012 . The decrease primarily reflects higher operating expenses and depreciation and lower pipeline affiliate income, partially offset by higher transportation revenue. The higher expenses and revenues were primarily attributable to the formation of MPLX. Corporate and other unallocated expenses decreased $65 million in 2013 compared to 2012 . The decrease was primarily due to lower unallocated employee benefit expenses and lower employee incentive compensation expenses. We recognized a gain of $183 million in 2012 associated with the settlement agreement with the buyer of our Minnesota assets, which included $86 million of the deferred gain that was recorded when the sale transaction was originally closed. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 6 for additional information on the Minnesota assets sale and subsequent settlement with the buyer. We recorded pretax pension settlement expenses of $95 million in 2013 and $124 million in 2012 resulting from the level of employee lump sum retirement distributions that occurred in 2013 and 2012 , respectively. 45 Table of Contents Results of Operations Years Ended December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011 Consolidated Results of Operations (In millions) 2012 2011 Variance Revenues and other income: Sales and other operating revenues (including consumer excise taxes) $ 82,235 $ 78,583 $ 3,652 Sales to related parties 8 55 (47 ) Income from equity method investments 26 50 (24 ) Net gain on disposal of assets 177 12 165 Other income 46 59 (13 ) Total revenues and other income 82,492 78,759 3,733 Costs and expenses: Cost of revenues (excludes items below) 68,668 65,795 2,873 Purchases from related parties 280 1,916 (1,636 ) Consumer excise taxes 5,709 5,114 595 Depreciation and amortization 995 891 104 Selling, general and administrative expenses 1,223 1,059 164 Other taxes 270 239 31 Total costs and expenses 77,145 75,014 2,131 Income from operations 5,347 3,745 1,602 Related party net interest and other financial income 1 35 (34 ) Net interest and other financial income (costs) (110 ) (61 ) (49 ) Income before income taxes 5,238 3,719 1,519 Provision for income taxes 1,845 1,330 515 Net income 3,393 2,389 1,004 Less net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 4 4 Net income attributable to MPC $ 3,389 $ 2,389 $ 1,000 Net income attributable to MPC was $1.00 billion higher in 2012 compared to 2011, primarily due to a higher Refining & Marketing gross margin, which increased to $17.85 per barrel in 2012 from $14.26 per barrel in 2011, partially offset by higher refinery direct operating costs. Sales and other operating revenues (including consumer excise taxes) increased $3.65 billion in 2012 compared to 2011, primarily due to increases in refined product selling prices and sales volumes, crude oil and refinery feedstock sales volumes and consumer excise taxes. Sales to related parties decreased $47 million in 2012 compared to 2011. The decrease resulted from lower refined product volumes sold to Centennial and sales to Marathon Oil after the Spinoff no longer being classified as related party sales. Income from equity method investments decreased $24 million in 2012 compared to 2011. The decrease resulted from an $18 million decrease in income from our ethanol investments and an $8 million decrease in income from our investment in LOOP. Our ethanol investments experienced lower product margins in 2012, primarily due to lower demand for corn ethanol and higher corn prices, and LOOP experienced higher expenses in 2012 compared to 2011. Other income decreased $13 million in 2012 compared to 2011, primarily due to a decrease in income from transition services provided to the buyer of our Minnesota assets and to Marathon Oil and a decrease in sales of RINs. These decreases were partially offset by $12 million of dividend income recognized in 2012 from our preferred equity interest in the buyer of our Minnesota assets, which was paid in connection with our settlement agreement with the buyer. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 6 for additional information on the Minnesota assets sale and subsequent settlement with the buyer. 46 Table of Contents Cost of revenues increased $2.87 billion in 2012 compared to 2011. The increase was primarily due to higher acquisition costs of crude oil and refined products in the Refining & Marketing segment, which resulted from increased volumes, partially offset by decreased prices. The increase in crude oil volumes was partially due to purchases from Marathon Oil not being classified as related party purchases in periods subsequent to the Spinoff. These impacts were partially offset by decreased acquisition costs of other charge and blendstocks, due to decreased volumes and prices. Crude oil volumes were up 6 percent and refined product volumes were up 8 percent, while other charge and blendstocks volumes were down 7 percent. Crude oil acquisition prices were down 1 percent, charge and blendstock prices were down 6 percent and purchased refined product prices were down 4 percent. Purchases from related parties decreased $1.64 billion in 2012 compared to 2011. The decrease was primarily due to purchases of crude oil from Marathon Oil after the Spinoff not being classified as related party transactions. Consumer excise taxes increased $595 million in 2012 compared to 2011, primarily due to the expiration of a federal excise tax credit for blending ethanol and increased excise tax in select states. Depreciation and amortization increased $104 million in 2012 compared to 2011, primarily due to the completion of the heavy oil upgrading and expansion project at our Detroit refinery and Speedway acquisition of 97 convenience stores in 2012. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $164 million in 2012 compared to 2011. Employee compensation and benefit expenses comprised $141 million of the increase, which was primarily due to $117 million of higher pension settlement expenses in 2012 and an increase in the number of administrative employees associated with being a stand-alone company for a full year in 2012 compared to half of the year in 2011, partially offset by a decrease in pension expenses associated with a pension plan amendment. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 22 for additional information on the pension settlements and the pension plan amendment. Contract service expenses increased $52 million primarily due to higher information technology costs, higher refinery-related contract services and contract services associated with the acquisition of the Galveston Bay Refinery and Related Assets. These impacts were partially offset by having no allocations from Marathon Oil subsequent to the Spinoff. Other taxes increased $31 million in 2012 compared to 2011, primarily due to increases in operating taxes of $11 million, personal property taxes of $8 million, real estate taxes of $7 million and franchise taxes of $6 million. These increases were attributable to a number of factors including the completion of the heavy oil upgrading and expansion project at our Detroit refinery, Speedway acquisition of 97 convenience stores and higher feedstock inventory values. Related party net interest and other financial income decreased $34 million in 2012 compared to 2011, primarily due to our short-term investments in preferred stock of MOC Portfolio Delaware, Inc. ( PFD ), a subsidiary of Marathon Oil, being redeemed prior to the Spinoff. The agreement with PFD was terminated on June 30, 2011. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 7 for further discussion of the PFD preferred stock. Net interest and other financial costs increased $49 million in 2012 compared to 2011, primarily reflecting an increase in interest expense associated with the $3.0 billion senior notes issued in February 2011, a decrease in foreign currency gains and an increase in bank service and other fees. We capitalized third-party interest of $101 million in 2012 compared to $104 million in 2011. The capitalized interest was primarily associated with the Detroit refinery heavy oil upgrading and expansion project. Provision for income taxes increased $515 million 2012 compared to 2011, primarily due to the $1.52 billion increase in income before income taxes. The effective income tax rate decreased from 36 percent in 2011 to 35 percent in 2012. The 2012 effective income tax rate was favorably impacted by a decrease in adverse tax impacts from state legislation and other permanent benefit differences. For years 2012 and 2011, adverse tax impacts of state legislation were $9 million and $19 million, respectively. The provision for income taxes for periods prior to the Spinoff has been computed as if we were a stand-alone company. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 12 for further details. 47 Table of Contents Segment Results Revenues are summarized by segment in the following table. (In millions) 2012 2011 Refining & Marketing $ 76,710 $ 73,381 Speedway 14,243 13,490 Pipeline Transportation 459 403 Segment revenues 91,412 87,274 Elimination of intersegment revenues (9,167 ) (8,636 ) Total revenues $ 82,245 $ 78,638 Items included in both revenues and costs: Consumer excise taxes $ 5,709 $ 5,114 Refining & Marketing segment revenues increased $3.33 billion in 2012 from 2011, primarily due to increased refined product selling prices and sales volumes. The table below shows our Refining & Marketing segment refined product sales volumes and prices. 2012 2011 Refining & Marketing segment: Refined product sales volumes (thousands of barrels per day) (a) 1,599 1,581 Average refined product sales prices (dollars per gallon) $ 3.00 $ 2.93 (a) Includes intersegment sales. The table below shows the average refined product benchmark prices for our marketing areas. (Dollars per gallon) 2012 2011 Chicago spot unleaded regular gasoline $ 2.84 $ 2.79 Chicago spot ultra-low sulfur diesel 3.01 2.98 USGC spot unleaded regular gasoline 2.81 2.75 USGC spot ultra-low sulfur diesel 3.05 2.97 Refining & Marketing intersegment sales to our Speedway segment were $8.78 billion in 2012 compared to $8.30 billion in 2011. Intersegment refined product sales volumes were 2.73 billion gallons in 2012 compared to 2.66 billion gallons in 2011, with the increased volumes primarily due to Speedway acquisition of 97 convenience stores in 2012. Speedway segment revenues increased $753 million in 2012 compared to 2011, primarily due to higher gasoline and distillate sales volumes and selling prices, which averaged $3.54 per gallon in 2012 compared to $3.44 per gallon in 2011. The Speedway segment also had higher merchandise sales excluding cigarettes. The increases in gasoline and distillate sales volumes and merchandise sales were primarily due to the acquisition of 97 convenience stores in 2012. Pipeline Transportation segment revenue increased $56 million in 2012 compared to 2011, primarily due to higher transportation tariffs resulting from increased tariff rates in 2012 and the startup of a new crude oil pipeline in 2012. 48 Table of Contents Income before income taxes and income from operations by segment are summarized in the following table.

The following table presents certain market indicators that we believe are helpful in understanding the results of our Refining & Marketing segment business. (Dollars per barrel) 2012 2011 Chicago LLS 6-3-2-1 (a)(b) $ 6.74 $ 3.81 USGC LLS 6-3-2-1 (a) 6.67 2.84 Blended 6-3-2-1 (a)(c) 6.71 3.35 LLS 111.67 112.37 WTI 94.15 95.11 LLS - WTI crude oil differential (a) 17.52 17.26 Sweet/Sour crude oil differential (a)(d) 12.47 9.11 (a) All spreads and differentials are measured against prompt LLS. (b) Calculation utilizes USGC 3% residual fuel oil price as a proxy for Chicago 3% residual fuel oil price. (c) Blended Chicago/USGC crack spread is 52%/48% in 2012 and 53%/47% in 2011 based on MPC refining capacity by region in each period. (d) LLS (prompt) - [delivered cost of sour crude oil: Arab Light, Kuwait, Maya, Western Canadian Select and Mars]. Refining & Marketing segment income from operations increased $1.51 billion in 2012 from 2011, primarily due to a higher Refining & Marketing gross margin per barrel, which averaged $17.85 per barrel in 2012 compared to $14.26 per barrel in 2011, partially offset by higher refinery direct operating costs associated with higher planned turnaround and major maintenance expenses and depreciation and amortization expenses. Our realized Refining & Marketing gross margin for 2012 benefited from increases in the Chicago and USGC LLS 6-3-2-1 blended crack spread of $3.36 per barrel and the sweet/sour crude oil differential of $3.36 per barrel in 2012, and we estimate these had positive impacts on our Refining & Marketing gross margin of $1.68 billion and $870 million, respectively. These favorable impacts on our Refining & Marketing gross margin for 2012 compared to 2011 were partially offset by higher cost realizations of the actual mix of crude oils we processed compared to market indicators. 49 Table of Contents The following table summarizes our refinery throughputs for 2012 and 2011. 2012 2011 Refinery throughputs ( thousands of barrels per day ): Crude oil refined 1,195 1,177 Other charge and blendstocks 168 181 Total 1,363 1,358 Sour crude oil throughput percent 53 52 WTI-priced crude oil throughput percent 28 27 The increase in crude oil throughput in 2012 compared to 2011 was primarily due to the increased crude oil refining capacities of the Garyville and Catlettsburg refineries and the impacts of the planned turnarounds in 2012 and 2011. The decrease in other charge and blendstocks throughput in 2012 compared to 2011 was primarily due to the planned turnarounds in 2012 and a combination of increased crude oil throughput and feedstock economics at our Garyville refinery in 2012. The following table includes certain key operating statistics for the Refining & Marketing segment for 2012 and 2011. 2012 2011 Refining & Marketing gross margin (dollars per barrel) (a) $ 17.85 $ 14.26 Refinery direct operating costs (dollars per barrel): (b) Planned turnaround and major maintenance $ 1.00 $ 0.78 Depreciation and amortization 1.44 1.29 Other manufacturing (c) 3.15 3.16 Total $ 5.59 $ 5.23 (a) Sales revenue less cost of refinery inputs and purchased products, divided by total refinery throughputs.

(c) Includes utilities, labor, routine maintenance and other operating costs. Speedway segment income from operations increased $39 million in 2012 compared to 2011, primarily due to increases in our merchandise gross margin and our gasoline and distillate gross margin, partially offset by higher expenses attributable to an increase in the number of convenience stores. The increase in the merchandise gross margin was primarily due to margin expansion resulting from higher merchandise and food sales along with an increase in the number of convenience stores. The following table includes certain key operating statistics for the Speedway segment for 2012 and 2011. 2012 2011 Convenience stores at period-end 1,464 1,371 Gasoline & distillate sales (millions of gallons) 3,027 2,938 Gasoline & distillate gross margin (dollars per gallon) (a) $ 0.1318 $ 0.1308 Merchandise sales (in millions) $ 3,058 $ 2,924 Merchandise gross margin (in millions) $ 795 $ 719 Same store gasoline sales volume (period over period) (0.8 )% (1.7 )% Same store merchandise sales (period over period) (b) 7.0 % 6.7 % (a) The price paid by consumers less the cost of refined products, including transportation, consumer excise taxes and bankcard processing fees, divided by gasoline and distillate sales volume. (b) Excludes cigarettes. Pipeline Transportation segment income from operations increased $17 million in 2012 from 2011. The increase primarily reflects higher transportation tariffs, partially offset by higher mechanical integrity expenses and a reduction in income from LOOP. 50 Table of Contents Corporate and other unallocated expenses increased $20 million in 2012 compared to 2011. The increase was primarily due to our administrative units realizing the impact of being a stand-alone company in 2012 compared to expenses incurred prior to the June 30, 2011 Spinoff, partially offset by lower pension expenses associated with a pension plan amendment in the second quarter of 2012. We recognized a gain of $183 million in 2012 associated with the settlement agreement with the buyer of our Minnesota assets, which included $86 million of the deferred gain that was recorded when the sale transaction was originally closed. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 6 for additional information on the Minnesota assets sale and subsequent settlement with the buyer. We recorded pretax pension settlement expenses of $124 million in 2012 resulting from the level of employee lump sum retirement distributions that occurred in 2012. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flows Our cash and cash equivalents balance was $2.29 billion at December 31, 2013 compared to $4.86 billion at December 31, 2012 . Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, investing activities and financing activities for the past three years is presented in the following table. (In millions) 2013 2012 2011 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 3,405 $ 4,492 $ 3,309 Investing activities (2,756 ) (1,452 ) 1,295 Financing activities (3,217 ) (1,259 ) (1,643 ) Total $ (2,568 ) $ 1,781 $ 2,961 Net cash provided by operating activities decreased $1.09 billion in 2013 compared to 2012 , primarily due to decrease s in net income of $1.26 billion and non-cash income adjustments of $453 million , partially offset by favorable changes in working capital of $626 million compared to 2012. Net cash provided from operating activities increased $1.18 billion in 2012 compared to 2011, primarily due to increases in net income of $1.00 billion and non-cash income adjustments of $620 million, partially offset by unfavorable changes in working capital of $441 million. For 2013 , changes in working capital were a net $198 million source of cash, primarily due to an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, partially offset by increases in current receivables and inventory volumes. Accounts payable increased $1.45 billion from year-end 2012 , primarily due to higher crude oil payable volumes, and current receivables increased $949 million from year-end 2012 , primarily due to higher refined product receivable volumes attributable to an increase in refined product sales volumes. Both of these increases are associated with the Galveston Bay refinery acquired in February 2013. Changes in inventories were a $305 million use of cash in 2013 , primarily due to higher refined product and crude oil inventory volumes. Changes in working capital were a net $428 million use of cash in 2012, primarily due to a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities resulting primarily from reductions in crude oil prices and payable volumes, partially offset by a decrease in current receivables resulting primarily from reductions in crude oil prices and receivable volumes. Changes in working capital were a net $13 million source of cash in 2011, primarily due to an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities resulting primarily from increases in crude oil prices and payable volumes, partially offset by an increase in current receivables resulting from increases in crude oil prices and receivable volumes and refined product prices. Cash flows from investing activities decreased $1.30 billion in 2013 compared to 2012 and decreased $2.75 billion in 2012 compared to 2011. The investing activity is further discussed below. 51 Table of Contents The consolidated statements of cash flows exclude changes to the consolidated balance sheets that did not affect cash. A reconciliation of additions to property, plant and equipment to reported total capital expenditures and investments follows for each of the last three years. (In millions) 2013 2012 2011 Additions to property, plant and equipment $ 1,206 $ 1,369 $ 1,185 Acquisitions (a) 1,386 180 74 Increase (decrease) in capital accruals 73 (117 ) 53 Total capital expenditures 2,665 1,432 1,312 Investments in equity method investees 124 28 11 Total capital expenditures and investments $ 2,789 $ 1,460 $ 1,323 (a) Includes $1.36 billion in 2013 for the acquisition of the Galveston Bay Refinery and Related Assets, comprised of total consideration, excluding inventory and other current assets, of $1.15 billion plus assumed liabilities of $210 million . The 2012 acquisitions exclude the inventory acquired and liability assumed. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 5 for further details. Capital expenditures and investments for each of the last three years are summarized by segment below. (In millions) 2013 2012 2011 Refining & Marketing (a) $ 2,094 $ 705 $ 900 Speedway (b) 296 340 164 Pipeline Transportation (c) 234 211 121 Corporate and Other (d) 165 204 138 Total $ 2,789 $ 1,460 $ 1,323 (a) Includes $1.29 billion in 2013 for the acquisition of the Galveston Bay Refinery and Related Assets. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 5 . (b) Includes acquisitions of nine convenience stores in 2013 , 97 convenience stores in 2012 and 23 convenience stores in 2011. (c) Includes $70 million in 2013 for the acquisition of the Galveston Bay Refinery and Related Assets. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 5 . (d) Includes capitalized interest of $28 million , $101 million and $114 million for 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , respectively. The acquisition of the Galveston Bay Refinery and Related Assets comprised 49 percent of our total capital spending in 2013 . The Detroit refinery heavy oil upgrading and expansion project, which we completed in 2012, comprised 46 percent and 59 percent (excluding capitalized interest associated with this project) of our Refining & Marketing segment capital spending in 2012 and 2011, respectively. Cash provided by disposal of assets totaled $16 million , $53 million and $144 million in 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , respectively. The $53 million of cash from asset disposals in 2012 primarily included proceeds from a settlement agreement with the buyer of our Minnesota assets. The $144 million of cash from asset disposals in 2011 primarily included the collection of a receivable associated with the sale of the Minnesota assets. Net investments in related party debt securities was a source of cash of $2.40 billion in 2011. All such activity reflected the net cash flow from redemptions and purchases of PFD preferred stock. Prior to the Spinoff, all investments in PFD preferred stock were redeemed, and the agreement with PFD was terminated. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 7 for further discussion of our investments in PFD preferred stock. Net investments were a $74 million use of cash in 2013 compared to a $51 million source of cash in 2012 . The change was primarily due to investments in ethanol affiliates of $75 million and the Sandpiper pipeline project of $24 million in 2013. Net cash used in financing activities totaled $3.22 billion in 2013 , $1.26 billion in 2012 and $1.64 billion in 2011 . The net use of cash in 2013 and 2012 was primarily due to the common stock repurchases through open market purchases and our ASR programs and dividend payments, partially offset in 2012 by proceeds from the issuance of MPLX common units. The use of cash in 2011 was primarily due to the net repayment of debt payable to Marathon Oil and its subsidiaries and net distributions to Marathon Oil, partially offset by cash provided from the issuance of long-term debt. These 2011 activities were undertaken to effect the Spinoff. The year 2011 also included a use of cash of $60 million for debt issuance costs associated with our senior notes, revolving credit agreement and trade receivables securitization facility. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 19 for additional information on our long-term debt. 52 Table of Contents Cash used in common stock repurchases totaled $2.79 billion in 2013 and $1.35 billion in 2012 associated with the share repurchase plans authorized by our board of directors. In 2013 , we repurchased 36 million common shares through open market repurchases. In 2012, we entered into an $850 million ASR program on February 3, 2012, under which we repurchased 20 million shares, and a $500 million ASR program on November 5, 2012, under which we received eight million shares in 2012 and one million shares in 2013. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 9 for further discussion of the share repurchase plans. Cash used in dividend payments totaled $484 million in 2013 , $407 million in 2012 and $160 million in 2011 . The increases in 2013 and 2012 were primarily due to having a full year of dividend payments in those years compared to 2011 and increases in our base dividend. Dividends per share were $1.54 in 2013 , $1.20 in 2012 and $0.45 in 2011. These impacts were partially offset by a decrease in the number of outstanding shares of our common stock as a result of share repurchases in 2013 and 2012. Cash proceeds from the issuance of MPLX common units was $407 million in 2012, of which $203 million was distributed by MPLX to MPC, in partial consideration of assets we contributed to MPLX and to reimburse us for certain capital expenditures incurred with respect to those assets. The initial public offering represented the sale of a 26.4 percent interest in MPLX. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 4 for further discussion of MPLX. Net borrowings and repayments under our long-term debt payable to Marathon Oil and its subsidiaries was a use of cash of $3.62 billion in 2011. The agreements with Marathon Oil and its subsidiaries were terminated in 2011. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 7 for further discussion of these financing agreements. Net distributions to Marathon Oil totaled $783 million in 2011. The net distribution in 2011 was primarily related to $1.47 billion in net cash distributions paid to Marathon Oil, partially offset by income taxes it incurred on our behalf. Derivative Instruments See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk for a discussion of derivative instruments and associated market risk. Capital Resources As of December 31, 2013 , we had no borrowings or letters of credit outstanding under our revolving credit agreements or our trade receivables securitization facility and our liquidity totaled $6.09 billion consisting of: (In millions) December 31, 2013 Cash and cash equivalents $ 2,292 Revolving credit agreement (a) 2,500 Trade receivables securitization facility 1,300 Total $ 6,092 (a) Excludes MPLX $500 million revolving credit agreement, which was undrawn as of December 31, 2013 . Because of the alternatives available to us, including internally generated cash flow and access to capital markets, we believe that our short-term and long-term liquidity is adequate to fund not only our current operations, but also our near-term and long-term funding requirements, including capital spending programs, the repurchase of shares of our common stock, dividend payments, defined benefit plan contributions, repayment of debt maturities and other amounts that may ultimately be paid in connection with contingencies. We have a $2.5 billion unsecured revolving credit agreement ("Credit Agreement") in place with a maturity date of September 14, 2017. The Credit Agreement includes letter of credit issuing capacity of up to $2.0 billion and swingline loan capacity of up to $100 million . We may increase our borrowing capacity under the Credit Agreement by up to an additional $500 million , subject to certain conditions including the consent of the lenders whose commitments would be increased. In addition, the maturity date may be extended for up to two additional one -year periods subject to the approval of lenders holding greater than 50 percent of the commitments then outstanding, provided that the commitments of any non-consenting lenders will be terminated on the then-effective maturity date. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest at either the Adjusted LIBO Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) plus a margin or the Alternate Base Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) plus a margin. We are charged various fees and expenses in connection with the Credit Agreement, including administrative agent fees, commitment fees on the unused portion of our borrowing capacity and fees related to issued and outstanding letters of credit. The applicable interest rates and certain of the fees fluctuate based on the credit ratings in effect from time to time on our long-term debt. 53 Table of Contents The Credit Agreement contains certain representations and warranties, affirmative and restrictive covenants and events of default that we consider to be usual and customary for arrangements of this type, including a financial covenant that requires us to maintain a ratio of Consolidated Net Debt (as defined in the Credit Agreement) to Total Capitalization (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of no greater than 0.65 to 1.00 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter. As of December 31, 2013 , we were in compliance with this debt covenant with a ratio of Consolidated Net Debt to Total Capitalization of 0.16 to 1.00. Other covenants, among other things, restrict our ability to incur debt, create liens on our assets or enter into transactions with affiliates. We were also in compliance with these other covenants contained in the Credit Agreement. MPLX Operations LLC, an affiliate of MPC and wholly-owned subsidiary of MPLX LP, has a $500 million unsecured revolving credit agreement ("MPLX Credit Agreement") in place with a maturity date of October 31, 2017. The MPLX Credit Agreement includes letter of credit issuing capacity of up to $250 million and swingline loan capacity of up to $50 million . The borrowing capacity under the MPLX Credit Agreement may be increased by up to an additional $300 million , subject to certain conditions, including the consent of the lenders whose commitments would increase. In addition, the maturity date may be extended up to two additional one -year periods subject to the approval of lenders holding greater than 50 percent of the commitments then outstanding, provided that the commitments of any non-consenting lenders will be terminated on the then-effective maturity date. Borrowings under the MPLX Credit Agreement bear interest at either the Adjusted LIBO Rate (as defined in the MPLX Credit Agreement) plus a margin, or the Alternate Base Rate (as defined in the MPLX Credit Agreement) plus a margin. MPLX is charged various fees and expenses in connection with the agreement, including administrative agent fees, commitment fees on the unused portion of the borrowing capacity and fees with respect to issued and outstanding letters of credit. The applicable interest rates and certain of the fees fluctuate based on MPLX's ratio of Consolidated Total Debt (as defined in the MPLX Credit Agreement) as of the end of each fiscal quarter to Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the MPLX Credit Agreement) for the prior four fiscal quarters, or the credit ratings in effect from time to time on MPLX's long-term debt subsequent to the Rating Date (as defined in the MPLX Credit Agreement). The MPLX Credit Agreement includes certain representations and warranties, affirmative and restrictive covenants and events of default that we consider to be usual and customary for an agreement of this type, including a financial covenant that requires MPLX to maintain a ratio of Consolidated Total Debt as of the end of each fiscal quarter to Consolidated EBITDA for the prior four fiscal quarters of no greater than 5.0 to 1.0 (or 5.5 to 1.0 during the six-month period following certain acquisitions). As of December 31, 2013 , MPLX was in compliance with this debt covenant with a ratio of Consolidated Total Debt to Consolidated EBITDA of 0.1 to 1.0. Other covenants restrict MPLX from incurring debt, creating liens on its assets and entering into transactions with affiliates. MPLX was also in compliance with these other covenants contained in the MPLX Credit Agreement. On December 18, 2013 , we entered into a three -year, $1.3 billion trade receivables securitization facility with a group of financial institutions that act as committed purchasers, conduit purchasers, letter of credit issuers and managing agents under the facility. The facility is evidenced by a Receivables Purchase Agreement and a Second Amended and Restated Receivables Sale Agreement and replaces the previously existing accounts receivable facility that was set to expire on June 30, 2014 . The facility consists of one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, Marathon Petroleum Company LP ( MPC LP ), selling or contributing on an on-going basis all of its trade receivables (including trade receivables acquired from Marathon Petroleum Trading Canada LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of MPC LP), together with all related security and interests in the proceeds thereof, without recourse, to another wholly-owned, bankruptcy-remote special purpose subsidiary, MPC Trade Receivables Company LLC ( TRC ), in exchange for a combination of cash, equity or a subordinated note issued by TRC to MPC LP. TRC, in turn, has the ability to finance its purchase of the receivables from MPC LP by selling undivided ownership interests in qualifying trade receivables, together with all related security and interests in the proceeds thereof, without recourse, to the purchasing group in exchange for cash proceeds. The facility also provides for the issuance of letters of credit of up to an initial amount of $1.25 billion , provided that the aggregate credit exposure of the purchasing group is limited to no more than $1.3 billion at any one time. To the extent that TRC retains an ownership interest in the receivables it has purchased or received from MPC LP, such interest will be included in our consolidated financial statements solely as a result of the consolidation of the financial statements of TRC with those of MPC. The receivables sold or contributed to TRC are available first and foremost to satisfy claims of the creditors of TRC and are not available to satisfy the claims of creditors of MPC. TRC has granted a security interest in all of its assets to the purchasing group to secure its obligations under the Receivables Purchase Agreement. 54 Table of Contents Proceeds from the sale of undivided percentage ownership interests in qualifying receivables under the facility will be reflected as debt on our consolidated balance sheet, none of which was outstanding as of December 31, 2013 . We will remain responsible for servicing the receivables sold to the purchasing group. TRC pays floating-rate interest charges and usage fees on amounts outstanding under the facility, if any, and certain other fees related to the administration of the facility and letters of credit that are issued and outstanding under the facility. The Receivables Purchase Agreement and Second Amended and Restated Receivables Sale Agreement include representations and covenants that we consider usual and customary for arrangements of this type. Trade receivables are subject to customary criteria, limits and reserves before being deemed to qualify for sale by TRC pursuant to the facility. In addition, further purchases of qualified trade receivables under the facility are subject to termination, and TRC may be subject to default fees, upon the occurrence of certain amortization events that are included in the Receivables Purchase Agreement, which we consider to be usual and customary for arrangements of this type. Our intention is to maintain an investment grade credit profile. As of December 31, 2013 , the credit ratings on our senior unsecured debt were at or above investment grade level as follows. Rating Agency Rating Moody Baa2 (positive outlook) Standard & Poor BBB (stable outlook) The ratings reflect the respective views of the rating agencies. Although it is our intention to maintain a credit profile that supports an investment grade rating, there is no assurance that these ratings will continue for any given period of time. The ratings may be revised or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies if, in their respective judgments, circumstances so warrant. Neither the Credit Agreement, the MPLX Credit Agreement nor our trade receivables securitization facility contains credit rating triggers that would result in the acceleration of interest, principal or other payments in the event that our credit ratings are downgraded. However, any downgrades of our senior unsecured debt to below investment grade ratings would increase the applicable interest rates, yields and other fees payable under the Credit Agreement and our trade receivables securitization facility. In addition, a downgrade of our senior unsecured debt rating to below investment grade levels could, under certain circumstances, decrease the amount of trade receivables that are eligible to be sold under our trade receivables securitization facility, impact our ability to purchase crude oil on an unsecured basis and could result in us having to post a letter of credit under an existing transportation services agreement. Debt-to-Total-Capital Ratio Our debt-to-total capital ratio (total debt to total debt-plus-equity) was 23 percent and 22 percent at December 31, 2013 and 2012 , respectively. December 31, (In millions) 2013 2012 Long-term debt due within one year $ 23 $ 19 Long-term debt 3,373 3,342 Total debt $ 3,396 $ 3,361 Calculation of debt-to-total capital ratio: Total debt $ 3,396 $ 3,361 Plus equity 11,332 12,105 Total debt plus equity $ 14,728 $ 15,466 Debt-to-total capital ratio 23 % 22 % Capital Requirements We have a capital and investment budget for 2014 of $2.43 billion , excluding capitalized interest. Additional details related to the 2014 capital and investment budget are discussed in the Capital Budget Outlook section below. On February 1, 2013, we acquired the Galveston Bay Refinery and Related Assets. Pursuant to the purchase and sale agreement, we may be required to pay BP a contingent earnout of up to an additional $700 million over six years, subject to certain conditions. 55 Table of Contents We made contributions to our funded pension plans in late 2013. Therefore, we do not anticipate any additional contributions will be made in 2014. On January 25, 2014 , our board of directors approved a 42 cents per share dividend, payable March 10, 2014 to stockholders of record at the close of business on February 19, 2014 . At the beginning of 2013, we had total outstanding repurchase authorizations of $650 million. On January 30, 2013, we announced that our board of directors approved an additional $2.0 billion share repurchase authorization through December 2014. On September 26, 2013, we announced that our board of directors approved an additional $2.0 billion share repurchase authorization through September 2015 . During 2013 , the final shares from the $500 million ASR program initiated in 2012 were delivered to us and we paid $2.79 billion to acquire 36 million common shares through open market share repurchases. In addition, at December 31, 2013 we had agreements to acquire additional common shares for $12 million , which were settled in early January 2014. As of December 31, 2013 , we had total outstanding repurchase authorizations of $1.86 billion , which expire in September 2015. We may utilize various methods to effect additional repurchases, which could include open market purchases, negotiated block transactions, ASRs or open market solicitations for shares, some of which may be effected through Rule 10b5-1 plans. The timing and amount of future repurchases, if any, will depend upon several factors, including market and business conditions, and such repurchases may be discontinued at any time. The above discussion contains forward-looking statements with respect to share repurchase authorizations. Factors that could affect the share repurchase authorizations and the timing of any repurchases include, but are not limited to business conditions, availability of liquidity and the market price of our common stock. These factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Contractual Cash Obligations The table below provides aggregated information on our consolidated obligations to make future payments under existing contracts as of December 31, 2013 . The contractual obligations detailed below do not include our contractual obligations to MPLX under various fee-based commercial agreements as these transactions are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements. (In millions) Total 2014 2015-2016 2017-2018 Later Years Long-term debt (a) $ 5,723 $ 170 $ 1,078 $ 269 $ 4,206 Capital lease obligations (b) 516 46 92 89 289 Operating lease obligations 969 191 336 201 241 Purchase obligations: (c) Crude oil, feedstock, refined product and renewable fuel contracts (d) 13,689 12,017 1,005 429 238 Transportation and related contracts 4,016 214 590 777 2,435 Contracts to acquire property, plant and equipment (e)(f) 1,740 551 1,051 138 Service, materials and other contracts (g) 1,857 408 500 364 585 Total purchase obligations 21,302 13,190 3,146 1,708 3,258 Other long-term liabilities reported in the consolidated balance sheet (h) 1,141 74 131 279 657 Total contractual cash obligations $ 29,651 $ 13,671 $ 4,783 $ 2,546 $ 8,651 (a) Includes interest payments for our senior notes and commitment and administrative fees for our Credit Agreement, the MPLX Credit Agreement and our trade receivables securitization facility. (b) Capital lease obligations represent future minimum payments. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 24 includes a capital lease assumed as part of the acquisition of the Galveston Bay Refinery and Related Assets, which was originally recorded at fair value. (c) Includes both short- and long-term purchases obligations. (d) These contracts include variable price arrangements with estimated prices to be paid primarily based on current market conditions. We are in the process of implementing systems that will allow us to estimate prices based on futures curves, which as of December 31, 2013 , has been implemented for contracts with purchase obligations of $4.96 billion . (e) Includes $892 million to fund 37.5 percent of the construction of the Sandpiper pipeline project, as well as other obligations to advance funds to equity method investees. (f) Includes $700 million of contingent consideration associated with the acquisition of the Galveston Bay Refinery and Related Assets. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 5 for additional information on this acquisition. (g) Primarily includes contracts to purchase services such as utilities, supplies and various other maintenance and operating services. (h) Primarily includes obligations for pension and other postretirement benefits including medical and life insurance, which we have estimated through 2023. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 22 . 56 Table of Contents Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Off-balance sheet arrangements comprise those arrangements that may potentially impact our liquidity, capital resources and results of operations, even though such arrangements are not recorded as liabilities under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Our off-balance sheet arrangements are limited to indemnities and guarantees that are described below. Although these arrangements serve a variety of our business purposes, we are not dependent on them to maintain our liquidity and capital resources, and we are not aware of any circumstances that are reasonably likely to cause the off-balance sheet arrangements to have a material adverse effect on liquidity and capital resources. We have provided various guarantees related to equity method investees. In conjunction with the Spinoff, we entered into various indemnities and guarantees to Marathon Oil. These arrangements are described in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 25 . Capital Budget Outlook We have a capital and investment budget for 2014 of $2.43 billion , excluding capitalized interest. This represents a 12 percent decrease from our 2013 spending, which is primarily due to the acquisition of the Galveston Bay Refinery and Related Assets in 2013, partially offset by an expected increase in the Pipeline Transportation segment capital spending. The budget includes spending on refining, retail marketing, transportation, logistics and brand marketing projects as well as amounts designated for corporate activities. We continuously evaluate our capital budget and make changes as conditions warrant. Refining & Marketing The Refining & Marketing segment's 2014 capital budget is $1.21 billion , which includes $348 million for midstream assets. The focus of our spending in the Refining & Marketing segment is on processing more condensate and light crude oil, growing distillate production and increasing export volumes. A number of these projects span multiple years. We have approximately $345 million of capital projects that will allow us to process and handle condensate and light crude oil from the Utica Shale region, of which approximately $225 million has been budgeted for 2014 . We have projects to invest in condensate splitters at our Canton and Catlettsburg refineries to allow the refineries to process up to 60 mbpcd of condensate from the Utica Shale region and to increase the light crude oil processing capacity at our Robinson refinery by 30 mbpcd, which will allow it to run 100 percent light crude oil. These projects are expected to be complete in 2014 for our Canton refinery, 2015 for our Catlettsburg refinery and 2016 for our Robinson refinery. In addition, we completed a truck-to-barge crude system project at our Wellsville terminal and are continuing to purchase new barges to allow Utica production to be transported from our Wellsville terminal to our Catlettsburg refinery. We have approximately $315 million of capital projects that will allow us to increase our diesel production, of which approximately $90 million has been budgeted for 2014 . At our Garyville refinery, we completed a project in 2013 to modify one of the crude units to improve distillate recovery, we completed a hydrocracker expansion in the first quarter of 2014 that increased the hydrocracker capacity to 110 mbpcd and we expect to complete a project to expand the distillate hydrotreater by 10 mbpcd in the first quarter of 2015. At our Galveston Bay refinery, we have a hydrocracker project designed to increase our ULSD production by 9 mbpd by shifting yields from gasoline, which we expect to complete in 2015. At our Robinson refinery, we have a similar project to revamp our distillate hydrocracker to improve margins by processing more feedstock at a lower conversion and shifting approximately 5 mbpd of light products to ULSD production. The project is expected to be completed in 2015. We budgeted $90 million in 2014 and $40 million in 2015 for a front-end engineering and design study for a residual fuel hydrocracker project at our Garyville refinery to increase margins by upgrading residual fuel to ULSD and gas oil. It would use hydrogen produced from low-cost natural gas to increase the liquid volume by approximately ten percent. If we proceed with the project, we expect that it will increase Garyville's ULSD production by 28 mbpd and reduce gas oil purchases by 30 mbpd. If we proceed with this project, we expect to invest $2.2 billion to $2.5 billion and anticipate completion in 2018. We are also evaluating three potential projects for our Galveston Bay refinery. The first project is to increase its hydrotreating capacity that will enable it to produce 100 percent ULSD. The second project is to build a gas oil hydrocracker and shut down one of the smaller catalytic cracking units in order to shift production from gasoline to ULSD. The third is to revamp the existing crude units for improved fractionation and enhanced distillate recovery. The remaining budget is primarily allocated to maintaining facilities and meeting regulatory requirements at our refineries. 57 Table of Contents Speedway The Speedway segment's 2014 capital budget is $327 million , primarily for new convenience store construction and land acquisitions to expand our markets and remodeling and rebuilding projects to upgrade and enhance our existing facilities. We have identified numerous opportunities for new convenience stores and store rebuilds in our existing markets. In addition, we are actively acquiring real estate in western Pennsylvania and Tennessee to be in a position to accelerate the pace of growth in these new contiguous markets over the next several years. Also included in the capital budget are expenditures for technology, equipment and dispenser upgrades. Pipeline Transportation The Pipeline Transportation segment's 2014 capital budget is $760 million , primarily for equity investments in major pipeline projects, new infrastructure and upgrades to replace or enhance our existing facilities. We agreed to fund 37.5 percent of the construction of the Sandpiper pipeline project and serve as an anchor shipper in exchange for an approximate 27 percent equity interest in Enbridge's North Dakota System when the Sandpiper pipeline is placed into service, which is targeted for early 2016. The project is estimated to cost $2.6 billion, of which approximately $1.0 billion is our share. We will also have the option to increase our ownership interest to approximately 30 percent through additional investments in future system improvements. In addition, we agreed to be the anchor shipper on Enbridge Inc.'s proposed Southern Access Extension pipeline in exchange for the option to acquire a 25 percent equity interest in the pipeline. The project is expected to be operational in 2015. As a result of our commitment to the Sandpiper pipeline project, our option for equity interest in the Southern Access Extension pipeline increased an additional 10 percent to a total of 35 percent. We budgeted approximately $460 million in 2014 and $1.45 billion in total for these equity interests. In addition, MPLX is planning to construct a $140 million pipeline to connect Utica Shale production in southeastern Ohio to our Canton refinery. The project is called the Cornerstone Pipeline and it is anticipated to be operational in 2016. Corporate and Other The remaining 2014 capital budget includes $133 million , primarily related to an expansion project for our corporate headquarters and upgrades to information technology systems. In addition, we project $38 million of capitalized interest associated with various capital projects. Our opinions concerning liquidity and capital resources and our ability to avail ourselves in the future of the financing options mentioned in the above forward-looking statements are based on currently available information. If this information proves to be inaccurate, future availability of financing may be adversely affected. Factors that affect the availability of financing include our performance (as measured by various factors, including cash provided by operating activities), the state of worldwide debt and equity markets, investor perceptions and expectations of past and future performance, the global financial climate, and, in particular, with respect to borrowings, the levels of our outstanding debt and credit ratings by rating agencies. The discussion of liquidity and capital resources above also contains forward-looking statements regarding expected capital and investment spending, costs for projects under construction, project completion dates and expectations or projections about strategies and goals for growth, upgrades and expansion. The forward-looking statements about our capital and investment budget are based on current expectations, estimates and projections and are not guarantees of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from these expectations, estimates and projections and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond our control and are difficult to predict. Some factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include prices of and demand for crude oil and refinery feedstocks and refined products, actions of competitors, delays in obtaining necessary third-party approvals, changes in labor, materials, and equipment costs and availability, planned and unplanned outages, the delay of, cancellation of or failure to implement planned capital projects, project cost overruns, disruptions or interruptions of our refining operations due to the shortage of skilled labor and unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, acts of war or terrorist acts and the governmental or military response, and other operating and economic considerations. 58 Table of Contents Transactions with Related Parties Following completion of the Spinoff on June 30, 2011, Marathon Oil retained no ownership interest in us and is no longer a related party. For the period prior to the Spinoff, purchases of crude oil and natural gas from Marathon Oil accounted for five percent of our total cost of revenues and purchases from related parties. Related party purchases of crude oil and natural gas from Marathon Oil were at market-based contract prices. The crude oil prices were based on indices that represented market value for time and place of delivery and that were also used in third-party contracts. The natural gas prices equaled the price at which Marathon Oil purchased the natural gas from third parties plus the cost of transportation. We believe that transactions with related parties, other than certain transactions with Marathon Oil to effect the Spinoff and related to the provision of administrative services, were conducted under terms comparable to those with unrelated parties. On May 25, 2011, we entered into a separation and distribution agreement and several other agreements with Marathon Oil to effect the Spinoff and to provide a framework for our relationship with Marathon Oil. Because the terms of our separation from Marathon Oil and these agreements were entered into in the context of a related-party transaction, the terms may not be comparable to terms that would be obtained in a transaction between unaffiliated parties. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 7 for further discussion of activity with related parties. Environmental Matters and Compliance Costs We have incurred and may continue to incur substantial capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations. If these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services, our operating results will be adversely affected. We believe that substantially all of our competitors must comply with similar environmental laws and regulations. However, the specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of its operating facilities, marketing areas, production processes and whether it is also engaged in the petrochemical business or the marine transportation of crude oil and refined products. Legislation and regulations pertaining to fuel specifications, climate change and greenhouse gas emissions have the potential to materially adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, including costs of compliance and permitting delays. The extent and magnitude of these adverse impacts cannot be reliably or accurately estimated at this time because specific regulatory and legislative requirements have not been finalized and uncertainty exists with respect to the measures being considered, the costs and the time frames for compliance, and our ability to pass compliance costs on to our customers. For additional information see Item 1A. Risk Factors. Our environmental expenditures, including non-regulatory expenditures, for each of the last three years were: (In millions) 2013 2012 2011 Capital $ 50 $ 115 $ 167 Compliance: (a) Operating and maintenance 321 318 354 Remediation (b) 22 24 27 Total $ 393 $ 457 $ 548 (a) Based on the American Petroleum Institute definition of environmental expenditures. (b) These amounts include spending charged against remediation reserves, where permissible, but exclude non-cash provisions recorded for environmental remediation. We accrue for environmental remediation activities when the responsibility to remediate is probable and the amount of associated costs can be reasonably estimated. As environmental remediation matters proceed toward ultimate resolution or as additional remediation obligations arise, charges in excess of those previously accrued may be required. New or expanded environmental requirements, which could increase our environmental costs, may arise in the future. We believe we comply with all legal requirements regarding the environment, but since not all of them are fixed or presently determinable (even under existing legislation) and may be affected by future legislation or regulations, it is not possible to predict all of the ultimate costs of compliance, including remediation costs that may be incurred and penalties that may be imposed. 59 Table of Contents Our environmental capital expenditures accounted for two percent, eight percent and 13 percent of capital expenditures in 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , respectively. Our environmental capital expenditures are expected to approximate $126 million , or five percent, of total capital expenditures in 2014 . Predictions beyond 2014 can only be broad-based estimates, which have varied, and will continue to vary, due to the ongoing evolution of specific regulatory requirements, the possible imposition of more stringent requirements and the availability of new technologies, among other matters. Based on currently identified projects, we anticipate that environmental capital expenditures will be approximately $391 million in 2015 ; however, actual expenditures may vary as the number and scope of environmental projects are revised as a result of improved technology or changes in regulatory requirements and could increase if additional projects are identified or additional requirements are imposed. For more information on environmental regulations that impact us, or could impact us, see Item 1. Business Environmental Matters, Item 1A. Risk Factors and Item 3. Legal Proceedings. Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( US GAAP ) requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the respective reporting periods. Accounting estimates are considered to be critical if (1) the nature of the estimates and assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change; and (2) the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material. Actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used. Fair Value Estimates Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. There are three approaches for measuring the fair value of assets and liabilities: the market approach, the income approach and the cost approach, each of which includes multiple valuation techniques. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities. The income approach uses valuation techniques to measure fair value by converting future amounts, such as cash flows or earnings, into a single present value amount using current market expectations about those future amounts. The cost approach is based on the amount that would currently be required to replace the service capacity of an asset. This is often referred to as current replacement cost. The cost approach assumes that the fair value would not exceed what it would cost a market participant to acquire or construct a substitute asset of comparable utility, adjusted for obsolescence. The fair value accounting standards do not prescribe which valuation technique should be used when measuring fair value and does not prioritize among the techniques. These standards establish a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used in applying the various valuation techniques. Inputs broadly refer to the assumptions that market participants use to make pricing decisions, including assumptions about risk. Level 1 inputs are given the highest priority in the fair value hierarchy while Level 3 inputs are given the lowest priority. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows: Level 1 Observable inputs that reflect unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets as of the measurement date. Active markets are those in which transactions for the asset or liability occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. Level 2 Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data. These are inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the measurement date. Level 3 Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data and may be used with internally developed methodologies that result in management best estimate of fair value. Valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs are favored. Assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest priority level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the placement of assets and liabilities within the levels of the fair value hierarchy. We use a market or income approach for recurring fair value measurements and endeavor to use the best information available. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 17 for disclosures regarding our fair value measurements. Significant uses of fair value measurements include: assessment of impairment of long-lived assets; assessment of impairment of goodwill; assessment of impairment of equity method investments; recorded values for acquisitions; and recorded values of derivative instruments. 60 Table of Contents Impairment Assessments of Long-Lived Assets, Goodwill and Equity Method Investments Fair value calculated for the purpose of testing our long-lived assets, goodwill and equity method investments for impairment is estimated using the expected present value of future cash flows method and comparative market prices when appropriate. Significant judgment is involved in performing these fair value estimates since the results are based on forecasted assumptions. Significant assumptions include: Future margins on products produced and sold . Our estimates of future product margins are based on our analysis of various supply and demand factors, which include, among other things, industry-wide capacity, our planned utilization rate, end-user demand, capital expenditures and economic conditions. Such estimates are consistent with those used in our planning and capital investment reviews. Future volumes. Our estimates of future refinery and pipeline throughput volumes are based on internal forecasts prepared by our Refining & Marketing and Pipeline Transportation segments operations personnel. Discount rate commensurate with the risks involved . We apply a discount rate to our cash flows based on a variety of factors, including market and economic conditions, operational risk, regulatory risk and political risk. This discount rate is also compared to recent observable market transactions, if possible. A higher discount rate decreases the net present value of cash flows. Future capital requirements . These are based on authorized spending and internal forecasts. We base our fair value estimates on projected financial information which we believe to be reasonable. However, actual results may differ from these projections. The need to test for impairment can be based on several indicators, including a significant reduction in prices of or demand for products produced, a poor outlook for profitability, a significant reduction in pipeline throughput volumes, significant reduction in refining margins, other changes to contracts or changes in the regulatory environment in which the asset or equity method investment is located. Long-lived assets used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. For purposes of impairment evaluation, long-lived assets must be grouped at the lowest level for which independent cash flows can be identified, which generally is the refinery and associated distribution system level for Refining & Marketing segment assets, site level for Speedway segment convenience stores or the pipeline system level for Pipeline Transportation segment assets. If the sum of the undiscounted estimated pretax cash flows is less than the carrying value of an asset group, fair value is calculated, and the carrying value is written down if greater than the calculated fair value. Unlike long-lived assets, goodwill must be tested for impairment at least annually, or between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. At December 31, 2013 , we had a total of $938 million of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet. The fair value of our reporting units exceeded book value appreciably for each of our reporting units in 2013 . Equity method investments are assessed for impairment whenever factors indicate an other than temporary loss in value. Factors providing evidence of such a loss include the fair value of an investment that is less than its carrying value, absence of an ability to recover the carrying value or the investee inability to generate income sufficient to justify our carrying value. At December 31, 2013 , we had $463 million of investments in equity method investments recorded on our consolidated balance sheet. An estimate of the sensitivity to net income resulting from impairment calculations is not practicable, given the numerous assumptions (e.g., pricing, volumes and discount rates) that can materially affect our estimates. That is, unfavorable adjustments to some of the above listed assumptions may be offset by favorable adjustments in other assumptions. Centennial experienced a significant reduction in shipment volumes in the second half of 2011 that has continued through 2013. At December 31, 2013 , Centennial was not shipping product. As a result, we continued to evaluate the carrying value of our equity investment in Centennial. We concluded that no impairment was required given our assessment of its fair value based on market participant assumptions for various potential uses and future cash flows of Centennial assets. If current business conditions remain unchanged and the owners of Centennial are unable to find an alternative use for the assets, there could be a future impairment of our Centennial interest. As of December 31, 2013 , our equity investment in Centennial was $29 million and we had a $42 million guarantee associated with 50 percent of Centennial's outstanding debt. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 25 for additional information on the debt guarantee. 61 Table of Contents The above discussion contains forward-looking statements with respect to the carrying value of our Centennial equity investment. Factors that could affect the carrying value of our Centennial equity investment include, but are not limited to, a change in business conditions, a further decline or improvement in the long-term outlook of the potential uses of Centennial assets and the pursuit of different strategic alternatives for such assets. These factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Acquisitions In accounting for business combinations, acquired assets and liabilities and contingent consideration are recorded based on estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition. The excess or shortfall of the purchase price when compared to the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired, if any, is recorded as goodwill or a bargain purchase gain, respectively. A significant amount of judgment is involved in estimating the individual fair values of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, contingent consideration and other assets and liabilities. We use all available information to make these fair value determinations and, for certain acquisitions, engage third-party consultants for assistance. The fair value of assets and liabilities, including contingent consideration, as of the acquisition date are often estimated using a combination of approaches, including the income approach, which requires us to project related future cash inflows and outflows and apply an appropriate discount rate; the cost approach, which requires estimates of replacement costs and depreciation and obsolescence estimates; and the market approach which uses market data and adjusts for entity-specific differences. The estimates used in determining fair values are based on assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain. Accordingly, actual results may differ from the projected results used to determine fair value. The fair value of the contingent consideration we expect to pay to BP is re-measured each quarter using an income approach, with changes in fair value recorded in cost of revenues. The amount of cash to be paid under the arrangement is based on both a market-based crack spread and refinery throughput volumes for the months during which the contract applies, as well as established thresholds that cap the annual and total payment. We used internal and external forecasts for the crack spread and internal forecasts for refinery throughput volumes and applied an appropriate risk-adjusted discount rate to the range of cash flows indicated by various scenarios to determine the fair value of the arrangement. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 5 for additional information on our acquisitions. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 17 for additional information on fair value measurements. Derivatives We record all derivative instruments at fair value. All of our commodity derivatives are cleared through exchanges which provide active trading information for identical derivatives and do not require any assumptions in arriving at fair value. Fair value estimation for all our derivative instruments is discussed in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 17 . Additional information about derivatives and their valuation may be found in Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Obligations Accounting for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations involves numerous assumptions, the most significant of which relate to the following: the discount rate for measuring the present value of future plan obligations; the expected long-term return on plan assets; the rate of future increases in compensation levels; and health care cost projections. We utilize the work of third-party actuaries to assist in the measurement of these obligations. We have selected different discount rates for our funded pension plans and our unfunded retiree health care plans due to the different projected benefit payment patterns. The selected rates are compared to various similar bond indexes for reasonableness. In determining the assumed discount rates, we use our third-party actuary discount rate model. This model calculates an equivalent single discount rate for the projected benefit plan cash flows using a yield curve derived from Aa bond yields. The yield curve represents a series of annualized individual spot discount rates from 0.5 to 99 years. The bonds used have an average rating of Aa or higher by a recognized rating agency and generally only non-callable bonds are included. Outlier bonds that have a yield to maturity that deviate significantly from the average yield within each maturity grouping are not included. Each issue is required to have at least $250 million par value outstanding. 62 Table of Contents Of the assumptions used to measure the year-end obligations and estimated annual net periodic benefit cost, the discount rate has the most significant effect on the periodic benefit cost reported for the plans. Decreasing the discount rates of 4.30 percent for our pension plans and 4.95 percent for our other postretirement benefit plans by 0.25 percent would increase pension obligations and other postretirement benefit plan obligations by $39 million and $25 million, respectively, and would increase defined benefit pension expense and other postretirement benefit plan expense by $3 million and $3 million, respectively. The long-term asset rate of return assumption considers the asset mix of the plans (currently targeted at approximately 62 percent equity securities and 38 percent fixed income securities for the funded pension plans), past performance and other factors. Certain components of the asset mix are modeled with various assumptions regarding inflation and returns. In addition, our long-term asset rate of return assumption is compared to those of other companies and to historical returns for reasonableness. After evaluating activity in the capital markets, along with the current and projected plan investments, we reduced the asset rate of return from 7.50 percent to 7.00 percent effective for 2014. We used the 7.50 percent long-term rate of return to determine our 2013 defined benefit pension expense. Decreasing the 7.00 percent asset rate of return assumption by 0.25 percent would increase our defined benefit pension expense by $4 million. Compensation change assumptions are based on historical experience, anticipated future management actions and demographics of the benefit plans. Health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data, the near-term outlook and an assessment of likely long-term trends. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 22 includes detailed information about the assumptions used to calculate the components of our annual defined benefit pension and other postretirement plan expense, as well as the obligations and accumulated other comprehensive loss reported on the year-end balance sheets. Contingent Liabilities We accrue contingent liabilities for legal actions, claims, litigation, environmental remediation, tax deficiencies related to operating taxes and third-party indemnities for specified tax matters when such contingencies are both probable and estimable. We regularly assess these estimates in consultation with legal counsel to consider resolved and new matters, material developments in court proceedings or settlement discussions, new information obtained as a result of ongoing discovery and past experience in defending and settling similar matters. Actual costs can differ from estimates for many reasons. For instance, settlement costs for claims and litigation can vary from estimates based on differing interpretations of laws, opinions on degree of responsibility and assessments of the amount of damages. Similarly, liabilities for environmental remediation may vary from estimates because of changes in laws, regulations and their interpretation, additional information on the extent and nature of site contamination and improvements in technology. We generally record losses related to these types of contingencies as cost of revenues or selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income, except for tax deficiencies unrelated to income taxes, which are recorded as other taxes. For additional information on contingent liabilities, see Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Environmental Matters and Compliance Costs. An estimate of the sensitivity to net income if other assumptions had been used in recording these liabilities is not practical because of the number of contingencies that must be assessed, the number of underlying assumptions and the wide range of reasonably possible outcomes, in terms of both the probability of loss and the estimates of such loss.
