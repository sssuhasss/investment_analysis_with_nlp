Item 7: Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview General. Grainger is the leading broad-line supplier of facilities maintenance and other related products in North America. Grainger reports its operating results in three segments: Grainger Branch-based, Acklands Grainger Branch-based (Acklands Grainger) and Lab Safety Supply, Inc. (Lab Safety). Grainger distributes a wide range of products used by businesses and institutions to keep their facilities and equipment up and running. Grainger uses a multichannel business model to provide customers with a range of options for finding and purchasing products through a network of branches, sales representatives, direct marketing including catalogs, and a variety of electronic and Internet channels. Grainger serves customers through a network of 610 branches, 18 distribution centers and multiple Web sites. Business Environment. Several economic factors and industry trends shape Grainger business environment. The current overall economy and leading economic indicators provide insight into anticipated economic factors for the near term and help in forming the development of projections for the upcoming year. Consensus Forecast-USA projected 2008 GDP growth of 1.6% and Industrial Production growth of 1.1% for the United States, a decrease from 2007 estimates of 2.2% and 1.9%, respectively. For Canada, Consensus Forecast-USA projected 2008 GDP growth of 1.8%, below the 2007 estimate of 2.6%. In 2007, Grainger benefited from the economic growth in the United States. Grainger sales correlate positively with industrial production growth. With the improvement in Industrial Production and general growth in the economy, Grainger realized an increase in sales across all customer sectors. Grainger sales also tend to increase when non-farm payrolls 10 grow, especially during economic recoveries. Non-farm payrolls increased approximately 1% on average in 2007 over 2006. For 2007, Grainger benefited from the combination of increased Industrial Production and non-farm payroll growth. The light and heavy manufacturing customer sectors, which comprised more than 25% of Grainger total 2007 sales, have historically correlated with manufacturing employment levels and manufacturing production. Manufacturing employment levels in the United States declined approximately 1% on average in 2007 from 2006, however, manufacturing output increased approximately 2%. This contributed to mid single-digit sales growth in the heavy manufacturing and light manufacturing customer sectors for Grainger in 2007. In 2004, Grainger launched a multiyear initiative in the United States to strengthen its presence in top metropolitan markets and better position itself to serve the local customer. The market expansion program contributed to the sales growth in 2007 and is expected to be a driver of growth in 2008 and beyond. The first phase of the market expansion program was completed in 2005. The second, third and fourth phases of the market expansion program were completed in 2007. Phases five and six were more than 50% complete at December 31, 2007, and are expected to be completed during 2008. In 2006, Grainger launched a multiyear product line expansion program in the United States. Over the past two years, Grainger has added approximately 90,000 new products to supplement Industrial Supply plumbing, fastener, material handling and security product lines. The product line expansion program contributed to the sales growth in 2007 and is expected to be a driver of growth in 2008 and beyond. In 2008, Grainger plans to add an additional 50,000 products to further supplement Industrial Supply product lines. Customer buying behavior is also important in Grainger business environment. Grainger believes that customers will continue to focus on reducing their cost to procure facilities maintenance products. Consequently, during 2006, Grainger increased information available to employees for improved service to customers by installing an upgraded SAP branch operating system as part of an overall conversion to an integrated SAP system in the U.S. branch-based business. Grainger financial strength enables it to fund major initiatives and acquisitions and to improve effectiveness. Capital spending in 2007 for the U.S. market expansion program was approximately $88 million, with total capital expenditures of $196 million. For 2008, Grainger anticipates total capital expenditures of $175 million to $200 million. Grainger intends to continue its investment in the market expansion program and information technology enhancements, with spending planned for the following major projects: $50 million to $60 million for U.S. market expansion; $25 million to $30 million for supply chain infrastructure; $20 million to $30 million for information technology; $15 million to $25 million for international expansion. Lease or purchase decisions, based on availability of facilities, may affect the timing and amount of capital expenditures associated with the market expansion program. Matters Affecting Comparability. There were 255 sales days in 2007, compared to 254 sales days in 2006 and 255 sales days in 2005. Grainger operating results for 2007 include the operating results of McFeely Square Drive Screws (McFeely s) from the acquisition date of May 31, 2007. The results of the acquisition are included in the Lab Safety segment. Effective January 1, 2006, Grainger adopted SFAS No. 123R, Share-Based Payment, for the accounting of employee stock-based compensation using the modified prospective method. The effect of the adoption was an approximately $0.14 earnings per share reduction for 2006. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of information related to SFAS No. 123R. During the fourth quarter of 2006, Grainger adopted SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132R. As a result of the adoption, Grainger recorded an additional liability of $36.8 million to Accrued employment-related benefit costs offset by $14.3 million of deferred income taxes and a reduction of Accumulated other comprehensive earnings of $22.5 million. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of information related to SFAS No. 158. Grainger operating results for 2006 include the operating results of Rand Materials Handling Equipment Co. (Rand) from the acquisition date of January 31, 2006. Grainger operating results for 2006 also include the operating results of Professional Inspection Equipment, Inc. (Professional Equipment) and Construction Book Express, Inc. (Construction Book) from the acquisition date of November 17, 2006. The results of these acquisitions are included in the Lab Safety segment. Grainger operating results for 2005 include the operating results of AW Direct from the acquisition date of January 14, 2005. AW Direct results are included in the Lab Safety segment. 11 Results of Operations The following table is included as an aid to understanding changes in Grainger Consolidated Statements of Earnings: For the Years Ended December 31, Items in Consolidated Statements of Earnings As a Percent of Net Sales Percent Increase/(Decrease) from Prior Year 2007 2006 2005 2007 2006 Net sales 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% 9.1% 6.5% Cost of merchandise sold 59.4 60.0 60.9 8.1 4.9 Gross profit 40.6 40.0 39.1 10.6 8.9 Operating expenses 30.1 30.2 29.7 8.8 8.1 Operating earnings 10.5 9.8 9.4 16.0 11.4 Other income (expense) 0.2 0.4 0.3 (55.1) 82.3 Income taxes 4.1 3.7 3.4 19.2 17.9 Net earnings 6.6% 6.5% 6.3% 9.6% 10.7% 2007 Compared to 2006 Grainger net sales of $6,418.0 million for 2007 increased 9.1% when compared with net sales of $5,883.7 million for 2006. There was one more selling day in 2007 versus 2006. Daily sales were up 8.7%. The increase in net sales was led by sales growth in the upper teens in the government sector, high single-digit sales growth in the commercial sector and mid single-digit sales growth in the manufacturing sector. Approximately 3 percentage points of the sales growth came from Grainger ongoing strategic initiatives, market expansion and product line expansion, with another 1 percentage point from foreign exchange. Partially offsetting these sales improvements was a negative 1 percentage point effect from the continued wind-down of low margin integrated supply contracts. Refer to the Segment Analysis below for further detail of Grainger ongoing strategic initiatives. The gross profit margin for 2007 improved 0.6 percentage point to 40.6% from 40.0% in 2006. The improvement in the gross profit margin was primarily driven by positive inflation recovery, partially offset by unfavorable selling price category mix. Operating earnings for 2007 totaled $670.7 million, an increase of 16.0% over 2006. This earnings improvement exceeded the sales growth rate due to an improved gross profit margin and operating expenses which grew at a slightly slower rate than sales. Net earnings for 2007 increased by 9.6% to $420.1 million from $383.4 million in 2006. The growth in net earnings for 2007 primarily resulted from the improvement in operating earnings, partially offset by lower interest income, no counterpart to a gain on the sale of Acklands Grainger interest in the USI-AGI Prairies joint venture in 2006, and a higher effective tax rate in 2007. The results for 2006 included tax benefits from the resolution of uncertainties related to the audit of the 2004 tax year and a tax benefit from a reduction of deferred tax liabilities related to property, buildings and equipment. These benefits increased diluted earnings per share by $0.15 in 2006. Diluted earnings per share of $4.94 in 2007 were 16.5% higher than the $4.24 for 2006. This improvement was higher than the percentage increase for net earnings due to the effect of Grainger share repurchase program. Segment Analysis The following comments at the segment level include external and intersegment net sales and operating earnings. Comments at the business unit level include external and inter- and intrasegment net sales and operating earnings. See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Grainger Branch-based Net sales were $5,352.5 million for 2007, an increase of $441.7 million, or 9.0%, when compared with net sales of $4,910.8 million for 2006. Daily sales were up 8.6%. Daily sales in the United States were up 8.5%, with growth in all customer end markets, led by sales growth in the upper teens in the government sector and high single-digit sales growth in the commercial sector. Approximately 4 percentage points of the sales growth came from Grainger ongoing strategic initiatives, market expansion and product line expansion. The wind-down of Grainger low margin integrated supply contracts reduced sales growth by approximately 1 percentage point. In 2004, Grainger launched a multiyear market expansion program to strengthen its presence in top metropolitan markets and better position itself to serve local customers. 12 Market expansion contributed approximately 2 percentage points to the sales growth for the segment. Results for the market expansion program were as follows: Daily Sales Increase 2007 vs. 2006 Estimated Percent Complete Phase 1 (Atlanta, Denver, Seattle) 15% 100% Phase 2 (Four markets in Southern California) 6% 100% Phase 3 (Houston, St. Louis, Tampa) 13% 100% Phase 4 (Baltimore, Cincinnati, Kansas City, Miami, Philadelphia, Washington, D.C.) 10% 100% Phase 5 (Dallas, Detroit, New York, Phoenix) 9% 75% Phase 6 (Chicago, Minneapolis, Pittsburgh, San Francisco) 9% 65% Product line expansion contributed approximately 2 percentage points to the growth in the segment. Over the past two years, Grainger has added approximately 90,000 new products in the plumbing, fastener, material handling and security product lines as part of its ongoing product line expansion initiative. Daily sales in Mexico increased 22.7% in 2007 versus 2006. In local currency, daily sales were up 22.8%, driven primarily by the ongoing branch expansion program and an improved economy. The segment gross profit margin increased 0.4 percentage point in 2007 over 2006, driven primarily by positive inflation recovery, partially offset by unfavorable selling price category mix. Operating expenses in this segment were up 9.0% in 2007. Expenses grew at the same rate as sales with payroll and benefits growing at a slower rate than sales offset by other operating expenses growing faster than sales, primarily due to increased bad debt expense and provisions and higher facility costs related to market expansion. For the segment, operating earnings of $669.4 million for 2007 increased 12.8% over the $593.5 million for 2006. This earnings improvement exceeded the sales growth rate due to an improved gross profit margin. Acklands Grainger Branch-based Net sales at Acklands Grainger were $636.5 million for 2007, an increase of $71.4 million, or 12.6%, when compared with $565.1 million for 2006. Daily sales were up 12.2%. In local currency, daily sales increased 5.8% due to a stronger economy. This increase was led by the mining sector with sales growth in the low twenties, high single-digit sales growth in the oil sector and mid single-digit sales growth in the government sector. These increases were partially offset by a mid-teens sales decline in the forestry sector. The gross profit margin increased 2.6 percentage points in 2007 over 2006. The improvement in the gross profit margin was primarily due to positive inflation recovery. Operating expenses were up 6.7% in 2007. Expenses grew at a slower rate than sales due to operating expense leverage, the result of improved cost management and lower severance costs. Operating earnings of $44.2 million for 2007 were up $29.0 million, or 190%. This earnings improvement exceeded the sales growth rate due to an improved gross profit margin and operating expenses that grew at a slower rate than sales. Lab Safety Net sales at Lab Safety were $434.7 million for 2007, an increase of $23.2 million, or 5.6%, when compared with $411.5 million for 2006. Daily sales were up 5.2%. Sales from the acquisitions made during 2007 and late 2006 contributed 6.1 percentage points to the growth. The gross profit margin decreased 0.5 percentage point in 2007 over 2006. Gross profit margin was down as a result of increased freight costs and unfavorable selling price category mix and product mix, partially offset by positive inflation recovery. Operating expenses were 4.6% higher in 2007 and grew at a slower rate than sales due to cost management efforts. Operating earnings of $54.3 million for 2007 were up 3.8% over 2006. This earnings improvement was less than the sales growth rate primarily due to a lower gross profit margin. 13 Other Income and Expense Other income and expense was $11.2 million of income in 2007, a decrease of $13.8 million as compared with $25.0 million of income in 2006. The following table summarizes the components of other income and expense: For the Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006 (In thousands of dollars) Other income and (expense): Interest income (expense) net $ 9,151 $ 19,570 Equity in net income of unconsolidated entities 2,016 2,960 Gain on sale of unconsolidated entity 2,291 Unclassified net 41 131 $ 11,208 $ 24,952 The decrease in interest income was primarily attributable to lower average cash balances due to working capital needs and share repurchases. There was a decrease in equity in net income of unconsolidated entities in 2007 versus 2006 primarily driven by the absence of earnings related to the joint venture that was sold. Income Taxes Income taxes of $261.7 million in 2007 increased 19.2% as compared with $219.6 million in 2006. Grainger effective tax rates were 38.4% and 36.4% in 2007 and 2006, respectively. Excluding the equity in net income of unconsolidated entities, the effective income tax rates were 38.5% for 2007 and 36.7% for 2006. The 2006 tax rate benefited from resolution of uncertainties related to the audit of the 2004 tax year and from a reduction of deferred tax liabilities related to property, buildings and equipment. Excluding the equity in net income of unconsolidated entities and the tax benefits noted above, the effective income tax rate for 2006 was 38.9%. For 2008, Grainger is projecting its estimated effective tax rate to be approximately 39%, excluding the equity in net income of unconsolidated entities. 2006 Compared to 2005 Grainger net sales for 2006 of $5,883.7 million were up 6.5% versus 2005. There was one less selling day in 2006 versus 2005. Daily sales were up 6.9%. The increase in net sales was led by low double-digit sales growth in the government sector, high single-digit sales growth in the manufacturing sector and mid single-digit sales growth in the commercial sector. Also contributing to the improvement was growth from the U.S. market expansion and product line expansion programs. Partially offsetting these sales improvements was the negative effect of the continued wind-down of low margin contracts with integrated supply and automotive customers. The gross profit margin of 40.0% in 2006 improved 0.9 percentage point over the gross profit margin of 39.1% in 2005, principally due to selling price category mix and the positive effect of product mix, including the global sourcing of products. The major driver of the improvement in the selling price category mix was reduced sales to integrated supply and automotive customers, which carry lower than average gross profit margins. Grainger operating earnings of $578.1 million in 2006 increased $59.1 million, or 11.4%, over the prior year. The operating margin of 9.8% in 2006 improved 0.4 percentage point over 2005, as the combined effect of increased sales and improvement in gross profit margin exceeded the increase in operating expenses. Operating expenses were up 8.1% in 2006 principally due to higher payroll and benefits driven by increased stock-based compensation expense due to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, and increased healthcare and profit sharing costs, partially offset by lower systems implementation costs. In 2006, net earnings of $383.4 million increased $37.1 million, or 10.7%, over the prior year. The growth in net earnings was due to the improvement in operating earnings and higher net interest income, partially offset by an increase in income tax expense. Diluted earnings per share for 2006 of $4.24 were 12.2% higher than the $3.78 for 2005, the result of higher net earnings and fewer shares outstanding. Segment Analysis The following comments at the segment level include external and intersegment net sales and operating earnings. Comments at the business unit level include external and inter- and intrasegment net sales and operating earnings. See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 14 Grainger Branch-based Net sales of $4,910.8 million increased by 5.6% in 2006 compared to net sales of $4,649.2 million in 2005. Daily sales were up 6.0%. Daily sales in the United States were up 6.0%, with growth in all customer end markets, led by low double-digit sales growth in the government sector and high single-digit sales growth in the heavy manufacturing sector. The wind-down of Grainger low margin integrated supply and automotive contracts reduced sales growth by approximately 2 percentage points. In 2004, Grainger launched a multiyear market expansion program to strengthen its presence in top metropolitan markets and better position itself to serve local customers. Phases 1 through 4 include sixteen markets. Work on Phases 5 and 6 began during 2006. Market expansion contributed approximately 2 percentage points to the sales growth for the segment. Results for the market expansion program were as follows: Daily Sales Increase 2006 vs. 2005 Estimated Percent Complete* Phase 1 (Atlanta, Denver, Seattle) 10% 100% Phase 2 (Four markets in Southern California) 12% 95% Phase 3 (Houston, St. Louis, Tampa) 13% 90% Phase 4 (Baltimore, Cincinnati, Kansas City, Miami, Philadelphia, Washington, D.C.) 8% 90% * Phases are reported once they reach 50% completion. Completion occurs when a new branch opens or a branch expansion or remodeling is finished. In 2006, Grainger launched a multiyear product line expansion program in the United States. The 43,000 products added in 2006 contributed approximately 2 percentage points to the growth in the segment. Daily sales in Mexico increased 20.1% in 2006 versus 2005. In local currency, daily sales were up 21.0%, driven by an improving economy, an expanded telesales operation, new branches in Santa Catarina and Chihuahua and an expanded presence in Tijuana. Segment gross profit margin increased 1.1 percentage points in 2006 over the comparable 2005 period, primarily driven by positive inflation recovery and a positive change in selling price category mix. A major driver in the improvement in selling price category mix was the reduction of sales related to low margin integrated supply and automotive contracts. Operating expenses were up 6.4% for 2006. The operating expense growth was primarily driven by higher payroll and benefits costs due to higher stock-based compensation related to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R and higher profit sharing costs, partially offset by lower systems implementation costs. Operating earnings of $593.5 million for 2006 increased 13.6% over the $522.6 million for 2005. The earnings improvement resulted from higher sales and improved gross profit margins, partially offset by operating expenses, which grew at a faster rate than sales. Acklands Grainger Branch-based Net sales at Acklands Grainger of $565.1 million increased by 12.6% in 2006 compared to 2005 net sales of $502.0 million, including the effect of a favorable exchange rate. Daily sales were up 13.0%. In local currency, daily sales increased 5.8% due to a stronger economy, improved branch presence, and higher sales to the oil and gas sectors, partially offset by weak sales in the forestry industry. The gross profit margin increased 0.5 percentage point in 2006 over 2005 primarily driven by positive inflation recovery. Operating expenses for Acklands Grainger were up 14.9% in 2006, primarily driven by payroll and benefits due to increased headcount and higher severance, information technology, advertising and occupancy costs. Operating earnings of $15.2 million in 2006 increased 8.8% from the $14.0 million in 2005 as a result of sales growth and an improved gross profit margin, partially offset by operating expenses, which grew at a faster rate than sales. Lab Safety Net sales at Lab Safety were $411.5 million for 2006, an increase of $31.4 million, or 8.3%, when compared with $380.1 million for 2005. Daily sales were up 8.7%. The sales growth included the benefit of incremental sales from Rand, acquired on January 31, 2006, and Professional Equipment and Construction Book, acquired on November 17, 2006, as well as sales growth in the manufacturing sector. Rand contributed 4.0 percentage points to the daily sales increase. Professional Equipment and Construction Book contributed 0.6 percentage point to the daily sales increase. Excluding Rand, Professional Equipment and Construction Book, daily sales increased 4.1%. The gross profit margin decreased 0.3 percentage point in 2006 from 2005 primarily as a result of increased freight costs and lower margin Rand product sales, partially offset by positive inflation recovery. 15 Operating expenses of $121.8 million were $12.8 million, or 11.7%, higher in 2006, primarily due to incremental costs associated with the acquisitions, higher advertising costs and increased expenses from the upgrade of the business enterprise resource planning system. Operating earnings of $52.3 million for 2006 were down 0.8% compared to 2005, resulting from a lower gross profit margin and higher operating expenses, partially offset by increased sales. Other Income and Expense Other income and expense was $25.0 million of income in 2006, an improvement of $11.3 million as compared with $13.7 million of income in 2005. The following table summarizes the components of other income and expense: For the Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 (In thousands of dollars) Other income and (expense): Interest income (expense) net $ 19,570 $ 11,019 Equity in net income of unconsolidated entities 2,960 2,809 Gain on sale of unconsolidated entity 2,291 Unclassified net 131 (143) $ 24,952 $ 13,685 The increase in interest income in 2006 was the result of higher interest rates and higher average cash balances. Income Taxes Income taxes of $219.6 million in 2006 increased 17.9% as compared with $186.4 million in 2005. Grainger effective tax rates were 36.4% and 35.0% in 2006 and 2005, respectively. Excluding the effect of equity in net income of unconsolidated entities, the effective income tax rates were 36.7% for 2006 and 35.2% for 2005. The 2006 tax rate benefited from resolution of uncertainties related to the audit of the 2004 tax year and from a reduction of deferred tax liabilities related to property, buildings and equipment. The 2005 tax rate included tax benefits related to a favorable revision to the estimate of income taxes for various state and local taxing jurisdictions and the resolution of certain federal and state tax contingencies. Excluding the equity in net income of unconsolidated entities and the tax benefits noted above, the effective income tax rate was 38.9% for 2006 and 37.0% for 2005. Financial Condition Grainger expects its strong working capital position, cash flows from operations and borrowing capacity to continue, allowing it to fund its operations including growth initiatives, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and repurchase of shares, as well as pay cash dividends. Cash Flow Net cash flows from operations of $468.9 million in 2007, $436.8 million in 2006 and $432.5 million in 2005 continued to improve Grainger financial position and serve as the primary source of funding. Net cash provided by operations increased $32.1 million in 2007 over 2006, driven primarily by increased net earnings. The Change in operating assets and liabilities net of business acquisitions used cash of $106.4 million in 2007. This use of cash was primarily driven by increases in inventory and trade accounts receivable as well as a decrease in trade accounts payable due to the timing of payments at year-end. The increases in inventory and trade accounts receivable were due to product line expansion and increased sales. These changes were partially offset by an increase in other current liabilities due to higher compensation, benefit and profit sharing accruals, the result of increased headcount and improved Company performance. The increase in net cash flows from operations from 2005 to 2006 was primarily attributable to increased net earnings. The Change in operating assets and liabilities net of business acquisitions used cash of $97.2 million in 2006. This use of cash was primarily driven by increases in inventory and trade accounts receivable, which were up due to increased sales and an increase in days sales outstanding. These changes were partially offset by an increase in trade accounts payable due to the higher inventory purchases. Net cash flows used in investing activities were $197.0 million, $139.7 million and $163.0 million for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Capital expenditures for property, buildings, equipment and capitalized software were $197.4 million, $136.8 million and $157.2 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Additional information regarding capital spending is detailed in the Capital Expenditures section below. In 2007, Grainger continued to fund the Company market expansion initiative ($88 million), purchased McFeely ($4.7 million) and purchased its distribution center in China ($6.7 million). In 2006, Grainger also invested $13.9 million to purchase Rand and $20.5 million to purchase 16 Professional Equipment and Construction Book, which are part of the Lab Safety segment. The results of operations for the acquisitions have been included in the consolidated financial statements since the respective acquisition dates. Net cash flows used in financing activities for 2007, 2006 and 2005 were $513.9 million, $492.9 million and $154.1 million, respectively. Treasury stock purchases increased $174.5 million in 2007, as Grainger repurchased 7,051,607 shares, compared with 6,950,900 shares in 2006. Treasury stock purchases were 2,404,400 shares in 2005. As of December 31, 2007, approximately 4.7 million shares of common stock remained available under Grainger repurchase authorization. Dividends paid to shareholders were $113.1 million in 2007, $97.9 million in 2006 and $82.7 million in 2005. Partially offsetting these cash outlays were proceeds and excess tax benefits realized from stock options exercised of $144.2 million, $77.8 million and $66.0 million for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Working Capital Internally generated funds have been the primary source of working capital and for funds used in business expansion, supplemented by debt as circumstances dictated. In addition, funds were expended for facilities optimization and enhancements to support growth initiatives, as well as for business and systems development and other infrastructure improvements. Working capital was $974.4 million at December 31, 2007, compared with $1,155.8 million at December 31, 2006, and $1,290.2 million at December 31, 2005. At these dates, the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 2.2, 2.6 and 2.9, respectively. The current ratio and working capital decrease in 2007 was due to the increase in short-term borrowings and a reduction in cash primarily to fund the accelerated share repurchase program. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Capital Expenditures In each of the past three years, a portion of operating cash flow has been used for additions to property, buildings, equipment and capitalized software as summarized in the following table: For the Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 (In thousands of dollars) Land, buildings, structures and improvements $ 100,380 $ 67,554 $ 52,955 Furniture, fixtures, machinery and equipment 87,389 62,233 59,342 Subtotal 187,769 129,787 112,297 Capitalized software 8,556 8,950 44,950 Total $ 196,325 $ 138,737 $ 157,247 In 2007 and 2006, Grainger investments included the market expansion program, which is designed to realign branches in several metropolitan markets, Mexico and China expansion and the normal, recurring replacement of equipment. In 2005, Grainger investments included the market expansion program, ongoing SAP initiatives, expenditures related to Canadian branch and systems projects, as well as the normal, recurring replacement of equipment. Capital expenditures are expected to range from $175 million to $200 million in 2008. These projected investments include the completion of the market expansion program in the United States, branch expansion in Mexico, ongoing information technology expenditures, support for the product line expansion program, as well as other general projects including the normal, recurring replacement of equipment. Grainger expects to fund 2008 capital investments from operating cash flows, which Grainger believes will remain strong. Debt Grainger maintains a debt ratio and liquidity position that provides flexibility in funding working capital needs and long-term cash requirements. In addition to internally generated funds, Grainger has various sources of financing available, including commercial paper sales and bank borrowings under lines of credit. At December 31, 2007, Grainger long-term debt rating by Standard & Poor was AA+. Grainger available lines of credit, as further discussed in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, were $250.0 million at December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005. Total debt as a percent of total capitalization was 5.0%, 0.4% and 0.4% as of the same dates. The increase in total debt as a percent of total capitalization was primarily the result of short-term borrowings used to fund an accelerated share repurchase program. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of Grainger accelerated share repurchase program. Grainger believes any circumstances that would trigger early payment or acceleration with respect to any outstanding debt securities would not have a material impact on its results of operations or financial position. Certain holders of industrial revenue bonds have various rights to require Grainger to redeem these bonds, thus a portion is classified as Current maturities of long-term debt. 17 Commitments and Other Contractual Obligations At December 31, 2007, Grainger contractual obligations, including estimated payments due by period, are as follows: Payments Due by Period Total Amounts Committed Less than 1 Year 1 3 Years 4 5 Years More than 5 Years (In thousands of dollars) Long-term debt obligations $ 9,485 $ 4,590 $ 4,895 $ $ Interest on long-term debt 675 340 335 Operating lease obligations 200,400 38,578 58,295 40,222 63,305 Purchase obligations: Uncompleted additions to property, buildings and equipment 48,287 48,287 Commitments to purchase inventory 228,534 228,534 Other purchase obligations 103,463 92,819 9,789 855 Other liabilities 113,784 6,747 13,866 16,352 76,819 Total $ 704,628 $ 419,895 $ 87,180 $ 57,429 $ 140,124 Purchase obligations consist primarily of inventory purchases made in the normal course of business to meet operating needs. While purchase orders for both inventory purchases and noninventory purchases are generally cancelable without penalty, certain vendor agreements provide for cancellation fees or penalties depending on the terms of the contract. Payments for Other liabilities represent future benefit payments for postretirement benefit plans and postemployment disability medical benefits as determined by actuarial projections. Other employment-related benefits costs of $33.8 million have not been included in this table as the timing of benefit payments is not statistically predictable. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. See also Notes 10 and 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail related to long-term debt and operating lease obligations, respectively. In addition, Grainger has recorded a noncurrent liability of $14.7 million for tax uncertainties at December 31, 2007. This amount is excluded from the table above, as Grainger cannot make reliable estimates of these cash flows by period. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Grainger does not have any material exposures to off-balance sheet arrangements. Grainger does not have any variable interest entities or activities that include nonexchange-traded contracts accounted for at fair value. Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of financial statements, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses in the financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and other assumptions, which it believes are reasonable. If actual amounts are ultimately different from these estimates, the revisions are included in Grainger results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known. Accounting policies are considered critical when they require management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made and when different estimates than those management reasonably could have made have a material impact on the presentation of Grainger financial condition, changes in financial condition or results of operations. Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. The most significant areas involving management judgments and estimates follow. Actual results in these areas could differ materially from management estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts . Grainger uses several factors to estimate the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable including the age of the receivables and the historical ratio of actual write-offs to the age of the receivables. The analyses performed also take into consideration economic conditions that may have an impact on a specific industry, group of customers or a specific customer. 18 Write-offs could be materially different than the reserves provided if economic conditions change or actual results deviate from historical trends. Inventory Reserves. Grainger establishes inventory reserves for shrinkage and excess and obsolete inventory. Provisions for inventory shrinkage are based on historical experience to account for unmeasured usage or loss. Actual inventory shrinkage could be materially different from these estimates, affecting Grainger inventory values and cost of merchandise sold. Grainger regularly reviews inventory to evaluate continued demand and identify any obsolete or excess quantities of inventory. Grainger records provisions for the difference between excess and obsolete inventory and its estimated realizable value. Estimated realizable value is based on anticipated future product demand, market conditions and liquidation values. Actual results differing from these projections could have a material effect on Grainger results of operations. Stock Incentive Plans. Grainger maintains stock incentive plans under which a variety of incentive grants may be awarded to employees and directors. Grainger uses a binomial lattice option pricing model to estimate the value of stock option grants. The model requires projections of the risk-free interest rate, expected life, volatility, expected dividend yield and forfeiture rate of the stock option grants. The fair value of options granted in 2007 and 2006 used the following assumptions: Year Ended December 31, 2007 Year Ended December 31, 2006 Risk-free interest rate 4.6% 4.9% Expected life 6 years 6 years Expected volatility 24.3% 23.9% Expected dividend yield 1.7% 1.5% The risk-free interest rate is selected based on yields from U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term approximately equal to the expected term of the options being valued. The expected life selected for options granted during each year presented represents the period of time that the options are expected to be outstanding based on historical data of option holders exercise and termination behavior. Expected volatility is based upon implied and historical volatility of the closing price of Grainger stock over a period equal to the expected life of each option grant. The dividend yield assumption is based on history and expectation of dividend payouts. Because stock option compensation expense is based on awards ultimately expected to vest, it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures, using historical forfeiture experience. The amount of stock option compensation expense is significantly affected by the valuation model and these assumptions. If a different valuation model or different assumptions were used, the stock option compensation expense could be significantly different from what is recorded in the current period. Compensation expense for other stock-based awards is based upon the closing market price on the last trading date preceding the date of the grant. For additional information concerning stock incentive plans, see Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Postretirement Healthcare Benefits . Postretirement healthcare obligations and net periodic costs are dependent on assumptions and estimates used in calculating such amounts. The assumptions used include, among others, discount rates, assumed rates of return on plan assets and healthcare cost trend rates. Changes in assumptions (caused by conditions in equity markets or plan experience, for example) could have a material effect on Grainger postretirement benefit obligations and expense, and could affect its results of operations and financial condition. These changes in assumptions may also affect voluntary decisions to make additional contributions to the trust established for funding the postretirement benefit obligation. The discount rate assumptions used by management reflect the rates available on high-quality fixed income debt instruments as of December 31, the measurement date, of each year. A lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and net periodic postretirement benefit costs. As of December 31, 2007, Grainger increased the discount rate used in the calculation of its postretirement plan obligation from 5.9% to 6.5% to reflect the increase in market interest rates. Grainger estimates that the increase in the expected discount rate will increase 2008 pretax earnings by approximately $2.4 million, although other changes in assumptions may increase, decrease or eliminate this effect. Grainger considers the long-term historical actual return on plan assets and the historical performance of the Standard & Poor 500 Index in developing its expected long-term return on plan assets. In 2007, Grainger maintained the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 6.0% (net of tax at 40%) based on the historical average of long-term rates of return. 19 A 1 percentage point change in assumed healthcare cost trend rates would have the following effects on December 31, 2007 results: 1 Percentage Point Increase (Decrease) (In thousands of dollars) Effect on total of service and interest cost $ 4,652 $ (3,597) Effect on accumulated postretirement benefit obligation 29,094 (23,181) Grainger may terminate or modify the postretirement plan at any time, subject to the provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and the Internal Revenue Code, as amended. In the event the postretirement plan is terminated, all assets of the Group Benefit Trust inure to the benefit of the participants. The foregoing assumptions are based on the presumption that the postretirement plan will continue. Were the postretirement plan to terminate, different actuarial assumptions and other factors might be applicable. Grainger has used its best judgment in making assumptions and estimates and believes such assumptions and estimates used are appropriate. Changes to the assumptions may be required in future years as a result of actual experience or new trends and, therefore, may affect Grainger retirement plan obligations and future expense. For additional information concerning postretirement healthcare benefits, see Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Insurance Reserves. Grainger retains a significant portion of the risk of certain losses related to workers compensation, general liability and property losses through the utilization of deductibles and self-insured retentions. There are also certain other risk areas for which Grainger does not maintain insurance. Grainger is responsible for establishing policies on insurance reserves. Although it relies on outside parties to project future claims costs, it retains control over actuarial assumptions, including loss development factors and claim payment patterns. Grainger performs ongoing reviews of its insured and uninsured risks, which it uses to establish the appropriate reserve levels. The use of assumptions in the analysis leads to fluctuations in required reserves over time. Any change in the required reserve balance is reflected in the current period results of operations. Income Taxes. Grainger recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The tax balances and income tax expense recognized by Grainger are based on management interpretations of the tax laws of multiple jurisdictions. Income tax expense reflects Grainger best estimates and assumptions regarding, among other items, the level of future taxable income, interpretation of tax laws and tax planning opportunities. Future rulings by tax authorities and future changes in tax laws and their interpretation, changes in projected levels of taxable income and future tax planning strategies could impact the actual effective tax rate and tax balances recorded by Grainger. Other. Other significant accounting policies, not involving the same level of measurement uncertainties as those discussed above, are nevertheless important to an understanding of the financial statements. Policies such as revenue recognition, depreciation, intangibles, long-lived assets and warranties require judgments on complex matters that are often subject to multiple external sources of authoritative guidance such as the Financial Accounting Standards Board and the Securities and Exchange Commission. Possible changes in estimates or assumptions associated with these policies are not expected to have a material effect on the financial condition or results of operations of Grainger. More information on these additional accounting policies can be found in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. New Accounting Standards The following new accounting standards exclude those pronouncements that are unlikely to have an effect on Grainger upon adoption. In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a company financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. It also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. Grainger adopted FIN 48 on January 1, 2007, and the adoption did not have a material effect on its results of operations or financial position. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of FIN 48. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS No. 157). SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting 20 principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The provisions of SFAS No. 157 are effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. Grainger does not expect adoption of SFAS No. 157 to have a material effect on its results of operations or financial position. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (SFAS No. 159). SFAS No. 159 provides companies with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value. It also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements to facilitate comparisons between companies using different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities. The statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. Grainger does not expect adoption of SFAS No. 159 to have a material effect on its results of operations or financial position. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), "Business Combinations" (SFAS No. 141R). SFAS No. 141R establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree and the goodwill acquired. SFAS No. 141R also establishes disclosure requirements to enable the evaluation of the nature and financial effects of the business combination. The statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, and will be applied to acquisitions after adoption by Grainger. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, "Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements an amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51" (SFAS No. 160). SFAS No. 160 establishes accounting and reporting standards for ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent, the amount of consolidated net earnings attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest, changes in a parent's ownership interest and the valuation of retained noncontrolling equity investments when a subsidiary is deconsolidated. SFAS No.160 also establishes disclosure requirements that clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent and the interests of the noncontrolling owners. The statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. Grainger is currently evaluating the impact that adoption of SFAS No. 160 may have on its results of operations or financial position. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of new accounting standards. Inflation and Changing Prices Inflation during the last three years has not had a significant effect on operations. The predominant use of the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method of accounting for inventories and accelerated depreciation methods for financial reporting and income tax purposes result in a substantial recognition of the effects of inflation in the financial statements. The major impact of inflation is on buildings and improvements, where the gap between historic cost and replacement cost accumulates for these long-lived assets. The related depreciation expense associated with these assets would likely increase if adjustments were to be made for the cumulative effect of inflation. Grainger believes the most positive means to combat inflation and advance the interests of investors lies in the continued application of basic business principles, which include improving productivity, increasing working capital turnover and offering products and services which can command appropriate prices in the marketplace. Forward-Looking Statements This Form 10-K contains statements that are not historical in nature but concern future results and business plans, strategies and objectives and other matters that may be deemed to be forward-looking statements under the federal securities laws. Grainger has generally identified such forward-looking statements by using words such as believe, expect, anticipate, continue, estimate, intend, planned, predict, projection, potential, scheduled, assumption, presumption, may, might, would, could, and will or similar expressions. Grainger cannot guarantee that any forward-looking statement will be realized although Grainger does believe that its assumptions underlying its forward-looking statements are reasonable. Achievement of future results is subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause Grainger results to differ materially from those which are presented. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those presented or implied in a forward-looking statement include, without limitation: higher product costs or other expenses; a major loss of customers; increased competitive pricing pressures; failure to develop or implement new technologies or business strategies; the outcome of pending and future litigation or governmental or regulatory proceedings; changes in laws and regulations; disruption of information technology or data security systems; general industry or market conditions; general economic conditions; labor shortages; facilities disruptions or shutdowns; higher fuel costs or disruptions in transportation services; natural and other catastrophes; unanticipated weather conditions; and the factors identified in Item 1A, Risk Factors. Caution should be taken not to place undue reliance on Grainger forward-looking statements and Grainger undertakes no obligation to publicly update the forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. 21
