ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with the Company consolidated financial statements. OVERVIEW The Company Business The Company develops, manufactures, markets and sells a broad range of household, personal care and specialty products. The Company sells its consumer products under a variety of brands through a broad distribution platform that includes supermarkets, mass merchandisers, wholesale clubs, drugstores, convenience stores, home stores, dollar, pet and other specialty stores, and websites, all of which sell the products to consumers. The Company also sells specialty products to industrial customers and distributors. The Company focuses its consumer products marketing efforts principally on its power brands. These well-recognized brand names include ARM & HAMMER (used in multiple product categories such as baking soda, cat litter, carpet deodorization and laundry detergent), TROJAN condoms, lubricants and vibrators, OXICLEAN stain removers, cleaning solutions, laundry detergent and bleach alternatives, SPINBRUSH battery-operated toothbrushes, FIRST RESPONSE home pregnancy and ovulation test kits, NAIR depilatories, ORAJEL oral analgesics, XTRA laundry detergent, and L IL CRITTERS and VITAFUSION dietary supplements. The Company considers four of these brands to be mega brands : ARM & HAMMER, OXICLEAN, TROJAN, and L IL CRITTERS and VITAFUSION, and is giving greatest focus to the growth of these brands. The Company operates its business in three segments: Consumer Domestic, Consumer International and SPD. The Consumer Domestic segment includes the power brands and other household and personal care products such as SCRUB FREE, KABOOM and ORANGE GLO cleaning products, FELINE PINE cat litter, ANSWER home pregnancy and ovulation test kits, ARRID antiperspirant, CLOSE-UP and AIM toothpastes and SIMPLY SALINE nasal saline moisturizer. The Consumer International segment primarily sells a variety of personal care products, some of which use the same brand names as the Company domestic product lines, in international markets including Canada, France, Australia, the United Kingdom, Mexico and Brazil. The SPD segment is the largest U.S. producer of sodium bicarbonate, which it sells together with other specialty inorganic chemicals for a variety of industrial, institutional, medical and food applications. This segment also sells a range of animal nutrition and specialty cleaning products. In 2013, the Consumer Domestic, Consumer International and SPD segments represented approximately 75%, 17% and 8%, respectively, of the Company consolidated net sales. Fiscal Year 2013 Financial Highlights Key fiscal year 2013 financial results include: 2013 net sales grew 9.3% over fiscal year 2012, with gains in two of the Company three segments, reflecting growth in both the base business and the Company gummy vitamin dietary supplements business. Gross margin increased 80 basis points to 45.0% in fiscal year 2013 from 44.2% in fiscal year 2012, reflecting the benefit of productivity programs outpacing commodity inflation and unfavorable price/mix. Operating margin increased 80 basis points to 19.5% in fiscal year 2013 from 18.7% in fiscal year 2012, reflecting gross margin expansion and selling, general and administrative expenses ( SG&A ) leverage offset by incremental marketing investments. 35 Table of Contents CHURCH & DWIGHT CO., INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES (Dollars in millions, except share and per share data) The Company achieved diluted net earnings per share in fiscal year 2013 of $2.79, an increase of approximately 14% from fiscal year 2012 diluted net earnings per share of $2.45. Cash from operations was $499.6 million, a $24 million decrease from the prior year, reflecting the shift of a $36 million payment of the December 2012 estimated federal tax payment into the first quarter of 2013 as a result of Hurricane Sandy relief. The Company returned $205 million to its stockholders through dividends and share repurchases. Strategic Goals, Challenges and Initiatives The Company ability to generate sales depends on consumer demand for its products and retail customers decisions to carry its products, which are, in part, affected by general economic conditions in its markets. In 2013, many of the markets in which the Company operates continued to experience general economic softness and weak or inconsistent consumer demand. Although the Company consumer products generally are consumer staples and less vulnerable to decreases in discretionary spending than other products, the continued economic downturn has reduced demand in many categories, particularly those in personal care, and affected Company sales in recent periods. Some customers have responded to economic conditions by increasing their private label offerings (primarily in the dietary supplements, diagnostic kits and oral analgesics categories), and consolidating the product selections they offer to the top few leading brands in each category. In addition, an increasing portion of the Company product categories are being sold by club stores, dollar stores and mass merchandisers. These customer actions have placed downward pressure on the Company sales and gross margins. The Company expects the challenging conditions of the last several years to continue in 2014 primarily due to continued weak consumer demand in many categories, new product introductions by competitors and continuing aggressive competitive pricing pressures. In the U.S., a continued slowdown in income growth, the unemployment rate and the uncertainty of unemployment benefits for the long-term unemployed may also adversely impact consumption patterns. To continue to deliver attractive results for stockholders in this environment, the Company intends to continue to aggressively pursue several key strategic initiatives: maintain competitive marketing and trade spending, tightly control its cost structure, continue to develop and launch new and differentiated products, and pursue strategic acquisitions. The Company also intends to continue to grow its product sales geographically (in an attempt to mitigate the impact of weakness in any one area), and maintain an offering of premium and value brand products (to appeal to a wide range of consumers). The Company continues to experience heightened competitive activity in certain product categories from other larger multinational competitors, some of which have greater resources. Such activities have included new product introductions, more aggressive product claims and marketing challenges, as well as increased promotional spending. Since the 2012 introduction in the U.S. of unit dose laundry detergent by various manufacturers, including the Company, there has been significant product and price competition in the laundry detergent category, contributing to an overall category decline. During 2012, the category declined by 0.6% and during 2013, the category declined an additional 3.2%. While the Company laundry detergent sales have increased, more than offsetting the impact of the total laundry detergent category decline, there is no assurance that the category will not decline further or that the Company will be able to offset any such category decline. Moreover, P&G, one of the Company major competitors and the market leader in premium laundry detergent, including unit dose laundry detergent, has recently reconfigured certain of its product offerings and related marketing and pricing strategies and launched various products to compete more directly with the Company core ARM & HAMMER, XTRA and OXICLEAN power brands. For example, in 2014, P&G is launching a lower-priced laundry detergent to compete directly with the Company core value laundry detergents, is attempting to leverage its leadership position in unit dose laundry detergent with the introduction of 36 Table of Contents CHURCH & DWIGHT CO., INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES (Dollars in millions, except share and per share data) a premium unit dose offering, and has launched a versatile stain remover, all of which are expected to be supported by aggressive trade spending and marketing. These actions, together with expected ongoing weak consumer spending and increased price competition, could negatively impact the Company laundry detergent and versatile stain remover businesses. The Company is responding to these competitive pressures by, among other things, focusing on strengthening its key brands, including increased focus on the ARM & HAMMER, OXICLEAN, TROJAN and L IL CRITTERS and VITAFUSION mega brands, which each span various product categories and represented approximately 60% of the Company sales and profits in 2013, through the launch of innovative new products and strong sales execution supported by increased marketing and trade spending. These mega brands have advantages over other power brands, including the ability to leverage research and development and marketing investments and lower overhead costs across mega brand categories. For example, the Company 2014 responsive product introductions include the simultaneous launch of OXICLEAN branded products into the mid/premium tier laundry detergent segment, auto dish detergent category and bleach alternatives with continued support of, and innovation in, the Company base ARM & HAMMER and OXICLEAN businesses, to create scale and maximize marketing efforts. Mega brand launches and launches of other products are anticipated to contribute more incremental new product revenue than the introduction of new products has in prior years, and a significant portion of those revenues will include expansion into new categories with premium household products, supported by increased levels of slotting, trade promotions and incremental marketing support and planned ongoing technology investment. There can be no assurance that these measures will be successful. Despite challenging economic conditions and customer responses to these conditions, the Company was able to grow market share in six of nine of its power brands in 2013, including laundry detergent. The Company global product portfolio consists of both premium (55% of total revenue in 2013) and value (45% of total revenue in 2013) brands, which it believes enables it to succeed in a range of economic environments. The Company value brands have performed strongly during economic downturns, and the Company intends to continue to develop a portfolio of appealing new products to build loyalty among cost-conscious consumers. Over the past 13 years, the Company has diversified from an almost exclusively U.S. business to a global company with approximately 17% of sales derived from foreign countries in 2013. The Company has operations in six countries (Canada, Mexico, U.K., France, Australia and Brazil) and exports to over 90 other countries. In 2013, the Company benefited from its concentration in North America in light of the economic downturn in Europe; however, the Company has continued and will continue to focus on selectively expanding its global business. The Company also continues to focus on controlling its costs. The Company experienced continued high raw material and energy costs throughout 2013. Historically, the Company has been able to mitigate the effects of cost increases primarily by implementing cost reduction programs and, to a lesser extent, by passing along some of these cost increases to customers. The Company has also entered into set pricing and pre-buying arrangements with certain suppliers and hedge agreements for diesel fuel and related surcharges. However, the increased price competition for these commodities in recent periods has diminished the impact of some of these measures and affected the Company gross margins. Additionally, maintaining tight controls on overhead costs has been a hallmark of the Company and has enabled it to effectively navigate recent challenging economic conditions. The identification and integration of strategic acquisitions are an important component of the Company overall strategy. Acquisitions have added significantly to Company sales and profits over the last decade. However, the failure to effectively integrate any acquisition or achieve expected synergies may cause the Company to incur material asset write-downs. The Company actively seeks acquisitions that fit its guidelines, 37 Table of Contents CHURCH & DWIGHT CO., INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES (Dollars in millions, except share and per share data) and its strong financial position provides it with flexibility to take advantage of acquisition opportunities. In addition, the Company ability to quickly integrate acquisitions and leverage existing infrastructure has enabled it to establish a strong track record in making accretive acquisitions. Since 2001, the Company has acquired eight of its nine power brands . In 2013, the Company completed the integration of the acquisition of its L IL CRITTERS and VITAFUSION dietary supplements business, which it acquired in 2012. The Company believes it is positioned to meet the ongoing challenges described above due to its strong financial condition, experience operating in challenging environments and continued focus on key strategic initiatives: maintaining competitive marketing and trade spending, managing its cost structure, continuing to develop and launch new and differentiated products, and pursuing strategic acquisitions. This focus, together with the strength of the Company portfolio of premium and value brands, has enabled the Company to succeed in a range of economic environments, and should position the Company to continue to increase stockholder value over the long-term. Moreover, the generation of a significant amount of cash from operations, as a result of net income and effective working capital management, combined with an investment grade credit rating provides the Company with the financial flexibility to pursue acquisitions, drive new product development, make capital expenditures to support organic growth and gross margin improvements, return cash to stockholders through dividends and share buy backs, and reduce outstanding debt, positioning it to continue to create stockholder value. For information regarding risks and uncertainties that could materially adversely affect the Company business, results of operations and financial condition, see Risk Factors in Item 1A of this Annual Report. Recent Developments Dividend Increase and Share Repurchase Authorization On January 29, 2014 the Board declared an 11% increase in the regular quarterly dividend from $0.28 to $0.31 per share, equivalent to an annual dividend of $1.24 per share or a current dividend yield of approximately 1.9% per share as of February 14, 2014. The decision raises the dividend payout from $155 million to approximately $170 million. On January 29, 2014, the Board authorized a share repurchase program, under which the Company may repurchase up to $500 million of Common Stock. This share repurchase program replaces the Company share repurchase program previously announced on November 5, 2012. In 2013, the Company purchased 0.9 million shares at an aggregate cost of approximately $50 million under the previous share purchase authorization, which is now terminated. In addition, the Board authorized a new evergreen share repurchase program, under which the Company may repurchase, from time to time, the Common Stock to reduce or eliminate dilution associated with issuances of Common Stock under the Company incentive plans. As part of the share repurchase programs, in February 2014, the Company entered into an accelerated share repurchase contract with a commercial bank to purchase $140 million of the Company common stock. The Company paid $140 million to the bank, inclusive of fees, and received an initial delivery of approximately 2 million shares, which reduced the Company shares outstanding. The Company used cash on hand to fund the initial purchase price. The total amount of shares to be ultimately delivered by the bank will be determined by the average price per share paid by the bank during the purchase period, which is expected to end in mid-May 2014. As of the filing of this Annual Report, the Company has made no purchases in 2014 other than those pursuant to the ASR described above. 38 Table of Contents CHURCH & DWIGHT CO., INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES (Dollars in millions, except share and per share data) CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The Company Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. By their nature, these judgments are subject to uncertainty. They are based on the Company historical experience, its observation of trends in industry, information provided by its customers and information available from other outside sources, as appropriate. The Company significant accounting policies and estimates are described below. Revenue Recognition and Promotional and Sales Return Reserves Virtually all of the Company revenue represents sales of finished goods inventory and is recognized when received or picked up by the Company customers. The reserves for consumer and trade promotion liabilities and sales returns are established based on the Company best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date. Promotional reserves are provided for sales incentives, such as coupons to consumers, and sales incentives provided to customers (such as slotting, cooperative advertising, incentive discounts based on volume of sales and other arrangements made directly with customers). All such costs are netted against sales. Slotting costs are recorded when the product is delivered to the customer. Cooperative advertising costs are recorded when the customer places the advertisement for the Company products. Discounts relating to price reduction arrangements are recorded when the related sale takes place. Costs associated with end-aisle or other in-store displays are recorded when product that is subject to the promotion is sold. The Company relies on historical experience and forecasted data to determine the required reserves. For example, the Company uses historical experience to project coupon redemption rates to determine reserve requirements. Based on the total face value of Consumer Domestic coupons redeemed over the past several years, if the actual rate of redemptions were to deviate by 0.1% from the rate for which reserves are accrued in the financial statements, an approximately $3.1 difference in the reserve required for coupons would result. With regard to other promotional reserves and sales returns, the Company uses experience-based estimates, customer and sales organization inputs and historical trend analysis in arriving at the reserves required. If the Company estimates for promotional activities and sales returns were to change by 10% the impact to promotional spending and sales return accruals would be approximately $7.1. While management believes that its promotional and sales returns reserves are reasonable and that appropriate judgments have been made, estimated amounts could differ materially from actual future obligations. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, the Company reduced promotion liabilities by approximately $3.7, $4.0 and $8.2, respectively, based on a change in estimate as a result of actual experience and updated information. These adjustments are immaterial relative to the amount of trade promotion expense incurred annually by the Company. Impairment of goodwill, trade names and other intangible assets and property, plant and equipment Carrying values of goodwill, trade names and other indefinite lived intangible assets are reviewed periodically for possible impairment . For finite intangible assets, the Company assesses business triggering events. The Company impairment analysis is based on a discounted cash flow approach that requires significant judgment with respect to unit volume, revenue and expense growth rates, and the selection of an appropriate discount rate. Management uses estimates based on expected trends in making these assumptions. With respect to goodwill, impairment occurs when the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the discounted present value of cash flows for that reporting unit. For trademarks and other intangible assets, an impairment charge is recorded for the difference between the carrying value and the net present value of estimated future cash flows, which represents the estimated fair value of the asset. Judgment is required in assessing whether assets may have 39 Table of Contents CHURCH & DWIGHT CO., INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES (Dollars in millions, except share and per share data) become impaired between annual valuations. Indicators such as unexpected adverse economic factors, unanticipated technological change, distribution losses, or competitive activities and acts by governments and courts may indicate that an asset has become impaired. The result of the Company annual goodwill impairment test determined that the estimated fair value substantially exceeded the carrying values of all reporting units. In addition, there were no goodwill impairment charges for the three year period ended December 31, 2013. The Company recognized trade name impairment charges within SG&A for the three year period ended December 31, 2013 as follows: 2013 2012 2011 Segments: Consumer Domestic $ 1.9 $ 0.0 $ 0.0 Consumer International 4.6 0.0 0.0 Total $ 6.5 $ 0.0 $ 0.0 The trade name impairment charges recorded in 2013 were a result of actual and projected reductions in sales and profitability as a result of increased competition. The amount of the impairment charges was determined by comparing the estimated fair value of the assets to their carrying amount. Fair value was estimated based on a relief from royalty or excess earnings discounted cash flow method, which contains numerous variables that are subject to change as business conditions change, and therefore could impact fair values in the future. The Company determined that the remaining carrying value of all other trade names exceeded their respective fair values based upon the forecasted cash flows and profitability of the brands. It is possible that the Company conclusions regarding impairment or recoverability of goodwill or other intangible assets could change in future periods if, for example, (i) the businesses or brands do not perform as projected, (ii) overall economic conditions in 2014 or future years vary from current assumptions (including changes in discount rates), (iii) business conditions or strategies change from current assumptions, (iv) investors require higher rates of return on equity investments in the marketplace or (v) enterprise values of comparable publicly traded companies, or actual sales transactions of comparable companies, were to decline, resulting in lower multiples of revenues and EBITDA. A future impairment charge for goodwill or intangible assets could have a material effect on the Company consolidated financial position or results of operations. Property, plant and equipment and other long-lived assets are reviewed whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate possible impairment . The Company impairment review is based on an undiscounted cash flow analysis at the lowest level at which cash flows of the long-lived assets are largely independent of other groups of Company assets and liabilities. The analysis requires management judgment with respect to changes in technology, the continued success of product lines, and future volume, revenue and expense growth rates. The Company conducts annual reviews to identify idle and underutilized equipment, and reviews business plans for possible impairment implications. Impairment occurs when the carrying value of the asset exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows. When an impairment is indicated, the estimated future cash flows are then discounted to determine the estimated fair value of the asset and an impairment charge is recorded for the difference between the carrying value and fair value. 40 Table of Contents CHURCH & DWIGHT CO., INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES (Dollars in millions, except share and per share data) The Company recognized charges related to plant impairment and equipment obsolescence, which occurs in the ordinary course of business during the three year period, ended December 31, 2013 as follows: For the Year Ended December 31, 2013 2012 2011 Segments: Consumer Domestic $ 1.7 $ 1.6 $ 1.9 Consumer International 0.0 0.4 0.2 Specialty Products 0.1 0.1 1.0 Total $ 1.8 $ 2.1 $ 3.1 The 2013 and 2012 Consumer Domestic and SPD charges are due to the idling of equipment and the 2012 Consumer International charge is due to the cancelation of a software project. The 2011 Consumer Domestic charge is a result of the idling of equipment. The 2011 SPD charge is associated with the Company decision to explore strategic options for the specialty chemical business in Brazil. The estimates and assumptions used in connection with impairment analyses are consistent with the business plans and estimates that the Company uses to manage its business operations. Nevertheless, future outcomes may differ materially from management estimates. If the Company products fail to achieve estimated volume and pricing targets, market conditions unfavorably change or other significant estimates are not realized, then the Company revenue and cost forecasts may not be achieved, and the Company may be required to recognize additional impairment charges. Inventory valuation When appropriate, the Company writes down the carrying value of its inventory to the lower of cost or market (net realizable value, which reflects any costs to sell or dispose). The Company identifies any slow moving, obsolete or excess inventory to determine whether an adjustment is required to establish a new carrying value. The determination of whether inventory items are slow moving, obsolete or in excess of needs requires estimates and assumptions about the future demand for the Company products, technological changes, and new product introductions. In addition, the Company allowance for obsolescence may be impacted by the reduction of the number of stock keeping units (SKUs). The Company evaluates its inventory levels and expected usage on a periodic basis and records adjustments as required. Adjustments to inventory to reflect a reduction in net realizable value were $10.1 at December 31, 2013, and $5.7 at December 31, 2012. Valuation of pension and postretirement benefit costs The Company pension costs relate solely to its international operations. Both pension and postretirement benefit costs are developed from actuarial valuations. Inherent in benefit cost valuations are key assumptions provided by the Company to its actuaries, including the discount rate and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Material changes in the Company international pension and domestic/international postretirement benefit costs may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions as well as fluctuations in plan assets. The discount rate is subject to change each year, consistent with changes in applicable high-quality, long-term corporate bond indices. Based on the expected duration of the benefit payments for the Company pension plans and postretirement plans, the Company refers to an applicable index and expected term of benefit payments to select a discount rate at which it believes the plan benefits could be effectively settled. The Company weighted average discount rate for its international pension plans as of December 31, 2013 is 4.48% as compared to 4.16% used at December 31, 2012. Based on the published rate as of December 31, 2013 that matched estimated cash flows for the plans, the Company used a weighted average discount rate of 4.56% for its postretirement plans as compared to 3.89% used at December 31, 2012. 41 Table of Contents CHURCH & DWIGHT CO., INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES (Dollars in millions, except share and per share data) The expected long-term rate of return on international pension plan assets is selected by taking into account the historical trend, the expected duration of the projected benefit obligation for the plans, the asset mix of the plans and known economic and market conditions at the time of valuation. Based on these factors, the Company weighted average expected long-term rate of return for assets of its pension plans for 2013 was 5.45%, compared to 5.35% used in 2012. A 50 basis point change in the expected long-term rate of return would result in an approximate $0.5 change in pension expense for 2014. As noted above, changes in assumptions used by management may result in material changes in the Company pension and postretirement benefit costs. In 2013, other comprehensive income reflected a $5.0 decrease in its remaining pension plan obligations and a $6.6 decrease for postretirement benefit plans. The changes are related to the change in discount rates for all plans and other actuarial assumptions. The Company made cash contributions of approximately $17.5 to its pension plans in 2013, including voluntary contributions of $13.0. The Company estimates it will be required to make cash contributions to its pension plans of approximately $3.4 in 2014 to offset 2014 benefit payments and administrative costs in excess of investment returns. Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized to reflect the future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Management provides a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets for amounts which are not considered more likely than not to be realized. The Company records liabilities for potential assessments in various tax jurisdictions under ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes. The liabilities relate to tax return positions that, although supportable by the Company, may be challenged by the tax authorities and do not meet the minimum recognition threshold required under applicable accounting guidance for the related tax benefit to be recognized in the income statement. The Company adjusts this liability as a result of changes in tax legislation, interpretations of laws by courts, rulings by tax authorities, changes in estimates and the expiration of the statute of limitations. Many of the judgments involved in adjusting the liability involve assumptions and estimates that are highly uncertain and subject to change. In this regard, settlement of any issue, or an adverse determination in litigation, with a taxing authority could require the use of cash and result in an increase in the Company annual tax rate. Conversely, favorable resolution of an issue with a taxing authority would be recognized as a reduction to the Company annual tax rate. New Accounting Pronouncements During the first quarter of 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued guidance for the reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income. The guidance requires an entity to present information about significant items reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income either on the face of the statement where net income is presented or as a separate disclosure in the notes to the financial statements. The Company elected to present the requirements in the notes to the financial statements (see Note 15). The adoption of the new pronouncement did not have an impact on the Company consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In July 2013, the FASB issued guidance requiring an entity to net its liability for unrecognized tax benefits against the deferred tax assets for all same jurisdiction net operating losses or similar tax loss carryforwards or tax credit carryforwards. A gross presentation will be required only if such carryforwards are not available as of 42 Table of Contents CHURCH & DWIGHT CO., INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES (Dollars in millions, except share and per share data) reporting date to settle any additional income taxes resulting from disallowance of the uncertain tax position or the entity does not intend to use these carryforwards for this purpose. The new guidance is effective on a prospective basis for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2013 and interim periods within those years. This new guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. There have been no other accounting pronouncements issued but not yet adopted by the Company which are expected to have a material impact on the Company consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 43 Table of Contents CHURCH & DWIGHT CO., INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES (Dollars in millions, except share and per share data) RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2013, 2012 AND 2011 The discussion of results of operations at the consolidated level presented below is followed by a more detailed discussion of results of operations by segment. The discussion of the Company consolidated results of operations and segment operating results is presented on a historical basis for the years ending December 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011. The segment discussion also addresses certain product line information. The Company operating units are consistent with its reportable segments. Consolidated results 2013 compared to 2012 Net Sales Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2013 were $3,194.3, $272.4 or approximately 9.3% above 2012 net sales. The components of the net sales increase are as follows: Net Sales Consolidated December 31, 2013 Product volumes sold 3.8 % Pricing/Product mix (1.9 %) Foreign exchange rate fluctuations (0.5 %) Acquired product lines (1) 7.6 % Sales in anticipation of information systems upgrade 0.3 % Net Sales increase 9.3 % (1) On October 1, 2012, the Company acquired the L IL CRITTERS and VITAFUSION gummy vitamin dietary supplement business. Net sales of these product lines subsequent to the acquisition are included in the Company results. The volume change primarily reflects increased product sales in the Consumer Domestic and Consumer International segments partially offset by lower SPD sales. Lower price/mix in Consumer Domestic and SPD was partially offset by favorable price/mix in Consumer International. Sales in the first quarter of 2012 were negatively impacted due to a timing shift in customer orders from the first quarter of 2012 to the fourth quarter of 2011 in anticipation of the January 1, 2012 information systems upgrade in the U.S. Gross Profit The Company gross profit for 2013 was $1,438.0, a $146.6 increase as compared to the same period in 2012 due primarily to contributions from its gummy vitamin dietary supplement business, higher sales volume and productivity improvement programs. These increases were partially offset by higher trade promotion and an unfavorable product mix. Commodity costs for the Company were unchanged in 2013 as compared to 2012. Gross margin was 45.0% in 2013 as compared to 44.2% in 2012. Gross margin was higher due to the positive impact of productivity improvement programs and higher sales volume, partially offset by higher trade promotion and coupon costs and unfavorable product mix. Operating Costs Marketing expenses for 2013 were $399.8, an increase of $42.5 as compared to 2012 due primarily to the gummy vitamin dietary supplement business, higher spending in support of certain power brands and new 44 Table of Contents CHURCH & DWIGHT CO., INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES (Dollars in millions, except share and per share data) product launches. Marketing expenses as a percentage of net sales were 12.5% in 2013 as compared to 12.2% in 2012. SG&A expenses for 2013 were $416.0, an increase of $27.0 as compared to 2012 due primarily to operating costs associated with the acquisition of the L IL CRITTERS and VITAFUSION gummy vitamin dietary supplement business, higher research and development and compensation costs and intangible asset impairment charges, partially offset by lower legal expenses. SG&A as a percentage of net sales was 13.0% in 2013 as compared to 13.3% in 2012. Other Income and Expenses Equity in earnings of affiliates was $2.8 as compared to $8.9 in 2012. The decrease is due primarily to an impairment charge recorded in the second quarter of 2013 associated with one of the Company affiliates and lower earnings from Armand as a result of increased raw material costs. Interest expense in 2013 increased $13.7 compared to 2012 principally due to debt incurred to finance the acquisition of the L IL CRITTERS and VITAFUSION gummy vitamin dietary supplement business at the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2012 and interest associated with the financing lease obligation for the Company global headquarters that was fully occupied in January 2013. Taxation The 2013 tax rate was 34.0% as compared to 35.5% in 2012. The effective tax rate for 2013 was favorably affected by a lower effective state tax rate and tax benefits relating to the federal research tax credit for 2013 and the retroactive extension of the federal research tax credit to January 2012 that occurred in the first quarter of 2013. The 2012 tax rate reflects no federal research tax credit. 2012 compared to 2011 Net Sales Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2012 were $2,921.9, $172.6 or approximately 6.3% above 2011 net sales. The components of the net sales increase are the following: Net Sales Consolidated December 31, 2012 Product volumes sold 6.3 % Pricing/Product mix (1.1 %) Foreign exchange rate fluctuations (0.8 %) Acquired product lines (1) 3.1 % Change in fiscal calendar (0.6 %) Sales in anticipation of information systems upgrade (0.6 %) Net Sales increase 6.3 % (1) On October 1, 2012, the Company acquired the L IL CRITTERS and VITAFUSION gummy vitamin dietary supplement business. On June 28, 2011, the Company acquired BATISTE dry shampoo. Net sales of these acquired product lines subsequent to the acquisition are included in the Company results. (See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for further information.) 45 Table of Contents CHURCH & DWIGHT CO., INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES (Dollars in millions, except share and per share data) The volume change primarily reflects increased sales of products in both Consumer Domestic and Consumer International, partially offset by unfavorable product mix and pricing primarily in Consumer Domestic. Sales in the first quarter of 2012 were negatively impacted due to a timing shift in customer orders from the first quarter of 2012 to the fourth quarter of 2011 in anticipation of the January 1, 2012 information systems upgrade in the U.S. Gross Profit The Company gross profit for 2012 was $1,291.4, a $76.9 increase as compared to 2011. The gross profit increase was primarily attributable to higher sales volumes and contributions from the gummy vitamin dietary supplement business, in-house production of unit dose detergent and the Company new manufacturing and distribution facility in Victorville, California, partially offset by unfavorable pricing and mix, higher commodity costs that were partially offset by productivity improvement programs and the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange rates. Gross margin was 44.2% in 2012 as well as in 2011. Gross margin was favorably impacted by manufacturing cost reduction projects partially offset by higher commodity costs and an inventory step-up charge related to the acquisition of the L IL CRITTERS and VITAFUSION gummy vitamin dietary supplement business. Operating Costs Marketing expenses for 2012 were $357.3, an increase of $3.2 as compared to 2011 due primarily to the effect of the acquired businesses, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange rates. Marketing expenses as a percentage of net sales were 12.2% in 2012 as compared to 12.9% in 2011. This reduction is due to a shift toward higher trade promotion spending, which is included in net sales, and partly due to the lower spending rate of the acquired L IL CRITTERS and VITAFUSION gummy vitamin dietary supplement business. SG&A expenses for 2012 were $389.0, an increase of $21.2 as compared to 2011 due to costs associated with the acquisition of the L IL CRITTERS and VITAFUSION gummy vitamin dietary supplement business, higher costs for salaries and fringe benefits, costs associated with the Company new headquarters facility and unfavorable foreign exchange rates partially offset by lower legal expenses. Other Income and Expenses Equity in earnings of affiliates was $8.9 as compared to $10.0 in 2011. The decrease is primarily due to costs related to the start-up of the Natronx joint venture. Interest expense in 2012 increased $5.3 compared to 2011 primarily due to the debt incurred to purchase the L IL CRITTERS and VITAFUSION gummy vitamin dietary supplement business. The Company issued $400 of 2.875% Senior Notes and $250 of commercial paper at the end of the third quarter of 2012. (See the Liquidity and capital resources below in this Management Discussion and Analysis for further information.) Taxation The 2012 tax rate was 35.5% as compared to 37.4% in 2011. The tax rate in 2012 was favorably affected by the settlement of a U.S. Internal Revenue Service audit for the years 2008 and 2009 in the first quarter. The effective tax rate for 2011 included a charge for the establishment of a valuation allowance of approximately $13 against the deferred tax assets of the Company Brazilian subsidiary, offset by a deferred income tax benefit of approximately $6 relating to New Jersey corporate tax reform legislation enacted in April 2011. Segment results for 2013, 2012 and 2011 The Company operates three reportable segments: Consumer Domestic, Consumer International and SPD. These segments are determined based on differences in the nature of products and organizational and ownership 46 Table of Contents CHURCH & DWIGHT CO., INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES (Dollars in millions, except share and per share data) structures. The results of the acquisition of the L IL CRITTERS and VITAFUSION gummy vitamin dietary supplement business are reflected in the Consumer Domestic segment. The Company also has a Corporate segment. Segment Products Consumer Domestic Household and personal care products Consumer International Primarily personal care products SPD Specialty chemical products The Corporate segment income consists of equity in earnings (losses) of affiliates. As of December 31, 2013, the Company held 50% ownership interests in each of Armand and ArmaKleen, respectively, and a one-third ownership interest in Natronx. The Company equity in earnings (losses) of Armand, ArmaKleen and Natronx for the twelve months ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 are included in the Corporate segment. Some of the subsidiaries that are included in the Consumer International segment manufacture and sell personal care products to the Consumer Domestic segment. These sales are eliminated from the Consumer International segment results set forth below. Segment net sales and income before income taxes for each of the three years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 were as follows: Consumer Domestic Consumer International SPD Corporate (3) Total Net Sales (1) 2013 $ 2,413.5 $ 532.8 $ 248.0 $ 0.0 $ 3,194.3 2012 2,156.9 510.1 254.9 0.0 2,921.9 2011 1,979.1 509.1 261.1 0.0 2,749.3 Income Before Income Taxes (2) 2013 $ 501.0 $ 64.5 $ 29.5 $ 2.8 $ 597.8 2012 428.8 71.0 33.8 8.9 542.5 2011 386.0 68.9 29.7 10.0 494.6 (1) Intersegment sales from Consumer International to Consumer Domestic, which are not reflected in the table, were $2.2, $3.4 and $5.2 for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. (2) In determining income before income taxes, interest expense, investment earnings, and other income (expense) were allocated among the segments based upon each segment relative Income from Operations. (3) Corporate segment consists of equity in earnings (losses) of affiliates from Armand, ArmaKleen and Natronx. Product line revenues for external customers for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 were as follows: 2013 2012 2011 Household Products $ 1,436.1 $ 1,411.3 $ 1,295.0 Personal Care Products 977.4 745.6 684.1 Total Consumer Domestic 2,413.5 2,156.9 1,979.1 Total Consumer International 532.8 510.1 509.1 Total SPD 248.0 254.9 261.1 Total Consolidated Net Sales $ 3,194.3 $ 2,921.9 $ 2,749.3 47 Table of Contents CHURCH & DWIGHT CO., INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES (Dollars in millions, except share and per share data) Household Products include deodorizing, cleaning and laundry products. Personal Care Products include condoms, pregnancy kits, oral care products, skin care products and vitamin and mineral supplements. Consumer Domestic 2013 compared to 2012 Consumer Domestic net sales in 2013 were $2,413.5, an increase of $256.6 or 11.9% compared to net sales of $2,156.9 in 2012. The components of the net sales change are the following: Net Sales Consumer Domestic December 31, 2013 Product volumes sold 4.4 % Pricing/Product mix (2.5 %) Acquired product lines (1) 9.6 % Sales in anticipation of information systems upgrade 0.4 % Net Sales increase 11.9 % (1) On October 1, 2012, the Company acquired the L IL CRITTERS and VITAFUSION gummy vitamin dietary supplement business. Net sales of these acquired product lines subsequent to the acquisition are included in the Company results. The increase in net sales reflects sales from the gummy vitamin dietary supplement business and higher sales of ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry detergent, OXICLEAN laundry additives, TROJAN products and FIRST RESPONSE diagnostic kits, partially offset by sales declines in ARM & HAMMER powder laundry detergent, XTRA liquid laundry detergent, SPINBRUSH battery-operated toothbrushes, and ARM & HAMMER cat litter. Sales in the first quarter of 2012 were negatively impacted due to a timing shift in customer orders from the first quarter of 2012 to the fourth quarter of 2011 in anticipation of the January 1, 2012 information systems upgrade in the U.S. Since the 2012 introduction in the U.S. of unit dose laundry detergent by various manufacturers, including the Company, there has been significant product and price competition in the laundry detergent category, contributing to an overall category decline. During 2012, the category declined by 0.6% and during 2013, the category declined an additional 3.2%. While the Company laundry detergent sales have increased, more than offsetting the impact of the total laundry detergent category decline, there is no assurance that the category will not decline further or that the Company will be able to offset any such category decline. P&G, one of the Company major competitors and the market leader in premium laundry detergent, has announced that in 2014 it will launch a lower-priced laundry detergent that may compete directly with the Company core value laundry detergents. This, together with expected ongoing weak consumer spending and increased price competition, could negatively impact the Company laundry detergent business. The Company plans to vigorously combat these pressures through, among other things, significant new product introductions such as the 2014 launch of an OXICLEAN premium priced laundry detergent, and increased marketing spending. However, there can be no assurance that these measures will be successful. Consumer Domestic income before income taxes for 2013 was $501.0, a $72.2 increase as compared to 2012. The increase is due primarily to the contribution from the acquisition of the L IL CRITTERS and VITAFUSION gummy vitamin dietary supplement business (net of higher interest expense), the impact of higher sales volumes and lower manufacturing costs resulting from productivity improvement projects, partially offset by higher trade promotion and coupon costs, the effect of unfavorable product mix and higher marketing and SG&A expenses. 48 Table of Contents CHURCH & DWIGHT CO., INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES (Dollars in millions, except share and per share data) 2012 compared to 2011 Consumer Domestic net sales in 2012 were $2,156.9, an increase of $177.8 or 9.0 % compared to net sales of $1,979.1 in 2011. The components of the net sales change are the following: Net Sales Consumer Domestic December 31, 2012 Product volumes sold 8.2 % Pricing/Product mix (1.9 %) Acquired product lines (1) 3.5 % Sales in anticipation of information systems upgrade (0.8 %) Net Sales increase 9.0 % (1) On October 1, 2012, the Company acquired the L IL CRITTERS and VITAFUSION gummy vitamin dietary supplement business. Net sales of these product lines subsequent to the acquisition are included in the Company segment results. (See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for further information.) The increase in net sales reflects sales from the acquisition of the L IL CRITTERS and VITAFUSION gummy vitamin dietary supplement business and higher sales of ARM & HAMMER liquid laundry detergent, XTRA liquid laundry detergent, ARM & HAMMER cat litter, OXICLEAN laundry additives and the recently introduced ARM & HAMMER CRYSTAL BURST unit dose laundry detergent. These increases were partially offset by lower sales of ARM & HAMMER powder laundry detergent, SPINBRUSH battery-operated toothbrushes, ANSWER diagnostic kits and ARRID deodorant. Sales in the first quarter of 2012 were negatively impacted due to a timing shift in customer orders from the first quarter of 2012 to the fourth quarter of 2011 in anticipation of the January 1, 2012 information systems upgrade in the U.S. Consumer Domestic income before income taxes for 2012 was $428.8, a $42.8 increase as compared to 2011. The increase is due primarily to the impact of higher sales volumes, partially offset by the effect of unfavorable product mix and pricing and higher SG&A costs. Higher commodity and manufacturing costs were largely offset by productivity gains. The acquisition of the L IL CRITTERS and VITAFUSION gummy vitamin dietary supplement business did not materially impact income before income taxes due to an inventory step-up charge and interest expense offsetting the operating income of the business. Consumer International 2013 compared to 2012 Consumer International net sales in 2013 were $532.8, an increase of $22.7 or 4.5% as compared to 2012. The components of the net sales change are the following: Net Sales Consumer International December 31, 2013 Product volumes sold 2.8 % Pricing/Product mix 0.9 % Foreign exchange rate fluctuations (2.3 %) Acquired product lines (1) 3.1 % Net Sales increase 4.5 % 49 Table of Contents CHURCH & DWIGHT CO., INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES (Dollars in millions, except share and per share data) (1) On October 1, 2012, the Company acquired the L IL CRITTERS and VITAFUSION gummy vitamin dietary supplement business. Net sales of these product lines subsequent to the acquisition are included in the Consumer International results. Higher sales in 2013 occurred primarily in Mexico, Canada, Brazil, United Kingdom and U.S. exports. Consumer International income before income taxes was $64.5 in 2013, a decrease of $6.5 compared to 2012 caused by unfavorable foreign exchange rates, a trade name impairment charge and marketing expenses, partially offset by the contribution from the acquisition of the L IL CRITTERS and VITAFUSION gummy vitamin dietary supplement business, higher sales volume and favorable price/mix. 2012 compared to 2011 Consumer International net sales in 2012 were $510.1, an increase of $1.0 or 0.2% as compared to 2011. The components of the net sales change are the following: Net Sales Consumer International December 31, 2012 Product volumes sold 3.9 % Pricing/Product mix (0.6 %) Foreign exchange rate fluctuations (3.3 %) Acquired product lines (1) 3.1 % Change in fiscal calendar (2) (2.9 %) Net Sales increase 0.2 % (1) On June 28, 2011, the Company acquired BATISTE dry shampoo. Net sales of this product line subsequent to the acquisition are included in the Company segment results. (See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for further information.) (2) Beginning in 2012, the Company changed to a calendar year reporting basis. To facilitate this change, the fourth quarter of 2011 included an additional period of reporting for those three subsidiaries outside of North America that previously reported one month prior to period presented. This change increased 2011 net sales by $14.3 and had a nominal impact on net income for 2011. Higher sales volumes in 2012 occurred principally in Canada, United Kingdom and France. Higher U.S. exports also contributed to the sales increase. The BATISTE acquisition contributed a full year of sales as compared to six months in 2011. Consumer International income before income taxes was $71.0 in 2012, an increase of $2.1 compared to 2011. Higher profits are attributable to higher sales volume and contribution from the BATISTE acquisition, partially offset by higher commodity costs, unfavorable pricing and product mix and unfavorable foreign exchange rates. 50 Table of Contents CHURCH & DWIGHT CO., INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES (Dollars in millions, except share and per share data) Specialty Products 2013 compared to 2012 SPD net sales were $248.0 for 2013, a decrease of $6.9, or 2.7% as compared to 2012. The components of the net sales change are the following: Net Sales SPD December 31, 2013 Product volumes sold 0.0 % Pricing/Product mix (1.8 %) Foreign exchange rate fluctuations (1.3 %) Sales in anticipation of information systems upgrade 0.4 % Net Sales decrease (2.7 %) The sales decrease in 2013 reflects reduced product sales of animal nutrition products, partially offset by higher bulk sales of sodium bicarbonate. Colder than normal weather during the second quarter of 2013 negatively impacted demand from the dairy industry. In addition, the decrease in net sales of 2013 was offset by the adverse impact in the first quarter of 2012 of a timing shift in customer orders from the first quarter of 2012 to the fourth quarter of 2011 in anticipation of the January 1, 2012 information systems upgrade in the U.S. SPD income before income taxes was $29.5 in 2013, a decrease of $4.3 as compared to 2012. The decrease in the income before income taxes for 2013 is due primarily to lower selling prices for animal nutrition products, partially offset by lower SG&A expenses. 2012 compared to 2011 SPD net sales were $254.9 for 2012, a decrease of $6.2, or 2.4% as compared to 2011. The components of the net sales change are the following: Net Sales SPD December 31, 2012 Product volumes sold (3.1 %) Pricing/Product mix 3.9 % Foreign exchange rate fluctuations (2.4 %) Sales in anticipation of information systems upgrade (0.8 %) Net Sales decrease (2.4 %) The sales volume decrease in 2012 reflects reduced product sales of certain animal nutrition products, partially offset by higher pricing. The reduction in net sales is also due to unfavorable foreign exchange rates and the adverse impact in the first quarter of 2012 of a timing shift in customer orders from the first quarter of 2012 to the fourth quarter of 2011 in anticipation of the January 1, 2012 information systems upgrade in the U.S. SPD income before income taxes was $33.8 in 2012, an increase of $4.1 as compared to 2011. The increase in the income before income taxes for 2012 primarily reflects higher selling prices partially offset by lower sales volume, higher raw material costs of certain animal nutrition and performance products and foreign exchange rates. 51 Table of Contents CHURCH & DWIGHT CO., INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES (Dollars in millions, except share and per share data) Corporate The Corporate segment reflects the administrative costs of the production, planning and logistics functions which are included in SG&A expenses in the operating segments but are elements of cost of sales in the Company Consolidated Statements of Income. Such amounts were $31.3, $29.4, and $25.3 for 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Also included in Corporate are equity in earnings (losses) of affiliates from Armand, ArmaKleen and Natronx. The reduction in equity in earnings of affiliates in 2013 is primarily due to a $3.2 impairment charge associated with one of the Company investment in affiliates. The charge is the result of the Company assessment of the financial impact of the delay in anticipated discounted cash flows from the affiliate. Liquidity and capital resources As of December 31, 2013, the Company had $496.9 in cash, approximately $350 available through the revolving facility under its Credit Agreement and its commercial paper program, and a commitment increase feature under the Credit Agreement that enables the Company to borrow up to an additional $500, subject to lending commitments of the participating lenders and certain conditions as described in the Credit Agreement. To preserve its liquidity, the Company invests its cash primarily in prime money market funds and short term bank deposits. As of December 31, 2013, the amount of cash and cash equivalents included in the Company assets, that was held by foreign subsidiaries was approximately $231.1. If these funds are needed for operations in the U.S., the Company will be required to accrue and pay taxes in the U.S. to repatriate these funds. However, the Company intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside the U.S., and the Company does not currently expect to repatriate them to fund operations in the U.S. On September 26, 2012, the Company closed an underwritten public offering of $400 aggregate principal amount of 2.875% Senior Notes (the 2022 Notes ). The 2022 Notes were issued under the second supplemental indenture (the Second Supplemental Indenture ), dated September 26, 2012, to the indenture dated December 15, 2010, between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee. Interest on the 2022 Notes is payable semi-annually, beginning April 1, 2013. The 2022 Notes will mature on October 1, 2022, unless earlier retired or redeemed pursuant to the terms of the Second Supplemental Indenture. The Company used $250 from commercial paper issuances, along with the $400 of 2022 Notes and cash, to purchase the L IL CRITTERS and VITAFUSION gummy vitamin dietary supplement business on October 1, 2012. On December 15, 2010, the Company completed an underwritten public offering of $250 aggregate principal amount of 3.35% senior notes due 2015 (the 2015 Notes ). The 2015 Notes were issued under (the Base Indenture ), and a first supplemental indenture (the First Supplemental Indenture ), dated December 15, 2010, between the Company and BNY Mellon, as trustee. On December 30, 2010, the proceeds of the offering were utilized to retire the outstanding $250 principal amount of the Company 6% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2012. Interest on the 2015 Notes is payable on June 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning June 15, 2011. The 2015 Notes will mature on December 15, 2015, unless earlier retired or redeemed pursuant to the terms of the First Supplemental Indenture. The current economic environment presents risks that could have adverse consequences for the Company liquidity. (See Unfavorable economic conditions could adversely affect demand for the Company products under Risk Factors in Item 1A of this Annual Report.) The Company does not anticipate that current economic conditions will adversely affect its ability to comply with the financial covenants in the Credit Agreement 52 Table of Contents CHURCH & DWIGHT CO., INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES (Dollars in millions, except share and per share data) because the Company currently is, and anticipates that it will continue to be, in compliance with the minimum interest coverage ratio requirement and the maximum leverage ratio requirement under the Credit Agreement. These financial ratios are discussed in more detail in this section under Certain Financial Covenants. On January 30, 2013, the Board increased the Company regular quarterly dividend from $0.24 per share to $0.28 per share, equivalent to an annual dividend rate of $1.12 per share, commencing with the dividend payable on March 1, 2013 to stockholders of record at the close of business on February 15, 2013. The higher dividend raised the Company annualized dividend payout from approximately $135 to approximately $155. On January 29, 2014, the Board declared an 11% increase in the regular quarterly dividend from $0.28 to $0.31 per share, equivalent to an annual dividend of $1.24 per share or a current dividend yield of approximately 1.9% per share. The decision raises the dividend payout from $155 to approximately $170. On January 29, 2014, the Board authorized a share repurchase program, under which the Company may repurchase up to $500 million of Common Stock. This share repurchase program replaces the Company share repurchase program previously announced on November 5, 2012. In 2013, the Company purchased 0.9 million shares at an aggregate cost of approximately $50 million under the previous share purchase authorization, which is now terminated. In addition, the Board authorized a new evergreen share repurchase program, under which the Company may repurchase, from time to time, the Common Stock to reduce or eliminate dilution associated with issuances of Common Stock under the Company incentive plans. As part of the share repurchase programs, in February 2014, the Company entered into an accelerated share repurchase contract with a commercial bank to purchase $140 million of the Company common stock. The Company paid $140 million to the bank, inclusive of fees, and received an initial delivery of approximately 2 million shares, which reduced the Company shares outstanding. The Company used cash on hand to fund the initial purchase price. The total amount of shares to be ultimately delivered by the bank will be determined by the average price per share paid by the bank during the purchase period, which is expected to end in mid-May 2014. As of the filing of this Annual Report, the Company has made no purchases in 2014 other than those pursuant to the ASR described above. The Company anticipates that its cash from operations, together with its current borrowing capacity, will be sufficient to meet its capital expenditure program costs, which are expected to be approximately $85.0 in 2014, fund its share repurchase program to the extent implemented by management and pay dividends at the latest approved rate. Cash may be used for acquisitions that would complement the Company existing product lines or geographic markets. The Company did not have any mandatory fixed rate debt principal payments in 2013 and will not have any in 2014. Net Debt The Company had outstanding total debt of $803.3 and cash of $496.9 at December 31, 2013, resulting in net debt of $306.4 at December 31, 2013. This compares to total debt of $903.2 and cash of $343.0, resulting in net debt of $560.2 at December 31, 2012. Net debt is defined as cash less total debt. 53 Table of Contents CHURCH & DWIGHT CO., INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES (Dollars in millions, except share and per share data) Cash Flow Analysis Year Ending December 31, 2013 2012 2011 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 499.6 $ 523.6 $ 437.8 Net cash used in investing activities $ (77.1 ) $ (741.3 ) $ (147.8 ) Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities $ (259.8 ) $ 305.2 $ (226.5 ) 2013 compared to 2012 Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities The Company net cash provided by operating activities in 2013 decreased $24.0 to $499.6 as compared to 2012. The Company was able to defer its fourth quarter 2012 federal tax payment of $36.0 to the first quarter of 2013 as allowed by the IRS due to the impact of Hurricane Sandy, which accounted for the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in 2013. Partially offsetting the decrease was a reduction in working capital (higher accounts payable and accrued expenses, partially offset by higher accounts receivable). Net Cash Used in Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities during 2013 was $77.1, principally reflecting $67.1 of property, plant and equipment expenditures and a $6.4 investment in Natronx. Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities during 2013 was $259.8, primarily reflecting $100.0 of repayments of commercial paper, $50.1 of repurchases of Common Stock and $155.2 of cash dividends, partially offset by $35.1 of proceeds and tax benefits from stock option exercises and the receipt of an incentive payment of $10.9 related to the financing lease for the Company new corporate headquarters. 2012 compared to 2011 Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities The Company net cash provided by operating activities in 2012 increased $85.8 to $523.6 as compared to 2011. The increase was primarily due to an improvement in working capital. Working capital was favorably impacted due to the deferral of the Company fourth quarter 2012 federal tax payment of approximately $36.0 as allowed by the IRS due to the impact of Hurricane Sandy, contributions from the Avid Health acquisition and smaller increases in accounts receivable due to the timing of cash collections. Net Cash Used in Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities during 2012 was $741.3, reflecting the $652.3 acquisition of Avid Health, $74.5 of property, plant and equipment expenditures, relating in part to the Victorville Facility, and a $13.7 investment in Natronx. Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities during 2012 was $305.2, principally reflecting $399.6 of 2022 Notes (net of discount), and $250.0 of commercial paper issued in connection with the acquisition of Avid Health, $42.6 of proceeds and tax benefits from stock option exercises, partially offset by $250.4 of common stock repurchases, $134.5 of cash dividends and deferred financing costs of $3.4. 54 Table of Contents CHURCH & DWIGHT CO., INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES (Dollars in millions, except share and per share data) Certain Financial Covenants Consolidated EBITDA (referred to below as Adjusted EBITDA and defined in the Credit Agreement) is a component of the financial covenants contained in the Credit Agreement. Such financial covenants include a leverage ratio (total debt to Adjusted EBITDA) and an interest coverage ratio (Adjusted EBITDA to total interest expense), which, if not met, could result in an event of default and trigger the early termination of the Credit Agreement. Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The Company leverage ratio for the twelve months ended December 31, 2013 was 1.2, which is below the maximum of 3.25 permitted under the Credit Agreement, and the interest coverage ratio for the twelve months ended December 31, 2013 was 28.3, which is above the minimum of 3.0 required under the Credit Agreement. The reconciliation of Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities (the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure) to Adjusted EBITDA for 2013 is as follows: Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities $ 499.6 Interest paid 26.4 Current Income Tax Provision 192.3 Excess Tax Benefit on Stock Options Exercised 13.1 Change in Working Capital and Other Liabilities 16.1 Adjusted EBITDA (per Credit Agreement) $ 747.5 Commitments as of December 31, 2013 The table below summarizes the Company material contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2013.

AND SUBSIDIARIES (Dollars in millions, except share and per share data) (2) Letters of credit with several banks guarantee payment for items such as insurance claims in the event of the Company insolvency and one year of rent on a warehouse. Performance bonds are principally for required municipal property improvements. (3) Pension contributions are based on actuarial assessments of government regulated employer funding requirements. These requirements are not projected beyond one year since they fluctuate with the change in plan assets, assumptions and demographics. (4) The Company has outstanding purchase obligations with suppliers at the end of 2013 for raw, packaging and other materials and services in the normal course of business. These purchase obligation amounts represent only those items which are based on agreements that are enforceable and legally binding, and do not represent total anticipated purchases. (5) Other includes payments for stadium naming rights for a period of 20 years until December 2032. The Company has excluded from the table above uncertain tax liabilities due to the uncertainty of the amount per period of payment. As of December 31, 2013, the Company has gross uncertain tax liabilities, including interest, of $6.3. (See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report). Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company does not have off-balance sheet financing or unconsolidated special purpose entities. OTHER ITEMS Market risk Concentration of Risk A group of three customers accounted for approximately 35%, 34% and 33% of consolidated net sales in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, of which a single customer, Wal-Mart, accounted for approximately 24%, 24% and 23% in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Interest Rate Risk The Company had outstanding total debt at December 31, 2013 of $803.3, of which 81% has a fixed weighted average interest rate of 3.06% and the remaining 19% constituted principally commercial paper issued by the Company that currently has an interest rate of less than 0.4%. The Company periodically considers entering into derivative financial instruments contracts to reduce interest rate risk exposure. Diesel Fuel Hedges The Company uses independent freight carriers to deliver its products. These carriers charge the Company a basic rate per mile that is subject to a mileage surcharge for diesel fuel price increases. During 2012 and 2013, the Company entered into hedge agreements with financial counterparties to mitigate the volatility of diesel fuel prices and related fuel surcharges, and not to speculate in the future price of diesel fuel. Under the hedge agreements, the Company agreed to pay a fixed price per gallon of diesel fuel determined at the time the agreements were executed and to receive a floating rate payment reflecting the variable common carriers mileage surcharge. The floating rate payment is determined on a monthly basis based on the average price of the Department of Energy Diesel Fuel Index during the applicable month and is designed to offset any increase or decrease in fuel surcharges that the Company pays to it common carriers. The agreements covered approximately 45% of the Company 2013 diesel fuel requirements and are expected to cover approximately 34% of the Company estimated diesel fuel requirements for 2014. These diesel fuel hedge agreements qualify for hedge 56 Table of Contents CHURCH & DWIGHT CO., INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES (Dollars in millions, except share and per share data) accounting. Therefore, changes in the fair value of such agreements are recorded under Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income on the balance sheet. Foreign Currency The Company is subject to exposure from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily U.S. Dollar/Euro, U.S. Dollar/British Pound, U.S. Dollar/Canadian Dollar, U.S. Dollar/Mexican Peso, U.S. Dollar/Australian Dollar, U.S. Dollar/Brazilian Real and U.S. Dollar/Chinese Yuan. The Company, from time to time, enters into forward exchange contracts to reduce the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations related to anticipated but not yet committed intercompany sales or purchases denominated in the U.S. Dollar, Canadian Dollar, British Pound and Euro. The Company entered into forward exchange contracts to protect it from the risk that, due to changes in currency exchange rates, it would be adversely affected by net cash outflows. The face value of the unexpired contracts as of December 31, 2013 totaled $25.6. The contracts qualified as foreign currency cash flow hedges, and, therefore, changes in the fair value of the contracts were recorded in Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) and reclassified to earnings when the hedged transaction affected earnings. Equity Derivatives The Company has entered into equity derivative contracts covering its own stock in order to minimize its liability, resulting from changes in quoted fair values of Company stock, to participants in its Executive Deferred Compensation Plan who have investments under that plan in a notional Company stock fund. The contracts are typically settled in cash. Since the equity derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting, the Company is required to mark the agreements to market throughout the life of the agreements and record changes in fair value in the consolidated statement of income.
