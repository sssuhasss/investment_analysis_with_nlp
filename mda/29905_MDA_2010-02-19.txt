Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes which appear elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. The Company actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, particularly in Item 1A. Risk Factors and in SPECIAL NOTES REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS inside the front cover of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. (1) FINANCIAL CONDITION Liquidity and Capital Resources Management assesses the Company liquidity in terms of its ability to generate cash to fund its operating, investing and financing activities. Significant factors affecting liquidity are: cash flows generated from operating activities, capital expenditures, acquisitions, dispositions, dividends, repurchases of outstanding shares, adequacy of available commercial paper and bank lines of credit, and the ability to attract long-term capital with satisfactory terms. The Company generates substantial cash from operations and remains in a strong financial position, with sufficient liquidity available for reinvestment in existing businesses and strategic acquisitions while managing its capital structure on a short and long-term basis. Cash and equivalents of $714.4 million at December 31, 2009, increased by $167.0 million from the prior year balance of $547.4 million. Cash and equivalents were invested in highly liquid investment grade money market instruments with maturity of 90 days or less. Short-term investments consist of investment grade time deposits with original maturity dates between three months and one year. Short-term investments of $223.8 million as of December 31, 2009 decreased by $55.7 million from the prior year balance of $279.5 million. The Company total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investment balance of $938.2 million at December 31, 2009, includes $813.8 million held outside of the United States. The following table is derived from the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows: Years Ended December 31, Cash Flows from Continuing Operations 2009 2008 (In thousands) Net Cash Flows Provided By (Used In): Operating activities $ 802,060 $ 1,010,416 Investing activities (257,865 ) (452,994 ) Financing activities (389,953 ) (560,904 ) Cash flows provided by operating activities for 2009 decreased $208.4 million from the prior year primarily reflecting lower earnings on reduced sales from continuing operations and increased contributions to employee benefit plans partially offset by improvements in working capital. Cash used in investing activities during 2009 decreased $195.1 million compared to 2008, largely reflecting reduced capital expenditures and net purchases of short-term investments partially offset by higher acquisition costs and higher proceeds from the sale of a business in 2008. Cash acquisition spending was $222.0 million (excluding $6.4 million of consideration paid in the form of common stock) during 2009 compared to $103.8 million in the prior year. Capital expenditures during 2009 decreased 31.7% to $120.0 million compared to $175.8 million in the prior year due to discretionary management spend in response to the economic environment. The Company currently anticipates that any acquisitions made during 2010 will be funded from available cash and internally generated funds, and if necessary, through the issuance of commercial paper, use of established lines of credit or public debt markets. Capital expenditures during 2010 are expected to be approximately 2.3% to 2.5% of revenue. 20 Table of Contents Cash used in financing activities during 2009 decreased $171.0 million compared to the prior year primarily driven by the absence of share repurchases versus the prior year and reduced proceeds from the exercise of stock options, partially offset by debt repayments and higher dividend payments in 2009. Share Repurchases The Company had no share repurchases in 2009. In May 2007, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 10,000,000 shares through May 2012. Approximately 8.9 million shares remain authorized for repurchase under this five year authorization as of December 31, 2009. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2008, pursuant to a separate $500 million share repurchase program approved by the Board of Directors in the fourth quarter of 2007, the Company repurchased 10,000,000 shares of its common stock in the open market at an average price of $46.15 per share. As of December 31, 2008, the Company had completed the purchases of all shares authorized under this $500 million share repurchase program. Adjusted Working Capital Adjusted Working Capital (a non-GAAP measure calculated as accounts receivable, plus inventory, less accounts payable) decreased from the prior year by $183.3 million, or 14.4%, to $1,092.6 million which reflected a decrease in receivables of $134.4 million, a decrease in net inventory of $65.3 million and a decrease in accounts payable of $16.4 million, generally due to active working capital management in a lower revenue environment. Excluding acquisitions, dispositions, and the effects of foreign exchange translation of $21.1 million, Adjusted Working Capital would have decreased by $246.2 million, or 19.3%. Average Annual Adjusted Working Capital as a percentage of revenue (a non-GAAP measure calculated as the five-quarter average balance of accounts receivable, plus inventory, less accounts payable divided by the trailing twelve months of revenue) increased to 19.9% at December 31, 2009 from 18.3% at December 31, 2008, and inventory turns were 6.2 at December 31, 2009 compared to 7.1 at December 31, 2008. In addition to measuring its cash flow generation and usage based upon the operating, investing and financing classifications included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, the Company also measures free cash flow (a non-GAAP measure). Management believes that free cash flow is an important measure of operating performance because it provides management and investors a measurement of cash generated from operations that is available to repay debt, pay dividends, fund acquisitions and repurchase the Company common stock. For further information, see Non-GAAP Disclosures at the end of this Item 7. Free Cash Flow Free cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $682.1 million or 11.8% of revenue compared to $834.6 million or 11.0% of revenue in the prior year. The 2009 decrease in free cash flow reflects lower earnings from continuing operations and higher employee benefit contributions partially offset by improvements in working capital and a decrease in capital expenditures as compared to the prior year. The increase in free cash flow as a percentage of revenue is due to active management of adjusted working capital in a lower revenue environment. The following table is a reconciliation of free cash flow to cash flows from operating activities Years Ended December 31, Free Cash Flow 2009 2008 (In thousands) Cash flow provided by operating activities $ 802,060 $1,010,416 Less: Capital expenditures 120,009 175,795 Free cash flow $ 682,051 $834,621 Free cash flow as a percentage of revenue 11.8 % 11.0 % At December 31, 2009, the Company net property, plant, and equipment totaled $828.9 million compared to $872.1 million at the end of 2008. The decrease in net property, plant and equipment reflected depreciation of $159.6 million and disposals of $21.7 million, partially offset by capital expenditures of $120.0 million, acquisitions of $11.6 million and $12.3 million related to foreign currency fluctuations. 21 Table of Contents The aggregate of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities decreased from a $240.7 million net liability at the beginning of the year to a net liability of $222.3 million at year-end 2009. This resulted primarily from a decrease in deferred tax liabilities related to intangible assets and accounts receivable, partially offset by an increase in deferred tax assets related to net operating loss and other carryforwards. The Company consolidated benefit obligation related to defined and supplemental retirement benefits increased by $31.0 million in 2009. The increase was due primarily to interest costs of $37.6 million, benefits earned of $20.2 million, currency changes of $10.3 million, business acquisitions of $7.2 million, a net actuarial loss of $7.1 million, and other changes, partially offset by benefits paid of $54.5 million. In 2009, plan assets increased $56.9 million primarily due to Company contributions of $77.5 million, investment returns of $24.0 million, currency and other changes amounting to $7.2 million, partially offset by $54.5 million in benefits paid during the year. It is anticipated that the Company defined and supplemental retirement benefits expense will decrease from $36.5 million in 2009 to approximately $32.4 million in 2010. The Company utilizes the net debt to total capitalization calculation (a non-GAAP measure) to assess its overall financial leverage and capacity and believes the calculation is useful to investors for the same reason. The following table provides a reconciliation of net debt to total capitalization to the most directly comparable GAAP measures: At December 31, At December 31, Net Debt to Total Capitalization Ratio 2009 2008 (In thousands) Current maturities of long-term debt $ 35,624 $ 32,194 Commercial paper and other short-term debt 192,750 Long-term debt 1,825,260 1,860,729 Total debt 1,860,884 2,085,673 Less: Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments 938,174 826,869 Net debt 922,710 1,258,804 Add: Stockholders equity 4,083,608 3,792,866 Total capitalization $ 5,006,318 $ 5,051,670 Net debt to total capitalization 18.4 % 24.9 % The total debt level of $1,860.9 million at December 31, 2009 decreased $224.8 million from December 31, 2008 due to repayment of commercial paper borrowings of $192.8 million and a decrease in long-term debt of $32.0 million. Net debt at December 31, 2009 decreased $336.1 million as a result of the decrease in total debt, a decrease in adjusted working capital and the absence of share repurchases in 2009. The Company long-term debt instruments had a book value of $1,860.9 million on December 31, 2009 and a fair value of approximately $1,954.6 million. On December 31, 2008, the Company long-term debt instruments had a book value of $1,892.9 million and a fair value of approximately $2,018.5 million. The Company believes that existing sources of liquidity are adequate to meet anticipated funding needs at comparable risk-based interest rates for the foreseeable future. Acquisition spending and/or share repurchases could potentially increase the Company debt. However, management anticipates that the net debt to total capitalization ratio will remain generally consistent with historical levels. Operating cash flow and access to capital markets are expected to satisfy the Company various cash flow requirements, including acquisitions and capital expenditures. Management is not aware of any potential deterioration to the Company liquidity. Under the Company $1 billion 5-year unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks, which expires in November 2012, the Company is required to maintain an interest coverage ratio of EBITDA to consolidated net interest expense of not less than 3.5 to 1. The Company was in compliance with this covenant and its other long-term debt covenants at December 31, 2009 and had a coverage ratio of 9.1 to 1. It is anticipated that in 2010 any funding requirements above cash generated from operations will be met through the issuance of commercial paper. Given the current economic conditions, the Company fully expects to remain in compliance with all of its debt covenants. The Company periodically enters into financial transactions specifically to hedge its exposures to various items, including, but not limited to, interest rate and foreign exchange rate risk. Through various programs, the 22 Table of Contents Company hedges its cash flow exposures to foreign exchange rate risk by entering into foreign exchange forward contracts and collars. The Company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes and does not have a material portfolio of derivative financial instruments. The Company long-term debt with a book value of $1,860.9 million includes $35.6 million which matures in less than one year and had a fair value of approximately $1,954.6 million at December 31, 2009. The estimated fair value of the long-term debt is based on quoted market prices, and present value techniques used to value similar instruments. During the second quarter ended June 30, 2008, the Company repaid its $150 million 6.25% Notes due June 1, 2008. In addition, on March 14, 2008, the Company issued $350 million of 5.45% Notes due 2018 and $250 million of 6.60% Notes due 2038. The net proceeds of $594.1 million from the notes were used to repay borrowings under the Company commercial paper program, and were reflected in long-term debt in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2008. The notes and debentures are redeemable at the option of the Company in whole or in part at any time at a redemption price that includes a make-whole premium, with accrued interest to the redemption date. During the first quarter of 2008, Dover entered into several interest rate swaps in anticipation of the debt financing completed on March 14, 2008 which, upon settlement, resulted in a net gain of $1.2 million which was deferred and is being amortized over the lives of the related notes. There is an outstanding swap agreement for a total notional amount of $50.0 million, or CHF65.1 million, which swaps the U.S. 6-month LIBOR rate and the Swiss Franc 6-month LIBOR rate. This agreement hedges a portion of the Company net investment in non-U.S. operations and the fair value outstanding at December 31, 2009 includes a loss of $13.3 million which was based on quoted market prices for similar instruments (uses Level 2 inputs under the ASC 820 hierarchy). This hedge is effective. During the third quarter of 2008, the Company entered into a foreign currency hedge which was subsequently settled within the quarter in anticipation of a potential acquisition, which did not occur. As a result of terminating the hedge, the Company recorded a gain of $2.4 million in the third quarter ended September 30, 2008. At December 31, 2008, the Company had open foreign exchange forward purchase contracts expiring through December 2009 related to cash flow and fair value hedges of foreign currency exposures. The fair values of these contracts were based on quoted market prices for identical instruments as of December 31, 2008 (uses Level 1 inputs ASC 820 hierarchy). The details of the open contracts as of December 31, 2009 are as follows: US Dollars Sold Expiration From 12/31/09 Less Than 1 Average Forward Currencies Purchased Month 2-3 Months 4-6 Months 7-12 Months Contract Rate (In thousands) Japanese Yen $ 1,796 $ 299 $ $ 91.495 Japanese Yen $ $ 3,012 $ $ 91.030 Euros $ $ 680 $ $ 0.670 Collar Put Call US Dollar Value US Dollar to Euro 1.420 1.470 $ 4,000 Maturities from 3/29/10 12/31/10 Chinese Yuan Value Chinese Yuan to US Dollar 6.500 6.808 247,000 Maturities from 1/25/10 12/29/10 23 Table of Contents The Company credit ratings, which are independently developed by the respective rating agencies, are as follows for the years ended December 31: 2009 2008 Short term Long term Short term Long term Moody P-1 A2 P-1 A2 Standard & Poor A-1 A A-1 A Fitch F1 A F1 A A summary of the Company undiscounted long-term debt, commitments and obligations as of December 31, 2009 and the years when these obligations are expected to be due is as follows: Payments Due by Period Less than 1 More than Total Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years 5 Years Other(A) (In thousands) Long-term debt $ 1,860,884 $ 35,624 $ 436,191 $ 190 $ 1,388,879 $ Interest expense 1,399,359 105,625 162,500 159,250 971,984 Rental commitments 240,127 49,943 75,722 44,116 70,346 Purchase obligations 29,006 27,399 1,165 442 Capital leases 5,461 1,140 2,022 1,311 988 Supplemental & post-retirement benefits 140,196 15,657 29,920 17,921 76,698 Uncertain tax positions (A) 245,563 15,363 230,200 Other long-term obligations 386 386 Total obligations $ 3,920,982 $ 251,137 $ 707,520 $ 223,230 $ 2,508,895 $ 230,200 (A) Due to the uncertainty of the potential settlement of future uncertain tax positions, management is unable to estimate the timing of the related payments, if any, that will be made subsequent to 2010. These amounts do not include the potential indirect benefits resulting from deductions or credits for payments made to other jurisdictions. (2) RESULTS OF OPERATIONS: 2009 COMPARED TO 2008 Consolidated Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 $ Change % Change (In thousands) Revenue $ 5,775,689 $ 7,568,888 $ (1,793,199 ) (24 )% Cost of goods and services 3,676,535 4,838,881 (1,162,346 ) (24 )% Gross profit 2,099,154 2,730,007 (630,853 ) (23 )% Selling and administrative expenses 1,511,111 1,700,677 (189,566 ) (11 )% Operating earnings 588,043 1,029,330 (441,287 ) (43 )% Interest expense, net 100,375 96,037 4,338 5 % Other expense (income), net (3,950 ) (12,726 ) 8,776 (69 )% Total interest/other expense, net 96,425 83,311 13,114 16 % Earnings before provision for income taxes and discontinued operations 491,618 946,019 (454,401 ) (48 )% Provision for income taxes 119,724 251,261 (131,537 ) (52 )% Earnings from continuing operations $ 371,894 $ 694,758 $ (322,864 ) (46 )% 24 Table of Contents Revenue Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2009 decreased 24% compared to 2008, due to decreases experienced across all four segments primarily driven by a $837.7 million or 34% decrease at Industrial Products and a $443.1 million or 26% decrease at Fluid Management as a result of lower demand and sales volume stemming from general unfavorable economic conditions. Revenue decreased at Engineered Systems by $148.4 million or 7% due to lower sales volume in core businesses which was offset by the incremental revenue from the 2009 acquisitions. Overall, the Company organic revenue growth decreased 23.9% with an unfavorable decrease in foreign exchange of 1.7% partially offset by a favorable impact of 1.9% in net growth from acquisitions. Gross profit decreased 23% to $2,099.1 million from 2008 while the gross profit margin remained essentially flat at 36.3% and 36.1%, in 2009 and 2008, respectively. Selling and Administrative Expenses Selling and administrative expenses of $1,511.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 decreased $189.6 million over the comparable 2008 period, primarily due to decreased revenue activity, cost curtailment efforts and integration programs partially offset by restructuring charges. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue increased to 26% from 22% in the prior year reflecting reduced revenue levels and restructuring charges of $50.2 million. Interest Expense, net Interest expense, net, increased 5% to $100.4 million for 2009, compared to $96.0 million for 2008 primarily due to lower average outstanding commercial paper balances during the period more than offset by cash and investments that were reinvested at lower interest rates during the later part of the year. Interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 was $116.2 million and $130.2 million, respectively. Interest income for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 was $15.8 million and $34.2 million, respectively. Other Expense (Income), net Other expense (income), net for 2009 and 2008 of ($4.0) million and ($12.7) million, respectively, was driven primarily related to the effect of foreign exchange fluctuations on assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other the Company functional currency. Income Taxes The effective tax rates for continuing operations for 2009 was 24.4% compared to the prior year rate of 26.6%. The effective tax rate for 2009 was improved by $31.6 million of net benefits recognized for tax positions that were effectively settled primarily in the second and fourth quarters of 2009. The effective tax rate for 2008 was favorably impacted by $26.3 million of net benefits recognized for tax positions that were primarily settled in the third and fourth quarters of 2008. The full year 2009 rate reflects the favorable impact of benefits recognized for tax positions that were effectively settled and the favorable impact of a higher percentage of non-U.S. earnings in low tax rate jurisdictions. Net Earnings Net earnings for the twelve months ended December 31, 2009 were $356.4 million or $1.91 dilutive earnings per share ( EPS ) including a loss from discontinued operations of $15.5 million or $0.08 EPS, compared to net earnings of $590.8 million or $3.12 dilutive EPS for the same period of 2008, including a loss from discontinued operations of $103.9 million or $0.55 EPS. The losses from discontinued operations in 2009 include approximately $10.3 million, net of tax, related to a write-down of a business held for sale. The losses from discontinued operations in 2008 largely reflect a loss provision for a business held for sale, as well as tax expenses and tax accruals related to ongoing Federal tax settlements and state tax assessments. Refer to Note 3 in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on discontinued operations. In addition to these factors, earnings across all platforms were also negatively impacted by restructuring charges as noted below, partially offset by benefits captured from business restructuring and integration programs completed to date. 25 Table of Contents Severance and Exit Reserves The Company synergy capture programs and the restructuring initiatives launched during 2008, were continued throughout 2009. The Company was able to respond to the economic downturn through strategic restructuring efforts undertaken by management which yielded savings of approximately $125 million in 2009. The 2010 benefits from these restructuring efforts are expected to range from $30 million to $40 million. During 2009, the Company had a net reduction in its workforce of approximately 2,950, or 9%, and a net reduction of 23 manufacturing and warehouse facilities. The Company does not anticipate a significant reduction to its workforce in 2010 and will continue to monitor business activity across its markets served and adjust capacity as necessary pending the economic climate. From time to time, the Company has initiated various restructuring programs at its operating companies as noted above and has recorded severance and other restructuring costs in connection with purchase accounting for acquisitions prior to January 1, 2009. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Company had reserves related to severance and other restructuring activities of $16.8 million and $31.0 million, respectively. During 2009, the Company recorded $72.1 million in additional charges and made $66.8 million in payments and $19.5 million of non-cash write-downs related to reserve balances. For 2009, approximately $21.9 million and $50.2 million of restructuring charges were recorded in cost of goods and services and selling and administrative expenses, respectively, in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. During 2008, the Company recorded $27.4 million in additional charges and $5.6 million in purchase accounting reserves related to acquisitions, partially offset by other non-cash write-downs of $2.3 million and payments of $28.1 million. Current Economic Environment With few exceptions, the Company experienced lower demand across all of its end markets resulting in lower bookings and backlog in the fourth quarter of 2008 through the first half of 2009, with modest improvements in certain segments in the second half of 2009. Although this downturn had a significant adverse impact on revenue and earnings for the year, the Company maintained double-digit margin levels and generated free cash flow in excess of 10% as a percentage of revenue. The structural changes made over the last few years, becoming less dependent on capital goods markets and having greater recurring revenue, together with improved working capital management and strong pricing discipline partially offset the impact of the economic downturn during 2009. As discussed above in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section, the Company believes that existing sources of liquidity are adequate to meet anticipated funding needs at comparable risk-based interest rates. 2010 Outlook The Company estimates full year organic growth to be in the range of 4% to 6% (inclusive of a foreign currency impact of 1%) and acquisition related growth to be around 3% for transactions completed in 2009. Based on these revenue assumptions and profitability expectations, the Company has projected that its diluted earnings per share from continuing operations will be in the range of $2.35 to $2.65 and expects its earnings to follow a traditional seasonal pattern of being higher in the second and third quarters. The Company also remains focused on key initiatives including the corporate development program, post merger integration process and supply chain initiative among others. 26 Table of Contents Segment Results of Operations Industrial Products Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2009 2008 % Change (In thousands) Revenue Material Handling $ 660,353 $ 1,136,869 (42 )% Mobile Equipment 962,177 1,323,422 (27 )% Eliminations (738 ) (786 ) $ 1,621,792 $ 2,459,505 (34 )% Segment earnings $ 139,757 $ 299,740 (53 )% Operating margin 8.6 % 12.2 % Acquisition related depreciation and amortization expense* $ 32,048 $ 32,283 (1 )% Bookings Material Handling $ 587,676 $ 1,109,028 (47 )% Mobile Equipment 901,164 1,177,880 (23 )% Eliminations (986 ) (1,134 ) $ 1,487,854 $ 2,285,774 (35 )% Backlog Material Handling $ 116,658 $ 188,591 (38 )% Mobile Equipment 329,774 387,329 (15 )% Eliminations (371 ) (220 ) $ 446,061 $ 575,700 (23 )% * Represents the pre-tax impact on earnings from the depreciation and amortization of acquisition accounting write-ups to reflect the fair value of inventory, property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets. Industrial Products revenue and earnings decreased by 34% and 53%, respectively, as compared to the prior year primarily due to general economic conditions as well as the continued downturn in infrastructure, energy, and transportation markets. The segment decline in revenue primarily reflected a core business decrease of 33% and an unfavorable impact of 1.0% due to foreign exchange. Earnings and margin were impacted by decreased revenue and $17.5 million in restructuring charges. The segment has experienced modest improvement in commercial activity across markets served during the fourth quarter of 2009. Material Handling revenue and earnings decreased 42% and 73%, respectively, when compared to the prior year. The platform experienced significant challenges in its core infrastructure, automotive, construction equipment and energy markets which were partially offset by an increase in military demand. The decrease in revenue coupled with restructuring charges of $11.0 million negatively impacted earnings. Although bookings are down 47% as compared to 2008, the platforms served end markets have stabilized in the fourth quarter. Mobile Equipment revenue and earnings decreased 27% and 29%, respectively, over the prior year. The strength of the military market during the year was offset by challenges in the energy, bulk transport and vehicle service markets. Earnings at the platform were primarily impacted by lower revenue and restructuring charges of $6.5 million. 27 Table of Contents Engineered Systems Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2009 2008 % Change (In thousands) Revenue Engineered Products $ 1,059,660 $ 1,085,881 (2 )% Product Identification 802,276 924,469 (13 )% $ 1,861,936 $ 2,010,350 (7 )% Segment earnings $ 227,268 $ 278,553 (18 )% Operating margin 12.2 % 13.9 % Acquisition related depreciation and amortization expense* $ 26,666 $ 24,394 9 % Bookings Engineered Products $ 1,018,067 $ 1,043,873 (2 )% Product Identification 817,359 920,712 (11 )% $ 1,835,426 $ 1,964,585 (7 )% Backlog Engineered Products $ 218,520 $ 183,821 19 % Product Identification 74,700 61,195 22 % $ 293,220 $ 245,016 20 % * Represents the pre-tax impact on earnings from the depreciation and amortization of acquisition accounting write-ups to reflect the fair value of inventory, property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets. Engineered Systems revenue and earnings decreased by 7% and 18%, respectively, as compared to the prior year. The decline in revenue was primarily driven by an 11% decline in core business revenue (excluding acquisitions) as a result of general softness in the markets served by the segment and an unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of 3%. The acquisitions of Tyler, Ala Cart, Inc. and Barker Company in the Engineered Products platform and Extech Instruments in the Product Identification platform accounted for 7% revenue growth. The earnings decline was substantially driven by the softness in most end markets served, $18.4 million of restructuring charges and $6.2 million of acquisition related expenses. Engineered Products revenue and earnings decreased by 2% and 10%, respectively, as compared to the prior year. Lower sales volume throughout our core businesses (most notably refrigeration equipment) were partially offset by acquisition revenue. The earnings decline resulted from lower sales volume in commercial cooling, HVAC and packaging equipment, restructuring charges of $6.9 million and $6.2 million of acquisition related expenses. Product Identification platform revenue and earnings declined 13% and 18%, respectively, as compared to the prior year. Core revenue decreased 10% due to lower sales volume in the Direct Marketing and Bar Coding business with the balance of the revenue decline due to foreign exchange. The platform incurred $11.5 million in restructuring charges during the year. 28 Table of Contents Fluid Management Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2009 2008 % Change (In thousands) Revenue Energy $ 624,211 $ 935,414 (33 )% Fluid Solutions 646,849 778,812 (17 )% Eliminations (150 ) (180 ) $ 1,270,910 $ 1,714,046 (26 )% Segment earnings $ 259,269 $ 385,317 (33 )% Operating margin 20.4 % 22.5 % Acquisition related depreciation and amortization expense* $ 18,389 $ 19,550 (6 )% Bookings Energy $ 610,045 $ 964,517 (37 )% Fluid Solutions 645,098 771,359 (16 )% Eliminations (140 ) (178 ) Backlog $ 1,255,003 $ 1,735,698 (28 )% Energy $ 77,173 $ 95,532 (19 )% Fluid Solutions 60,540 64,471 (6 )% Eliminations (2 ) (12 ) $ 137,711 $ 159,991 (14 )% * Represents the pre-tax impact on earnings from the depreciation and amortization of acquisition accounting write-ups to reflect the fair value of inventory, property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets. Fluid Management revenue and earnings decreased by 26% and 33%, respectively, as compared to the prior year. The decline in revenue was primarily driven by a 25% decline in core business revenue and an unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of 2%. The decline in revenue was partially offset by the full year effect of 2008 acquisitions and a 2009 acquisition (1%). The earnings decline was driven by reduced revenue, $9.7 million in restructuring charges and acquisition related expenses of $2.5 million. The Energy platform revenue and earnings decreased 33% and 38%, respectively, as compared to the prior year. The decline in revenue is a result of lower demand in the oil, gas and power generation industries, partially offset by the impact of 2008 and 2009 acquisitions. The platform has experienced a recent increase in revenue growth stemming from increases in active North American drilling rigs. The decrease in earnings is a result of lower sales volume, restructuring charges of $3.0 million and acquisition related expenses of $2.5 million, partially offset by operational improvements and cost savings as a result of restructuring activities. Waukesha Bearings acquired Inpro/Seal Company on December 30, 2009 which accounted for the majority of the acquisition costs. The Fluid Solutions platform revenue and earnings decreased 17% and 20%, respectively, as compared to the prior year due to lower demand in the their various industrial markets. Decreased earnings reflect lower sales volume and $6.7 million of restructuring charges. 29 Table of Contents Electronic Technologies 2009 2008 % Change (In thousands) Revenue $ 1,026,954 $ 1,396,131 (26 )% Segment earnings $ 83,694 $ 193,641 (57 )% Operating margin 8.1 % 13.9 % Acquisition related depreciation and amortization expense* $ 33,203 $ 36,481 (9 )% Bookings 1,055,282 1,342,382 (21 )% Backlog 206,893 175,317 18 % * Represents the pre-tax impact on earnings from the depreciation and amortization of acquisition accounting write-ups to reflect the fair value of inventory, property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets.

The decline in core revenue was 24% and there was a 2% unfavorable impact on revenue from foreign exchange. Micro Electronic Mechanical Systems ( MEMS ) products continue to show increased customer adoption, while military and space programs continue to provide a constructive business climate for our electronic component companies. Earnings for the twelve months ended December 31, 2009 were negatively impacted by lower sales volume and $26.6 million of restructuring charges. In addition, the comparability of 2009 earnings is impacted by the favorable impact of 2008 earnings, which included a $7.5 million gain on the sale of a business (semi-conductor test handling). 2008 COMPARED TO 2007 Consolidated Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 $ Change % Change (In thousands) Revenue $ 7,568,888 $ 7,317,270 $ 251,618 3 % Cost of goods and services 4,838,881 4,697,768 141,113 3 % Gross profit 2,730,007 2,619,502 110,505 4 % Selling and administrative expenses 1,700,677 1,614,005 86,672 5 % Operating earnings 1,029,330 1,005,497 23,833 2 % Interest expense, net 96,037 89,589 6,448 7 % Other expense (income), net (12,726 ) 3,541 (16,267 ) (459 )% Total interest/other expense, net 83,311 93,130 (9,819 ) (11 )% Earnings before provision for income taxes and discontinued operations 946,019 912,367 33,652 4 % Provision for income taxes 251,261 242,617 8,644 4 % Earnings from continuing operations $ 694,758 $ 669,750 $ 25,008 4 % Revenue Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2008 increased 3% over 2007, due to increases of $232.0 million at Fluid Management, $52.2 million at Industrial Products and $6.0 million at Electronic Technologies. These revenue increases were due to positive market fundamentals and acquisitions at Fluid Management, while Engineered Systems revenue decreased $41.7 million due to weakness in markets served by the Engineered Products platform. Overall, Dover organic revenue growth was 1%, net acquisition growth was 1% and the impact from foreign exchange was 1%. Gross profit increased 4% to $2,730.0 million from 2007 while the gross profit margin remained essentially flat at 36.1% and 35.8%, in 2008 and 2007, respectively. 30 Table of Contents Selling and Administrative Expenses Selling and administrative expenses of $1,700.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 increased $86.7 million over the comparable 2007 period, primarily due to increased revenue activity, increased professional fees and restructuring charges. Interest Expense, net Interest expense, net, increased 7% to $96.0 million for 2008, compared to $89.6 million for 2007. The increase was due to higher average outstanding borrowings used to fund purchases of the Company common stock and higher average commercial paper rates. Other Expense (Income), net Other expense (income), net for 2008 and 2007 of ($12.7) million and $3.5 million, respectively, was driven primarily by foreign exchange gains and losses, partially offset by other miscellaneous income. Income Taxes The 2008 and 2007 tax rate for continuing operations was 26.6% in both periods, each favorably impacted by the mix of non-U.S. earnings in low-taxed overseas jurisdictions. Net Earnings Net earnings for the twelve months ended December 31, 2008 were $590.8 million or $3.12 EPS, which included a loss from discontinued operations of $103.9 million or $0.55 EPS, compared to net earnings of $661.1 million or $3.26 EPS for the same period of 2007, including a loss from discontinued operations of $8.7 million or $0.04 EPS. The losses from discontinued operations in 2008 largely reflect a loss provision for a business expected to be sold in 2009, as well as tax expenses and tax accruals related to ongoing Federal tax settlements and state tax assessments. Refer to Note 3 in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on discontinued operations. 31 Table of Contents Segment Results of Operations Industrial Products Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2008 2007 % Change (In thousands) Revenue Material Handling $ 1,136,869 $ 1,145,253 (1 )% Mobile Equipment 1,323,422 1,262,984 5 % Eliminations (786 ) (977 ) $ 2,459,505 $ 2,407,260 2 % Segment earnings $ 299,740 $ 312,486 (4 )% Operating margin 12.2 % 13.0 % Acquisition related depreciation and amortization expense* $ 32,283 $ 27,830 16 % Bookings Material Handling $ 1,109,028 $ 1,141,955 (3 )% Mobile Equipment 1,177,880 1,364,340 (14 )% Eliminations (1,134 ) (1,556 ) $ 2,285,774 $ 2,504,739 (9 )% Backlog Material Handling $ 188,591 $ 213,653 (12 )% Mobile Equipment 387,329 543,776 (29 )% Eliminations (220 ) (195 ) $ 575,700 $ 757,234 (24 )% * Represents the pre-tax impact on earnings from the depreciation and amortization of acquisition accounting write-ups to reflect the fair value of inventory, property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets. Industrial Products increase in revenue over the prior year was primarily due to strength in the military and solid waste management markets as well as the impact of the December 2007 acquisition of Industrial Motion Control LLC ( IMC ), and the March 2008 acquisition of Lantec Winch and Gear Inc. Overall, the segment had 2% revenue growth from its core businesses and acquisition growth of 3%, which was partially offset by the sale of a line of business. Earnings declined 4% when compared to the prior year substantially due to weakness in the construction and the North American auto service markets, and restructuring costs. Material Handling revenue decreased 1% while earnings decreased 5% when compared to the prior year. Revenue and earnings growth in the industrial winch business was more than offset by softness in the infrastructure, industrial automation and automotive markets. In addition, the platform incurred additional expenses related to its ongoing cost reduction and integration activities. Mobile Equipment revenue and earnings increased 5% and 2%, respectively, over the prior year. The revenue increase was primarily due to core business growth as the platform continued to experience strength in the aerospace, military and solid waste management markets. Softness in the automotive service and bulk transport end markets partially offset the increases experienced in other markets. 32 Table of Contents Engineered Systems Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2008 2007 % Change (In thousands) Revenue Engineered Products $ 1,085,881 $ 1,139,478 (5 )% Product Identification 924,469 912,580 1 % $ 2,010,350 $ 2,052,058 (2 )% Segment earnings $ 278,553 $ 291,727 (5 )% Operating margin 13.9 % 14.2 % Acquisition related depreciation and amortization expense* $ 24,394 $ 29,262 (17 )% Bookings Engineered Products $ 1,043,873 $ 1,116,638 (7 )% Product Identification 920,712 919,216 0 % $ 1,964,585 $ 2,035,854 (4 )% Backlog Engineered Products $ 183,821 $ 227,523 (19 )% Product Identification 61,195 68,938 (11 )% $ 245,016 $ 296,461 (17 )% * Represents the pre-tax impact on earnings from the depreciation and amortization of acquisition accounting write-ups to reflect the fair value of inventory, property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets. Engineered Systems decreases in revenue and earnings over the prior year of 2% and 5%, respectively, were primarily driven by the Engineered Products platform. Overall, the segment had a 4% decline in revenue from its core businesses which was partially offset by the favorable impact of currency rates of 2%. Engineered Products revenue and earnings decreased 5% and 15%, respectively, over the prior year due to weaker sales of retail food equipment and softness in the beverage can equipment business. In addition to the reduction in overall sales volume during the year, the platform earnings were negatively impacted by currency exchange rates, restructuring and a $6.6 million one-time charge primarily related to inventory. Partially offsetting these declines were the results of the heat exchanger and foodservice businesses which experienced continued strength throughout 2008. Product Identification platform revenue and earnings both increased 1% over 2007. The revenue growth was primarily due to the favorable impact of foreign exchange as the core businesses in the platform experienced lower volume. Despite the decline in core business revenue, the platform was able to maintain margins consistent with the prior year due to on-going integration activities across the platform. 33 Table of Contents Fluid Management Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2008 2007 % Change (In thousands) Revenue Energy $ 935,414 $ 775,024 21 % Fluid Solutions 778,812 707,113 10 % Eliminations (180 ) (129 ) $ 1,714,046 $ 1,482,008 16 % Segment earnings $ 385,317 $ 304,576 27 % Operating margin 22.5 % 20.6 % Acquisition related depreciation and amortization expense* $ 19,550 $ 15,569 26 % Bookings Energy $ 964,517 $ 785,065 23 % Fluid Solutions 771,359 716,644 8 % Eliminations (178 ) (110 ) $ 1,735,698 $ 1,501,599 16 % Backlog Energy $ 95,532 $ 88,245 8 % Fluid Solutions 64,471 73,713 (13 )% Eliminations (12 ) (14 ) $ 159,991 $ 161,944 (1 )% * Represents the pre-tax impact on earnings from the depreciation and amortization of acquisition accounting write-ups to reflect the fair value of inventory, property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets. Fluid Management revenue and earnings increased 16% and 27%, respectively, over 2007 due to strength in the oil, gas, and power generation sectors served by the Energy platform as well as the diverse markets served by the Fluid Solutions platform. Overall, the segment had organic revenue growth of 12%, acquisition growth of 3%, with the remainder due to the favorable impact of foreign exchange. The Energy platform revenue increased 21% while its earnings improved 32%, when compared to 2007, due to strength in the oil and gas markets and increasing power generation demand. Earnings and margin benefited from the higher volume and operational improvements. The Fluid Solutions platform revenue increased 10% and earnings improved 20% due to acquisitions and strength in the markets served by its core businesses. In general, demand remained strong for pumps, dispensing systems, and connectors. Earnings and margins improved due to a favorable business mix and cost savings from the platform ongoing cost reduction activities. 34 Table of Contents Electronic Technologies Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2008 2007 % Change (In thousands) Revenue $ 1,396,131 $ 1,390,103 0 % Segment earnings $ 193,641 $ 180,337 7 % Operating margin 13.9 % 13.0 % Acquisition related depreciation and amortization expense* $ 36,481 $ 38,296 (5 )% Bookings 1,342,382 1,378,551 (3 )% Backlog 175,317 232,704 (25 )% * Represents the pre-tax impact on earnings from the depreciation and amortization of acquisition accounting write-ups to reflect the fair value of inventory, property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets. Electronic Technologies revenue was flat while earnings increased 7% when compared to the prior year. Revenue increases in the micro-acoustic component business were offset by a softening in the other markets served by the segment resulting in a 3% decline in core business revenue, excluding favorable foreign exchange rates. The segment earnings benefited from the increased volume in the micro-acoustic component business, a $7.5 million gain from the sale of a line of business (semi-conductor test handling), and cost savings from restructuring activities that were implemented in the first quarter of 2008. Critical Accounting Policies The Company consolidated financial statements and related public financial information are based on the application of generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ( GAAP ). GAAP requires the use of estimates, assumptions, judgments and subjective interpretations of accounting principles that have an impact on the assets, liabilities, revenue and expense amounts reported. These estimates can also affect supplemental information contained in the public disclosures of the Company, including information regarding contingencies, risk and its financial condition. The Company believes its use of estimates and underlying accounting assumptions conform to GAAP and are consistently applied. Valuations based on estimates are reviewed for reasonableness on a consistent basis throughout the Company. The Company believes that its significant accounting policies are primary areas where the financial information of the Company is subject to the use of estimates, assumptions and the application of judgement which include the following areas: Revenue is recognized when all of the following circumstances are satisfied: a) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, b) price is fixed or determinable, c) collectibility is reasonably assured, and d) delivery has occurred. In revenue transactions where installation is required, revenue can be recognized when the installation obligation is not essential to the functionality of the delivered products. Revenue transactions involving non-essential installation obligations are those which can generally be completed in a short period of time at insignificant cost and the skills required to complete these installations are not unique to the Company and in many cases can be provided by third parties or the customers. If the installation obligation is essential to the functionality of the delivered product, then revenue recognition is deferred until installation is complete. In addition, when it is determined that there are multiple deliverables to a sales arrangement, the Company will allocate consideration received to the separate deliverables based on their relative fair values and recognize revenue based on the appropriate criteria for each deliverable identified. In a limited number of revenue transactions, other post shipment obligations such as training and customer acceptance are required and, accordingly, revenue recognition is deferred until the customer is obligated to pay, or acceptance has been confirmed. Service revenue is recognized and earned when services are performed. Revenues associated with construction type contracts are recorded using the percentage-of-completion method. The Company recognizes contract revenue under percentage of completion accounting using the cost to cost method measure of progress. The application of percentage of completion accounting requires estimates of future revenues and contract costs over the full term of the contract. The Company updates project cost estimates on a quarterly basis or more frequently when changes in circumstances warrant. 35 Table of Contents Inventory for the majority of the Company subsidiaries, including all international subsidiaries, are stated at the lower of cost, determined on the first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis, or market. Other domestic inventory is stated at cost, determined on the last-in, first-out (LIFO) basis, which is less than market value. Under certain market conditions, estimates and judgments regarding the valuation of inventory are employed by the Company to properly value inventory. The Electronic Technologies companies tend to experience somewhat higher levels of inventory value fluctuations, particularly given the relatively high rate of product obsolescence over relatively short periods of time. Occasionally, the Company will establish restructuring reserves at an operation, in accordance with appropriate accounting principles. These reserves, for both severance and exit costs, require the use of estimates. Though the Company believes that these estimates accurately reflect the anticipated costs, actual results may be different than the estimated amounts. The Company has significant tangible and intangible assets on its balance sheet that include goodwill and other intangibles related to acquisitions. The valuation and classification of these assets and the assignment of useful depreciation and amortization lives involve significant judgments and the use of estimates. The testing of these intangibles under established accounting guidelines for impairment also requires significant use of judgment and assumptions, particularly as it relates to the identification of reporting units and the determination of fair market value. The Company assets and reporting units are tested and reviewed for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter or when indicators of impairment exist, such as a significant sustained change in the business climate, during the interim periods. The Company believes that its use of estimates and assumptions are reasonable and comply with generally accepted accounting principles. Changes in business conditions could potentially require adjustments to the valuations. The valuation of the Company pension and other post-retirement plans requires the use of assumptions and estimates that are used to develop actuarial valuations of expenses and assets/liabilities. Inherent in these valuations are key assumptions, including discount rates, investment returns, projected salary increases and benefits, and mortality rates. The actuarial assumptions used in the Company pension reporting are reviewed annually and are compared with external benchmarks to ensure that they accurately account for the Company future pension obligations. Changes in assumptions and future investment returns could potentially have a material impact on the Company pension expenses and related funding requirements. The Company expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is reviewed annually based on actual returns, economic trends and portfolio allocation. The Company discount rate assumption is determined by developing a yield curve based on high quality corporate bonds with maturities matching the plans expected benefit payment streams. The plans expected cash flows are then discounted by the resulting year-by-year spot rates. The Company has significant amounts of deferred tax assets that are reviewed for recoverability and valued accordingly. These assets are evaluated by using estimates of future taxable income streams and the impact of tax planning strategies. Reserves are also estimated, using a more likely than not criteria, for ongoing audits regarding federal, state and international issues that are currently unresolved. The Company routinely monitors the potential impact of these situations and believes that it is properly reserved. Valuations related to tax accruals and assets can be impacted by changes in accounting regulations, changes in tax codes and rulings, changes in statutory tax rates, and the Company future taxable income levels. The provisions for uncertain tax positions provides a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and disclosure requirements regarding uncertainties in income tax positions. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The Company records interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of provision for income taxes. The Company has significant accruals and reserves related to the self-insured portion of its risk management program. These accruals require the use of estimates and judgment with regard to risk exposure and ultimate liability. The Company estimates losses under these programs using actuarial assumptions, the Company experience and relevant industry data. The Company reviews these factors quarterly and considers the 36 Table of Contents current level of accruals and reserves adequate relative to current market conditions and Company experience. The Company has established reserves for environmental and legal contingencies at both the operating company and corporate levels. A significant amount of judgment and use of estimates is required to quantify the Company ultimate exposure in these matters. The valuation of reserves for contingencies is reviewed on a quarterly basis at the operating and corporate levels to ensure that the Company is properly reserved. Reserve balances are adjusted to account for changes in circumstances for ongoing issues and the establishment of additional reserves for emerging issues. While the Company believes that the current level of reserves is adequate, future changes in circumstances could impact these determinations. The Company from time to time will discontinue certain operations for various reasons. Estimates are used to adjust, if necessary, the assets and liabilities of discontinued operations to their estimated fair market value. These estimates include assumptions relating to the proceeds anticipated as a result of the sale. The adjustments to fair market value of these operations provide the basis for the gain or loss when sold. Changes in business conditions or the inability to sell an operation could potentially require future adjustments to these estimates. The Company is required to recognize in its consolidated statements of operations the expense associated with all share based payment awards made to employees and directors, including stock options, stock appreciation rights (SARs), restricted stock and performance share awards. The Company uses the Black-Scholes valuation model to estimate the fair value of its SARs, and stock options that are granted to employees. The model requires management to estimate the expected life of the SAR or option, expected forfeitures and the volatility of the Company stock using historical data. The Company uses the Monte Carlo simulation model to estimate fair value of performance share awards which also requires management to estimate the volatility of its stock and the volatility of returns on the stock of its peer group as well as the correlation of the returns between the companies in the peer group. For additional information related to the assumptions used, see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Adoption of New Accounting Standards 2009 In December 2007, the FASB issued authoritative guidance under ASC 805, Business Combinations ( ASC 805 ), which retains the fundamental requirements that the acquisition method of accounting (the purchase method) be used for all business combinations and for an acquirer to be identified for each business combination. In general, the statement 1) extends its applicability to all events where one entity obtains control over one or more other businesses, 2) broadens the use of fair value measurements used to recognize the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, 3) changes the accounting for acquisition related fees and restructuring costs incurred in connection with an acquisition, and 4) increases required disclosures. The Company has applied the provisions of this guidance prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after January 1, 2009. The impact of these provisions did not have a material effect on the Company consolidated financial statements since its adoption. In April 2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance under ASC 805 for the initial recognition and measurement, subsequent measurement and accounting, and disclosures for assets and liabilities arising from contingencies in business combinations. ASC 805 eliminates the distinction between contractual and non-contractual contingencies. The Company has applied the provisions of this guidance prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after January 1, 2009. The impact of these provisions did not have a material effect on the Company consolidated financial statements since its adoption. 37 Table of Contents In April 2008, the FASB issued authoritative guidance under ASC 350, Goodwill and Other Intangibles ( ASC 350 ) and ASC 275, Risks and Uncertainties ( ASC 275 ), to improve the consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the intangible asset. ASC 350 and ASC 275 amend the factors to be considered when developing renewal or extension assumptions that are used to estimate an intangible asset useful life. The guidance is to be applied prospectively to intangible assets acquired after December 31, 2008. In addition, ASC 350 and ASC 275 increase the disclosure requirements related to renewal or extension assumptions. The Company has applied the provisions of this guidance to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after January 1, 2009. The impact of ASC 350 and ASC 275 did not have a material effect on the Company consolidated financial statements since its adoption. In December 2008, the FASB issued authoritative guidance under ASC 715, Compensation Retirement Benefits ( ASC 715 ) which amends the disclosure requirements about plan assets of a defined pension or other postretirement plan. The provisions of this guidance require disclosure of 1) how investment allocation decisions are made, including factors that are pertinent to an understanding of the investment policies and strategies, 2) the fair value of each major category of plan assets, 3) the inputs and valuation techniques used to determine fair value and 4) an understanding of significant concentration of risk in plan assets. The provisions of this guidance become effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2009 and are to be applied prospectively. The adoption of the amendments under ASC 715 did not have a material impact on the Company consolidated financial statements. In May 2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance under ASC 855, Subsequent Events ( ASC 855 ) which establishes general standards of accounting for and disclosures of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued. ASC 855 became effective for interim or annual financial periods ending after June 15, 2009 and was adopted in the second quarter of 2009. The adoption of ASC 855 did not have a material effect on the Company consolidated financial statements. In June 2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance under ASC 105, Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( ASC 105 ), which establishes the FASB Accounting Standards Codification ( Codification ) as the source of authoritative accounting principles recognized by the FASB to be applied by nongovernmental entities in the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. ASC 105 became effective for financial statements issued for interim periods ended after September 15, 2009. All content within the Codification carries the same level of authority. The adoption of ASC 105 did not have a material effect on the Company consolidated financial statements. In April 2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance under ASC 825, Financial Instruments ( ASC 825 ) to require disclosures about fair value of financial instruments not measured on the balance sheet at fair value in interim financial statements as well as in annual financial statements. The provisions of this guidance require all entities to disclose the methods and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value of financial instruments. ASC 825 became effective for interim periods ended after June 15, 2009 and does not require comparative disclosure for earlier periods presented upon initial adoption. The adoption of ASC 825 did not have a material effect on the Company consolidated financial statements. 2008 Effective December 31, 2006, the Company applied certain provisions of ASC 715 which required companies to report the funded status of their defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans on their balance sheets as a net liability or asset. Upon adoption at December 31, 2006, the Company recorded a net reduction to shareholders equity of $123.5 million, net of tax. In addition, effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2008, the new standard required companies to measure benefit obligations and plan assets as of a Company fiscal year end (December 31, 2008 for the Company), using one of the methods prescribed in the standard. The Company adopted the new valuation date requirements using the 15-month alternative, as prescribed in the standard, which resulted in a charge of approximately $5.8 million, net of tax, to retained earnings during the fourth quarter of 2008. In September 2006, the FASB issued authoritative guidance under ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ( ASC 820 ) which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in GAAP, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. For financial assets and liabilities, this guidance was effective for fiscal periods beginning after November 15, 2007 and did not require any new fair value measurements. The 38 Table of Contents adoption of this guidance on January 1, 2008 did not have a material effect on the Company consolidated financial statements. In February 2008, the FASB delayed the effective date for nonfinancial assets and liabilities to fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008, except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). The adoption of the provisions of ASC 820 related to non-financial assets did not have a material effect on the Company consolidated financial statements. In February 2007, the FASB issued authoritative guidance under ASC 825 which permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. This statement became effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, including interim periods within that fiscal year. The Company did not elect the fair value option for any of its existing financial instruments as of December 31, 2008 and the Company has not determined whether or not it will elect this option for financial instruments it may acquire in the future. 2007 Effective January 1, 2007, the Company adopted certain provisions under ASC 740, Income Taxes ( ASC 740 ) which specifies the way companies are to account for uncertainty in income tax reporting, and prescribes a methodology for recognizing, reversing and measuring the tax benefits of a tax position taken, or expected to be taken, in a tax return. As a result of adopting the new standard, the Company recorded a $58.2 million increase to reserves as a cumulative effect decrease to opening retained earnings as of January 1, 2007, of which $53.4 million was included in continuing operations. Including this cumulative effect adjustment, the Company had unrecognized tax benefits, net of indirect benefits and deposits, of $190.5 million at January 1, 2007, of which $35.4 million related to accrued interest and penalties. The portion of the unrecognized tax benefits at January 1, 2007 included in continuing operations totaled $147.6 million, of which $28.0 million related to accrued interest and penalties. Non-GAAP Disclosures In an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding the Company results as determined by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the Company also discloses non-GAAP information which management believes provides useful information to investors. Free cash flow, net debt, total debt, total capitalization, adjusted working capital, average annual adjusted working capital, revenues excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and organic revenue growth are not financial measures under GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for cash flows from operating activities, debt or equity, revenue and working capital as determined in accordance with GAAP, and they may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Management believes the (1) net debt to total capitalization ratio and (2) free cash flow are important measures of operating performance and liquidity. Net debt to total capitalization is helpful in evaluating the Company capital structure and the amount of leverage it employs. Free cash flow provides both management and investors a measurement of cash generated from operations that is available to fund acquisitions, pay dividends, repay debt and repurchase the Company common stock. Reconciliations of free cash flow, total debt and net debt can be found above in this Item 7, Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation. Management believes that reporting adjusted working capital (also sometimes called working capital ), which is calculated as accounts receivable, plus inventory, less accounts payable, provides a meaningful measure of the Company operational results by showing the changes caused solely by revenue. Management believes that reporting adjusted working capital and revenues at constant currency, which excludes the positive or negative impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, provides a meaningful measure of the Company operational changes, given the global nature of Dover businesses. Management believes that reporting organic revenue growth, which excludes the impact of foreign currency exchange rates and the impact of acquisitions, provides a useful comparison of the Company revenue performance and trends between periods. 39 Table of Contents
